Ser-133 phosphorylation, in turn, activates target gene expression by promoting recruitment of the co-activator CBP. Recent studies showing that CREB and its paralog CREM are required for survival of certain cell types prompted us to examine whether CREB is a nuclear target for activation via the growth factor-dependent Ser/Thr kinase Akt/PKB. When overexpressed in serum-stimulated cells, Akt/PKB potently induced Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB and promoted recruitment of CBP. Correspondingly, Akt/PKB stimulated target gene expression via CREB in a phospho(Ser-133)-dependent manner. Akt/PKB induced CREB activity only in response to serum stimulation, and this effect was suppressed by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Our results support the notion that Akt/PKB promotes cell survival, at least in part, by stimulating the expression of cellular genes via the CREB/CBP nuclear transduction pathway.

CREM-deficient mice, for example, exhibit a spermatogenesis defect secondary to enhanced apoptosis of germ cells (17Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A.

Overexpression of a dominant negative CREB transgene, moreover, induces apoptosis in T cells, following growth factor stimulation (19Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The involvement of CREB family members in cell survival and the resemblance of Akt/PKB to protein kinase A, not only in primary sequence but also in its apparent substrate specificity, prompted us to examine whether CREB is a regulatory target for Akt/PKB. Here we demonstrate that Akt/PKB promotes phosphorylation of CREB, stimulates recruitment of CBP to the promoter, and activates cellular gene expression via a CRE-dependent mechanism. Our results suggest that CREB may contribute importantly to cell survival in response to growth factor stimulation. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection assay, cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with Lipofectin reagent supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. For assays with GAL4 CREB expression vector, each transfection contained 0.5 μg of G5B CAT, 0.5 μg of HA-tagged Akt/PKB expression plasmid, 0.25 μg of GAL4-CREB expression plasmid, plus 0.5 μg of RSV β-galactosidase expression vector as internal control. Total amount of plasmid was adjusted to 1.75 μg with empty CMV expression vector. Cells were harvested 36–40 h post-infection. For PI3-K inhibitor studies in Fig. 3 C, transfected cells were treated with 10% serum plus Me2SO vehicle or 10% serum plus 20 μm LY 294002 for 24 h. CAT activity was quantitated with a PhosphorImager after normalizing to β-galactosidase activity. For mammalian two-hybrid studies 293T cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of GAL4KID, 0.25 μg of KIX VP16, 0.5 μg of Akt/PKB expression vector, and 0.5 μg of RSV β-galactosidase as normalization control. In assays where KIX VP16 was omitted, VP16 expression vector was added in place. 293T cells (1 × 106) were transfectd with 8 μg of HA-tagged wild-type or kinase-inactive Akt/PKB expression plasmid using Lipofectin reagent. Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 420 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm okadaic acid. After removing cell debris by centrifugation at 13,500 for 10 min, lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with agarose-protein A/G resin and then incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antiserum (16B12, Babco) for 4 h. Anti-HA Akt/PKB complexes were then collected by incubation with agarose-protein A/G resin, and these immunoprecipitates were used in in vitro kinase assays containing [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of recombinant CREB protein. Reactions were terminated by addition of 2× SDS loading buffer. To determine whether CREB is a regulatory target for Akt/PKB, we performed in vitro kinase assays with HA-tagged wild-type and mutant forms of Akt/PKB following transfection in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitates of HA-tagged Akt/PKB phosphorylated recombinant CREB protein in vitro (Fig. 1). Lower levels of Ser-133 kinase activity were recovered from Akt/PKB immunoprecipitates prepared from serum-deprived cells compared with serum-stimulated cells, indicating that Akt/PKB must be activated to phosphorylate CREB (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with previous reports showing that serum stimulation activates Akt/PKB kinase activity (9Andjelkovic M. Alessi D. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J. Hemmings B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). By contrast, no CREB kinase activity was recovered from immunoprecipitates of 293T cells expressing kinase-inactive K179M mutant HA-Akt/PKB (20Franke T. Yang S. Chan T. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D. Kaplan D. Tsichlis P. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar), indicating that the effect of Akt/PKB on CREB phosphorylation is likely to be direct (Fig. 1). To test whether Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation of CREB is sufficient to stimulate recruitment of CBP, we performed mammalian two-hybrid studies in 293T cells using relevant interaction domains in CREB and CBP, referred to as KID and KIX, respectively. Overexpression of wild-type Akt/PKB stimulated recruitment of a KIX-VP16 fusion protein to GAL4-KID about 10-fold, as evaluated on a G5B CAT reporter containing five GAL4 recognition sites (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, kinase-inactive mutant Akt/PKB had no stimulatory effect on G5B CAT reporter activity, demonstrating the importance of Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation for induction of the CREB·CBP complex. Based on its ability to promote recruitment of CBP to CREB, we examined whether Akt/PKB correspondingly induces target gene expression via this pathway. When overexpressed in 293T cells, wild-type Akt/PKB but not kinase-inactive Akt/PKB stimulated a CRE-CAT reporter about 15-fold (Fig. 2 B). To rule out regulatory contributions from other CRE binding proteins and to evaluate the importance of Ser-133 phosphorylation for induction via Akt/PKB, we performed transfection assays with GAL4 CREB polypeptides in which the CREB trans-activation domain (amino acids 1–283) is fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147). Following transfection into 293T cells, wild-type Akt/PKB stimulated GAL4-CREB activity 20-fold relative to kinase-inactive Akt/PKB in 293T cells (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, wild-type Akt/PKB had no effect on the activity of a Ser-133 → Ala GAL4 CREB (GAL4-M1)mutant polypeptide, indicating that this kinase stimulates CREB activity via phosphorylation at Ser-133. Indeed, Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from transfected 293T cells revealed that the wild-type GAL4-CREB polypeptide was phosphorylated in cells expressing wild-type Akt/PKB but not kinase-inactive Akt/PKB (Fig. 3 B). In keeping with its effects on CREB phosphorylation in vitro, serum treatment promoted Akt/PKB induction of Gal4 CREB activity in 293T cells about 3–4-fold compared with serum-deprived cells (Fig. 3 C). Following serum stimulation, Akt/PKB appears to be activated by PI3-K (9Andjelkovic M. Alessi D. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J. Hemmings B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 20Franke T. Yang S. Chan T. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D. Kaplan D. Tsichlis P. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). To test whether CREB activation proceeds via a similar mechanism, we treated 293T cells with the PI3-K inhibitor LY 294002. Compared with serum-stimulated cells, 293T cells blocked with LY 294002 compound showed far lower GAL4 CREB activation in response to Akt/PKB, demonstrating that the PI3-K pathway is indeed required for this effect (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, our results indicate that Akt/PKB stimulates cellular gene expression in part via the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that an Akt/PKB-associated kinase and not Akt/PKB per se phosphorylates CREB directly. The ability of Akt/PKB to promote target gene activation is unusual because other second messengers such as phosphoinositol, although inducing Ser-133 phosphorylation to high stoichiometry, do not promote target gene activation (21Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid studies indicate that the block in target gene activation occurs at the level of CREB·CBP complex formation (21Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying signal discrimination via CREB/CBP is unclear, but current data favor a secondary phosphorylation event on CREB that would inhibit complex formation with CBP. In this regard, Maurer and colleagues have observed that secondary phosphorylation of phospho(Ser-133) CREB at Ser-142 strongly inhibits target gene activation (14Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P. Maurer R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether and to what degree Ser-142 is phosphorylatedin vivo following stimulation via pathways that do or do not promote target gene activation. Recent studies indicate that CREB functions importantly in promoting cell survival. Targeted disruption of the CREB gene, for example, leads to a defect in spermatogenesis secondary to germ cell apoptosis (17Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar,18Blendy J. Kaestner K. Weinbauer G. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant negative CREB transgene, moreover, induces T cell apoptosis in response to growth factor stimulation (19Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Characterizing target genes that are activated via CREB will further clarify the mechanism by which Akt/PKB promotes cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2057132428,Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants inactivates some aberrant or highly expressed RNAs in a sequence-specific manner in the cytoplasm. A silencing mechanism similar to PTGS appears to function as an adaptive antiviral response. We demonstrate that the P1/HC-Pro polyprotein encoded by tobacco etch virus functions as a suppressor of PTGS. A locus comprised of a highly expressed β-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene was shown to exhibit PTGS. Genetic crosses and segregation analyses revealed that a P1/HC-Pro transgene suppressed PTGS of the GUS sequence. Nuclear transcription assays indicated that the silencing suppression activity of P1/HC-Pro was at the posttranscriptional level. These data reveal that plant viruses can condition enhanced susceptibility within a host through interdiction of a potent defense response.
https://openalex.org/W1538028541,"p27Kip is a candidate human tumour-suppressor protein, because it is able to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases and block cell proliferation. Abnormally low levels of the p27 protein are frequently found in human carcinomas, and these low levels correlate directly with both histological aggressiveness and patient mortality. However, it has not been possible to establish a causal link between p27 and tumour suppression, because only rare instances of homozygous inactivating mutations of the p27 gene have been found in human tumours. Thus, p27Kip1 does not fulfil Knudson's 'two-mutation' criterion for a tumour-suppressor gene. Here we show that both p27 nullizygous and p27 heterozygous mice are predisposed to tumours in multiple tissues when challenged with gamma-irradiation or a chemical carcinogen. Therefore p27 is a multiple-tissue tumour suppressor in mice. Molecular analyses of tumours in p27 heterozygous mice show that the remaining wild-type allele is neither mutated nor silenced. Hence, p27 is haplo-insufficient for tumour suppression. The assumption that null mutations in tumour-suppressor genes are recessive excludes those genes that exhibit haplo-insufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2085871516,"The stress-responsive p38 and JNK MAPK pathways regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. A human MAPKKK, MTK1 (= MEKK4), mediates activation of both p38 and JNK in response to environmental stresses. Using a yeast two-hybrid method, three related proteins, GADD45α (= GADD45), GADD45β (= MyD118), and GADD45γ, were identified that bound to an N-terminal domain of MTK1. These proteins activated MTK1 kinase activity, both in vivo and in vitro. The GADD45-like genes are induced by environmental stresses, including MMS, UV, and γ irradiation. Expression of the GADD45-like genes induces p38/JNK activation and apoptosis, which can be partially suppressed by coexpression of a dominant inhibitory MTK1 mutant protein. We propose that the GADD45-like proteins mediate activation of the p38/JNK pathway, via MTK1/MEKK4, in response to environmental stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2022415270,"αv integrins have been implicated in many developmental processes and are therapeutic targets for inhibition of angiogenesis and osteoporosis. Surprisingly, ablation of the gene for the αv integrin subunit, eliminating all five αv integrins, although causing lethality, allows considerable development and organogenesis including, most notably, extensive vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Eighty percent of embryos die in midgestation, probably because of placental defects, but all embryos develop normally to E9.5, and 20% are born alive. These liveborn αv-null mice consistently exhibit intracerebral and intestinal hemorrhages and cleft palates. These results necessitate reevaluation of the primacy of αv integrins in many functions including vascular development, despite reports that blockade of these integrins with antibodies or peptides prevents angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2001252698,"We reported that the lipoapoptosis of beta-cells observed in fat-laden islets of obese fa/fa Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats results from overproduction of ceramide, an initiator of the apoptotic cascade and is induced by long-chain fatty acids (FA). Whereas the ceramide of cytokine-induced apoptosis may be derived from sphingomyelin hydrolysis, FA-induced ceramide overproduction seems to be derived from FA. We therefore semiquantified mRNA of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which catalyzes the first step in ceramide synthesis. It was 2–3-fold higher in fa/fa islets than in +/+ controls. [3H]Ceramide formation from [3H]serine was 2.2–4.5-fold higher in fa/faislets. Triacsin-C, which blocks palmitoyl-CoA synthesis, andl-cycloserine, which blocks SPT activity, completely blocked [3H]ceramide formation from [3H]serine. Islets of fa/fa rats are unresponsive to the lipopenic action of leptin, which normally depletes fat and prevents FA up-regulation of SPT. To determine the role of leptin unresponsiveness in the SPT overexpression, we transferred wild type OB-Rb cDNA to their islets; now leptin completely blocked the exaggerated FA-induced increase of SPT mRNA while reducing the fat content. Beta-cell lipoapoptosis was partially prevented in vivo by treating prediabetic ZDF rats withl-cycloserine for 2 weeks. Ceramide content and DNA fragmentation both declined 40–50%. We conclude that lipoapoptosis of ZDF rats is mediated by enhanced ceramide synthesis from FA and that blockade by SPT inhibitors prevents lipoapoptosis.

Zucker Diabetic Fatty fatty acid serine palmitoyltransferase phosphate-buffered saline triglyceride. Obesity has become the single most prevalent health problem in the United States and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus its most common complication (1National Center for Health Statistics Newsweek. 1994; 127: 62Google Scholar). Yet the mechanism by which obesity can damage remotely situated tissues such as the pancreatic beta-cells has not been established. Recently however, considerable evidence has implicated fatty acid excess as the major factor in obesity-associated beta-cell dysfunction and damage in a rodent model of adipogenic non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF)1rat (2Lee Y.

Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the evidence pointed to de novo ceramide synthesis as a major factor in the lipoapoptosis (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Obese ZDF rats are homozygous for the fa mutation (fa/fa), a Gln-269 → Pro substitution in the leptin receptor (OB-R) (5Iida M. Murakami T. Ishida K. Mizuno A. Kuwajima M. Shima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Phillips M.S. Liu Q. Hammond H. Dugan V. Hey P. Caskey C.T. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The lipid content of their islets is markedly elevated because of complete unresponsiveness of their fat-laden islets to the lipopenic action of leptin (7Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We theorized that the overproduction of ceramide was somehow linked to the overproduction of fat.Because each molecule of ceramide contains two molecules of long-chain fatty acids (FA), it seemed likely that fatty acids stimulated ceramide-mediated apoptosis by providing excess substrate for de novo ceramide synthesis rather than by causing sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide. To test this possibility, we studied [3H]ceramide formation from [3H]palmitate and observed a marked increase in islets from fa/fa ZDF rats (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). This overproduction of ceramide was blocked with fumonisin-B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthetase (8Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also blocked the apoptosis (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Thus de novo synthesis of ceramide appeared to be important in fatty acid-induced apoptosis.However, the mechanism of de novo ceramide overproduction was not fully explained by the foregoing studies. Because the high triglyceride (TG) content of these islets provided an expanded source of palmitoyl-CoA for de novo ceramide formation (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), we considered an increase within the metabolic pathway of ceramide synthesis. The first step in the pathway involves serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to form dehydrosphinganine, a precursor of sphingosine (9Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,12Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). The following study was designed to determine whether there is an increase in SPT activity and, if so, whether fatty acid-induced ceramide-mediated apoptosis of beta-cells in islets of ZDF rats could be blocked by inhibiting SPT activity and if this prevents the partial destruction of beta-cells that accompanies this form of obesity.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study provide several lines of new evidence that the high ceramide content observed in pancreatic islets of obesefa/fa ZDF rats, and implicated in beta-cell lipoapoptosis and adipogenic diabetes (4Shimabukuro M.

First, expression of the enzyme SPT, the enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form the ceramide precursor, dehydrosphinganine (8Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W.

Second, [3H]ceramide formation from [3H]serine, evidence of SPT enzyme activity, was increased in those islets, confirming our previous report of increased [3H]ceramide from [3H]palmitate (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Third, the increased ceramide synthesis was inhibited by Triacsin-C blockade of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, indicating that the excess ceramide formation is dependent on activation of long-chain fatty acids. Triacsin-C also blocked fatty acid-induced apoptosis (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, the competitive inhibitor of SPT, l-cycloserine, blocked the increase in [3H]ceramide, clear evidence that it was newly formed.De novo ceramide synthesis had not previously been identified as a source of ceramide in apoptosis; in cytokine-mediated autoimmune destruction of islets, for example, the ceramide is believed to be derived from sphingomyelin of membranes (22Sjoholm A.

This strongly indicates that the serine → ceramide segment of sphingomyelin synthetic pathway is increased in fa/fa islets without any discernible post-ceramide differences (Fig. 7).The overexpression of SPT in the fa/fa islets appears to be secondary to the fa mutation, a Gln-269 → Pro substitution in the OB-R (5Iida M.

One consequence of this mutation is total loss of the lipopenic action of leptin on islets (7Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation are underexpressed (25Zhou Y-T. Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Lee Y. Wang M-Y. Trieu F. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6386-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), resulting in striking increase in islet lipid content exceeding more than 50 times that of normal (2Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Based on the foregoing, it seemed reasonable to consider as a mechanism for SPT overexpression either a loss of direct leptin-induced inhibition or a lipid-mediated up-regulatory effect. Because loss of leptin activity is so tightly coupled to lipid accumulation (7Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), we could not exclude the former possibility and focused instead on the role of lipids. Fatty acids up-regulated SPT mRNA in both normal+/+ and obese fa/fa ZDF rat islets, but the baseline level of SPT expression and the fatty acid-induced up-regulation was far greater in the fa/fa islets. This correlated well with the much higher base-line TG content and the fatty acid-induced increase in TG content in fa/fa islets.Evidence consistent with leptin-mediated regulation of islet lipid was also obtained by overexpressing the wild-type OB-Rb or, as a control, β-galactosidase in the fa/fa islets. This conferred leptin responsiveness to the former islets, whereas leptin had no effect in the β-gal controls. In the OB-Rb-overexpressing islets, 20 ng/ml leptin reduced islet TG content to normal and completely blocked fatty acid-induced up-regulation of SPT mRNA.Finally, we tested the possibility that SPT blockade might protect the fat-laden islets of prediabetic ZDF rats from ceramide-mediated lipoapoptosis of beta-cells (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), which may be a factor in their diabetes. Prediabetic ZDF rats were treated withl-cycloserine for 2 weeks, and ceramide content and DNA fragmentation were measured. The results suggest that agent was partially effective, reducing [3H]ceramide formation from [3H]serine and DNA fragmentation by ∼50%. Obesity has become the single most prevalent health problem in the United States and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus its most common complication (1National Center for Health Statistics Newsweek. 1994; 127: 62Google Scholar). Yet the mechanism by which obesity can damage remotely situated tissues such as the pancreatic beta-cells has not been established. Recently however, considerable evidence has implicated fatty acid excess as the major factor in obesity-associated beta-cell dysfunction and damage in a rodent model of adipogenic non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF)1rat (2Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 3Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V.

A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Recent studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that long-chain fatty acids induce apoptosis of the beta-cells of obese ZDF rats (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the evidence pointed to de novo ceramide synthesis as a major factor in the lipoapoptosis (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Obese ZDF rats are homozygous for the fa mutation (fa/fa), a Gln-269 → Pro substitution in the leptin receptor (OB-R) (5Iida M. Murakami T. Ishida K. Mizuno A. Kuwajima M. Shima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Phillips M.S. Liu Q. Hammond H. Dugan V. Hey P. Caskey C.T. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The lipid content of their islets is markedly elevated because of complete unresponsiveness of their fat-laden islets to the lipopenic action of leptin (7Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We theorized that the overproduction of ceramide was somehow linked to the overproduction of fat. Because each molecule of ceramide contains two molecules of long-chain fatty acids (FA), it seemed likely that fatty acids stimulated ceramide-mediated apoptosis by providing excess substrate for de novo ceramide synthesis rather than by causing sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide. To test this possibility, we studied [3H]ceramide formation from [3H]palmitate and observed a marked increase in islets from fa/fa ZDF rats (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). This overproduction of ceramide was blocked with fumonisin-B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthetase (8Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also blocked the apoptosis (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Thus de novo synthesis of ceramide appeared to be important in fatty acid-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism of de novo ceramide overproduction was not fully explained by the foregoing studies. Because the high triglyceride (TG) content of these islets provided an expanded source of palmitoyl-CoA for de novo ceramide formation (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), we considered an increase within the metabolic pathway of ceramide synthesis. The first step in the pathway involves serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to form dehydrosphinganine, a precursor of sphingosine (9Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); sphingosine is then acylated to form ceramide (11Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,12Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar).

Because loss of leptin activity is so tightly coupled to lipid accumulation (7Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), we could not exclude the former possibility and focused instead on the role of lipids. Fatty acids up-regulated SPT mRNA in both normal+/+ and obese fa/fa ZDF rat islets, but the baseline level of SPT expression and the fatty acid-induced up-regulation was far greater in the fa/fa islets. This correlated well with the much higher base-line TG content and the fatty acid-induced increase in TG content in fa/fa islets. Evidence consistent with leptin-mediated regulation of islet lipid was also obtained by overexpressing the wild-type OB-Rb or, as a control, β-galactosidase in the fa/fa islets. This conferred leptin responsiveness to the former islets, whereas leptin had no effect in the β-gal controls. In the OB-Rb-overexpressing islets, 20 ng/ml leptin reduced islet TG content to normal and completely blocked fatty acid-induced up-regulation of SPT mRNA. Finally, we tested the possibility that SPT blockade might protect the fat-laden islets of prediabetic ZDF rats from ceramide-mediated lipoapoptosis of beta-cells (4Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), which may be a factor in their diabetes. Prediabetic ZDF rats were treated withl-cycloserine for 2 weeks, and ceramide content and DNA fragmentation were measured. The results suggest that agent was partially effective, reducing [3H]ceramide formation from [3H]serine and DNA fragmentation by ∼50%.

https://openalex.org/W2075271539,"MutL and its homologs are essential for DNA mismatch repair. Mutations in genes encoding human homologs of MutL cause multiorgan cancer susceptibility. We have determined the crystal structure of a 40 kDa N-terminal fragment of E. coli MutL that retains all of the conserved residues in the MutL family. The structure of MutL is homologous to that of an ATPase-containing fragment of DNA gyrase. We have demonstrated that MutL binds and hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and Pi. Mutations in the MutL family that cause deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair and a predisposition to cancer mainly occur in the putative ATP-binding site. We provide evidence that the flexible, yet conserved, loops surrounding this ATP-binding site undergo conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis thereby modulating interactions between MutL and other components of the repair machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1976678735,"We have identified a new human cDNA (y+L amino acid transporter-1 (y+LAT-1)) that induces system y+L transport activity with 4F2hc (the surface antigen 4F2 heavy chain) in oocytes. Human y+LAT-1 is a new member of a family of polytopic transmembrane proteins that are homologous to the yeast high affinity methionine permease MUP1. Other members of this family, theXenopus laevis IU12 and the human KIAA0245 cDNAs, also co-express amino acid transport activity with 4F2hc in oocytes, with characteristics that are compatible with those of systems L and y+L, respectively. y+LAT-1 protein forms a ≈135-kDa, disulfide bond-dependent heterodimer with 4F2hc in oocytes, which upon reduction results in two protein bands of ≈85 kDa (i.e. 4F2hc) and ≈40 kDa (y+LAT-1). Mutation of the human 4F2hc residue cysteine 109 (Cys-109) to serine abolishes the formation of this heterodimer and drastically reduces the co-expressed transport activity. These data suggest that y+LAT-1 and other members of this family are different 4F2 light chain subunits, which associated with 4F2hc, constitute different amino acid transporters. Human y+LAT-1 mRNA is expressed in kidney ≫ peripheral blood leukocytes ≫ lung > placenta = spleen > small intestine. The humany+LAT-1 gene localizes at chromosome 14q11.2 (17cR ≈ 374 kb from D14S1350), within the lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) locus (Lauteala, T., Sistonen, P., Savontaus, M. L., Mykkanen, J., Simell, J., Lukkarinen, M., Simmell, O., and Aula, P. (1997) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 60, 1479–1486). LPI is an inherited autosomal disease characterized by a defective dibasic amino acid transport in kidney, intestine, and other tissues. The pattern of expression of human y+LAT-1, its co-expressed transport activity with 4F2hc, and its chromosomal location within the LPI locus, suggest y+LAT-1 as a candidate gene for LPI.

These two proteins are slightly hydrophobic, which prompted the hypothesis that rBAT and 4F2hc are subunits or modulators of the corresponding amino acid transporter. This has been supported by several indirect observations: (i) rBAT and 4F2hc are involved in the induction of several activities in Xenopus oocytes (3Anmed A. Yao P.C. Brant A.M. Peter G.J.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have recently provided new evidence that the amino acid transport system y+L has a heterodimeric structure (11Estévez R. Camps M. Testar X. Hediger M. Zorzano A. Palacı́n M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, we have shown that the y+L activity induced in oocytes by a cysteine-less mutant of human 4F2hc is also inactivated by membrane-impermeant thiol-specific reagents, implying that another protein is required for this function, which would have external cysteine(s) that are targets of these reagents. Moreover, the sensitivity to inactivation is increased by reducing conditions and in 4F2hc mutants in which cysteine 109 has been mutated. These results indicate that Cys-109 may be linked by a disulfide bond to the cysteine target of these agents of the associated protein. ASUR4 (Y12716), an adrenal steroid up-regulated cDNA fromXenopus laevis A6 cells (12Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

Verrey, personal communication. 1F. Verrey, personal communication. When comparing the amino acid sequence of ASUR4 to protein data bases, many highly homologous eukaryotic and prokaryotic amino acid transporter-related proteins are listed within the amino acids, polyamines, and choline (APC) family of transporters. Among these, and with highest degree of identity (between 38 and 82% when corresponding protein regions are compared) to ASUR4, are found its counterpart in human, E16 (Q01650) (13Gaugitsch H.W.

DNA Res. 1996; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); five different Caenorhabditis elegans open reading frames deduced from genomic DNA sequence (Z68216, U50308,Z74042, U56963, and U70850) (16Wilson R.

In the same list appeared a yeast high affinity methionine permease, MUP1 (17Isnard A.D. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (U40316), and many other prokaryotic amino acid permeases. ASUR4 showed low, although significant, identity (between 26 and 31%) with the mammalian transporters for cationic amino acids CAT12 and CAT2 (18Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 659-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 19MacLeod C.L. Finley K. Kakuda D. Kozak C.A. Wilkinson M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Human E16 was first identified from peripheral blood leukocytes and related to lymphocyte activation (13Gaugitsch H.W. Prieschl E.E. Kalthoff F. Huber N.E. Baumruker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat TA1 was cloned later on the basis of its differential expression between hepatoma cells and normal liver (14Sang J. Lim Y.P. Panzica M. Finch P. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1152-1159PubMed Google Scholar). E16, TA1, and ASUR4 cDNA were first described as proteins 241 amino acids long. The presence in the data base of a thyroid hormone regulated X. laevis cDNA, termed IU12 (AF019906) (20Liang V. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1997; 7: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which was 507 amino acid long and practically identical to ASUR4 (only one amino acid was different in the corresponding protein region), suggested that the former three cDNAs were indeed longer. Very recently, F. Verrey has submitted a new ASUR4 cDNA GenBank entry (accession number Y12716), which also has 507 amino acids. Although IU12 and the new entry of ASUR4 still differ in four disperse amino acids, we can consider that both sequences correspond to the same gene in Xenopus. We can now assume that E16 and TA1 are actually longer proteins. In this study, we have identified a new human member of this group of amino acid permease-related proteins. This protein, which we have named y+L amino acid transporter-1 (y+LAT-1) does not induce transport of amino acids in oocytes when injected alone, but y+L activity is co-expressed when it is injected with 4F2hc. We demonstrate here that it forms an heterodimer with 4F2hc linked by disulfide bridges with residue cysteine 109 of human 4F2hc. Its pattern of expression and its chromosomal localization indicate that this gene could be responsible for lysinuric protein intolerance (21Simell O. Scriver C.H. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3581-3601Google Scholar), an inherited disorder of cationic amino acid transport. Oocyte origin, management, and injections were as described elsewhere (1Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacı́n M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Defolliculated stage VI X. laevis oocytes were injected with different amounts of human 4F2hc, human y+LAT-1, human y+LAT-2 (KIAA0245), or X. laevis IU12 cRNA. Amino acid transport rates obtained with oocytes injected with water (50 nl) were similar to those of uninjected oocytes (data not shown). Synthesis of human 4F2hc cRNA (22Teixeira S. Di Grandi S. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9574-9580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was as described (11Estévez R. Camps M. Testar X. Hediger M. Zorzano A. Palacı́n M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). IU12 was a gift from Shi and co-workers (20Liang V. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1997; 7: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the cRNA was obtained by cutting the cDNA, cloned in pBluescript SK− between the sitesXhoI and EcoRI with ApaI and using T3 polymerase. The open reading frame of y+LAT-1 was obtained from the Integrated and Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression (IMAGE) cDNA clone 727811 cloned in the vector pT7T3 between the restriction sites EcoRI and NotI. To obtain the y+LAT-2 cRNA, because it has a long 3′-untranslated region and is not expressed properly in Xenopus oocytes, we inserted the open reading frame of KIAA0245 (obtained from Takahiro Nagase from the Kasuza DNA Research Institute, (15Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and cloned in pBluescript II SK+) in another vector with a shorter 3′ tail. Subcloning was done by cutting pBluescript-KIAA0245 with ApaI and filling with Klenow; the clone was then ethanol-precipitated, cut again with PstI, and finally ligated into pSPORT1-human rBAT that had been cut withPstI and Bst1107I. Influx rates ofl-[3H]arginine,l-[3H]leucine were measured in 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm choline Cl medium at the indicated days after injection and under linear conditions. When presented, the induced uptake was calculated by subtracting uptake values in uninjected oocytes from those of the corresponding cRNA-injected oocytes. For PCR amplification, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA purified from opossum kidney (23Aloy P. Cedano J. Oliva B. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar) cells using the SuperScript II kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two degenerate forward and reverse primers were designed based on two highly conserved regions among KIAA0245, IU12, E16, TA1, and SPRM1 proteins. From region 1 sequence (A/S)REGHLP (corresponding to residues 347–353 of KIAA0245), a forward 5′-C(C/T)(C/A)G(C/A/G)GA(G/A)GG(C/G)CA(C/T)CT(G/C/T/A)CC-3′ primer (1F) was synthesized, as well as a reverse (2R) 5′-A(T/G)G(A/C)(T/A)(A/G)-AA(C/G)A(C/A)(C/G)A(C/T)(T/A/G)GG-3′ primer deduced from region 2 sequence P(I/V)(V/F)F(I/C)(I/L) (corresponding to residues 429–434 of KIAA0245). Amplification was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler, and conditions were as follows: hot start of 3 min at 94 °C; 15 cycles of denaturing (94 °C for 25 s), annealing (starting 65–50 °C lowering 1 °C each cycle for 30 s), and extension (74 °C for 70 s); 25 cycles of denaturing (94 °C for 25 s), annealing (50 °C for 30 s), and extension (74 °C for 70 s); and a final extension of 4 min at 72 °C. PCR-amplified DNA fragments with the expected length were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced in one direction. The DNA sequence obtained and all frames of the deduced amino acid sequences were then compared with DNA and protein sequence data bases. All sequences carried out in this work were performed in one or both directions (in the case of clone 727811) with D-Rhodamine Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (Perkin-Elmer). Analysis of the sequence reactions was done with an Abi Prism 377 DNA sequencer. Amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology searching was performed using basic local alignment tool (BLAST) via on-line connection to the National Center of Biotechnology Information. The programs BLASTn, BLASTp, and BLASTx were run using default parameters. Data base searching was done against nonredundant or dbEST, when searching for nucleotide sequence homology, and versus nonredundant when comparing to peptide sequences. The clusters of Expressed Sequence Tag were identified and analyzed with the IMAGE data base and Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine EST assembly machine tool. Multiple nucleotide or amino acid sequence comparisons were done with CRUSTALW via on-line connection to the Genome World Wide Web server (University of Tokyo) and to the Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher (University of Texas). Amino acid sequence deduction and other sequence analysis were done with Genetics Computer Group utilities. The prediction of transmembrane segments of the proteins y+LAT-1, y+LAT-2, IU12, and SPRM1 was established on the basis of the combination of three criteria: (i) the prediction of transmembrane segments by the programs of Aloy et al. (23Aloy P. Cedano J. Oliva B. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar) and TopPred II (24Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) using the algorithms of G. von Heijne (25von Heijne G. J. Mol.

Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17102) Google Scholar) to determine the position of hydrophobicity peaks; (ii) the prediction of α-helix in the predicted secondary structure using a program that combines the algorithms of Chou-Fasman and Rose (28Clotet J. Cedano J. Querol E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 495-500PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) the surface probability and flexibility index plots, according to the algorithms of Boger (29Emini E.A. Hughes J.V. Perlow D.S. Boger J. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 836-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Karplus and Schulz (30Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. Naturwissenschaften. 1985; 72: 212-213Crossref Scopus (935) Google Scholar), respectively. A human adult poly(A+) membrane containing 12 different tissues, purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) was used. Insert of clone 727811 was separated from the pT7T3D-727811 vector withApaI-NotI digestion. This 2250-bp-long DNA fragment was purified, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) using a random oligonucleotide-priming labeling kit (Amersham), and used as a probe. Hybridization, carried out in Express HybTM Hybridization solution (CLONTECH), and wash conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer. To rule out differences in sample loading, the CLONTECHmembrane was hybridized with human β-actin probe. A nonradioactive fluorescein and anti-fluorescein peroxidase-conjugated antibody detection kit was used (Amersham). Hybridization, washes, and detection conditions were as suggested by the supplier. Chromosome mapping was done using the Stanford Human Genome Center G3 Radiation Hybrid panel (medium resolution). DNA samples of this panel, along with total genomic DNA and pT7T3-727811 (used as a positive controls), were PCR-screened for the presence of the genomic sequences flanked by the primers F7 (5′-GGAAGTTGAAAAGGAAAGC-3′) and R7 (5′-AAGGAGACAGGAAATTGG-3′), which are located at the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA. PCR amplifications were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler, using 200 μm dNTP, 3 pmol of each primer and DNA Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in PCR buffer. Amplification conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of denaturing (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (56 °C for 40 s), and extension (74 °C for 30 s). PCR results were classified as 0 (for no amplification), 1 (for positive amplification), or r (for uncertain) and submitted to the Radiation Hybrid Mapping E-mail server at the Stanford Human Genome Center (SHGC). Resulting chromosomal location, referred to a SHGC marker, was obtained automatically via E-mail from this server. Construction of the mutants C109S and C330S of human 4F2hc was as described in Ref. 11Estévez R. Camps M. Testar X. Hediger M. Zorzano A. Palacı́n M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of human 4F2hc or C109S human 4F2hc (CS1) or C330S human 4F2hc (CS2) alone or in combination with 10 ng of y+LAT-1 cRNA. After 24 h, [35S]methionine (0.5 μCi in 50 nl of water; ICN) was injected, and the oocytes (usually 20 oocytes) were incubated for 48 h at 18 °C in 1 ml of modified Barth's solution. Oocytes were then harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Extracts were centrifuged twice at 1000 × g in order to remove the yolk granules. Aliquots of 106 cpm were rotated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of human 4F2hc antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France) previously bound to protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). The beads were washed five times in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mmLiCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and five times in the same buffer without LiCl. The resulting immunoprecipitates were heated in sample buffer with or without 100 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min at 95 °C before gel loading. The labeled proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography after enhancement with 1 m sodium salicylate. Our goal was to identify any new member of the amino acid transporter-related family expressed in kidney and potentially involved in reabsorption of amino acids. For this purpose reverse transcription PCR amplification of total RNA from opossum kidney cells (32Mora C. Chillarón J. Calonge M.J. Forgo J. Testar X. Nunes V. Murer H. Zorzano A. Palacı́n M. J.

Degenerated primers were designed on the basis of two highly conserved protein regions (see under “Experimental Procedures”) revealed after a multiple amino acid sequence comparison among KIAA0245, E16, TA1, IU12, and SPRM1 proteins. Electrophoretic analysis of the PCR showed one band of 228 bp, which was subcloned into pGEMT-easy vector and amplified in Escherichia coli. Several clones were then analyzed by sequencing. Nucleotide sequence of clone b4c2 showed a significant degree of identity to the amino acid transporter-related proteins when compared, using BLASTx program, to nonredundant peptide data bases. Deduced amino acid sequence comparison showed an identity of 75, 52, 49, 47, and 20% for b4c2 with KIAA0245, IU12, TA1, E16, and SPRM1, respectively. This high degree of identity with KIAA0245 suggested that we had cloned a fragment of the KIAA0245 ortholog cDNA in opossum. To rule out the presence of other human genes having high homology to KIAA0245, the coding region sequence of this gene was run as a query with BLASTn program against dbEST data bases. Flanking 3′- and 5′-untranslated regions were avoided to minimize the presence of KIAA0245 EST in the results. We identified an IMAGE EST cluster (46303) that corresponds to a new unidentified human gene with a high degree of identity (75%) to KIAA0245. EST AA393488(located 5′ of this cluster) and EST AA400789 (located 3′ of this cluster and presenting a poly(A+) tail) are flanking regions of IMAGE cDNA clone 727811 and comprised the whole cDNA. We named this clone y+LAT-1 (y+L amino acid transporter), and KIAA0245 tentatively as a y+LAT-2 because they yielded system y+L amino acid transport activity when co-injected with 4F2hc in oocytes (see below). Two direction sequencing of clone 727811 (Fig. 1) showed a cDNA 2245 bp long. Sequence comparison of the corresponding region of y+LAT-1 with the opossum b4c2 clone revealed 82 and 81% identity for DNA and protein, respectively. We then assumed that b4c2 clone is a fragment of the corresponding y+LAT-1 in opossum. The size of the human y+LAT-1 cDNA corresponds to the transcript seen in Northern blots (see Fig. 5). The first ATG codon lies within a good consensus initiation sequence (5′-CCACC) (33Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frame continues to the first stop codon (TAA) at base 1820 and codes for a protein of 511 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 55,988 Da. The nucleotide sequence of y+LAT-1 has been deposited in the GenBank data base (accession number: AF092032).Figure 5Northern blot analysis for y+LAT-1 mRNA in human tissues. A poly(A) RNA (2 μg per lane) membrane containing 12 different human adult tissues was purchased from CLONTECH. Blots were probed with32P-labeled human IMAGE clone 727811 and washed at high stringency conditions (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Human y+LAT-1 cDNA hybridizes to a transcript of ≈2.4 kb and is expressed predominantly in kidney, leukocytes (from peripheral blood), lung, placenta, spleen, and total small intestine. Proper quality and control of loading was substantiated by hybridization with human β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH), used as a control probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hydrophobicity studies (see under “Experimental Procedures”) show 12 transmembrane domains with both C- and N-terminal segments intracytoplasmatic, a typical protein structure similar to some previously reported organic solute transporters (34Mueckler M.

There is only one putative N-glycosylation site underlined in Fig. 1 (Asn-Ala-Ser) between the putative transmembrane segments VIII and IX. In our prediction model, this segment is cytoplasmic and cannot be glycosylated. There are also two putative casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (threonine 8 and serine 11, located in the putative cytoplasmic N-terminal segment) and one putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site (threonine 96, located intracellularly between the putative transmembrane segments II and III). A multiple sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of y+LAT-1, y+LAT-2 (KIAA0245), IU12, E16, and SPRM1 is shown in Fig. 2. The percentages of identity between y+LAT-1 and y+LAT-2, E16, IU12, SPRM1, and the yeast permease MUP1 are 75, 51, 53, 39, and 31%, respectively. The predicted structural model of these proteins is also very similar. Only the consensus for the position of the transmembrane segment III can vary for the proteins presented in Fig. 2. For y+LAT-1 and y+LAT-2, this segment could be located in the position indicated in Fig. 2. However, in the case of IU12, the fragment is displaced 10 amino acids to the C-terminal end, and in the protein SPRM1, the fragment is moved 5 amino acids to the N-terminal end. Because 4F2hc is associated with y+LAT-1 in a disulfide bond-dependent manner (see Fig. 7), we looked for cysteine residues conserved in these proteins. There are only two cysteines conserved in all these proteins: cysteine 151 of y+LAT-1, located extracellularly in our structure model prediction, corresponding to residues 159, 164, and 137 of y+LAT-2, IU12, and SPRM1, respectively; and cysteine 174, located in the transmembrane domain IV and corresponding to residues 182, 187, and 160 of y+LAT-2, IU12, and SPRM1, respectively. These two cysteines are not conserved in the yeast permease MUP1.Figure 74F2hc protein forms a heterodimeric disulfide bond-dependent structure with y+LAT-1 through the Cys-109 residue.

It was shown recently that glycosphingolipids are elevated in MDR cells. Sphingolipids are major constituents of caveolae and of detergent-insoluble, glycosphingolipid-rich membrane domains. Here we report that multidrug-resistant HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells exhibit a 12-fold overexpression of caveolin-1, a 21-kDa coat/adaptor protein of caveolae. Similar observations were made in adriamycin-resistant MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Caveolin-2 expression is also up-regulated in MCF-7-AdrR cells, but neither caveolin-1 nor caveolin-2 were detected in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with P-gp. The up-regulation of caveolins is associated with a 5-fold increase in the number of caveolae-like structures observed in plasma membrane profiles of HT-29-MDR cells and with the appearance of a comparable number of caveolae in MCF-7-AdrR cells. A significant fraction (∼40%) of cellular P-gp is localized in low density detergent-insoluble membrane fractions derived from either HT-29-MDR or MCF-7-AdrR cells. The distribution of recombinant P-gp in stably transfected MCF-7 cells was similar, even though these cells do not express caveolins and are devoid of caveolae.

Although chemotherapy improves long term survival in cancer patients, the treatment often results in the development of tumors that are resistant to most cytotoxic drugs commonly used in chemotherapy, leading to an untreatable and incurable disease (1Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 747-754PubMed Google Scholar). Known as multidrug resistance (MDR),1 this phenomenon may be defined as the ability of cancer cells exposed to a given drug to resist the cytotoxic actions of a broad range of structurally and functionally unrelated drugs. MDR is often caused by overexpression of a plasma membrane ATPase called P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (2Bosch I. Croop J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F37-F54PubMed Google Scholar). P-gp acts as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump, increasing outward transport of active drugs and thereby decreasing their intracellular concentration and reducing their cytotoxic efficacy. However, additional mechanisms that contribute to MDR have been described (see Ref. 3Kaye S.B. Am. J. Med. 1995; 99: 40S-44SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar for review). Recent studies have indicated that glucosylceramide accumulates to a major extent in various types of MDR cells (4Lavie Y. Cao H.-T. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Glucosylceramide and other glycosphingolipids are important constituents of detergent-insoluble membrane domains termed DIGs (5Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) that are enriched also in sphingomyelin and cholesterol (6Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). DIGs are related in their lipid composition and their insolubility in cold non-ionic detergents to nonclathrin-coated, plasma membrane vesicular invaginations termed caveolae (reviewed in Ref. 7Parton R.G. Curr. Op. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1, a 21-kDa integral membrane protein, is a major caveolar coat protein (8Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar) that has the ability to engage in complex interactions with other caveolin molecules, as well as other proteins (9Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of caveolin-1 induces the appearance of caveolae-like vesicles in cells that normally lack caveolae, e.g. lymphocytes, Sf9 insect cells, and transformed fibroblasts (10Fra A.M.

Caveolae have been implicated in a number of plasma membrane transport processes such as endocytosis (13Tran D. Carpentier J.L. Sawano F. Gorden P. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7957-7961Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), transcytosis (14Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, caveolae are enriched in signaling molecules, and certain receptor, transducer, and effector proteins are recruited onto caveolae upon cell surface receptor activation (9Okamoto T.

Human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29-wt and HT-29-MDR cells (17Breuer W. Slotki I.N. Ausiello D.A. Cabantchik I.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1711-C1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Prof. I. Cabantchik (Hebrew University, Jerusalem). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. HT-29-MDR cells were maintained in the same medium supplemented with colchicine (300 ng/ml). HT-29-MDR cells were plated in drug-free medium prior to experiments. MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, adriamycin-resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-AdrR), and MCF-7 cells stably transfected with P-gp (BC-19) were kindly provided by Dr. Merrill E. Goldsmith (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). The MCF-7 and derived cell lines were grown according to published procedures (18Fairchild C.R. Ivy S.P. Kao-Shan C.S. Whang-Peng J. Rosen N.

Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar). Caveolin-rich membrane domains were purified from cultured cells as a low density, Triton-insoluble complex, essentially as described (20Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The protein content of each fraction was determined according to the modified Lowry procedure (21Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L. Tolbert L.L. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (5307) Google Scholar). Aliquots taken from each of the sucrose density gradient fractions were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (for resolution of P-gp and caveolin-1, respectively). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5% skim milk (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with monoclonal antibodies to caveolin-1 (clone 2297; Transduction Laboratories), caveolin-2 (clone 65; Transduction Laboratories), or anti-P-gp (C219; Signet), all utilized in a dilution of 1:1000 in the blocking buffer. The blots were then washed extensively and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation of the caveolin and P-gp was carried out by quantitative densitometry using an image densitometer (PDI Inc.), and the data were processed using Quantity One image analysis software. [3H]Serine labeling of cell lipids and analysis of glycosphingolipids by thin-layer chromatography were performed essentially as described before (4Lavie Y. Cao H.-T. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayer cell cultures were fixed in glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in OsO4, stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Sections were examined utilizing a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope, and cell profiles were routinely photographed at a magnification of 24,000×. Caveolae-like structures were identified by their characteristic round shape, size (50–100 nm), and location at or near the plasma membrane. The number of caveolae/10 μm of plasma membrane was determined by counting morphologically identifiable caveolae in individual cell surface membrane profiles of each cell line (n = 20). The specific sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched composition of caveolae facilitates their purification on sucrose density gradients together with other detergent-insoluble, low density membrane domains (20Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Brown D. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Triton X-100-based lysates were prepared from HT-29 human adenocarcinoma cells and fractionated in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient, and the fractions were analyzed for protein concentration and caveolin-1 immunoreactivity. The distribution of protein along the gradient was characteristically skewed, with most protein concentrated at high density sucrose fractions 8–12 (Fig. 1 A). There was no apparent difference between parental HT-29-wt and multidrug-resistant HT-29-MDR cells in either the level or distribution of protein. Caveolin-1 was concentrated in low density fractions 4 and 5 (Fig. 1, B and C). The level of caveolin-1 in HT-29-MDR cells was greatly increased (12-fold) as compared with the parental cell line (Fig. 1,B and C). An even more dramatic up-regulation of caveolin-1 immunoreactivity was observed in multidrug-resistant MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. In the parental, drug-sensitive cells caveolin-1 expression was undetectable (Fig. 2 A, top panel); in contrast, there was a massive caveolin-1-immunoreactive 21-kDa band in the adriamycin-resistant MCF-7-AdrR cells (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). To test the possibility that the up-regulation of caveolin-1 is a consequence of overexpression of P-gp in the MDR cells, caveolin-1 levels were examined also in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with P-gp (BC-19 cell line). These cells express P-gp levels that are comparable with those found in MCF-7-AdrR (Ref.19Fairchild C.R. Moscow J.A. O'Brien E.E. Cowan K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar; cf. Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 2 A(bottom panel), caveolin-1 was undetectable in these cells. These results indicate that the up-regulation of caveolin-1 in MDR cancer cells might be a general phenomenon in MDR cancer cells and that the higher level of caveolin-1 is not a secondary cellular response to the overexpression of P-gp.Figure 2Up-regulation of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 in multidrug-resistant MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells.Parental MCF-7 cells, multidrug-resistant MCF-7-AdrR cells and BC-19 cells (MCF-7 cells stably transfected with P-gp) were lysed and fractionated by flotation in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient.

The two proteins are known to be co-expressed in most cell types (24Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and are thought to form hetero-oligomers in basolaterally destined caveolae (25Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether the up-regulation of caveolin-1 is accompanied by overexpression of caveolin-2. Fig. 2 B shows that this is indeed the case; whereas caveolin-2 is undetectable in parental MCF-7 (Fig. 2 B, top panel), there is a strong band of caveolin-2 immunoreactive protein in MCF-7-AdrR cells (Fig. 2 B, middle panel). In contrast, the expression of caveolin-2 in BC-19 cells was too low to be detected (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel). Previous results have indicated that another constituent of caveolae, the glycosphingolipid glucosylceramide, is elevated in various MDR cell lines (4Lavie Y. Cao H.-T. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Examination of glucosylceramide levels in [3H]serine-labeled HT-29 and HT-29-MDR cells revealed that in those colon cancer cells, too, glucosylceramide is significantly elevated (0.15 ± 0.01 versus 0.63 ± 0.15% of total lipid radioactivity in HT-29 and HT-29-MDR cells, respectively). High glucosylceramide levels found in the HT-29-MDR cells were sensitive to 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, which caused a 47–68% decrease in [3H]glucosylceramide levels in the MDR cells, suggesting that the enzyme is constitutively active in these cells. The fact that three specific constituents of caveolae, namely caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and glucosylceramide, are up-regulated in MDR cells, raised the possibility that acquisition of the MDR phenotype in cancer cells is associated with an increase in the number of caveolae. Electron microscopic examination of plasmalemmal profiles from HT-29-MDR cells revealed the presence of numerous non-clathrin-coated vesicular structures, 50–100 nm in diameter, that are juxtaposed to the plasma membrane and are morphologically indistinguishable from caveolae (Fig. 3 A, main panel and inset). In contrast, profiles of HT-29-wt cells typically contained significantly fewer caveolae-like structures (Fig. 3 B). Quantitative analysis of multiple plasmalemmal profiles revealed that the HT-29-MDR cells contained over 5-fold more caveolae-like structures as compared with the parental cells (3.5 ± 1.8 versus 0.65 ± 0.7 caveolae/10 μm, respectively). Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 and MCF-7-AdrR cells. Whereas the parental MCF-7 cells had virtually no caveolae, the MCF-7-AdrR cells had 2.4 ± 1.4 caveolae/10 μm. Together with the biochemical data presented above, showing the up-regulation of caveolin-1, caveolin-2 and glucosylceramide, these results indicate that MDR cells have significantly more caveolae and suggest that these structures may play a role in multidrug resistance. As in most other cell lines that acquired MDR (1Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 747-754PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ling V. Am. J. Med. 1995; 99: 31S-34SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the multidrug-resistant phenotype of HT-29-MDR cells is caused by overexpression of the MDR drug efflux ATPase P-glycoprotein, the product of the human MDR1 gene. Immunoblot analysis of fractions derived from HT-29-MDR cells with antibodies to P-gp revealed that 40% of cellular P-gp is associated with the low density fractions that contain caveolae (Fig. 4 A). The level of P-gp in HT-29-wt cells was usually undetectable. Similarly, 38% of total cellular P-gp was localized in caveolin-rich low density fractions of MCF-7-AdrR cells (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that a significant fraction of cellular P-gp is localized in detergent-insoluble low density membrane domains. To establish whether the fraction of P-gp present in such domains is localized in caveolae proper or in the related membrane domains termed DIGs, we examined the distribution of recombinantly expressed P-gp in BC-19 cells. In these cells, which do not express detectable levels of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 (cf. Fig. 2), the distribution of P-gp is very similar to that of endogenous P-gp found in MCF-7-AdrR cells, with a significant proportion (24%) of P-gp localized in low density detergent-insoluble membranes (Fig. 4 C). Thus, it would seem that the targeting of P-gp to these membrane domains is not dependent on the presence of caveolin or caveolae. It may therefore be concluded that cellular P-gp is located in at least two distinct membrane compartments. One compartment is detergent-soluble, whereas the other one has the physical properties of DIGs and caveolae, namely detergent-insolubility and low buoyant density. The expression of caveolin is not a necessary condition for targeting P-gp to the DIGs/caveolae fraction. An interesting issue that requires much further study is the relative contribution of those two distinct P-gp pools to drug efflux and drug resistance in the MDR cells. The present results raise the interesting and potentially important possibility that caveolae play a role in multidrug resistance of cancer cells. The up-regulation of caveolar constituents, both protein (caveolin-1 and caveolin-2) and lipid (glucosylceramide), coupled with the greater abundance of caveolae-like structures, all indicate that MDR cancer cells produce more caveolae. What might be the role of caveolae in MDR? Of the different functions assigned to caveolae, their proposed role in mediating cholesterol efflux might be most relevant in the context of MDR. Fielding et al. (27Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 28Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14932-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown that caveolae serve as plasma membrane terminals for the outward transport of cellular cholesterol and thus act to reduce cellular cholesterol levels. Furthermore, caveolin-1 expression is under the control of free cholesterol, acting through the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway (29Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 30Bist A. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The SREBP pathway has been implicated in the transcriptional activation of enzymes and proteins involved in biosynthesis or uptake of cholesterol (31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). In contrast, SREBP has a suppressive effect on caveolin-1 expression (30Bist A. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism of free cholesterol efflux through caveolae is not known, it is possible that caveolae (or caveolin) may be capable of mediating or facilitating the export of lipophilic drugs via a similar or analogous mechanism (probably at relatively low efficiency). If caveolae do have such a capability, cells that express higher levels of caveolin (and hence have more caveolae) will have a selective advantage during early stages of drug exposure. This property will therefore be positively co-selected, together with high P-gp expression, in drug-treated cells. This hypothesis is amenable to experimental scrutiny and is currently under study in our laboratory. It is interesting to note that caveolae and P-gp have been implicated independently in sterol metabolism of normal cells. As mentioned above, caveolae were proposed to constitute a site of cholesterol efflux (27Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,28Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J.

Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 30Bist A. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The evidence linking P-gp to free cholesterol metabolism is indirect but is based on several lines of research: first, the fact that progesterone and other steroids inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis by antagonizing P-gp (34Metherall J.E. Waugh K. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2627-2633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,35Metherall J.E. Li H. Waugh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2634-2640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); second, the observation that non-steroidal inhibitors of P-gp that are known to reverse MDR also inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis (35Metherall J.E. Li H. Waugh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2634-2640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); and third, the enhanced sensitivity of cells that overexpress P-gp to the cytotoxic action of lovastatin (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) (36Holmberg M. Sandberg C. Nygren P. Larsson R. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1994; 5: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Dimitroulakos J. Yeger H. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). By showing that caveolins are up-regulated in MDR cells and that P-gp is localized in part in DIGs and caveolae domains, the present results bring together these two lines of research and offer new approaches by which the proposed P-gp-dependent modulation of cholesterol metabolism (in normal cells) can be directly examined. Cancer cells “normally” have very low levels of caveolin, most likely due to the down-regulation of caveolin that occurs upon oncogenic transformation (12Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 38Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar); cf. Figs. 1 and 2). The present results indicate that upon acquisition of the MDR phenotype, cancer cells re-acquire a characteristic property of the differentiated epithelial cell, i.e. high levels of caveolin. It remains to be seen whether markers of differentiation other than caveolin are likewise modulated in MDR. Interestingly, expression of caveolin-1 has a growth-inhibitory effect on transformed cells (12Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 39Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In fact, caveolin-1 was identified as one of over 20 candidate “tumor suppressor” genes that are down-regulated in human breast cancer (40Sager R. Sheng S. Anisowitz A. Sotiropoulou G. Zhou Z. Stenman G. Swisshelm K. Chen Z. Hendrix M.J. Pemberton P. Rafidi K. Ryan K. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, we have found that the growth rate of HT-29-MDR cells (mean doubling time of 96 h) is significantly slower than that of their parental drug-sensitive cells (mean doubling time of 24 h). Hence, one functional consequence of the up-regulation of caveolins in MDR cells is a slower rate of proliferation, which may provide MDR cells with some protection against the action of cytotoxic drugs and thus contribute to their selective growth advantage under chemotherapy. Other consequences of the high caveolin expression levels in MDR cells are likely but will require much additional work to be fully elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2334098414,"Virtually all diffuse large cell lymphomas and a significant fraction of follicular lymphomas contain translocations and/or point mutations in the 5' non-coding region of the putative oncogene BCL-6, that are presumed to deregulate its expression. BCL-6 encodes a Cys2-His2 zinc finger transcriptional repressor with a POZ domain at its amino-terminus. The POZ (or BTB) domain, a 120-amino-acid motif, mediates homomeric and, in some proteins, heteromeric POZ-POZ interactions. In addition, the POZ domain is required for transcriptional repression of several proteins, including BCL-6. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified N-CoR and SMRT as BCL-6 interacting proteins. Both N-CoR and SMRT, which were originally identified as co-repressors for the unliganded nuclear thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors, are components of large complexes containing histone deacetylases. We show that the interaction between BCL-6 and these co-repressors is also detected in the more physiologically relevant mammalian two-hybrid assay. The POZ domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with these co-repressors. BCL-6 and N-CoR co-localize to punctate regions of the nucleus. Furthermore, when BCL-6 is bound to its consensus recognition sequence in vivo, it can interact with N-CoR and SMRT. We find, in vitro, that POZ domains from a variety of other POZ domain-containing proteins, including the transcriptional repressor PLZF, as well as ZID, GAGA and a vaccinia virus protein, SalF17R, also interact with varying affinities with N-CoR and SMRT. We find that BCL-6 POZ domain mutations that disrupt the interaction with N-CoR and SMRT no longer repress transcription. In addition, these mutations no longer self associate suggesting that self interaction is required for interaction with the co-repressors and for repression. More recently N-CoR has also been implicated in transcriptional repression by the Mad/Mxi proteins. Our demonstration that N-CoR and SMRT interact with the POZ domain containing proteins indicates that these co-repressors are likely involved in the mediation of repression by multiple classes of repressors and may explain, in part, how POZ domain containing repressors mediate transcriptional repression."

https://openalex.org/W2033889343,"Key to p53 ability to mediate its multiple cellular functions lies in its stability. In the present study we have elucidated the mechanism by which Mdm2 regulates p53 degradation. Using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays we demonstrate that Mdm2 association with p53 targets p53 ubiquitination. Exposure of cells to UV-irradiation inhibits this targeting. Mdm2 which is deficient in p53 binding failed to target p53 ubiquitination, suggesting that the association is essential for Mdm2 targeting ability. While mdm2-p53 complex is found in non-stressed cells, the amount of p53-bound mdm2 is decreased after UV-irradiation, further pointing to the relationship between mdm2 binding and p53 level. Similar to Swiss 3T3 cells, the dissociation of mdm2-p53 complex was also found in UV-treated Scid cells, lacking functional DNA-PK, suggesting that DNA-PK is not sufficient for dissociating mdm2 from p53. Together our studies point to the role of Mdm2, as one of p53-associated proteins, in targeting p53 ubiquitination."

We report the crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution of a 55 kDa N-terminal fragment from the 190 kDa clathrin heavy chain. The structure comprises the globular “terminal domain” and the linker that joins it to the end of a triskelion leg. The terminal domain is a seven-blade β propeller, a structure well adapted to interaction with multiple partners, such as the AP-1 and AP-2 sorting adaptor complexes and the nonvisual arrestins. The linker is an α-helical zigzag emanating from the propeller domain. We propose that this simple motif may extend into the rest of the clathrin leg."

Leukocyte trafficking into lymphoid tissues or into sites of infection or injury is a multistep process that involves several classes of adhesion molecules (1Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Binding of selectins to cell-surface glycoconjugates mediates the initial tethering and rolling adhesion of leukocytes on endothelial cells, platelets, or other leukocytes under the shear stresses in the microcirculation (2Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McEver R.P. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Most leukocytes express L-selectin, whereas activated endothelial cells and/or platelets express P- and E-selectin. Each selectin has an N-terminal C-type lectin domain, followed by an epidermal growth factor (EGF)1-like domain, a series of short consensus repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Selectins are postulated to mediate leukocyte tethering and rolling because they bind their ligands with very fast association and dissociation rates and high tensile strength (4Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 5Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, flowing leukocytes form transient tethers on very low densities of immobilized selectins, suggesting the presence of fast dissociation rates for selectin-ligand bonds. The unstressed cellulark off has been estimated to be 1 s−1for P-selectin, 0.7 s−1 for E-selectin, and 7 s−1 for L-selectin (5Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 6Alon R. Chen S.Q. Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). First-order dissociation kinetics suggest that each transient tether represents a quantal unit that corresponds to a single selectin-ligand bond, although the data do not exclude the possibility that a tether represents a small number of bonds (5Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 6Alon R. Chen S.Q. Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cellular experiments do not yield the association rates or the equilibrium affinities of selectin-ligand interactions. Therefore, biochemical measurements of the kinetics and affinity of binding of selectins to biologically relevant ligands are needed to extend the results of cellular assays. The selectins bind with low affinity to several sialylated, fucosylated, and sulfated glycans, including sialyl Lewis x (sLex, NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNAcβ1-R), a terminal component of oligosaccharides on many glycoproteins and glycolipids on leukocytes and endothelial cells (7Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7390-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). However, a striking feature of selectins is their preferential binding to only a few appropriately modified glycoproteins, most of which are sialomucins (7Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7390-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 8Varki A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The best characterized glycoprotein ligand for L-selectin is GlyCAM-1, a mucin secreted from high endothelial venules of peripheral lymph nodes (9Rosen S.D. Hwang S.T. Giblin P.A. Singer M.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because it is secreted, GlyCAM-1 may function primarily to transduce signals into leukocytes rather than to support leukocyte adhesion (10Hwang S.T. Singer M.S. Giblin P.A. Yednock T.A. Bacon K.B. Simon S.I. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Giblin P.A. Hwang S.T. Katsumoto T.R. Rosen S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3498-3507PubMed Google Scholar). To bind L-selectin, GlyCAM-1 must be modified with branched core-2 O-glycans that are sialylated, fucosylated, and sulfated (12Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D.

Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Experiments using surface plasmon resonance indicate that perfused soluble, monomeric L-selectin binds to immobilized GlyCAM-1 with very low affinity and very fast association and dissociation rates (16Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The measured equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) is 108 μm, and the measured dissociation rate constant (k off) is ≥10 s−1, with a calculated association rate constant (k on) of ≥105m−1 s−1. The rapid k off is consistent with the very short lifetimes of cellular tethers mediated through L-selectin (6Alon R. Chen S.Q. Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance measurements indicate that the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules CD2 and CD48 also interact with fast kinetics and very low affinity (K d = 90 μm) (17Van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Such results have led to the hypothesis that low affinity binding is a general feature of cell adhesion receptors (18Van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PSGL-1 is a disulfide-bonded homodimeric sialomucin on leukocytes that binds to all three selectins (reviewed in Ref. 19McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This result suggests that P-selectin binds to PSGL-1 with much higher affinity thanL-selectin binds to GlyCAM-1 and further implies that low affinity binding is not a characteristic of all adhesion receptors. However, it has been suggested that a small percentage of radiolabeled P-selectin oligomers might have bound multivalently to the neutrophil surface, resulting in an overestimate of the actual affinity (16Nicholson M.W.

In this study we used surface plasmon resonance to measure binding of perfused multimeric or monomeric forms of P-selectin to immobilized PSGL-1. The PSGL-1 for these studies was purified from human neutrophils to ensure that the mucin was post-translationally modified in a physiologically relevant cell type. Our results demonstrate that monomeric P-selectin binds to PSGL-1 with both fast association and dissociation rates, yet relatively high affinity. These data have important implications for how leukocytes tether to and roll on P-selectin under flow. The mAbs G1 and S12 against human P-selectin were prepared as described (30Geng J.-G.

PSGL-1 was purified from human neutrophils by P-selectin affinity chromatography (33Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

Tissue Culture Methods. 1994; 16: 255-257Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble P-selectin containing the entire extracellular region (sP-selectin, M r = 110,000) and soluble P-selectin containing only the lectin and EGF domains (Lec-EGF, M r = 28,000) were purified from conditioned medium of transfected 293 cells (28Ushiyama S.

Blood. 1997; 90: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Lec-EGF cDNA was also inserted into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the expression plasmid pEE14.1, and the plasmid was transfected into CHO-K1 cells. Permanently transfected cells secreting Lec-EGF protein were selected in medium containing 25 μm methionine sulfoximine and further subjected to 200 μm methionine sulfoximine as described (36Bebbington C.R. Methods. 1991; 2: 136-145Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Lec-EGF was purified from conditioned medium of the highest expressing clone by HPC4 affinity chromatography (35Mehta P. Patel K.D. Laue T.M. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). sP-selectin and Lec-EGF are monomeric as determined by both hydrodynamic analysis and electron microscopy (28Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mehta P. Patel K.D. Laue T.M. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure further that no oligomers were present, sP-selectin was chromatographed by size exclusion on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peak fractions were identified by the MicroBCA assay (Pierce), stored at 4 °C, and used within 48 h for binding experiments. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were conducted at 25 °C with a BIAcoreTMbiosensor that was upgraded to model 1000 specifications. All solutions were passed through a 0.2-μm filter and degassed before injection into the instrument. The running buffer was 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Brij-58 (Pierce), except for certain experiments where the CaCl2 was replaced with 0.2 mm EDTA. PSGL-1 was covalently coupled to a research grade CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) through its primary amino groups. Coupling was performed with the Amino Coupling Kit (BIAcore) according to the supplied instructions, except that PSGL-1 was first exchanged into 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing 0.01–0.05% Brij-58 (critical micellar concentration = 0.0086%). Then PSGL-1 was injected across the chip at a flow rate of 2 μl/min for 25 min, and unreacted sites were blocked with 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. A control surface was prepared by injecting 200 milliunits/ml of Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (Oxford Glycosystems) over immobilized PSGL-1 at a flow rate of 1 μl/min for 12.5 h. Analytes (P-selectin or mAbs) were perfused over the immobilized PSGL-1 ligand at a flow rate of 40 μl/min unless otherwise specified. Bound P-selectin was removed by injection of 10 mm EDTA. Bound mAbs were removed by injection of 50 mm HCl. Repeated short pulses of HCl did not alter the binding capacity of PSGL-1 for P-selectin. Data on equilibrium binding were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm to the primary data and by linear regression analysis of Scatchard plots. Biosensor data were routinely collected at one point/s, except for the dissociation rate measurements where data were collected at 10 points/s. The interaction of native PSGL-1 with both native and recombinant forms of P-selectin was studied. PSGL-1, a homodimeric mucin, was purified from human neutrophil membranes by P-selectin affinity chromatography. The two subunits of each PSGL-1 molecule are linked by a disulfide bond near the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1 A). P-selectin binds to the N-terminal region of PSGL-1. PL1, a mAb to this region, blocks binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. PL2, a mAb that binds to an epitope within the decameric repeats of PSGL-1, does not block binding to P-selectin (25Moore K.L. Patel K.D. Bruehl R.E. Fugang L. Johnson D.A. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Native membrane P-selectin (mP-selectin) was purified from human platelets (Fig. 1 B). In buffers containing 0.1% Brij-58, mP-selectin is primarily composed of dimers, with lesser amounts of monomers and oligomers (28Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G1, a mAb that binds to the C-type lectin domain, blocks binding of P-selectin to PSGL-1. S12, a mAb that binds to the sixth consensus repeat, does not block binding to PSGL-1 (30Geng J.-G. Bevilacqua M.P. Moore K.L. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Kim J.M. Bliss G.A. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Nature. 1990; 343: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Two recombinant soluble forms of P-selectin were expressed in human 293 cells (Fig. 1 B). sP-selectin contains the entire extracellular portion of the molecule (28Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Lec-EGF contains only the lectin and EGF domains, plus a short C-terminal sequence for a factor Xa cleavage site and an epitope for the Ca2+-dependent mAb HPC4 (35Mehta P. Patel K.D. Laue T.M. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both sP-selectin and Lec-EGF are monomeric in aqueous buffers, as determined by hydrodynamic analysis and electron microscopy (28Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mehta P. Patel K.D. Laue T.M. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out further the presence of oligomers, sP-selectin was gel-filtered on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. The protein eluted as a single peak (data not shown). No earlier eluting peaks were observed, suggesting that the sP-selectin preparation lacks even a minor population of oligomers. To ensure further that sP-selectin was completely monomeric, binding experiments were performed using material from the peak fractions within 48 h after chromatography. PSGL-1 was covalently coupled to the sensor surface through its primary amines. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, 3424 resonance units (RU) were covalently bound. Because the RU coupled to the surface do not necessarily indicate the amount of appropriately oriented PSGL-1, we measured the availability of epitopes for the anti-PSGL-1 mAbs PL1 and PL2. At saturating concentrations, equivalent amounts of both IgG mAbs bound to immobilized PSGL-1. PL1 Fab fragments also bound saturably to PSGL-1, although they dissociated faster than did the bivalent PL1 IgG (Fig. 2). On a molar basis, the ratio of PL1 Fab to PL1 IgG binding was ≈1.5:1, suggesting that some IgG molecules bound bivalently or that the smaller Fab fragments had better access to the epitope on each subunit of the PSGL-1 homodimer. The amount of IgG bound at saturation (≈600 RU) is less than the 3424 RU of covalently bound PSGL-1, even accounting for the smaller apparentM r of IgG (150,000) relative to that of PSGL-1 (≈240,000). The difference may be due to immobilized PSGL-1 molecules that are not suitably oriented for binding and/or to immobilized contaminating proteins. However, the data clearly indicate that mAbs bind to at least some immobilized PSGL-1 molecules. The ability of PL1 to bind is particularly important, because the epitope for this mAb overlaps the P-selectin-binding site (37Li F. Erickson H.P. James J.A. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6342-6348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). mP-selectin was first perfused over the PSGL-1 surface, because mP-selectin is primarily dimeric in nonionic detergents and should therefore bind to PSGL-1 with higher avidity than monomeric forms of P-selectin. Injection of mP-selectin resulted in a biphasic binding response, followed by a relatively slow rate of dissociation (Fig. 3 A). Preincubation of mP-selectin with the blocking anti-P-selectin mAb G1 abrogated binding to PSGL-1. In contrast, preincubation with the nonblocking anti-P-selectin mAb S12 augmented the response, due to the larger mass of the mP-selectin-S12 complex. Prebinding of PL1 to the PSGL-1 surface blocked binding of mP-selectin, whereas prebinding of PL2 did not block binding (Fig. 3 B). Injection of EDTA rapidly reversed the binding of mP-selectin, consistent with the known Ca2+dependence of selectin binding to PSGL-1 (data not shown). These data demonstrate that mP-selectin binds specifically to immobilized PSGL-1. Because mP-selectin is dimeric and oligomeric, it could not be reliably used to measure the affinity and kinetics of binding. Injection of sP-selectin resulted in a rapid binding response, followed by rapid dissociation (Fig. 4 A). Preincubation of sP-selectin with mAb G1 blocked binding. In contrast, preincubation with mAb S12 increased the binding response, due to the larger mass of the sP-selectin-S12 complex and to an increase in binding avidity presumably caused by cross-linking of some sP-selectin molecules by the bivalent S12 IgG. Prebinding of PL1 to the PSGL-1 surface blocked binding of sP-selectin (Fig. 4 B). After prebinding of PL2, however, injection of increasing concentrations of sP-selectin caused progressive increases in the binding response. sP-selectin did not bind to immobilized PSGL-1 in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). These data demonstrate that sP-selectin also binds specifically to immobilized PSGL-1. Because it is monomeric, sP-selectin dissociates much more rapidly from PSGL-1 than does mP-selectin. Because the BIAcore detects binding as a change in refractive index, the rapid kinetics of binding of sP-selectin to immobilized PSGL-1 may be difficult to distinguish from bulk refractive changes, especially when high protein concentrations are injected. We therefore wished to conduct parallel injections of P-selectin on both a PSGL-1 surface and a control, nonbinding surface. In this manner, RU attributed to bulk refractive index on the control surface could be subtracted from the total RU measured on the PSGL-1 surface, yielding specific binding. Treatment of PSGL-1 with sialidase abrogates binding to P-selectin, consistent with the requirement for sLex or related glycans as part of the binding site (26Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.L. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 27Norgard K.E. Moore K.L. Diaz S. Stults N.L. Ushiyama S. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12764-12774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We immobilized PSGL-1 on two flow cells at comparable densities and perfused sialidase over one of the flow cells to remove sialic acid moieties from PSGL-1. Sialidase treatment eliminated binding of CSLEX-1, a mAb to sLex, but increased binding of LeuM1, a mAb to the nonsialylated Lexstructure (Fig. 5, A and B). Sialidase treatment did not appreciably affect binding of PL1, which recognizes a protein epitope near the N terminus of PSGL-1 (Fig. 5 C). Thus, the sialidase perfusion effectively removed sialic acid from PSGL-1, but did not remove PSGL-1 itself from the sensor surface. mP-selectin bound to nontreated PSGL-1 but not to sialidase-treated PSGL-1 (Fig. 5 D). These data further document the specificity of binding of P-selectin to immobilized PSGL-1, by showing that binding requires sialylation of PSGL-1. They also demonstrate that sialidase-treated PSGL-1 is an ideal control surface for distinguishing bulk refractive index changes from specific binding of P-selectin to PSGL-1. We measured the affinity of sP-selectin and Lec-EGF for PSGL-1 by injecting increasing concentrations of each protein over both nonsialidase-treated PSGL-1 and sialidase-treated PSGL-1. Although sP-selectin and Lec-EGF are monomeric by several criteria, there remained the possibility that small quantities of oligomers might develop prior to the assay. Because of mass action, low concentrations of oligomers would bind slowly relative to the major monomeric species. We therefore used a high flow rate (40 μl/min) and a short injection time (15 s) to favor monomer binding. This short infusion provided sufficient data points, since equilibrium binding was reached within 2–3 s. Injection of increasing concentrations of sP-selectin or Lec-EGF resulted in a rapid increase in refractive index on both PSGL-1 surfaces, followed by a rapid decrease to base line after the injection was completed (Fig. 6). The RU measured on the nonsialidase-treated surface were always higher than on the sialidase-treated surface. Injection of equivalent concentrations of human serum albumin on either surface yielded RU values identical to those observed for sP-selectin or Lec-EGF on the sialidase-treated surface (Fig. 6). Thus, the RU values on the sialidase-treated surface clearly reflected bulk refractive index changes rather than true binding to the surface. Subtraction of the value on the sialidase-treated surface from the value on the nonsialidase-treated surface yielded the specific binding of sP-selectin or Lec-EGF to PSGL-1. The equilibrium affinity of binding to PSGL-1 was measured in two ways (Fig. 7). In the first, the BIAevaluation software was used to plot the subtracted equilibrium response (R eq) versus the concentration of sP-selectin or Lec-EGF. Nonlinear curve fitting was used to derive the dissociation constant (K d). In the second, standard Scatchard analysis was used. Both methods yielded similar results and indicated that sP-selectin and Lec-EGF bound to a single class of sites on PSGL-1. The K d for sP-selectin was 320 ± 20 nm, as determined in multiple experiments using different preparations of sP-selectin (Table I). The K d for Lec-EGF was similar (Table I), although the results were slightly more variable because the smaller mass of Lec-EGF decreased the ratio of specific to nonspecific binding at higher input concentrations.Table ISummary of affinity and kinetic data for sP-selectin and Lec-EGF binding to PSGL-1P-selectin constructK d (nm) (nonlinear curve-fitting)k offk ons−1m−1s−1sP-selectin1-aMean ± S.D. of four determinations for equilibrium affinity measurements and of six determinations for dissociation rate constant measurements, using three different preparations of sP-selectin.320 ± 201.4 ± 0.14.4 × 106Lec-EGF1-bMean ± S.D. of seven determinations for equilibrium affinity measurements and of six determinations for dissociation rate constant measurements, using four different preparations of Lec-EGF.422 ± 891.6 ± 0.43.8 × 1061-a Mean ± S.D. of four determinations for equilibrium affinity measurements and of six determinations for dissociati"
https://openalex.org/W2086768044,"Expression of pipe in the somatic tissue of the Drosophila ovary is required for the formation of embryonic dorsal–ventral polarity. pipe, which encodes an enzyme similar to the glycosaminoglycan-modifying enzyme heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase, is expressed in a spatially restricted domain of follicle cells on the ventral side of the egg chamber. Mutations that affect follicular polarity correspondingly alter the spatial pattern of pipe expression. Directed expression of pipe in otherwise pipe mutant females restores embryonic lateral and ventral pattern elements and can orient the dorsal–ventral axis of the embryo. Thus, the localized expression of pipe and the spatially restricted modification of carbohydrate chains play pivotal roles in the mechanisms that establish embryonic pattern and integrate follicular and embryonic polarity."

Sequence analysis revealed that Diva is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing Bcl-2 homology domain 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. The expression of Diva mRNA was detected in multiple embryonic tissues but was restricted to the ovary and testis in adult mice. The expression of Diva promoted the death of 293T, Ramsey, and T47D cells as well as that of primary sensory neurons, indicating that Diva is a proapoptotic protein. Significantly, Diva lacks critical residues in the conserved BH3 region that mediate the interaction between BH3-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues and their prosurvival binding partners. Consistent with this, Diva did not bind to cellular Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1. Furthermore, mutants of Diva lacking the BH3 region fully retained their proapoptotic activity, confirming that Diva promotes apoptosis in a BH3-independent manner. Significantly, Diva interacted with a viral Bcl-2 homologue (vBcl-2) encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Consistent with these associations, apoptosis induced by Diva was inhibited by vBcl-2 but not by Bcl-XL. Importantly, Diva interacted with Apaf-1, an adapter molecule that activates caspase-9, a central death protease of the apoptotic pathway. The expression of Diva inhibited the binding of Bcl-XL to Apaf-1, as determined by immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, Diva represents a novel type of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue that promotes apoptosis independently of the BH3 region through direct binding to Apaf-1, thus preventing Bcl-XL from binding to the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1.

Analyses of the nematode cell death regulators CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 have provided important insight into the biochemical mechanism that regulates apoptosis.

To date, all death-promoting Bcl-2-related proteins heterodimerize with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Mcl-1, suggesting that these molecules promote cell death at least in part by interacting with and antagonizing Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 (12Oltvai Z.N.

Unlike all known Bcl-2-related proapoptotic proteins, Diva lacks critical residues in the BH3 domain that are involved in the interaction between BH3-containing proapoptotic proteins and their binding partners. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by Diva does not require the conserved BH3 domain. Apoptosis induced by Diva was inhibited by the viral caspase inhibitor p35 and the dominant negative mutant of caspase-9, but not by Bcl-XL. Consistent with this, Diva can directly interact with Apaf-1 and displace Bcl-XL from the Apaf-1/Bcl-XL complex, suggesting that Diva inhibits Bcl-XL function through competitive binding to Apaf-1. Apoptosis, a morphologically distinguished form of programmed cell death, is critical during development and tissue homeostasis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6172) Google Scholar). Several regulatory components of the apoptotic pathway have been identified in various living organisms including man (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6172) Google Scholar, 2White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). A family of proteins that includes Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1 shares conserved regions termed Bcl-2 homology domains 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4)1 and function by repressing apoptosis (3Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). The biochemical process by which Bcl-2 family members regulate cell death is poorly understood. Analyses of the nematode cell death regulators CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 have provided important insight into the biochemical mechanism that regulates apoptosis. CED-9, the nematode homologue of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, binds to CED-4 and represses cell death by interacting and inhibiting the killing activity of CED-3 through CED-4 (4Spector M.S. Desnoyers S.

Aquaporins (AQPs)1 are a class of membrane proteins in which water transport is thought to take place via an aqueous pore by osmosis (1Van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. Dempster J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The physical dimensions, the location, and the chemical composition of the putative pore are largely unknown. Such parameters, however, will be central to the interpretation of structural data (4Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heyman J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A.

Here we probe the pore size by testing the osmotic efficiencies of solutes of different molecular weights, dimensions, and chemical compositions; if the test solute can permeate the pore, the resulting water fluxes will be smaller than that caused by an impermeable solute (7Finkelstein A. Water Movement Through Lipid Bilayers, Pores, and Plasma Membranes, Theory and Reality. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 228Google Scholar, 8Hill A.E. J. Membr.

To obtain precise measurements, it was necessary first to evaluate critically and to improve the Xenopus oocyte system as an assay of osmotic water transport. So far, water transport by aquaporins expressed in Xenopus oocytes have been investigated by challenging with hyposmolar solutions creating gradients of about 100 mosm for up to 30 min. This results in rates of swelling that vary with time. Furthermore, oocytes do not shrink as well as they swell when exposed to large hypertonic gradients (9Zhang R. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C26-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have improved the volume recording and the solution changing system to employ osmotic gradients as small as 2.5 mosm and as short as 5 s. In this way the transport parameters could be determined unambiguously from the initial rate of oocyte volume changes in both swelling and shrinkage experiments.

The data demonstrate that the water flow through aquaporins are bidirectional and that there are structural differences among the various subtypes. Furthermore, for a given aquaporin, there was no relation between the size of the test solutes and their permeability. Human AQP1 and rat AQP5 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 99538 and ATCC 87185). Human AQP2 was a gift from Dr. K. Fushimi. Rat AQP3 and -4 were a gift from Dr. S. Nielsen. Preparation of mRNA, injection into and maintenance of theXenopus oocytes were carried out as described previously (20Zeuthen T. Meinild A.-K. Klaerke D.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. Belhage B. Litman T.

Briefly, cRNA was synthesized by the mCAP In Vitrotranscription kit from Stratagene, and the appropriate RNA polymerases (T7 or T3) were used for run off transcription of sense-cRNA. Oocytes were isolated and defolliculated with collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim). For expression, the oocytes were injected with 10–50 ng of cRNA and incubated at 19 °C in Kulori medium (in mm: 90 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4) for 3–7 days before experiments. Healthy oocytes with membrane potentials more negative than −20 mV were used. The experiments were performed as described in detail previously (20Zeuthen T. Meinild A.-K. Klaerke D.A. Loo D.D.F.

The chamber had a total volume of 30 μl, and the control bathing solution could be changed to a test solution within 5 s (90% complete). The oocytes were impaled with two microelectrodes that served to determine the membrane potential, and, importantly, they stabilized the oocyte in the chamber. The presence of microelectrodes did not affect the measurements (22Loo D.D.F. Zeuthen T. Chandy G. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13367-13370Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in experiments where the oocytes were held from the outside by two microelectrodes, the tips of which had been melted into 100 μm spheres. Oocytes were observed from below via an inverted microscope connected to a charge-coupled camera. The oocyte volume change was visualized on line. Noise levels were about 0.03%, which is equal to a oocyte volume change of about 0.3 nl. The temperature of the experimental chamber was 23 °C but could be lowered by leading the bathing solutions through ice. The control bathing solution contained in mm: 90 NaCl, 20 mannitol, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 214 mosm. Hyposmotic test solutions were obtained by removing mannitol and hyperosmotic solutions by adding mannitol. The mannitol contents were adjusted so that the removal of all mannitol from the test solution led to a reduction of the osmolarity of 20 mosm. To induce large rates of oocyte swelling, we used hypotonic solutions that contained 45 mm NaCl and 10 mm mannitol, otherwise as above. This gives an osmolarity of 120 mosm, 94 mosm lower than the control solution. Osmolarities were measured in duplicate for each experiment by freezing point depression (Roebling). The osmotic water permeabilityL p was obtained from JV=−ALpΔπ(Eq. 1) The volume flow, J V, was determined from the initial rate of change of oocyte volume. L p are given per true cm2 of oocyte membrane, A. The oocytes had an average diameter of 1.35 mm, which gives a volume of 1.35 μl and an apparent surface area of 5.9 mm2. Folding of the membrane increases this area by nine times to A= 0.53 cm2 (23Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Δπ is the difference between the osmolarity of the test solution and the control bathing solution. The ability to permeate was assessed from reflection coefficients (ς): ςurea, ςglycerol, ςacetamide, and ςformamide were derived from the initial rate of shrinkage induced by test solutions made 20 mosm hyperosmolar by adding either urea (M r 60), glycerol (M r92), acetamide (M r 63) or formamide (M r 45) to the control solution JV=−ςALpΔπ(Eq. 2) This shrinkage was compared with the one induced by adding mannitol (M r 182) (Eq. 1) and ς obtained by division. If the test solute permeates, ς is smaller than 1. Alternatively, ςs could be derived from the initial rates of cell swelling induced by replacing the 20 mosm of mannitol in the control solution by 2 mosm of the test solute JV=(1−ς)ALpΔπ(Eq. 3) where Δπ equals 20 mosm. All numbers are given as mean ± S.E., n is the number of experiments in at least 4 oocytes unless otherwise indicated. When the external osmolarity was changed, the oocyte volume began to change within 1 s. For oocytes expressing aquaporins, the rate of change decreased progressively with time; when the bathing solution was returned to the control solution, the oocyte volume returned rapidly toward its control value (Fig. 1, A and B). There was a direct relationship between the difference in the initial and the final slope of the volume change during the osmotic challenge (Fig. 1 C, α) and the initial slope during the subsequent recovery (Fig. 1C, β): The two values were equal to a first approximation. For osmotic challenges in the range −20 to +20 mosm, β equaled 1.2 ± 0.06 times α (r = 0.98, n = 73). The magnitudes of the effect varied, the larger the expressed water permeability the larger α and β; changes were virtually absent (α and β = 0) in native oocytes (Fig. 1 D). Both α and β were smaller when measured at 13 °C compared with 23 °C. The Arrhenius activation energy E a was 10 ± 1 kcal mol−1(5 oocytes) for α and 11 ± 3 (5 oocytes) for β. TheseE as are about 50% larger than those obtained for the L p (see below). There was no change in membrane potential when the external osmolarity was changed by means of mannitol. Furthermore, inhibitors of volume regulatory responses had no effects on the volume responses: 100 μm DIDS (24Ackerman M.J. Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), 1 mm furosemide, 100 μm bumetanide, or 100 μm cytocalasin B (data not shown). Hyperosmotic (shrinkage) experiments were performed by adding up to 20 mm of mannitol to the control bathing solution, whereas hyposmotic experiments (swelling) were obtained by removing up to 20 mm of mannitol. The L ps obtained were independent of the direction of the osmotic gradient. These experiments were compared with the effects of exposing the oocyte to hyposmolarities of −94 mosm for each oocyte. A typical set of recordings are shown in Fig. 2. The slope defines the osmotic water permeability L p when the initial rates of change are plotted as a function of the osmotic driving force. The average L p ((10−5 cm s−1 (osmol liter−1)−1) was for oocytes expressing AQP0, 2.3 ± 0.06 (6Li H. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct.

The L pof the native oocytes was 0.38 ± 0.04 (10−5 cm s−1 (osmol liter−1)−1) (15 oocytes) (Fig. 1 D). This is about 6 times lower than theL p recorded for AQP0-expressing oocytes and 20 times lower than that recorded for the other aquaporins. The effects of adding 20 mosm of mannitol was compared with the effects of adding 20 mosm of urea, glycerol, acetamide, or formamide and given as ς in Table I. Most notable are the low ςs for glycerol, acetamide, and formamide in AQP3, indicative of high permeabilities, and the fact that these ςs are larger at a lower temperature.

If values are significantly different from 1 at the 0.05 level, based on both number of oocytes (No) and number of observations (given in parentheses), they are corrected for the permeability of the native oocyte and given in bold. The ςs for urea, glycerol, acetamide, and formamide for native oocytes were all insignificantly different from 1 (data not shown). Because the L p of the native oocyte is small (see above) any correction of the raw data in Table I is small, about 10% for AQP0 and 5% for the other aquaporins. The ςs presented in Table I were determined from shrinkage experiments. For AQP3 we tested whether the same ςs were obtained in experiments where water enters the cells. The control bathing solution was changed abruptly to one where the 20 mosm of mannitol was replaced isotonically by 20 mosm of urea, glycerol, acetamide, or formamide (Eq. 3). The rates of swelling, proportional to 1 − ς are presented in Fig. 3. Clearly these experiments give the same ςs as the shrinkage experiments. E a for the L p was derived from experiments performed at 23 and 13 °C with the addition of 20 mosm of mannitol.E a was 7 kcal mol−1 for AQP0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and 6 kcal mol−1 for AQP1 with S.E. less than 10%. In AQP3, the addition of 20 mosm of mannitol, urea, glycerol, acetamide, or formamide gave E as of 6.5 ± 0.6 (8Hill A.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 6.7 ± 1.0 (5Cheng A. van Hoek A.N. Yager M. Verkman A.S. Mitra A.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), 5.1 ± 0.2 (8Hill A.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 6.3 ± 0.8 (8Hill A.E. J.

These values are similar to those above except for that of glycerol, which is significantly lower. The effects of HgCl2was tested as a function of time. At time zero 1 mm of HgCl2 was added to the control bathing solution, subsequently L p and ς were measured every 1 to 2 min by short lasting additions of 20 mosm of mannitol or test solute. In agreement with the observations of others, AQP1, 2, 3, and 5 were sensitive to HgCl2, whereas AQP0 and AQP4 were not. The rate, however, at which HgCl2 inhibited AQP1 was up to 10 times slower than that reported by others (34Echevarrı́a M. Windhager E.E. Frindt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25079-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After 10 min of exposure to 1 mm HgCl2, L pwas reduced by 38% ± 3 (7 oocytes). After 30 min of exposure, the inhibition was 61% ± 3 (5 oocytes) equivalent to anL p of 3.4 ± 0.4 (10−5 cm s−1 (osmol liter−1)−1). This is still about 8 times higher than that of the native oocyte membrane. If 5 mm HgCl2 was used instead of 1 mm, similar degrees of inhibitions were obtained, but the effects occurred three times faster (4 oocytes, data not shown). We have no explanation for this slow response, it cannot be because of methodology, because the inhibitions of AQP2, 3, and 5 were complete in a few minutes, which is as fast as those reported by others. In AQP3, HgCl2 affected both L p and the ςs. After 10 min of exposure to HgCl2, theL p was reduced by 76% ± 5 (4 oocytes). Within 15 min the inhibition was complete at 88% ± 4, equivalent to anL p of 0.9 ± 0.2 (10−5 cm s−1 (osmol liter−1)), which is close to the value of native oocytes treated with HgCl2. Initially ςglyc was small, about 0.25 (Table I), but after only 3–5 min in HgCl2 (i.e. before theL p was fully inhibited), additions of 20 mosm of glycerol to the bathing solutions produced the same oocyte shrinkage as did mannitol, ςglyc = 1 (6 oocytes tested). A similar effect was found for formamide; ςformincreased to 0.6 after 5 min of HgCl2 exposure (3 oocytes tested). The effects of HgCl2 on L p were fully reversible (even without the application of β-mercaptoethanol) within 10–20 min. Common to both native and aquaporin-expressing oocytes, 1 mm of HgCl2 caused the oocytes to swell and to stabilize at a volume 5% (range from 2 to 8) larger than the control volume; concurrently, the membrane potential fell typically from −35 mV to −5 mV. Native oocytes behaved as almost ideal osmometers (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, oocytes that expressed aquaporins exhibited volume changes that were markedly nonlinear; most striking is the rapid return to control volume after the osmotic challenge (Fig. 1, A and B). During the osmotic challenge, there appears to be a gradual build up of a counter osmotic force, which reduces the rate of volume change (Fig. 1 C, by the amount α). When the external solution is returned to control solution, this counter osmotic force remains and gives rise to the fast rate of return (Fig. 1 C, β) of the oocyte volume toward the control volume, hence α ≅ β. Most likely, this behavior results from a build up of an unstirred layer inside the oocyte and is governed by the very slow rates of interdiffusion between water and the intracellular proteinaceous solutes (25Dick, D. A. T. (1966) pp. 155, Butterworth, LondonGoogle Scholar). When the external solution is returned to control, most of the water in the unstirred layer will return to the bathing solution by osmosis across the oocyte membrane; the flux into the oocyte will be comparatively small, because it is determined by the slow process of interdiffusion (25Dick, D. A. T. (1966) pp. 155, Butterworth, LondonGoogle Scholar). Consequently, the oocyte volume returns to the control value. It is unlikely that an ion specific, membrane bound, volume regulatory mechanism should be operating to any great extent. The osmotic effects were not associated with changes in the membrane potential and were insensitive to inhibitors of volume regulation. Furthermore, the nonlinearity effects (α and β) had activation energies of about 10 kcal mol−1, whereas the volume regulatory cotransport mechanism has E as of more than 20 kcal mol−1 (26Ellory J.C. Hall A.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90A: 533-537Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). From the analysis above, we conclude that only the initial rate of change of the oocyte volume gives a valid measure of theL p. Inspection of the curves in Fig. 1, Aand B, shows that an L p based on volume change observed after 120 s will be estimated a factor 2.5 too low and if based on changes observed after 30 s, a factor 1.7 too low. Thus part of the variability in the data reported in the literature could arise if investigators based their L p values on volume changes obtained at different times. The values of E a will also depend on the time at which the volume change is determined. Because of the highE a of the nonlinearity effects (Fig. 1 C, α), volume changes recorded at 13 °C will exhibit less change than volume changes obtained at 23 °C. Consequently, the apparentE a will be smaller the later the volume changes are recorded. The difference between the E as reported by us, about 7 kcal mol−1, and those in the literature of about 4 kcal mol−1, can easily be attributed to this effect. If we base our estimates on values obtained after 60 s, instead of initial values, we also obtain E as of about 4 kcal mol−1. By applying small and short lasting osmotic challenges we show, for the first time, that theL p derived from shrinkage experiments and swelling experiments are the same. Thus the aquaporins are bidirectional,i.e. they do not rectify water flows. The aquaporins exhibited ςs lower than 1 for a number of solutes, which demonstrates interactions between water and solute flow in the aqueous pathway. The possibility that the test solute should cross the membrane via another route and thereby alter the osmotic driving force across the pore can be excluded. First, we deal with initial rates of flows and determine the rate of water flow within 10 s. As can be calculated, such periods are too short for any significant osmolarity to build up inside the oocyte. Second, ς for all test solutes in the native oocyte was one, similar to that for mannitol, which is impermeable. Third, there was no general connection between the type of the solute and the pattern of ςs (Table I). In some AQPs the smallest solute formamide had a low ς whereas in others it had a ς of 1. If, say, formamide could permeate via the protein-lipid interphase of the expressed aquaporins, ςform would be small for all aquaporins. Finally, it can be excluded that the low ς should arise from some kind of blockage by the solute inside the pore. If the test solutes should cause a physical reduction of the cross-section of the channel, we would not obtain the same ς in shrinkage experiments as in swelling experiments (Fig. 3). Our data suggest that there are specific interactions between the pore and the test solutes and exclude an entirely steric model where the solute and pore are viewed as having well defined dimensions (7Finkelstein A. Water Movement Through Lipid Bilayers, Pores, and Plasma Membranes, Theory and Reality. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 228Google Scholar, 8Hill A.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consider the van der Waals dimensions of the solutes employed (in Å): mannitol (7.4 × 8.2 × 12), urea (3.6 × 5.2 × 5.4), glycerol (4.8 × 5.1 × 7.8), acetamide (3.8 × 5.2 × 5.4), and formamide (3.4 × 4.4 × 5.4) (27Gutiérrez A.M. González E. Echevarrı́a M. Hernández C.S. Whittembury G. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For AQP1, -2, and -4 only ςglyc was lower than 1 (Table I). Accordingly, glycerol permeates the pores, yet the glycerol molecule is not the smallest. In AQP3, ςform is smaller than ςglyc, which is smaller than ςacet. Yet, glycerol is larger than acetamide and they are both larger than urea which does not permeate. Thus pore size and van der Waal dimensions of the solutes are insufficient to explain the sequences of ςs observed. Part of the explanation could be solute-pore interactions. If, for example, the –NH2 and –OH of the solutes formed hydrogen bonds with oxygens facing the pore wall, the effective size of the solute would be smaller by 1.4 A (28Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, Massachusetts1992: 607Google Scholar). The effects of lowering the temperature for AQP3 demonstrates that the pore dimensions are not fixed entities (Table I); ςacetincreased to 1 and ςglyc and ςform doubled. Possibly AQP3 undergoes conformational changes that narrow the pore diameter. This would also explain the low E aobtained for volume flows induced by glycerol gradients;E a would result from two processes, the osmotic flow of water and the exclusion of glycerol at reduced temperature. Interestingly, ςglyc increased to 1 and ςform doubled under the influence of HgCl2, which also suggests a conformatinal narrowing of the pore. Single channel permeabilities and reflection coefficients (Table I) can be combined to suggest dimensions of the rate-limiting (the narrow) part of the aqueous pore. Single channel permeabilities are (in cm3 s−1 10−14) for AQP0, 0.25 (29Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), 0.015 (23Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Now the reflection coefficients for AQP1, AQP2, and AQP4 were similar. If this means that their cross-sections are equal, the narrow part of the pore of AQP1 and AQP2 should have the same length, whereas that for AQP4 should be 6 times shorter. It appears that AQP3 has the largest pore cross-section, but because its single channel permeability is similar to that of AQP1 and AQP2, the length of the narrow part of its pore should be longer. These estimates, based naively on macroscopic hydrodynamics, should be viewed with great caution. Furthermore, the variability in the reported single channel permeabilities calls for further studies. Our data clearly shows that AQP3 is permeable to water. Expression of the protein increased the water permeability of the oocyte about 20-fold; theL p was inhibited by HgCl2 and had a low activation energy. This agrees with some studies (15Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi M. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6273-6369Google Scholar, 34Echevarrı́a M.

We found AQP3 to be permeable to glycerol by a mechanism that had a low activation energy and was sensitive to HgCl2 in a reversible manner. This agrees with the findings reported in Ref. 15Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi M. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25079-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar where it was reported that glycerol uptake was determined by a high activation energy and was unaffected by mercurials. Now, the latter study employed radioactive uptakes and long term swellings, methods that report on the rate of transport by all types of mechanisms, but may be too crude to detect whether a given ς is lower than 1. Our finding of a ς smaller than 1 only shows that the solute can enter and permeate through the aqueous pore, it does not show whether the resulting flux is large enough to be detected in tracer experiments, and it may not detect parallel pathways that depend on other kinds of transport mechanisms. The controversy could therefore arise if AQP3 had two parallel pathways for glycerol, an aqueous pathway and a mechanism that depended on conformational changes. AQP3 is able to sustain a transport of urea (15Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi M. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our results show that this transport does not take place by diffusion in the aqueous pathway. AQP4 was found by us to be permeable to glycerol, characterized by a ς of 0.8. It has been concluded from radioactive uptakes, however, that glycerol was impermeable (18Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previously, we used synthetic peptides to screen for biologically active sequences in the laminin α1 chain C-terminal globular domain (G domain) and identified several cell binding sequences (Nomizu, M., Kim, W.

Here, we identify new cell binding sequences on the remainder of the laminin α1 chain by systematic peptide screening, using 208 overlapping synthetic peptides encompassing the central and N-terminal portions of the α1 chain. HT-1080 cell attachment activity to the peptides was evaluated using peptide-coated plastic substrates and peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads. Twenty five peptides showed cell attachment activities on either the peptide-coated plastic substrates and/or the peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads. A-13 (RQVFQVAYIIIKA) showed strongest cell attachment activity in both the assays. Cell attachment to 14 of the peptides was inhibited by heparin. EDTA and integrin antibodies inhibited cell adhesion to two of the peptides, A-13 and A-25, suggesting that these sites likely bind to integrins. These peptides inhibited cell attachment to laminin-1 but not to collagen I, suggesting these active sites are available on the intact molecule.

These synthetic peptides have been used to understand the various biological functions of laminin and to develop therapeutic agents. However, biologically functional domains/sequences of laminin-1 have not been fully characterized, since it is a large molecule with complex conformations.Recently, we began a systematic screening of cell binding sequences from the multifunctional molecule, laminin-1, using large numbers of overlapping synthetic peptides (20Nomizu M.

Additionally two other G domain peptides promoted integrin-mediated cell invasion with induction of a tumor cell-specific protease (30Nakahara H. Nomizu M. Akiyama S.K. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J.

Systematic peptide screening is a powerful and logical method for identification of bioactive peptide sequences from multifunctional large molecules such as laminin.Here we describe a systematic peptide screening of the laminin α1 chain (positions 1–2110, not including the G domain) using a large set of overlapping peptides. We examined the cell attachment activities of 208 different peptides by two assay systems at the first stage of screening. Twenty five potential active sequences were identified and further evaluated for integrin binding and cell type specificity.DISCUSSIONPreviously we screened the G domain of the laminin α1 chain and identified several active sites using systematic synthetic peptides (20Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here we describe identification of cell binding sequences from the remainder of the laminin α1 chain (Fig. 8). We prepared 208 overlapping peptides and evaluated their cell binding activity with HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells using peptide-conjugated beads and peptide-coated plates. Eleven of the peptides showed cell attachment on both peptide-conjugated beads and peptide-coated plates. Five peptides showed cell attachment only to peptide-conjugated beads. These peptides may be have less binding ability to plastic plate and/or they cannot form active conformations on the plastic. In contrast, nine peptides including A-208, which contained the previously identified active IKVAV (16Tashiro K. Sephel G.C. Weeks B. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16174-16182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequence, were active only in the peptide-coated plate assay.An N-terminal region of the laminin α1 chain, domain VI, has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and to interact with α1β1 integrin (41Colognato-Pyke H.

We also identified several cell adhesive sequences located on the N-terminal region one of which, A-13, showed strong cell attachment activity that was inhibited by EDTA and by anti-integrin β1 antibody. In addition, several active peptides, including A-13 from domain VI, showed neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth activity. 2S. K. Powell and H. K. Kleinman, unpublished results. This site may be an important biological domain on laminin-1.Several peptides previously reported to be active with certain cells were not active in our screen further confirming cell type specificity within neuronal cells. A YFQRYLI peptide (position 1583–1589) was found previously to promote neurite outgrowth (43Tashiro K. Nagata I. Yamashita N. Okazaki K. Ogomori K. Tashiro N. Anai M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A-144 and A-145 containing a part of the YFQRYLI did not show HT-1080 cell attachment activity. However, when a peptide containing the entire YFQRYLI sequence was prepared, we confirmed it was active for cell attachment with PC-12 (data not shown). Previously an LRE (Leu-Arg-Glu) sequence was found to be active for neuronal cell attachment and neurite outgrowth (44Hunter D.D. Shah V. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 45Hunter D.D. Porter B.E. Bulock J.W. Adams S.P. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A-193 (SLAMLRESPGGM, position 2001–2012) contains an LRE sequence, but this peptide did not show HT-1080 cell attachment activity using the peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated plates. It was also not active with PC-12. The LRE sequence may have cell binding activity specifically for certain neuronal cells. Such cell type specificity has been observed with some of the G domain peptides of laminin-1 (23Richard B.L. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The finding of additional cell type specificity in the remainder of the α1 chain is important. The differences observed cannot be due to coating efficiencies on the plastic or conformation of the peptides since various cells showed differences in attachment with the same peptides. The cell type specificity observed demonstrates unique cellular receptors. There may be specific receptors for each cell type. Alternatively, the observed differences could be the result of differences in the receptor levels and/or affinity to different cell types. Some of the receptors are in the integrin family, which can recognize multiple sequences (47Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar).We have now screened the entire laminin-1 component chains α1, β1, and γ1 using 673 overlapping synthetic peptides (20Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,21Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Song S.-Y. Ponce M.L. Hoffman M.P. Powell S.K. Miyoshi K. Otaka A.

Approximately 11% of the peptides (74 out of 673) were active in either the Sepharose bead assay or the peptide-coated plate assay. Of the peptides active in either assay, approximately a third (28 peptides) or 4% of the total peptides tested were active in both assays. More than half of the active peptides (31 peptides) were localized in the globular domains. The globular domains contain few cysteines and thus are relatively less conformationally stable than either the epidermal growth factor-like repeats located between some of the globular domains in the N termini or the coiled-coil domain located centrally in the α1 chain. The presence of the majority of the cell-binding sites in the globular domains may be due to the less rigid structures of these regions. Our data with the bead assay and the peptide-coated plate assay suggest the importance of conformations regulating cellular interactions. Since the test peptides were attached to the beads in solution versusdried on the dishes, it is likely that different conformations occurred. Inhibition of cell attachment on a laminin-1 substrate by peptides suggests that active sites of A-10, A-13, A-24, and A-25 are available on the intact molecule and that their activity is specific to laminin-1. These results confirm the importance of conformation for cell interactions.It is possible that some active sequences in laminin are always cryptic and are not exposed with different laminin-protein interactions. Such cryptic sites may be active only when laminin is cleaved. Recently, fragments of laminin-5 generated by MMP-9 were found to induce cell migration and tumor metastases (48Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Likewise, certain other proteolytic fragments of some proteins have been found to possess activities not exhibited by the intact molecule. For example, the anti-angiogenesis factors angiostatin and endostatin are fragments of plasminogen activator and collagen XVIII, respectively (49O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

Thus, while some of the active cell binding sequences may be dependent on conformation in the intact molecule, others could be cryptic and only exposed with proteolytic cleavage.

These synthetic peptides have been used to understand the various biological functions of laminin and to develop therapeutic agents. However, biologically functional domains/sequences of laminin-1 have not been fully characterized, since it is a large molecule with complex conformations. Recently, we began a systematic screening of cell binding sequences from the multifunctional molecule, laminin-1, using large numbers of overlapping synthetic peptides (20Nomizu M. Kim W.H.

Some of these G domain peptides have cell type-specific biological activities (22Nomizu M. Song S.Y. Kuratomi Y. Tanaka M. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y.

AG-73, which showed the strongest cell attachment activity among the G domain peptides, promoted neurite outgrowth for some but not all laminin-responsive neuronal cells (23Richard B.L. Nomizu M.

Additionally two other G domain peptides promoted integrin-mediated cell invasion with induction of a tumor cell-specific protease (30Nakahara H. Nomizu M. Akiyama S.K. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J.

Systematic peptide screening is a powerful and logical method for identification of bioactive peptide sequences from multifunctional large molecules such as laminin. Here we describe a systematic peptide screening of the laminin α1 chain (positions 1–2110, not including the G domain) using a large set of overlapping peptides. We examined the cell attachment activities of 208 different peptides by two assay systems at the first stage of screening. Twenty five potential active sequences were identified and further evaluated for integrin binding and cell type specificity. DISCUSSIONPreviously we screened the G domain of the laminin α1 chain and identified several active sites using systematic synthetic peptides (20Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here we describe identification of cell binding sequences from the remainder of the laminin α1 chain (Fig. 8). We prepared 208 overlapping peptides and evaluated their cell binding activity with HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells using peptide-conjugated beads and peptide-coated plates. Eleven of the peptides showed cell attachment on both peptide-conjugated beads and peptide-coated plates. Five peptides showed cell attachment only to peptide-conjugated beads. These peptides may be have less binding ability to plastic plate and/or they cannot form active conformations on the plastic. In contrast, nine peptides including A-208, which contained the previously identified active IKVAV (16Tashiro K. Sephel G.C. Weeks B. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16174-16182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequence, were active only in the peptide-coated plate assay.An N-terminal region of the laminin α1 chain, domain VI, has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and to interact with α1β1 integrin (41Colognato-Pyke H.

O'Rear J.J. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29330-29336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also identified several cell adhesive sequences located on the N-terminal region one of which, A-13, showed strong cell attachment activity that was inhibited by EDTA and by anti-integrin β1 antibody. In addition, several active peptides, including A-13 from domain VI, showed neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth activity. 2S. K. Powell and H. K. Kleinman, unpublished results. This site may be an important biological domain on laminin-1.Several peptides previously reported to be active with certain cells were not active in our screen further confirming cell type specificity within neuronal cells. A YFQRYLI peptide (position 1583–1589) was found previously to promote neurite outgrowth (43Tashiro K. Nagata I. Yamashita N. Okazaki K. Ogomori K. Tashiro N. Anai M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A-144 and A-145 containing a part of the YFQRYLI did not show HT-1080 cell attachment activity. However, when a peptide containing the entire YFQRYLI sequence was prepared, we confirmed it was active for cell attachment with PC-12 (data not shown). Previously an LRE (Leu-Arg-Glu) sequence was found to be active for neuronal cell attachment and neurite outgrowth (44Hunter D.D. Shah V. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 45Hunter D.D. Porter B.E. Bulock J.W. Adams S.P. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A-193 (SLAMLRESPGGM, position 2001–2012) contains an LRE sequence, but this peptide did not show HT-1080 cell attachment activity using the peptide-conjugated Sepharose beads and peptide-coated plates. It was also not active with PC-12. The LRE sequence may have cell binding activity specifically for certain neuronal cells. Such cell type specificity has been observed with some of the G domain peptides of laminin-1 (23Richard B.L. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The finding of additional cell type specificity in the remainder of the α1 chain is important. The differences observed cannot be due to coating efficiencies on the plastic or conformation of the peptides since various cells showed differences in attachment with the same peptides. The cell type specificity observed demonstrates unique cellular receptors. There may be specific receptors for each cell type. Alternatively, the observed differences could be the result of differences in the receptor levels and/or affinity to different cell types. Some of the receptors are in the integrin family, which can recognize multiple sequences (47Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar).We have now screened the entire laminin-1 component chains α1, β1, and γ1 using 673 overlapping synthetic peptides (20Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,21Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Song S.-Y. Ponce M.L. Hoffman M.P. Powell S.K. Miyoshi K. Otaka A.

Approximately 11% of the peptides (74 out of 673) were active in either the Sepharose bead assay or the peptide-coated plate assay. Of the peptides active in either assay, approximately a third (28 peptides) or 4% of the total peptides tested were active in both assays. More than half of the active peptides (31 peptides) were localized in the globular domains. The globular domains contain few cysteines and thus are relatively less conformationally stable than either the epidermal growth factor-like repeats located between some of the globular domains in the N termini or the coiled-coil domain located centrally in the α1 chain. The presence of the majority of the cell-binding sites in the globular domains may be due to the less rigid structures of these regions. Our data with the bead assay and the peptide-coated plate assay suggest the importance of conformations regulating cellular interactions. Since the test peptides were attached to the beads in solution versusdried on the dishes, it is likely that different conformations occurred. Inhibition of cell attachment on a laminin-1 substrate by peptides suggests that active sites of A-10, A-13, A-24, and A-25 are available on the intact molecule and that their activity is specific to laminin-1. These results confirm the importance of conformation for cell interactions.It is possible that some active sequences in laminin are always cryptic and are not exposed with different laminin-protein interactions. Such cryptic sites may be active only when laminin is cleaved. Recently, fragments of laminin-5 generated by MMP-9 were found to induce cell migration and tumor metastases (48Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Likewise, certain other proteolytic fragments of some proteins have been found to possess activities not exhibited by the intact molecule. For example, the anti-angiogenesis factors angiostatin and endostatin are fragments of plasminogen activator and collagen XVIII, respectively (49O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar, 50O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G.

Thus, while some of the active cell binding sequences may be dependent on conformation in the intact molecule, others could be cryptic and only exposed with proteolytic cleavage. Previously we screened the G domain of the laminin α1 chain and identified several active sites using systematic synthetic peptides (20Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A.

An N-terminal region of the laminin α1 chain, domain VI, has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and to interact with α1β1 integrin (41Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y. Carbonetto S.

MLK-3 and other MLK family kinases are characterized by the presence of multiple protein-protein interaction domains including a tandem leucine/isoleucine zipper (LZs) motif. Leucine zippers are known to mediate protein dimerization raising the possibility that the tandem leucine/isoleucine zippers may function as a dimerization motif of MLK-3. Using both co-immunoprecipitation and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we demonstrated that MLK-3 forms disulfide bridged homo-dimers and that the LZs motif is sufficient for MLK-3 homodimerization. We next asked whether MLK-3 utilizes a dimerization-based activation mechanism analogous to that of receptor tyrosine kinases. We found that dimerization via the LZs motif is a prerequisite for MLK-3 autophosphorylation. We then demonstrated that co-expression of Cdc42 lead to a substantial increase in MLK-3 dimerization, indicating that binding by this GTPase may induce MLK-3 dimerization. Moreover, the LZs minus form of MLK-3 failed to activate the downstream target SAPK, and expression of a MLK-3 LZs polypeptide was found to block SAPK activation by wild type MLK-3.

Although it is clear that the MLKs play important roles in transmitting a variety of different signals to the stress-signaling pathway, the mechanisms that directly regulate MLK activity are not well understood. The MLK family consists of two subgroups: the highly related MLK-1 (10Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J.

MLK-2 and MLK-3 bear a number of protein-protein interaction domains including an NH2-terminal SH3 domain, a basic region, a Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding (CRIB) (20Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) region, and a COOH-terminal proline-rich region (see Fig. 1). MLK-1 likely bears the same array of motifs, but to date, only a partial amino acid sequence has been reported for this kinase (10Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DLK/MUK/ZPK and LZK display somewhat more homology to each other than to MLK-1, MLK-2, and MLK-3 but share the characteristic feature of this group of kinases, namely, two leucine zippers carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain. The tandem LZs of MLK-1, MLK-2, and MLK-3 are 68% identical and are separated by a highly conserved spacer region of 13 amino acids (this region is designated as the “leucine zipper-spacer-leucine zipper” region). The LZs of DLK/MUK/ZPK and LZK show even greater homology and are separated by a larger spacer region of 31 amino acids. The fact that all MLK family members bear highly related LZs implies a common role for these motifs in the functioning of these kinases. Leucine zippers are generally defined as a row of 4–7-heptad leucine repeats, although in some cases, the canonical leucine residues are replaced by isoleucine or valine (as in the case of MLK-3) (21Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy studies have demonstrated that leucine zippers form parallel coiled-coil α-helices, which wrap around one another via the hydrophobic interaction of the leucine side chains (22Junius F.K. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Weiss A.S. King G.F. J Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 13663-13667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,23Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Leucine zipper motifs were initially identified in transcription factors and shown to mediate homo- or heterodimerization and play a role in DNA binding (21Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). Leucine zipper motifs have been found subsequently in a wide array of proteins and found to play pivotal roles in regulating the activity of these proteins (24Vrana K.E. Walker S.J. Rucker P. Liu X. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2014-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Barr M.M. Tu H. Aelst L.V. Wigler M. Mol. Cell.

Roberts S.J. Brody B. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4748-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, interactions between leucine zippers are relatively restricted; each leucine zipper binds only one or at most a few such partners (21Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). Secondary structure analyses of the leucine zipper-spacer-leucine zipper region within MLK-3 indicates that this domain forms a “α-helix-loop-α-helix” structure (10Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which appears to be a hybrid of leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix motifs (10Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Vinson C.R. Garcia K.C. New Biol. 1992; 4: 396-403PubMed Google Scholar). Because both leucine zippers and helix-loop-helix motifs have been found to mediate dimerization of some transcription factors, we first asked whether the MLK-3 leucine zipper domain functioned as a dimerization motif. We found that MLK-3 does, in fact, form homodimers via the tandem leucine/isoleucine zipper motif. Because receptor type tyrosine kinases undergo dimerization following ligand binding (29Stock J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 825-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Heldin C.H. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 7-24PubMed Google Scholar), we next addressed whether the activation of MLK-3 is mediated via an analogous dimerization-based mechanism. We show that a constitutively active form of Cdc42 promotes MLK-3 homodimerization and that dimerization via the LZs domain is a prerequisite for MLK-3-induced phosphorylation of SAPK. These data indicate that homodimerization is a critical step in the activation of MLK-3. A schematic of the various MLK-3 expression constructs used in this study is shown in Fig. 1 B. The MLK-3 containing expression constructs pcDNA3 Flag-MLK-3, pcDNA3 HA-MLK, pcDNA3 HA-MLK-3–3-K144R, and pEBG GST-HA-MLK-3 have been described previously (1Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 derived Flag-tagged MLK-3 expression construct lacking the tandem leucine zipper sequences (Flag-MLK3ΔLZs) was generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach. First, a 3′ oligonucleotide (GTGCGGTCGCTCGCGGTCCACCTCGCGCTTCCAGCCTTCCTG) containing sequences flanking both sides of the tandem leucine zipper region and half of a PmlI restriction site, together with a 5′ oligonucleotide (D83: CAAGGCCTCCACCTTCTCTA) were used to generate a MLK-3 cDNA fragment (lacking the two leucine zippers). The resulting DNA fragment was digested with the restriction enzymeHpaI and cloned into the HpaI and PmlI sites of pcDNA3 Flag-MLK-3. The MLK-3 carboxyl-terminal truncation construct of (Flag-MLK-3-ΔC591) was generated by ligating anEcoRI-KpnI MLK-3 cDNA fragment (derived from the pcDNA3-Flag-MLK-3 and including the Flag epitope and NH2-terminal MLK-3 cDNA sequences) into theEcoRI and KpnI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The pCMV-Flag MLK-3 LZs expression construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers that flank the MLK-3 LZs/basic region/CRIB domains, and the sequences encoding both the basic region and the CRIB domain were subsequently removed. The 5′ oligo (TTGAATTCGCCACCATGGAGGAAGGCTGGAA) contained a EcoRI restriction site, a Kozak consensus sequence, and a start codon 5′ to MLK-3 sequence, whereas the 3′ oligo (TTGGATCCTCGAAGACGTTTCTCCT) harbored a BamHI restriction site at the 5′ end. After amplification, the resulting LZ DNA fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into theEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites amino-terminal to the Flag DNA sequence of the pCMV5b Flag vector. The construct was then digested with Pml 1 and BamHI, the BamHI site was “filled-in” using Klenow fragment, re-ligated, and sequenced. All transfection assays were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 293 cells. 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 250 ng/ml fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Montreal, QC), 200 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA). In brief, 100-mm culture dishes containing subconfluent 293 cells were transfected with 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA and 15–40 μl of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 5-h incubation with the DNA-LipofectAMINE mix in OPTIMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), the medium was then replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and harvested as described below. Either 2 or 3 days (see “Results”) after transfection, the 293 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol supplemented with several proteinase inhibitors (50 μg/ml aminoethylbenzenesulfonylfluoride, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin (ICN Pharmaceuticals) together with various phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm β-glycero-phosphate). The lysates were passed three times through a 25G needle, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then used for immunoprecipitation or subjected to affinity purification. For immunoprecipitations, mouse monoclonal M2 anti-Flag antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) or anti-HA antibody (ascitic fluid prepared from 12CA5 cells using standard methods) was added to the lysates for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting immune complexes were collected by adding 30 μl of 0.1 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. GST-tagged MLK-3 or SAPK proteins were affinity purified by incubating the lysates with 100 μl of 50% glutathione 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The proteins bound to either protein A or glutathione-Sepharose were then washed three times with lysis buffer prior to SDS-PAGE or in vitro kinase assay. 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) either with or without the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (final concentration, 200 mm) was added to the immunopurified or affinity purified protein samples. After boiling for 3 min, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.13 m NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl) for 30 min and then incubated with the primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. In addition to the anti-Flag and anti-HA antibodies, in some experiments, rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the MLK-3 SH3 domain 2Y. L. Ing and N. Lassam, manuscript in preparation. and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California) were also used as primary antibody. The membranes were then washed twice for 10 min in TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.14 m NaCl, 3 mm KCl) supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (TBSN) and subsequently incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) in TBSN for 30 min at room temperature. After two 10-min washes, the membranes were incubated with Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrates (Pierce) for 5 min and then subjected to autoradiography. Affinity purified GST-HA-MLK-3 proteins were incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm EDTA. The samples were then boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE. The polyacrylamide gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. To address whether MLK-3 forms homodimers (or oligomers), we initially employed a co-immunoprecipitation approach. For these studies, two different epitope-tagged (Flag and HA) MLK-3 expression constructs were transfected either alone or together into 293 cells. Anti-HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the putative HA-MLK-3-Flag-MLK-3 complexes, and following SDS-PAGE, Western blot analyses were carried out with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody to detect any Flag-MLK-3 bound to HA-MLK-3. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the Flag-tagged form of MLK-3 was detected only when co-expressed with HA-MLK-3, indicating that these two different epitope-tagged forms of MLK-3 do, in fact, co-precipitate. As a control, the same immunoprecipitates were also subjected to Western blotting with anti-HA antibody to demonstrate that HA-MLK-3 was expressed at similar levels in both the single and double transfected cells (Fig. 2 B). The faint band seen in thefirst lane that co-migrated with the HA-tagged form of MLK-3 is a background band that is visible only on prolonged exposure. To show that Flag MLK-3 was expressed at similar levels in all of the transfections, the lysates were also immunoprecipitated and Western blotted using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 2 C). We obtained essentially identical data when the converse experiment was carried out; that is, when anti-Flag antibody used for immunoprecipitation and anti-HA antibody for Western blotting (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies are highly specific and that MLK-3 forms oligomers when over-expressed in 293 cells. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE can be used to demonstrate the presence of disulfide linked dimers (31Chan J.L.K. Lai M. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 146-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,32Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G., Yu, G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, the disulfide bonds of these protein dimers are preserved and can be detected as protein complexes migrating at approximately twice the size of the corresponding monomeric form. To establish whether MLK-3 forms dimers (or other oligomeric forms) stabilized by disulfide bonds, we first expressed the full-length Flag-tagged form of MLK-3 in 293 cells. Three days after transfection, the Flag-MLK-3 protein was immunoprecipitated and separated via SDS-PAGE in either the presence or the absence of the reducing agent DTT. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in the presence of DTT, MLK-3 migrated solely as a monomer of 105 kDa. However, in the absence of DTT, both monomeric and dimeric forms (of approximately 220 kDa) of MLK-3 were observed. Although these data imply that a substantial fraction of MLK-3 protein, when over-expressed in cells, exists in the form of dimers stabilized by disulfide bridges, it remained possible that MLK-3 formed heterodimers with an unknown protein of similar size and thus migrated as an apparent homodimer. To examine this possibility, an expression construct encoding a COOH-terminal truncated form of MLK-3, containing the LZs and CRIB regions but lacking amino acids 591–847 (designated as Flag MLK-3ΔC591 (Fig. 1) was generated and used in similar nonreducing SDS-PAGE experiments. If, in fact, MLK-3 forms homodimers in vivo, it follows that the truncated form of MLK-3 will form dimers twice the size of the monomeric form. However, if MLK-3 heterodimerizes with another protein similar in size to that of the wild type MLK-3, the resulting dimer would be of intermediate size. As shown in Fig. 3 B, under reducing conditions, this truncated form of MLK-3 migrated only as monomer of approximately 65 kDa. However, under nonreducing conditions, MLK-3ΔC591 migrated both as a monomer and as a dimer of approximately 130 kDa (i.e. twice the size of the monomeric form). These data indicate that MLK-3 does, in fact, form disulfide-bridged homodimers and that the COOH terminus (amino acids 591–847) of MLK-3 is not required for either dimerization or disulfide bond-mediated interactions. Having demonstrated that MLK-3 forms homodimers, we next investigated whether MLK-3 homodimerizes via the LZs motif. For these studies, we used polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis to generate an MLK-3 mutant lacking just the LZs region (amino acids 403–462; Fig. 1 B) designated as MLK-3ΔLZs. We again used a co-immunoprecipitation approach to test whether the LZs minus form of MLK-3 would form a dimer with wild type MLK-3. Flag-tagged full-length MLK-3 was expressed in 293 cells, either alone or together with either the wild type or leucine zipper minus forms of HA-MLK-3. As shown in Fig. 4 A, wild type Flag-MLK-3 was readily detected when co-expressed with the HA-MLK-3 but was not observed in co-transfections with the ΔLZs form of HA-MLK-3. Western blotting with anti-HA antibody confirmed that both HA-MLK-3 and HA-MLK-3ΔLZs were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4 B). The lysates were also subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using anti-Flag antibody to establish that wild type Flag MLK-3 expressed at similar levels in both the single and double transfections (Fig. 4 C). To corroborate these observations, a MLK-3 cDNA fragment containing the LZs region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, subcloned into the pCMV5b-Flag vector (designated as Flag-MLK-3-LZs; Fig. 1) and used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments designed to establish whether the MLK-3 LZs motif could itself associate with the wild type HA-MLK-3. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the LZs region readily formed complexes with the full-length form of MLK-3. Together with the data shown in Fig. 4, these data establish that the LZs motif is both necessary and sufficient for MLK-3 homodimerization. We next addressed whether, as is the case with receptor type tyrosine kinases, MLK-3 autophosphorylation requires prior homodimerization or whether the converse is true. In an effort to establish the order of these events, two different epitope-tagged (Flag and HA) MLK-3 kinase dead (K144R) expression constructs were generated and used in co-immunoprecipitation studies. If catalytic activity is a prerequisite for MLK-3 dimerization, the kinase dead version of MLK-3 would fail to complex with the catalytically inactive form of MLK-3; alternatively, if MLK-3 dimerization occurs prior to autophosphorylation, the kinase inactive MLK-3 will be dimerize and co-immunoprecipitate. The HA-tagged K144R version of MLK-3 was expressed either alone or together with either the Flag-tagged wild type or kinase dead forms of MLK-3. As shown in Fig. 6 A, HA-MLK-3 (K144R) co-precipitated with both kinase dead and wild type Flag-MLK-3. The fact that kinase inactive forms of MLK-3 can readily dimerize implies that dimerization of MLK-3 takes place prior to autophosphorylation. Because MLK-3 kinase activity does not appear to be required for dimerization, we hypothesized that dimerization of MLK-3 might be an obligatory prerequisite for MLK-3 autophosphorylation activity. To test this hypothesis, we used GST-tagged wild type and leucine-zippers deleted forms of MLK-3 kinase in a series of in vitro kinase assays. In brief, if MLK-3 dimerization leads to autophosphorylation activity, the LZs region minus form of MLK-3 will exhibit no autophosphorylation activity; alternatively, if dimerization is not required for MLK-3 autophosphorylation, then MLK-3 protein lacking the LZs motif should display autophosphorylation activity. After transfection into 293 cells, the resulting GST fusion proteins were affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with]γ-32P]ATP and Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 7, although both the leucine-zipper minus and wild type forms of MLK-3 were expressed at similar levels, the wild type MLK-3 displayed substantially more autophosphorylation activity, indicating that the LZs motif is, in fact, required for this activity. The findings described above indicate that MLK-3 homodimerizes via the LZs motif and that dimerization is a prerequisite for autophosphorylation activity. We next studied the upstream events leading to MLK-3 dimerization. Burbelo et al. (20Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) identified a binding motif (CRIB) within the MLK-3 sequence that interacts with Cdc42 but not RhoA. Because MLK-3 is known to be a downstream target of Cdc42, it seemed reasonable to propose that Cdc42 could induce MLK-3 dimerization. Accordingly, MLK-3 was expressed either alone or together with either a constitutively active (V12) or a dominant negative (N17) form of Cdc42 in 293 cells. Because the level of MLK-3 that exists in dimeric form (relative to the monomers) tends to increase over time and is maximal 3 days after transfection, for these studies the cells were harvested 2 days after transfection in an effort to highlight the change in MLK-3 dimerization induced by Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 8 A, very low levels of MLK-3 dimers were observed when MLK-3 was expressed either alone or together with Cdc42 N17. However, in the presence of Cdc42 V12, a substantial increase in the level of MLK-3 dimers was observed. Moreover, these data may explain, at least in part, why low levels of MLK-3 dimers can be detected in the absence of the co-expressed Cdc42 V12; endogenous Cdc42 may itself be sufficient to activate a fraction of the MLK-3 protein produced after the transfection with MLK-3 expression constructs. As a negative control, a constitutively active form (V14) of RhoA was co-expressed with MLK-3, which as expected, had no effect on the level of MLK-3 dimers (data not shown). Thus, constitutively active Cdc42, but not RhoA, results in MLK-3 dimerization, indicating that the induction by Cdc42 is highly specific. To rule out the possibility that Cdc42 induces MLK-3 heterodimerization with another protein of similar size, the COOH-terminal truncation construct (Flag-MLK-3ΔC591) was used in parallel experiments. This construct, which bears both the CRIB and LZs regions, was expressed either alone or together with the Cdc42 V12. As shown in Fig. 8 B, in the presence of Cdc42v12, there was an increase in the Flag-MLK-3ΔC591 dimers corresponding to twice the monomeric size, indicating that constitutively active Cdc42 induces MLK-3 homodimerization. In the experiments just described, we demonstrated that expression of Cdc42, an activator of the stress-responsive pathways upstream of MLK-3, resulted in increased MLK-3 dimerization. These findings are consistent with the notion that dimerization is a crucial step leading to MLK-3 activation. Previous studies by others and ourselves have demonstrated that MLK-3 activates the SAPK pathway by phosphorylating SEK1. To verify that dimerization via LZs is a prerequisite for MLK-3-mediated SAPK activation, two different co-expression studies were conducted. Firstly, we sought to demonstrate that the LZs minus form of MLK-3 was incapable of inducing SAPK phosphorylation. Secondly, we examined whether expression of a polypeptide (MLK-3-LZs), corresponding to just the LZs region of MLK-3, would block SAPK phosphorylation by competitively inhibiting the dimerization of the wild type MLK-3. In the first set of experiments, GST-SAPK was expressed either alone or together with the wild type or LZs minus forms of HA-MLK-3. Two days after transfection, affinity purified GST-SAPK was Western blotted using either anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody to identify phosphorylated SAPK or anti-GST antibody to evaluate the expression levels of SAPK. As shown in Fig. 9 A, SAPK was phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) when co-expressed with wild type MLK-3. However, in the presence of the LZs minus form of MLK-3, we could find no evidence of SAPK tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the MLK-3 LZs motif is required for MLK-3 activation of SAPK. In the second set of experiments, we again employed co-expression assays. The GST-SAPK, HA-MLK-3, and Flag-MLK-3LZs expression constructs were co-transfected into 293 cells, and the resulting GST-tagged SAPK was affinity purified and Western blotted using either anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody or anti-GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 10 A, SAPK was phosphorylated only when co-expressed with wild type MLK-3. Notably, however, the MLK-3-LZs polypeptide completely blocked SAPK phosphorylation induced by the wild type MLK-3. Because MLK-3 LZs polypeptide heterodimerizes with the full-length form of MLK-3 (Fig. 5), taken together these observations indicate that the MLK-3-LZs polypeptide inhibits the full-length MLK-3 from forming active homodimers and thereby blocking activation of SAPK. In this report, we sought to define the mechanism of MLK-3 activation using the dimerization model of receptor tyrosine kinases as our prototype. Although MLK-3 is a nonreceptor type serine/threonine kinase, it contains an unusual tandem leucine/isoleucine zipper region, which is a hybrid of two dimerization motifs (namely the leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix motifs). Accordingly, we first asked whether this tandem leucine/isoleucine zipper region served as a dimerization motif. We found that MLK-3 readily forms homodimers that are stabilized by disulfide bonds and that the leucine zipper region is both necessary and sufficient for this interaction. These data indicate that the tandem leucine zipper motif of MLK-3 is, in fact, a dimerization motif. We next investigated whether, as is the case with receptor tyrosine kinases, the transition from monomer to dimer plays a role in the regulation of MLK-3 activation. Specifically, we hypothesized that binding of an upstream activator to MLK-3 would result first in dimerization, which in turn would lead to autophosphorylation and subsequent activation. We present here several lines of evidence indicating that MLK-3 activation is mediated in this manner: 1) MLK-3 bears a GTPase-interacting (CRIB) binding motif and has been shown to bind Cdc42 (but not Rho) in a GTP-dependent manner, indicating that MLK-3 is a downstream target of this GTPase (4Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). We found co-expression of a constitutively active form of Cdc42 but not dominant negative Cdc42 or constitutively active RhoA, to increase markedly MLK-3 dimerization. 2) To address whether autophosphorylation of MLK-3 occurs before or after dimerization, we evaluated a catalytically inactive form of MLK-3 and found this variant to form dimers as readily as the wild type MLK-3, suggesting that autophosphorylation of MLK-3 occurs after dimerization. In agreement with these findings, we were also able to show that the leucine zipper minus form of MLK-3 lacks autophosphorylation activity. Moreover, it is likely that MLK-3 autophosphorylation is trans (rather than cis), because hetero-duplexes comprised of wild type MLK-3 and the polypeptide corresponding to the MLK-3 LZs region failed to activate SAPK via SEK1. 3) Because MLK-3 is a potent activator of the SAPK/JNK pathway, we used the leucine zipper minus form of MLK-3 to establish whether dimerization of MLK-3 is required for MLK-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. In contrast with the wild type form of MLK-3, we found no evidence of SAPK/JNK phosphotyrosine in the presence of the MLK-3 variant lacking the leucine zipper region. On the basis of the data shown here, we propose a model for MLK-3 activation (illustrated schematically in Fig. 11) that parallels the mechanism of receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Upstream activators such as Cdc42 induce MLK-3 homodimerization. This brings about the juxtaposition of the two catalytic domains and subsequent autophosphorylation. The active MLK-3 dimer in turn phosphorylates SEK1, ultimately leading to the activation of SAPK/JNK. MLK1 and MLK2 also bear tandem leucine zippers that are closely related to the MLK-3 LZs, and thus it is likely that these MLK kinase family members also form homodimers. Because LZs may also mediate heterodimerization between two dissimilar proteins, it is also possible that MLK-3 forms heterodimers with MLK-1 and/or MLK-2. In this regard, we have used co-immunoprecipitation assays and found that MLK-2 and MLK-3 will, in fact, form heterodimers (data not shown). Although the expression of MLK-1 and MLK-2 is more restricted than that of MLK-3, some tissues are likely to contain at least two, and in some cases all three, of these kinases. Accordingly, heterodimerization between different MLK family members might result in the production of various dimeric forms with distinct functions and may be one means by which a relatively small number of MLK kinases could mediate signals from a wide variety of different signaling cascades. Finally, it should be noted that like MLK-3, MLK-1, 3N. Lassam, unpublished observations. and MLK-2 also bear a CRIB domain, and recently, Nagata et al. have reported that MLK-2 interacts with the GTP bound forms of both Cdc42 and Rac1 (33Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that small GTPase-induced dimerization may also regulate the activity of MLK-1 and MLK-2. Among the MLK subfamily members, DLK has been shown to form disulfide-linked homodimers (32Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G., Yu, G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tanaka and Hanafusa (7Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that DLK will form complexes with MLK-3 and that a kinase inactive form of DLK will suppress MLK-3-mediated activation of JNK/SAPK. Although the mechanism underlying the interaction between MLK-3 and DLK was not established by Tanaka and Hanafusa, we speculate that DLK and MLK-3 heterodimerize via their respective LZs motif and that heterodimers comprised of a catalytically inactive form of DLK bound to MLK-3 are inactive; that is, in the absence of trans-phosphorylation, MLK-3 will not activate downstream targets. Dimerization also appears to play a role in the activation of another serine/threonine MAPKKK, namely Raf. Following activation by Ras, Raf clusters at the plasma membrane and thus becomes accessible to other membrane kinases (34Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 35Morrison D.K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whether Raf is activated via autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by other membrane kinases is not clear. However, both Farrar et al. (36Farrar M.A. Alberol-Ila Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and Luo et al. (37Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that artificially induced oligomerization of Raf is sufficient to induce its activation. Because both MLK-3 and Raf can be activated by small GTPases, it is possible that Cdc42 also recruits MLK-3 to the plasma membrane and initiates MLK-3 dimerization either by inducing conformational change or by increasing the local concentration of MLK-3 protein. Indeed, it is tempting to speculate that dimerization following membrane localization might serve as a common means of MAPKKK activation. We are indebted to Drs. B. Zanke, P. Marsden, and Y. L. Ing for constructive criticism in the preparation of this paper. We also thank M. Symons for the Cdc42 and RhoA expression plasmids, F. Kiefer for the wild type and kinase-incative Flag-MLK3 expression constructs, and M. Tyers for the anti-HA antibody and hybridoma cell line. Finally, the technical assistance of M. Shennan is greatly appreciated."

https://openalex.org/W2115340713,"Graded activity of the DPP signaling pathway is critical for specification of dorsal embryonic cell fates in Drosophila. We present evidence that a second BMP ligand, SCW, potentiates DPP activity. Using dominant-negative forms of the type I receptors SAX and TKV, we demonstrate that SAX mediates the SCW signal, while TKV is required for both DPP and SCW activity. We find that while DPP/TKV signaling is obligatorily required, SCW/SAX activity is necessary but not sufficient for dorsal patterning. SAX and TKV act synergistically, suggesting a mechanism for integration of the SCW and DPP signals. Further, we show that the extracellular protein SOG can antagonize SCW, thus limiting its ability to augment DPP signaling in a graded manner."

Large conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ (MaxiK)1channels are sensitive to both the transmembrane potential and to the internal calcium concentration ([Ca2+]). The probability of finding these channels in the open state increases with positive potentials or with increments of [Ca2+] (1Toro L. Wallner M. Meera P. Tanaka Y. News Physiol.

One of the most remarkable features is that MaxiK channels also contain the S4 common motif, a structure with a repeated triple sequence of one positively charged amino acid (arginine or lysine) plus two hydrophobic amino acids (4Atkinson N.S.

We have recently shown that MaxiK channels possess an intrinsic voltage sensor whose rearrangement triggered by voltage induces measurable gating currents (27Stefani E. Ottolia M. Noceti F. Olcese R. Wallner M. Latorre R. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5427-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both charge movement and pore opening are facilitated by [Ca2+] > 100 nm (26Meera P. Wallner M. Jiang Z. Toro L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Stefani E.

We examine here the contribution of individual charged residues of the S4 region to the voltage dependence and Ca2+ sensitivity of a cloned human MaxiK channel, hSlo, using site-directed mutagenesis. We conclude that: (a) the S4 region in the hSlo channel is part of the voltage sensor; (b) for all the S4 mutants tested only two charged amino acid residues appear to modify the limiting slope of the probability of openingversus voltage curves; (c) for all S4 mutants, there is a [Ca2+] region (≤100 nm) in which channel activity becomes independent of the [Ca2+]. We performed an analysis of the half-activation voltages-[Ca2+] data for the WT hSlo and the S4 mutant channels using a gating scheme drawn from the Monod-Wyman-Changeaux (MWC) model for allosteric proteins (28Cox D.H. Cui J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 257-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The model describes the data reasonably well and indicates that shifts in the P o-V curves along the voltage axis induced by the mutations in the S4 domain are due to stabilization of the open configuration and to a decrease in the coupling between Ca2+ binding and channel opening. All experiments were performed on the high conductance, calcium-dependent K+ channel, hSlo, cloned from human myometrium (11Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar). Channels were expressed from hSlo cDNAs starting from the third Kozak consensus sequence (M3). Constructs contained as 5′-untranslated region, 86 base pairs upstream M3 of hSlo or 223 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region from Shaker H4. S4 mutations were carried out on the latter version that also contained a poly(A) tail at the 3′-end and results in a higher level of expression (27Stefani E. Ottolia M. Noceti F. Olcese R. Wallner M. Latorre R. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5427-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the polymerase chain reaction, based on the four-primer strategy (29Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar, 30Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). After DNA amplification, sequencing checked the presence of mutations. Wild type and S4 mutant RNAs of hSlo were in vitro transcribed using mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Inc., Austin TX). The protocol used to isolate Xenopus laevis oocytes received institutional approval and followed NIH guidelines. Oocytes (stage V-VI) were treated with collagenase (≈450 units/ml, 60–90 min. at room temperature) in a Ca2+-free medium (OR-2 (mm): NaCl 82.5, KCl 2.5, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, pH 7.6) and then washed five times with ND-96 (in mm: NaCl 96, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, pH 7.6). Twenty-four hours later they were microinjected with 50 nl of 0.01–0.5 μg/μl mRNA in water. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in ND-96 supplemented with gentamycin (50 μg/ml). After the manual removal of the vitellin membrane, macroscopic currents were evoked in membrane patches in the inside-out configuration. Current records were obtained 2–6 days after injection of the oocytes. The pipettes had 1–2 megohm resistances, and no series resistance compensation was used. The error due to uncompensated series resistance was never greater than ∼5 mV. Pipettes were filled with (mm): 110 potassium methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, pH 7.0. The free [Ca2+] in the bath solution, which faces the intracellular side of the membrane in the inside-out patch configuration, was buffered with Ca2+ chelators and calculated with the software CHELATOR (31Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P.R. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-874PubMed Google Scholar). From 10 nm to 3 mm free Ca2+, all of the solutions had (mm): 110 potassium methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, and 5 HEDTA, pH 7.0. The desired free [Ca2+] was set adding concentrated CaCl2 to this base solution. Free [Ca2+] was measured with a Ca2+ electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Solutions with [Ca2+] less than 10 nm were obtained by replacing the corresponding amount of methanesulfonate with 10 mm HEDTA (1.5 nm free Ca2+), 10 mm EGTA (363 pm free Ca2+), 70 mm EGTA (52 pm free Ca2+), 10 mm EDTA (55 pm free Ca2+), or 70 mm EDTA (8 pm free Ca2+). The current signal was digitized to a frequency equal to 5 times the filter cutoff frequency. The acquisition and basic analysis of the data were performed with pClamp 6.0 software (Axon Instrument, Inc.). To obtain the maximum conductance, G max, membrane patches were stimulated with rectangular voltage pulses and steady-state I-V curves were constructed. Conductance (G) versus voltage relationships were obtained from the relation G =I/(V −E K ) where I is the measured K+ current and E K is the K+ equilibrium potential. The data were well described by a Boltzmann function of the form Po=G/Gmax=[1+exp(−zeqF(V−V12)/RT)]−1(Eq. 1) where P o is the probability of channel opening, V 12 is the voltage at whichP o = 0.5; z eqis the equivalent gating charge associated with the closed to open transitions, and R, T, and F have their usual meanings. G max, V 12, and z eq were obtained using a non-linear curve fitting procedure. Maximum conductance was an adjustable parameter in those patches in which artifacts introduced by fast Ca2+block and non-linearity of the instantaneous current-voltage relation (32Oberhauser A. Alvarez O. Latorre R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Cox D.H. Cui J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were minimal. This G max was used to fitV 12 and z eq at those [Ca2+] where the determination of G max was unreliable. The validity of this method of determining G max was checked using tail current measurements (33Cox D.H. Cui J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have tested a series of S4 mutants in a quest to find the role of this transmembrane segment in hSlo channels. Fig. 1 shows two possible alignments for hSlo S4 segment. Alignment 2 predicts an hSlo S4 segment with only 3 positive residues (arginines) at 207, 210, and 213, compared with 7 in Shaker K+ channels. We have substituted these positively charged residues of S4 by either neutral (glutamine or asparagine) or negative (glutamate) residues. Other positions, that are basic amino acids in Shaker, are hydrophobic (Leu-204), polar (Gln-216, Gln-222), or acidic (Glu-219) in hSlo. In these positions, the following point mutations were performed: L204R, L204H, Q216R, E219Q and E219K. In alignment 1 (34Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14922-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), residue Arg-201 could also form part of hSlo S4 segment. We have neutralized this residue to glutamine (R201Q). In all the cases tested, mutations in the S4 segment of hSlo produced functional channels. In contrast, in Shaker K+channel neutralization of lysine 374 or arginine 377 produced nonfunctional channels (22Papazian D.M. Timpe L.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

A. 1996; 93: 14922-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the Glu-219 residue forms part of the S4 segment. The effect of five point mutations in the S4 segment on hSlo channel activation is depicted in Figs. 2 and3. In Fig. 2 A, the [Ca2+] was 5.7 μm and the holding voltage was 0 mV. Both R207Q and R207E mutations induce a clear change in activation kinetics of the hSlo channel. In this case currents can be elicited at very negative voltages and all channels are open at −20 mV, a voltage at which less than 10% of the channels are open in the wild type hSlo channel (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 2 B shows that at 103 μm Ca2+, glutamine substitution for arginines 210 and 213 (R210Q, R213Q) results in channels that could be opened only by applying very positive potentials. At this [Ca2+], mutants R210Q and R213Q have half-activation potentials, V 12, of 96 and 98 mV, respectively, while the V 12 for WT channel was –59 mV (Fig. 3 B). It is of interest to compare the effects of mutations R210Q and R210N on the activation curves. For [Ca2+] = 1.2 μm, V 12 of the R210N construct was about the same as the one obtained for the wild type channel (Fig. 3 C). However, the position of theP o-V curve for the R210N mutant relative to the WT channel is a function of the [Ca2+], and this observation will be discussed in detail below. Summarizing, mutations R207Q and R207E produced leftward shifts along the voltage axis of the P o-V curve compared with the wild type channel; R210Q and R213Q induced rightward shifts of theP o-V curve; and mutations L204R, L204H, Q216R, E219Q, and E219K were of minor consequences (TableI).Figure 3Normalized open-state probability (P O) versus voltage curves for WT hSlo and S4 mutants.

A prediction of this model is that a reduction in the number of charges in the S4 segment should lead to a reduction in the number of gating charges (z eq; Equation 1) that determine the slope of the Boltzmann distribution around the half activation voltage. Mutations R207Q, R207E, R210N, R210Q, and R213Q decrease the slope of the P o-V curves (Fig. 3,A–C) by 49, 50, 65, 65, 51, and 59%, respectively (TableI). These results support the notion that the S4 basic amino acids are part of the voltage sensor in hSlo. By contrast, five mutations of the S4 segment did not significantly alter the slope of the P o-V curve: L204H, L204R, Q216R, E219Q, and E219K (Table I). Additionally, the neutralization of the arginine 201, which in alignment 2 (34Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14922-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) is located in the S3-S4 linker, did not change the slope of the P o-Vcurves (Table I). The use of a Boltzmann function to fit theP o-V data assumes a simple two-state model: closed-open. There is compelling evidence that the hSlo channel contain several closed and open states (27Stefani E. Ottolia M. Noceti F. Olcese R. Wallner M. Latorre R. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this case, a fit to theP o-V data using Equation 1 may result in an underestimation of the number of gating charges per channel. The total number of gating charges for channels having an arbitrary number of closed states can be obtained through measurements of gating currents (47Schoppa N.E. McCormack K. Tanouye M.A. Sigworth F.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1712-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, hSlo gating current measurements require large channel expression and an adequate methodology to measure them, and this has been successfully done only recently (27Stefani E. Ottolia M. Noceti F. Olcese R. Wallner M. Latorre R. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5427-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a widely used method to obtain the equivalent number of gating charges for a linear model containing any number of closed states is the limiting slope method (LSM) (48Almers W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 82: 96-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used LSM to further investigate the mutants for which z eq is lower than that of WT. In order to use the LSM, theP o(V) data were plotted as log(P o) versus V (Fig. 4), and theP o values in the range between 0.001 to 0.01 were fitted to the equation Po(V)=cte[exp(zeqlimFV/RT)],(Eq. 2) where z eq lim is the equivalent number of gating charges at very low P o. The LSM was applied to the different S4 mutants used in this study, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Thez eq lim was found to be the same asz eq obtained using Equation 1 for the wild type hSlo channel. Using the LSM, we could only confirm that neutralization of arginines in positions 210 and 213 were able to significantly reduce the number of gating charges directly coupled to the hSlo pore opening (Table I, Fig. 5). The notion that arginine 207 is located outside of the electric field is strengthened by the result obtained with the double mutant R207Q/R213Q. For this mutant, z eq lim was the same as the one found for the single mutant R213Q, suggesting that the neutralization of arginine 207 is unable to reduce the gating charge (Table I).Figure 5Number of apparent gating charges for wild type and S4 mutants hSlo channels.

Each subunit can be in a reluctant (R) or in a permissive (P) state, and only those channels containing the four subunits in the P configuration are conductive. For each subunit, we have the scheme below. KcR⇄R­CaK1(V)⇅⇅K2(V)P⇄P­CaKo SCHEME I K 1(V) and K 2(V) are the voltage-dependent equilibrium constants connecting R and P states with and without Ca2+ bound, respectively, and K c and K o are the dissociation constants for Ca2+ from the R and P configurations, respectively. In the present study, we used the model of Cox et al. (28Cox D.H. Cui J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 257-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) in which four Ca2+ ions bind to the channel and the microscopic dissociation constants depend only on whether the subunit is in the R or P configurations. This model is sufficient to give a good fit to the data obtained with the wild type hSlo and to interpret the S4 mutant results mechanistically. The model predicts that the probability of opening is given by the relation (28Cox D.H. Cui J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 257-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) Po=1/{1+[(1+[Ca]/Kc)/(1+[Ca]/Ko)]4Kl(V)},(Eq. 3) where K 1(V) =exp[(ΔG 0 −z eq FV)/RT] and ΔG o is the free energy difference between the open and closed configuration of the hSlo channel atV = 0 and [Ca2+] = 0. From Equation 3, we find that the voltage at whichP o = 0.5, V 12, is: V12=(ΔGo+RT lnB)/(zF),(Eq. 4) where B = [(1 + [Ca]/K c)/(1 + [Ca]/K o)]4. Notice that when [Ca2+] ≫ K c and K o, B = (K o/K c)4 and when [Ca2+] → 0, B = 1, hence ΔGo=zeqFV12(Ca=0)(Eq. 5) and V12(Ca=0)−V12(Ca=∞)=(4RT/zeqF)ln(Ko /Ko).(Eq. 6) The change in conformational energy difference between open and closed configuration of the channel induced by Ca2+binding, A, is given by the following equation. A=zeqF[V12(Ca=0)−V12(Ca=∞)](Eq. 7) The parameter A can be viewed as a measure of the coupling between Ca2+ binding and pore opening.A is calculated from the ratioK c /K o, which can be obtained fitting the V 12-[Ca2+] data using Equation 4. Fig. 6 Ashows that a fit to the WT hSlo data using Equation 4 is reasonably good in the range of [Ca2+] between 10−12 to 10−4m (cf. Ref. 28Cox D.H. Cui J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen.

In embryos lacking dpp signaling, increasing the level of TKV activity promotes progressively more dorsal cell types, while activation of SAX alone has no phenotypic consequences. However, SAX activity synergizes with TKV activity to promote dorsal development. Functional experiments suggest the two receptors have different ligands: DPP acts through TKV, and SCW acts through SAX. Furthermore, SOG, a negative regulator of this patterning process, preferentially blocks SCW activity. We propose that spatial regulation of the SAX pathway modulates TKV signaling to create positional information over the embryonic ectoderm."

It has been suggested to play a central integrative role in gene regulation. However, little is known about signal cascades that can regulate CBP activity. Here we show that either nerve growth factor (NGF) or cAMP treatment led to enhanced activity of CBP in PC12 cells. The C-terminal glutamine-rich activation domain of CBP was shown to be responsible for induction by NGF and cAMP. NGF-induced enhancement of CBP activity was also observed in protein kinase A (PKA)-deficient PC12 cells, whereas cAMP failed to increase the transcriptional activity of CBP in these cells. Moreover, the specific PKA inhibitor H-89 blocked cAMP-induced but not NGF-induced up-regulation of CBP activity. The up-regulation of CBP transcriptional activity in response to NGF was, however, prevented by the specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/44MAPK) activation, PD98059, which had no effect on the up-regulation induced by cyclic AMP, indicating that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway is specifically involved in the NGF-induced activation of CBP. In addition, expression of a dominant-negative interfering mutant of p42/44MAPK can prevent the NGF-mediated induction of the CBP activity, whereas expression of a p42/44MAPK constitutively active mutant can enhance the transcriptional activity of CBP. These data indicate that activation of the p42/p44MAPK cascade mediates the up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of CBP by NGF, whereas the similar up-regulation induced by cyclic AMP is mediated by PKA activation.

Nerve growth factor (NGF)1 and other members of the neurotrophin family are critical for the survival and differentiation of neurons within the peripheral and central nervous systems (1Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). NGF exerts its growth- and survival-promoting effects on neurons through activation of its receptor TrkA and subsequent initiation of intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately influence the expression of various genes (2Segal A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Several signal transduction pathways have been implicated in mediating the intracellular components of the NGF signal including protein kinase C (3Hama T. Huang K.-P. Guroff G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 86: 1756-1760Google Scholar), the cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKAs) (4Schubert D. Heinemann S. Kidokoro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). One transcription factor that is a key target of the NGF-stimulated signaling pathway is the cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB) protein (6Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

Science. 1997; 227: 1097-1100Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Studies in neuronal cells have defined a number of genes whose transcription is activated by NGF and the cyclic AMP response elements in the promoters of some of those genes including the c-fos and the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide promoters have been shown to be necessary for an NGF response (6Ginty D.D.

Upon exposure of the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, sympathetic neurons and sensory neurons to NGF, CREB becomes phosphorylated at Ser133 (6Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

Interestingly, Ser133 within the kinase-inducible domain of CREB can also be phosphorylated by a number of kinases including cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N.

This phosphorylation stimulates the transcription of cyclic AMP response element-dependent genes in part by inducing interaction of CREB with a second nuclear factor, CREB-binding protein (CBP) (9Chrivia J.C.

Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that in addition to mediating CREB activity, CBP and the related protein p300 also interact with a variety of different transcription factors, including c-myb, c-jun, c-fos, YY1, E2F-1, MyoD, p53, E1A, Tax and components of the basal transcription machinery (for review see Ref.12Shikama N. Lyon J. Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (424) Google Scholar). CBP has been proposed as a bridging protein, bringing together proteins of the RNA polymerase II-dependent basal transcription complex with specific transcription factors (13Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The recent finding that CBP itself has histone acetyltransferase activity (14Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar), suggests that it contributes to transcriptional activation by disrupting repressive chromatin structure. Thus, CBP is a central regulator of gene regulation. Recent studies showed that mutations of the CBP gene cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (15Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C.M. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommem G.B. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J.M. Breuning M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), indicating that CBP is important in cellular differentiation and development. It is interesting to note that CBP functions as a coactivator for many signal-dependent factors. Immunoneutralization studies demonstrated that microinjection of CBP antiserum could block transcription not only from cAMP-responsive promoters but also from those regulated by mitogens and serum (16Arias J.

Indeed, CBP and p300 have been shown to interact with c-jun (16Arias J. Alberts A. Brinde P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In most cases, complex formation with CBP is signal-dependent. CBP might be responsible for cross-talk between different signaling pathways through competition for CBP (20Zhang J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C. Darnell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The involvement of CBP in cellular signaling events impelled us to investigate signal cascades that could modulate the function of CBP. In this study, we observed that upon exposure of PC12 cells to NGF and cAMP, the transcriptional activity of CBP was greatly enhanced. In contrast to cAMP, which up-regulates CBP activity via the PKA pathway, NGF was found to regulate the transcriptional activity of CBP through activation of p42/44MAPK. 2.5sNGF, basic FGF, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, all-trans retinoic acid, and dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) were from Sigma.

The reporter plasmid 5xGal4-E1B TATA-luciferase was obtained from Dr. R. A. Maurer (10Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The expression vectors for the constitutively active MAPKK mutant (SS/DD) and the dominant-negative p42/44MAPK mutant (T192A) were obtained from Dr. J. Pouyssegur (22Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G.

The expression plasmid containing the constitutive active subunit of PKC was a kind gift from Dr. M. Marber and Dr. P. Parker. PC12 cells (23Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4802) Google Scholar) and ND7 cells (24Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were maintained in L15 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 1 mm glutamine. PKA-deficient PC12 cells (25Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were a kind gift from Dr. J. Wagner, were in L15 medium containing 500 μg/ml of active G418. Transient transfections of PC12cells and ND7 cells were performed using the calcium phosphate procedure as described by Gorman (26Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out with 4 × 105 cells/well on six-well tissue culture plates. The amounts of expression plasmids used are indicated in the figure legends. For each transfection a β-galactosidase expression plasmid was used as an internal control. Following calcium phosphate transfections, PC12 cells were glycerol-shocked and incubated for 16 h in media containing 1% horse serum. Cells were then treated with 2.5sNGF, EGF, basic FGF, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, all-trans retinoic acid, and Bt2cAMP for 30 h. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with different protein kinase inhibitors for 1 h before addition of NGF and Bt2cAMP. Cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activities according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). Results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity by using relative protein content as determined by Bradford protein assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). To determine whether the transcriptional activity of CBP is regulated by cellular signal cascades, we used a construct in which the full-length CBP was fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (21Swope D.L. Muller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of CBP demonstrated that CBP, as with other transcription coactivators, lacks a DNA binding domain (9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwala M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Gal4-CBP fusion proteins can activate gene transcription when delivered to a promoter containing Gal4 DNA binding sites (9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwala M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 21Swope D.L. Muller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus the Gal4-CBP construct provides a good template for investigating regulation of CBP transcriptional activity. PC12 cells are derived from a rat pheochromocytoma and respond to a variety of external stimuli in different ways (23Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4802) Google Scholar). This cell line offers a very useful model system for studying gene regulation induced by various cellular signal cascades in cells of neuronal origin. As a first step in identifying which extracellular stimuli can influence the transcriptional activity of CBP, we overexpressed the Gal4-CBP fusion proteins together with a reporter construct containing five Gal4 binding sites and the E1B TATA box (10Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) in PC12 cells and then treated the cells with NGF, EGF, basic FGF, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, all-trans retinoic acid, or Bt2cAMP. As previously reported, Gal-CBP (full-length) stimulated transcription from the reporter gene 6-fold over the basal level. The DNA binding domain of Gal4 (amino acids 1–147) has been shown previously to be inactive in transcriptional stimulation, and this has been confirmed in our studies. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the activity of the Gal4 DNA binding domain was not induced by any extracelluar stimuli tested, indicating that any change of the transcriptional activity observed with the Gal4-CBP fusion proteins is due to the CBP portions. Treatment with growth factors including NGF, basic FGF, and EGF up-regulated the transcriptional activity of the full-length CBP with the strongest effect being observed with the NGF treatment (Fig. 1). Enhancement of the transcriptional activity of Gal4-CBP (full-length) protein was also observed upon cAMP and retinoic acid treatment. However, the transcriptional activity of CBP was not induced by treatment with cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. When we substitute the CBP C-terminal activation domain (amino acids 1678–2441 fused to Gal4) for full-length CBP in this experiment, none of the up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of CBP was lost in response to NGF, FGF, EGF, cAMP, and retinoic acid. In fact, a stronger effect was observed with the C-terminal domain. This indicates that the C-terminal region (amino acids 1678–2441) of CBP contains sufficient information to be fully induced by these factors (Fig. 1). In contrast, the N-terminal activation domain of CBP (amino acids 1–460) showed no significant activation by any of the stimuli tested, indicating that it cannot mediate these effects (Fig. 1). Although these initial experiments used a NGF concentration of 50 ng/ml, we subsequently observed significant activation of the full-length and C-terminal CBP/Gal4 fusions by 25 ng/ml of NGF (data not shown), and this concentration was therefore used in subsequent assays. The effect of NGF on the CBP activity was not specific to the PC12 cell line because a similar up-regulation was observed with primary dorsal root ganglion neurons, which are responsive to NGF but not dependent upon NGF for survival (28Lindsay R.M. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). This experiment was also carried out in the ND7 cell line, which is derived from dorsal root ganglion neurons and lacks responsiveness to NGF but can respond to cAMP (24Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). cAMP treatment up-regulated the transcriptional activity of CBP (data not shown). As expected, NGF showed no effects in this cell line. We next characterized NGF-activated signaling pathways required to up-regulate the transcriptional activity of CBP. PC12 cells respond to NGF by acquiring a reversible sympathetic neuronal like morphology that is preceded by a cycle of cell division. Several signal transduction pathways have been implicated in mediating the NGF-signaling including PKAs, PKC, and MAPKS (3Hama T. Huang K.-P. Guroff G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 86: 1756-1760Google Scholar, 4Schubert D. Heinemann S. Kidokoro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). To investigate involvement of the PKA pathway in NGF-induced up-regulation of CBP activity, similar experiments were carried out in a PKA-deficient PC12 cell line, in which mutant regulatory subunits of PKA were stably expressed (25Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this cell line is insensitive to stimulation by cAMP because cAMP-signaling is mediated via activation of PKA, which in turn phosphorylates cellular substrates (29Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8443-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, cAMP-induced up-regulation of the CBP activity was blocked in PKA-deficient PC12 cells, whereas NGF-mediated enhancement of the CBP activity was observed in these cells. Similarly, a specific PKA inhibitor, H-89, completely inhibited cAMP-stimulated up-regulation of CBP transcriptional activity but did not have this effect on NGF-induced CBP activity (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, the data suggest that NGF up-regulates the transcriptional activity of CBP via a signal pathway distinct from that activated by cAMP. The binding of nerve growth factor to its receptor is known to induce receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, and the activation of phospholipase C, which in turn activates PKC. We next asked whether activation of PKC is required for NGF-induced enhancement of CBP transcriptional activity. As illustrated in Fig. 3, treatment of PC12 cells with a PKC activator, SC-9, or a selective PKC inhibitor, H-7, did not show significant effects either on NGF-induced up-regulation of CBP activity or on the constitutive activity of CBP. In addition, overexpression of a constitutive active subunit of PKC in PC12 cells failed to stimulate CBP activity. It is known that binding of NGF to its receptor tyrosine kinase activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which is also called MAPK pathway (30Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed three distinct MAPK cascades: p42/p44MAPK, p38MAPK, and stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), also called Jun kinases (31Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trents Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of the p38MAPK signaling pathway in the NGF-mediated up-regulation of CBP activity, we have used the specific p38MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580. As shown in Fig. 4, NGF-mediated up-regulation of CBP activity was insensitive to the presence of SB 203580. Interestingly, in our initial experiments, we have found that the transcriptional activity of CBP is not regulated by stimulation by various cytokines (Fig. 1) whose signals are predominantly mediated by the activation of the p38MAPK and SAPKs. In addition, overexpression of SAPK-1 in conjunction with activation of this kinase by heat shock treatment of the cells at 42 °C for 1 h showed little effect on the transcriptional activity of CBP (Fig. 4). Taken together, these findings indicate that activation of p38MAPK and SAPKs neither up-regulates CBP activity nor mediates NGF-induced enhancement of the transcriptional activity. MAPK cascades channel extracellular signals into specific cellular responses. Activation of p42MAPK (ERK2) and p44MAPK (ERK1) mediate signals in response to growth factors (32Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that a synthetic compound, PD 098059, inhibited specifically the activation of MAPK (p42MAPK) by growth factors in vivo(33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, PD 98059 inhibited NGF-induced up-regulation of CBP transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 50 μM in cell culture media, PD 98059 completely blocked the NGF-induced up-regulation of CBP activity. In addition, reduction of the basal transcription activity of Gal4-CBP fusion proteins was observed in response to treatment with PD 98059. In contrast, PD 98059 did not show any inhibition of the cAMP-induced enhancement of CBP activity (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that activation of p42MAPK is involved in the NGF-induced up-regulation of transcriptional activity of CBP but not cAMP-mediated activation. To investigate the role of p42/44MAPK in the regulation of CBP activity more directly, we used previously characterized expression constructs to modulate either positively or negatively the p44MAPK activity (22Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 6 A, the NGF-mediated up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of CBP was blocked by expression of dominant-negative p44MAPK (MAPKK1T192A). In addition, overexpression of a constitutively activated mutant of MAPK kinase (MKK1-SS/DD) led to up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of Gal4-CBP fusion proteins (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these data indicate that activation of the p42MAPK/p44MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role in mediating NGF-induced up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of CBP. Thus, it is clear that the activation of the p42/p44MAPKpathway is responsible for NGF-induced up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of the full-length CBP and the C-terminal activation domain of CBP (amino acids 1678–2441). To localize regions in the C-terminal activation domain of CBP that mediate NGF-induced up-regulation, we used a series of smaller Gal-CBP chimera constructs spanning the C-terminal region (amino acids 1678–2441). In addition, two other CBP N-terminal regions (amino acids 227–460 and amino acids 721–1678) were also tested in this experiment. As illustrated in Fig. 7, two of these chimeras containing smaller C-terminal regions: Gal-CBP (amino acids (1961–2039) and Gal-CBP (amino acids 2060–2179) were each able to mediate a 7-fold increase in transactivation in response to NGF, whereas a much smaller effect or no effect at all was observed with the other C-terminal and N-terminal fragments. Hence the response to NGF can be mediated independently by two short regions of the C terminus that contain the two previously characterized C-terminal activation domains (21Swope D.L. Muller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The specific MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 completely blocked NGF-induced up-regulation of transactivation by these two smaller activation domains (Fig. 8). Similarly, NGF-induced up-regulation of either domain was also inhibited by overexpression of dominant-negative p44MAPK (MAPKK1T192A) (Fig. 8). These data indicate that NGF can up-regulate the transcriptional activity of different C-terminal activation domains of CBP through activation of the p42/p44MAPK pathway.Figure 8Activation of the p42/p44MAPKpathway mediates up-regulation of activity of two smaller CBP C-terminal activation domains by NGF in PC12 cells.

The specific MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μM) was added 1 h before addition of NGF (25 ng/ml).

It is well known that CBP is a transcription coactivator for a number of different transcription factors (for review see Ref. 12Shikama N. Lyon J. Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Fusion of the CBP cDNA to a heterologous DNA binding domain demonstrates that CBP contains potent transcriptional activation domains (9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwala M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). This transcriptional activity has been demonstrated to reside in the C-terminal region of the molecule. Here we show that transactivation mediated by the C-terminal activation domain of CBP (amino acids 1678–2441) can be up-regulated by NGF as well as by cAMP. The finding that cAMP can stimulate CBP activity is in accord with a previous study demonstrating that overexpression of PKA in the cells enhanced the transcriptional activity of CBP (9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwala M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that NGF can regulate CREB activity by inducing phosphorylation of CREB and interaction with CBP (6Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwala M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). However, regulation of CBP activity in response to NGF was not reported before. We have demonstrated here that NGF up-regulates the transcriptional activity of CBP via a signal pathway distinct from the cAMP pathway (PKA-dependent pathway). Furthermore, activation of PKC, p38MAPK, and Jun kinases are unlikely to be involved in the up-regulation of CBP activity. In contrast to cAMP, which up-regulates CBP activity via the PKA pathway, NGF was shown to up-regulate the transcriptional activity of CBP via activation of the p42/p44MAPK pathway. Nakajima et al. (34Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) have observed that NGF can induce formation of the pp90rsk-CBP complex and NGF-mediated activation of the c-fos promoter requires interaction of CBP with pp90rsk. It has been suggested that the pp90rsk-CBP complex, which appears to be essential for induction of NGF-responsive gene, may function via inducing a productive interaction between CBP and serum response element binding proteins (34Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pp90rsk is a component of a Ras-MAPK signaling pathway that mediates NGF signaling (20Zhang J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C. Darnell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15092-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We report here that another component of the ras-MAPK signal pathway, p42/p44MAPK, can functionally interact with CBP and mediate NGF-induced up-regulation of the transcriptional activity of CBP. Our results indicate that the functional interaction of p42/p44MAPK with CBP occurs through several distinct sites within amino acids 1961–2039 and 2069–2179 of CBP, whereas pp90rsk has been shown to interact with amino acids 1805–1891 of CBP (34Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Most commonly, regulation of transcription factor activity by extracellular signals is achieved by reversible phosphorylation (35Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Thus, NGF regulates CBP activity, possibly through stimulating CBP phosphorylation by activated p42/p44MAPK and pp90rsk in cells. It is possible that interaction between CBP and pp90rsk leads to phosphorylation of CBP, which in turn induces the interaction between CBP and other proteins. However, the region of CBP that interacts with pp90rsk is localized to the region of amino acids 1805–1891, which does not contain the pp90rsk consensus phosphorylation site (Ser1772) (34Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that formation of the pp90rsk-CBP complex may induce phosphorylation of CBP at Ser1772. Whatever the effect of formation of the pp90rsk-CBP complex on CBP, it is possible that functional interaction between p42/p44MAPK with CBP may stimulate CBP phosphorylation. Indeed, several potential MAPK recognition sites are present in the C-terminal region (amino acids 1678–2441) of CBP. In addition, we found that transactivation mediated by two smaller CBP C-terminal regions (amino acids 1961–2039 and 2060–2179) was up-regulated by activation of p42/p44MAPK in response to NGF treatment, suggesting that phosphorylation can occur at different sites throughout the C-terminal region. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that two adjacent C-terminal regions of CBP can be phosphorylated by MAPKsin vitro (36Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further mapping is currently underway to precisely determine the sites that are phosphorylated by MAPKs. Studies have revealed that phosphorylation of a number of transcription factors at specific phosphoacceptor sites located within their activation domains correlates with increased transcriptional activity (for review see Ref. 37Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). It was postulated that phosphorylation of activation domains induces conformational changes, which facilitates their interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery (or coactivator proteins) or decreases their interaction with corepressors. The C-terminal activation domain of CBP has been demonstrated to interact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery such as TFIIB (11Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) and the RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex as well as the transcriptional co-activator p/CIP (38Kee B.L. Arias J. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (Nature 376, 348–351): 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 39Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamel Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). These interactions may be regulated by CBP phosphorylation. It will be of interest to determine whether NGF, which up-regulates the transcriptional activity of CBP, enhances these interactions. NGF and FGF cause PC12 cells to differentiate to a sympathetic-like neuronal phenotype through the MAPK signal pathway (5Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar), whereas the EGF induces proliferation instead of differentiation, but the EGF receptor also activates MAPK signaling (40Qiu M-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 937-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising to see that FGF and EGF also up-regulate the transcriptional activity of CBP. Presumably, like NGF, FGF and EGF enhance CBP activity via activation of the p42/p44MAPK pathway. Hence, the transcriptional activity of the CBP C-terminal activation domain can be regulated by various extracellular stimuli including NGF, FGF, EGF, cAMP, and retinoic acid but not by cytokines, indicating that extracellular signals induce specific gene transcription by differentially phosphorylating CBP, which play an active role both in the integration of cellular signal pathways and in activation of gene transcription. CBP, which is initially characterized as a co-activator for genes that are responsive to cyclic AMP (9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwala M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), has been shown to be a general mediator of signal-dependent transcription. In response to various stimuli including cyclic AMP, growth factors, cytokines, stress, steroid and thyroid hormones, or retinoids, CBP associates with a variety of signal-dependent transcription factors including CREB (9Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwala M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), jun (16Arias J. Alberts A. Brinde P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), STATs 1 and 2 (18Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.

Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), respectively. Interaction between CBP and these signal-dependent factors tethers CBP to the promoters of signal-responsive genes, resulting in activation of gene transcription. Our results showed that the transcriptional activity of CBP was regulated differentially in response to different extracellular stimuli. Thus, CBP itself may represent a potential target of various cellular signal cascades as well as a mediator of signal-dependent transcription. The data presented here show that the transcriptional activity of CBP can be up-regulated in response to NGF. This finding indicates that CBP, like its partner CREB, is a key target of the NGF-stimulated signaling pathway. NGF has been shown to induce differentiation of PC12 cells in part by stimulating the transcription of specific genes including c-fos (41Greenberg M. Greene L. Ziff E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14101-14110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CBP has been shown to be essential for transcriptional induction of c-fos by NGF (16Arias J. Alberts A. Brinde P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 34Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our previous study showed that the NGF inducibility of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide promoter is dependent upon the cyclic AMP response element and is associated with the NGF-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133, which in turn induces interaction of CREB with its coactivator CBP (8Watson A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9655-9660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, CBP plays an important role in the activation of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide promoter by NGF via at least two mechanisms. One mechanism is that it is recruited to the promoter via interaction with CREB. Another mechanism is that its transcriptional activity is directly enhanced by the NGF-induced activation of the p42/p44MAPK cascade. We thank Dr. J.

The initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is tightly regulated such that all the DNA is replicated precisely once per cell cycle from a number of discrete replication origins (Refs. 1Cairns J.

The nature of this regulation, however, is not well understood as only a small fraction of proteins involved in this process have been identified. Moreover, with the exception of budding yeast, the DNA sequences that define the origin of DNA replication on chromosomes remain an almost complete mystery in higher eukaryotes. Present knowledge of the control over initiation of DNA replication in an eukaryotic cell is largely based on experiments done in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In this yeast, DNA replication starts from well defined origins, known as the autonomously replicating sequences (6Newlon C.S. Theis J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 3: 752-758Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). An essential, bipartite DNA sequence in all S. cerevisiae replication origins is recognized by the six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC),1 which is itself essential for initiation of DNA replication (7Bell S.P.

The ORC also functions in the control of gene silencing, a function that is, at least partially, separable from the functions in initiation of DNA replication (9Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B.

Proteins homologous to individual subunits of the S. cerevisiae ORC have been identified recently in other yeast species and from animal and plant cells. Orc1p and Orc2p were found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila, Xenopus, and humans, and Orc5p has been identified in Drosophila (24Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B.

More recently, the human Orc4p has been identified and shown to co-immunoprecipitate with human Orc2p (31Quintana D.G. Hou Z. Thome K.C. Hendricks M. Saha P. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28247-28251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of ORC inhibited initiation of DNA replication in aXenopus egg extract, suggesting that ORC is essential for initiation of DNA replication in higher eukaryotes (28Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I.

Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The nature of the DNA sequence specificity for origin function has not been resolved in species other than the budding yeast, but we imagine that characterization of ORC and its interaction with DNA will help clarify this situation. In pursuance of this goal, we sought to identify the protein subunits of ORC from Xenopus and human cells. Monoclonal antibodies against Xenopus Orc1p were made and used for immunoaffinity purification of the presumed, complete ORC protein complex from Xenopus egg extract. The purifiedXenopus ORC was composed of six subunits with molecular masses of ∼110, 68, 64, 48, 43, and 27 kDa. The 110- and 64-kDa proteins were identified previously as the Xenopus Orc1p and Orc2p proteins, respectively. We identified the 43-kDa protein as theXenopus homologue of the yeast Orc4p, and the 48-kDa polypeptide as the homologue of Orc5p. Based on this protein sequence information, cDNAs encoding the human Orc4p and Orc5p were also isolated. The sequences reveal a previously unrecognized structural similarity among the ORC subunits. Mice were injected with bacterially expressed full-length Xenopus Orc1p as described (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Spleen cells from three best-responding mice were used to generate antibody-producing hybridomas, and antibodies were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoprecipitation (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Two deletional mutants of Xenopus Orc1p, ΔN 280 and ΔN 423, were use to map the epitopes of selected antibodies. Antibodies TK1 and TK15 were found to recognize epitopes within the first 280 residues, whereas TK37 and TK47 recognize a protein sequence between residue 423 and the C terminus of Xenopus Orc1p. Polyclonal antibodies against bacterially expressed full-lengthXenopus Orc1p and Orc2p were raised as described in (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-Orc1p monoclonal antibodies TK1, TK15, TK37, and TK47 were covalently coupled to protein A beads (Bio-Rad) using dimethylpimelimidate dihydrochloride (Sigma) as a coupling agent, essentially as described in Ref. 33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar. To perform immunoaffinity purification, antibody-coupled beads were incubated with Xenopus egg extract. The beads were then washed several times with ice-cold purification buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The purified proteins were released by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Two procedures, Edman degradation method and mass spectrometry were used to microsequence the isolatedXenopus peptides. The first procedure was performed essentially as described in (9Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Science. 1993; 262: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Very briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digested with lysyl-endopeptidase (Achromabacter protease I; Wako Chemical). Peptide fragments were subsequently extracted and separated on a Hewlett-Packard HPLC model 1090 using a Vydac C18 column. Separated peptides were sequenced with an automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 494). In the second procedure, the proteins were electroblotted and digested with trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim), and the peptides were extracted with 1:1 v/v formic acid:ethanol (34Sutton C.W. Pemberton K.S. Cottrell J.S. Corbett J.M. Wheeler C.H. Dunn M.J. Pappin D.J.C. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Aliquots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a LaserMat 2000 mass spectrometer (Thermo Bioanalysis) (34Sutton C.W. Pemberton K.S. Cottrell J.S. Corbett J.M. Wheeler C.H. Dunn M.J. Pappin D.J.C. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Additional aliquots were quantitatively esterified using 1% v/v thionyl chloride in methanol and also analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization to provide acidic residue composition (35Mock K.K. Sutton C.W. Cottrell J.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Native and esterified peptide masses were then screened against the MOWSE peptide mass fingerprint data base (36Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The remaining digested peptides (90% of total digest) were also reacted with N-succinimidyl-2(3-pyridyl) acetate to enhance b-ion abundance and facilitate sequence analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (37Pappin D.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 64: 165-173PubMed Google Scholar). Dried peptide fractions were treated with 1% w/vN-succinimidyl-2(3-pyridyl) acetate in 0.5 mHEPES (pH 7.8 with NaOH) containing 15% v/v acetonitrile on ice. The reaction was terminated by the addition of hepta-fluorobutyric acid and an equal volume of water. The solution was then injected onto a capillary reverse-phase column (300 μm × 15 cm) packed with POROS R2/H material (Perseptive Biosystems) equilibrated with 2% v/v acetonitrile/0.05% v/v trifluoroacetic acid running at 3 μl/min. After washing with 10% v/v acetonitrile/0.05% v/v trifluoroacetic acid, peptides were eluted with a single-step gradient to 75% v/v acetonitrile/0.1% v/v formic acid and collected in a single 3–4-μl fraction. The derivatized peptides were sequenced by low-energy collision-activated dissociation using a Finnigan MAT TSQ7000 fitted with a nanoelectrospray source (38Hunt D.F. Yates J.R. Shabanowitz J. Winston S. Hauer C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 84: 6233-6237Crossref Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 39Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Collision-activated dissociation was performed using 2.5 mTorr argon with collisional offset voltages between −18V and −28V. The production spectra were collected with Q3 scanned at 500 amu/sec. A search of the dbEST data base using the BLAST or PSI-BLAST programs (40Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) with either the Drosophila Orc4p sequence (DmOrc4p) 2I. Chesnokov and M. Botchan, personal communication. or the S. cerevisiae Orc4p sequence (ScOrc4p) (14Bell S.P. Mitchell J. Leber J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 83: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), a partial human cDNA clone (accession no. W23942). W23942 was obtained from ATCC, and sequence analysis performed using an ABI automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373). Nested polymerase chain reactions to map the 5′-end were carried out on a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library kindly provided by Dr. Jacek Skowronski at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. A full-length clone was assembled from the polymerase chain reaction fragment and the EST cDNA clone. Two mouse ESTs, AA168456and AA110785, were also identified in data base searches using Scorc4p, DmOrc4p, or peptide MS4–1 from the 43-kDa band as queries. Sequencing analyses revealed a single complete open reading frame (ORF) with significant homology to ORC4 was shared by these two EST cDNA clones, henceforth called MmORC4. A 473-base pair fragment to MmORC4 was also used to identifyXenopus ORC4 using a Xenopus ovary cDNA library (Strategene), a generous gift from Dr. Eva Dworkin at Vienna University). Screening of approximately 60,000 phage plaques was done essentially as described (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease analysis of the two isolated clones revealed that they were derived from the same cDNA. The larger insert (1.6 kilobases) was then sequenced on both strands with Sequenase, version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The dbEST nucleotide sequence data base was searched using the BLAST or PSI-BLAST (40Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) programs for sequences related to the peptide sequences obtained from the Xenopus Orc5p (48-kDa band) or to the S. cerevisiae Orc5p (15Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One partial human EST cDNA clone from Jurkat cells (accession no. AA353934; ATCC) was identified and then sequenced completely. A single nucleotide discrepancy (A162G, numbering from the start of AA353934) was observed between AA353934 and the polymerase chain reaction products derived from amplifying related cDNAs from a teratocarcinoma cDNA library using clonedPfu polymerase (Strategene). The most 5′-terminal ATG codon was tentatively assigned as the initiation codon, the context of which matched with the Kozak consensus for eukaryotic translation initiation (42Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). CSF-arrested extracts were activated by the addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Histone HI-kinase assay was done as described (43Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Phosphatase sensitivity was tested by adding 0.4 units of potato acid phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of phosphatase buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). In the control sample, phosphatase was inhibited by addition of 50 mm NaF. The DNA sequences reported in this paper were submitted to either the EMBL or GenBankTMdata bases, and the accession numbers are as follows: human Orc4p,AF047598; mouse Orc4p, Y16386; Xenopus Orc4p, Y16385; human Orc5p, AF047599. To purify Xenopus ORC, mouse monoclonal antibodies were raised against the recombinant Orc1p subunit (29Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Antibodies were selected on the basis of their ability to immunoprecipitate Orc1p from a Xenopus egg extract under native conditions. We mapped the epitopes of antibodies TK1 and TK15 to the N terminus of Orc1p (residues 1–280) and those of antibodies TK37 and TK47 to the C-terminal half of Orc1p (residues 423–886). These antibodies, together with a control antibody against SV40 large T-antigen (mAb423), were individually coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were then incubated with an interphase Xenopusegg extract (44Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 shows that all four anti-Orc1p mAbs selectively immunoprecipitated a protein corresponding to the size of Orc1p, easily visible by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, whereas the control antibody did not (Fig. 1 A). Five additional polypeptides also reproducibly associated with all four anti-Orc1p antibodies but not with the control antibody (Fig. 1 A, arrows). Immunoblotting the same samples with an anti-Orc1p polyclonal antibody confirmed that the 110-kDa polypeptide was indeedXenopus Orc1p and an anti-Orc2p polyclonal antibody identified the 64-kDa polypeptide as Xenopus Orc2p (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–6). It seemed likely, therefore, that the four proteins that copurified with the Xenopus Orc1p and Orc2p were components of Xenopus ORC. It is striking that the molecular masses of the ORC subunits purified from Xenopuseggs (∼110, 68, 64, 48, 43, and 27 kDa) corresponded closely to those of the ORC purified from Drosophila embryos (∼115, 82, 79, 47, 42, and 30 kDa), whereas the ORC identified in yeast was somewhat different (120, 72, 62, 56, 53, and 50 kDa) (7Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 14Bell S.P. Mitchell J. Leber J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B.

Science. 1995; 270: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Polypeptides that bound specifically to anti-ORC1 antibody TK15 were analyzed by mass spectrometry and the Edman degradation method (Table I). Both methods further confirmed that the 110- and 64-kDa proteins were the previously identified Xenopus Orc1p and Orc2p, respectively (29Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 32Carpenter P.B. Meuller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, a tryptic peptide derived from the 43-kDa band, (R/K)TV(I/L)HGESNSA(I/L)(I/L)(I/L)GPR, was similar to the sequence RTAIYGESNSVLIVGPR translated from a Mus musculus EST,AA110785. Interestingly, an independent search of the dbEST data base using both ScOrc4p (14Bell S.P. Mitchell J. Leber J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 83: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and the DrosophilaOrc4p2 as queries identified another mouse EST, AA168456, as well as a human EST, W23942. Both AA110785 and AA168456 were sequenced completely and were found to contain an identical ORF. This ORF is capable of encoding 433 amino acids closely related to the otherORC4 sequences and is therefore likely to be the mouse homologue. W23942 was also sequenced completely and was found to be lacking the 5′-end. Isolation of the 5′-end using nested polymerase chain reaction led to the assembly of a full-length cDNA, the coding sequence of which was highly related to the yeast, fly, frog (see below and Fig. 2), and mouse Orc4p sequences.Table IMicrosequencing of the Xenopus ORCPeptideMethodPeptide sequence1-aLowercase letters indicate amino acids identified with lower certainty.Corresponding gene productsK28EdmanLTDPHQAYVQILKX1Orc1p, LTDPHQAYVQILK (aa 599–611)1-baa, amino acids; MS, mass spectrometry.K16EdmanNEFISTTX10rc2p, NEFISTT (aa 151–157)K32EdmanVQFTPDEEVLEHIX1Orc2p, VQFTPDEEVLEHI (aa 14–26)K35EdmanLLDQTPSAFADELHRISKX1Orc2p, LLDQTPSAFADELHRISK (aa 256–273)K37EdmanNTASNLVEEYFEAHSSSKX1Orc2p, NTASNLVEEYFEAHSSSK (aa 215–232)K32–5EdmanLSLPASFPDsqFfEkX10rc4p, LSLPASFPDSQFAEK (aa 232–246)K35–5EdmanLQDIYxGexfX10rc4p, LQDIYDGEPF (aa 333–342)K24EdmanxLVELxKX10rc4p, HLVELLK (aa 44–50)K33EdmanaLEDIFGX10rc4p, ALEDIFG (aa 78–84)MS4–1MS(K/R)TV(L/I)HGESNSA(L/I)(L/I)(L/I)GPRX10rc4p, RTVIHGESNSALIIGPR (aa 51–67)MS4–2MS(K/R)Q(L/I)ED(L/I)(F/M)G(F/M)KX10rc4p, KGALEDIFGMK (aa 76–86)K12EdmanNIEPhLKPutative X10rc5p, Hs: NIEPHLK (aa 256–262)K21EdmanrFFLKPutative X10rc5p, Hs: RFFLK (aa 326–330)K24–4EdmanLSAHAHVELPYYSKPutative X10rc5p, Hs: LSAHTHVELPYYSK (aa 294–307)MS5–1MS(K/R)ESQVST(L/I)(L/I)S(L/I)(F/M)GERPutative X10rc5p, Hs: RESQVSILQSLFGER (aa 11–25)MS5–2MS(K/R)TY(L/I)(L/I)QTV(L/I)RPutative X10rc5p, Hs: KTYVTQTLLK (aa 43–52)MS5–3MS(K/R)TVL(F/M)D(L/I)VRPutative X10rc5p, Hs: RTVNFDIIK (aa 421–429)MS5–4MS(K/R)GHTVS(L/I)N(F/M)(L/I)RPutative X10rc5p, Hs: KCTVSLDFIR (aa 408–417)1-a Lowercase letters indicate amino acids identified with lower certainty.1-b aa, amino acids; MS, mass spectrometry. Open table in a new tab A 473-base pair fragment from the mouse ORC4 cDNA clone was also used to screen a λ-ZAP Xenopus ovary cDNA library. Two identical clones containing a 1.3-kilobase ORF were identified. Importantly, more microsequencing of the 43-kDa polypeptide by both Edman degradation and mass spectrometry subsequently identified peptides (Table I) that showed close matches to the predicted sequence from the cDNA (Fig. 2). Several observations can be made upon aligning multiple Orc4p sequences from human, mouse, frog, and yeast (Fig. 2). First of all, all these sequences share similar lengths and are highly related to each other. A BLAST search comparing HsOrc4p with other sequences in GenBank showed that HsOrc4p is most related to MmOrc4p and XlOrc4p (P= 3.1e-251 for MmOrc4p, and P = 2.0e-204 for XlOrc4p). Not surprisingly, Orc4p from these intimately related organisms (human, mouse, and frog) share higher levels of homology (compare withP = 3.1e-24 for ScOrc4p). Second, multiple blocks of conserved residues can be readily identified. One intriguing feature is a strong match to the nucleotide binding site consisting of both the Walker A and B motifs (45Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). This bipartite putative nucleotide binding site appears to be well conserved among human, mouse, and frog, whereas only a weak match to the Walker A motif, but not to the B motif, is found in ScOrc4p (Fig. 2). It has been postulated that the Walker A motif is involved in ATP/GTP binding, whereas the Walker B motif is involved in ATP hydrolysis (45Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, ScOrc4p has been shown to cross-link ATP in the presence of autonomously replicating sequence 1 and ScOrc1p (46Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, mutations that removed this motif in ScOrc4p showed no gross phenotypic defect. Furthermore, the cross-linking to ATP was completely abrogated when the Walker A motif in Orc1p was mutated, indicating that the Orc4p-ATP binding might have been indirect or that it at least requires a functional ScOrc1p. It is likely that the nucleotide binding motif is nonfunctional in yeast but fully functional in higher eukaryotes due to selection pressure. Further biochemical analysis is necessary to address this question. A data base search identified a human EST clone, AA353934, as a potential homologue of theDrosophila Orc5p (DmOrc5p). This cDNA was sequenced entirely on both strands, and a conceptual translation with the most 5′-terminal ATG as tentative initiation codon revealed an ORF strikingly similar to both DmOrc5p (25Gossen M. Pak D.T.S. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R. Science. 1995; 270: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the S. cerevisiae Orc5p (ScOrc5p; 15); this ORF will henceforth be referred to as HsOrc5p. Others have also identified this same EST clone encoding HsOrc5p (47Ishiai M. Dean F.B. Okumura K. Abe M. Moon K.-Y. Amin A.A. Kagotani K. Taguchi H. Murakami Y. Hanaoka F. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Eki T. Genomics. 1997; 46: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The predicted protein consists of 435 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. Overall, HsOrc5p is approximately 39% identical and 50% similar to DmOrc5p (Fig. 3). It is also 29% identical and 41% similar to ScOrc5p, with the sequence similarity most evident in the C-terminal half of the proteins. Nonetheless, a search of the PROSITE data base failed to identify any recognizable motif in this region. In the N terminus, all three proteins contain a putative Walker A motif, implicating a role of Orc5p in ATP binding. Indeed, ScOrc5p, when complexed with the other ORC subunits, displayed a DNA-independent ATP binding activity that was sensitive to mutations within the consensus (46Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additional evidence supporting a role for this gene product as the human homologue of Orc5p was obtained from microsequencing the 48-kDa band that copurified with XlOrc1p and XlOrc2p. Several peptides were generated from this band (Table I; Fig. 3), all of which displayed extensive similarities to the deduced sequence of HsOrc5p, as well as DmOrc5p and ScOrc5p. Thus, the 48-kDa polypeptide that co-immunoprecipitated with XlOrc1p was most likely to be XlOrc5p. In a survey of primary human tissues using HsOrc5 mRNA as a probe, a single 1.9-kilobase transcript, was detected by Northern blotting in most tissues (data not shown). The size of the HsOrc5 transcript detected in this experiment suggested that the isolated cDNA was likely to be full-length. Intriguingly, HsORC5 mRNA was particularly abundant in testis (data not shown). A bacterial artif"

The occurrence of open reading frames in the 5′ leaders of eukaryotic mRNA molecules is quite rare. These upstream open reading frames (uORFs)1 are found in less than 10% of cloned mammalian mRNAs; however, the small subset of genes that do contain uORFs is strongly biased toward those encoding growth-related products such as growth factors, growth factor receptors, tumor suppressors, and regulated transcription factors (1Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2Morris D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1997: 165-180Google Scholar). It is striking that over two-thirds of the proto-oncogene mRNAs surveyed 10 years ago contained uORFs (5Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). These observations, associating uORFs with regulation of vertebrate cell growth, suggest that these elements of mRNA structure may be involved in aspects of translational control known to be a part of the mitogenic program (2Morris D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For a uORF to participate in translational regulation it must itself be translated, and its translation in turn must suppress, in a regulated manner, translation of the cistron located downstream (2Morris D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Morris D.R. Harford J.B. Morris D.R. RNA Metabolism and Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1997: 165-180Google Scholar). Some uORFs, but not all, strongly suppress translation of the downstream cistron. At least two structural features are known to contribute to the suppressiveness of a uORF in eukaryotic cells, the RNA sequence flanking the termination codon and the amino acid sequence of the encoded peptide (1Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2Morris D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 173-198Google Scholar). In the yeast GCN4 gene, there are two suppressive uORFs in the 5′ leader (6Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). The suppressiveness of theGCN4 uORFs is not determined by the sequence of the encoded peptides but by the G + C content of the RNA sequence surrounding the termination codon (7Grant C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 606-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that stable RNA-RNA interactions in the vicinity of the stop codon may result in suppression of downstream translation. In a second class of suppressive uORFs, referred to as “sequence-dependent uORFs,” suppressive activity depends on the amino acid sequence of the encoded peptide (1Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Examples from this class are limited, but the best studied are in the mammalian AdoMetDC gene (8Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the human cytomegalovirus gpUL4 (gp48) gene (10Schleiss M.R. Degnin C.R. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Degnin C.R. Schleiss M.R. Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5514-5521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both instances, particular missense mutations of the codons at the 3′ end of the uORF abolish inhibitory activity, whereas modifications that retain the wild type amino acid coding information (synonymous mutations) uniformly preserve the suppressive effect of these uORFs. Because the sequence-dependent uORFs seem to act in cis on the ribosome that translated them (9Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Degnin C.R. Schleiss M.R. Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5514-5521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a likely model is that the nascent peptide translated from the uORF interacts specifically with a component of the translation apparatus, such as peptidyltransferase, the peptide channel of the ribosome, or one of the termination factors, to stall the ribosome in the vicinity of the termination codon. The stalled ribosome thereby creates a blockade to further translation of the mRNA (1Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, Cao and Geballe (12Cao J. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have located a ribosome arrested over the termination codon of the wild type, but not mutant, uORF of thegpUL4(gp48) gene. The nature of the interaction between the encoded peptide and its target seems to be of paramount importance in defining the mechanism of inhibition by the sequence-dependent uORFs. The specificity of this interaction has not yet been examined systematically and in detail for any of the sequence-dependent uORFs. It is interesting to note that there is no similarity between the peptides encoded by the uORFs from the AdoMetDC and gpUL4(gp48) genes, implying that there are multiple intracellular targets for these regulatory molecules. In the studies described in this paper, we find that the specificity of this peptide-target interaction is widely conserved in nature, because the sequence-dependent inhibitory activity of the mammalianAdoMetDC uORF is retained when placed in a yeast 5′ leader. Using a yeast expression system as the primary screen, we examine by saturation mutagenesis the range of amino acids that can be substituted in critical positions of the AdoMetDC uORF with retention of suppressive activity. Substitutions of interest were retested in mammalian cells. The results show an exquisite dependence on amino acid sequence in that only aspartic acid is functional at position 4 in the peptide, and only valine will substitute for isoleucine at position 5. These results support the hypothesis of a highly specific interaction between the peptide encoded by the AdoMetDC uORF and its intracellular target. Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to insert wild type and modified uORFs into the 5′ leaders of fusion constructs between the AdoMetDC and GCN4genes and reporter genes. Oligonucleotides (TableI) were designed to create 5′-HindIII and 3′-BglII cohesive ends for insertion into the leaders.

Changes from wild type sequence are underlined. To generate the chimeric constructs between AdoMetDC and human growth hormone (hGH), unique HindIII and BglII sites flanking the uORF were engineered into the 5′ leader of pRS362, which has the AdoMetDC leader, with 47 nucleotides between the 5′ cap and the uORF, upstream of the hGH coding region (13Ruan H.J. Hill J.R. Fatemie-Nainie S. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17905-17910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type uORF was removed by digestion withHindIII and BglII, and double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the desired uORFs were cloned into the HindIII/BglII site. GCN4/lacZ chimeric constructs were made by inserting the double-stranded oligonucleotides between the HindIII and BglII sites of pM128 (14Miller P.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). pM128 is an Escherichia coli/yeast shuttle vector containing the 5′ leader of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae GCN4 gene linked to the E. coli β-galactosidase reporter gene. Digestion of pM128 withHindIII and BglII removes the four wild type uORFs of GCN4. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% calf serum and 100 units of penicillin and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. Stable transformants were selected using HeLa medium supplemented with 400 μg of G-418 (Geneticin; Calbiochem)/ml. After selection, stable transformants were maintained in the presence of 200 μg of G-418/ml. Transient transfection of HeLa cells was performed as described previously (8Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested after 48 h in culture. Assays of hGH accumulation were performed on samples of culture medium as described previously (8Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hGH produced by the cells was normalized to the amount of hGH mRNA in the cells. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blots, using a probe for chimeric hGH mRNA (15Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of HeLa cells was performed by seeding 150-mm dishes with 1 × 106 cells, culturing overnight, adding fresh culture medium (adjusted to pH 7.2 by the addition of 1m Hepes, pH 7.2), and culturing an additional 4 h. Calcium phosphate precipitates were prepared (16Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar) and layered onto the monolayers of HeLa cells. After culturing overnight, the cells were exposed for 4 min to medium containing 15% glycerol, and fresh medium was added for beginning G-418 selection. For analysis of hGH expression, cultures of pooled clones were grown without G-418 for 48 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (2 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4) supplemented with 10% calf serum and replaced with warm preconditioned culture medium. Preconditioned medium was obtained from nontransfected HeLa cultures grown at low density for 16 h. Samples of the medium were removed immediately (T 0) and after culturing for 6 h (T 6). Also at 6 h, the cells were lysed for extraction of RNA. Measurement of hGH protein accumulation (T 6–T 0) and Northern blot analysis were performed as outlined above. GCN4/lacZ chimeric constructs were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain CRY1 (MATa; ade2–1 oc ; can1–100; his3–11, 15; leu2–3, 112; trp1–1; ura3–1) (17Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J.

Greene and Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). Colonies isolated from uracil-deficient synthetic dextrose media were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity, which was normalized to the level of lacZ mRNA (16Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). Levels of lacZ mRNA were determined by RNase protection (18Ruan H.J. Brown C.Y. Morris D.R. Richter J.D. Analysis of mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 305-321Google Scholar) as follows. Total RNA was hybridized to a 200-nucleotide, 32P-labeled antisense transcript, which yielded a 130-nucleotide protected fragment after digestion with RNase A. The digested fragments were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 8 m urea. The dried gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. To normalize for mRNA recovery, Northern blots were hybridized to a 560-base pair pyruvate kinase fragment cloned from CRY1 mRNA by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification and labeled with 32P by random priming (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). The results are reported as the ratio of lacZ mRNA to pyruvate kinase mRNA. Random mutagenesis of the AdoMetDC uORF at codon 4 was performed by annealing a primer 5′-CGTTACGGAAAGATCTA-3′ to 5′-ATCGTATTAAAAGCTTAGTATGGCCGGCNNNATTAGCTAGATCTTTCCGTAACG-3′ and completing the complimentary strand using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The double-stranded fragments containingHindIII and BglII sites were ligated into pM128 digested with HindIII and BglII. E. coli transformants were sequenced using the polymerase chain reaction product sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA was transformed into S. cerevisiae strain CRY1, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described above. Random mutagenesis at codons 4 and 5 were performed as described above, using the same primer with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ATCGTATTAAAAGCTTAGTATGGCCGGCGACNNNAGCTAGATCTTTCCGTAACG-3′ and 5′-ATCGTATTAAAAGCTTAGTATGGCCGGCGACATTNNNTAGATCTTTCCGTAAG-3′. Fractionation of yeast polysomes and isolation of RNA contained in the fractions was carried out using a modification of a published protocol (20Baim S.B. Pietras D.F. Eustice D.C. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-ml cultures in mid-log phase of growth were poured over approximately 75 g of crushed, frozen culture medium, and the mixture was swirled in an ice water bath for 10 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed twice with 10 ml of polysome lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 500 μg of heparin/ml, and 0.2 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate/ml). The cells were disrupted in 1.5 ml of polysome lysis buffer containing 2 g of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) by eight cycles of vortexing for 15 s followed by incubation on ice for 45 s. The lysate was decanted from the beads and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 ×g. The lysate was layered on top of a 7–47% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-40 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. Gradients were separated into 12 equal fractions using a density gradient fractionator model 185 (Isco, Lincoln, NE) while monitoring absorbance at 254 nm. Each fraction was precipitated by adding 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 450 μl of RNA isolation buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% SDS). After the addition of 45 μl of 2 m sodium acetate, the samples were extracted once with water-saturated phenol, once with phenol-chloroform (1:1), and once with chloroform. RNA was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed for β-galactosidase mRNA by RNase protection as described above. Yeast cultures containing the indicated constructs were grown to mid-log phase and sevenA 600 units were washed once with fresh medium and resuspended in fresh medium at A 600 = 1.0. The cells were labeled by the addition of 33 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). After incubation for 60 min with shaking at 30 °C, cultures were poured into centrifuge tubes containing 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm KF and harvested by centrifugation. After washing the cells once in unlabeled medium, cell pellets were resuspended in 700 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA), and an equal volume of 425–600-μm acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) was added. After vortexing for 8 cycles as described above, the lysates were cleared by centrifuging for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant solutions were heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Aliquots from each sample were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Samples containing equal precipitable cpm were diluted in 7 volumes of 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. To each sample 4.4 μg of anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) was added, and the samples were incubated with rocking for 16 h at 4 °C. After continued incubation with 25 μl of PansorbinTM cells (Calbiochem) for 1 h, immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% SDS and twice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of sample buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was fixed in 100% methanol for about 20 min and then treated for about 20 min with 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in glacial acetic acid. After soaking in water for 2 min, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. The sequence-dependent AdoMetDC uORF encodes a hexapeptide with the amino acid sequence MAGDIS (8Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the uORF was present in its natural context, 14 nucleotides from the 5′ cap, it suppressed translation of the associated cistron in T lymphocytes but not in nonlymphoid cell types (8Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the uORF was placed in a position 47 nucleotides from the cap, it suppressed downstream translation irrespective of cell type (13Ruan H.J. Hill J.R. Fatemie-Nainie S. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17905-17910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the influence of sequence on constitutive suppression of translation in the absence of cell-type regulation, the uORF of the AdoMetDC gene was placed 47 nucleotides from the cap using the hGH gene as a reporter (Fig. 1). Constructs with wild type and modified uORFs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Rate of hGH production and mRNA levels were measured (8Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type uORF reduced translational efficiency to approximately 1% that of the construct in which the uORF had been destroyed by modifying the initiator AUG codon to GUG. Consistent with previous results obtained with the AdoMetDC uORF located 14 nucleotides from the cap (9Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alterations in codons 4, 5, and 6 all relieved a major proportion of the suppression, leaving a residual 14–40% inhibition compared with the 99% inhibition produced by the wild type uORF. This residual inhibition probably reflects the efficiency of translational reinitiation on an mRNA after termination in HeLa cells. To examine the coding requirements of a sequence-dependent uORF, it would be convenient to employ a microbial system to initially screen constructs generated by saturation mutagenesis of critical codons. To test whether the mammalian AdoMetDC uORF showed similar sequence-dependent activity in yeast, wild type and modified uORFs were placed into a derivative of the 5′ leader of theGCN4 mRNA in which all of the natural uORFs had been removed (14Miller P.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The translational efficiencies of the mRNAs, based on β-galactosidase expression from these constructs, are given in TableII. A pattern similar, but not identical, to that seen in mammalian cells was observed. The wild type uORF encoding the peptide MAGDIS suppressed translation to a level 5% that of the construct in which the initiator AUG (codon 1) had been altered. This result, based on β-galactosidase activity, was qualitatively confirmed by labeling cells with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitating the labeled β-galactosidase (Fig. 2). Alteration of codons 2 and 3 produced no significant change in expression from the wild type uORF (Table II), consistent with results with mammalian cells (9Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas changes in codons 4 and 5 relieved translational suppression by 4- to 6-fold. However, in contrast to what we observed in mammalian cells, changing the sixth codon from serine to alanine only minimally influenced suppression, increasing expression by only about 2-fold over wild type. This suggested that the requirements at the 3′-terminal codon might be less demanding than originally suspected (9Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a conclusion that was confirmed in later experiments (described below). It should be noted that none of the constructs tested in Table II nor any examined elsewhere in this study (e.g. Fig. 4) exhibited substantial alteration in mRNA level, indicating the absence of nonsense-mediated decay promoted by these uORFs in the context of the 5′ leader of GCN4.Table IISequence-dependent behavior of the AdoMetDC uORF in yeastAltered codonuORF derivative (plasmid designation)2-aThe indicated derivatives of the AdoMetDCuORF were ligated into the yeast GCN4 leader, lacking its own uORFs, and fused to the E. coli β-galactosidase-coding region as described under “Experimental Procedures”.β-Galactosidase2-bβ-galactosidase activity of the strains was determined under “Experimental Procedures.”mRNA level2-cβ-Galactosidase mRNA level was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”β-Gal/mRNA2-dRatio of β-galactosidase activity to mRNA level.Translational efficiency2-eRatio of β-galactosidase activity to mRNA, normalized to the construct with the initiator AUG mutated to GUG (pMHY3).-MAGDIS (wild type, pMHY1)13.62.226.120.051AUG → GUG (pMHY3)3483.121121.02A → E (pGM308)13.63.364.040.043G → A (pGM309)13.23.703.560.034D → R (pGM118)52.42.0825.00.225I → A (pGM145)87.02.8630.40.276S → A (pGM146)32.32.5312.80.112-a The indicated derivatives of the AdoMetDCuORF were ligated into the yeast GCN4 leader, lacking its own uORFs, and fused to the E. coli β-galactosidase-coding region as described under “Experimental Procedures”.2-b β-galactosidase activity of the strains was determined under “Experimental Procedures.”2-c β-Galactosidase mRNA level was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-d Ratio of β-galactosidase activity to mRNA level.2-e Ratio of β-galactosidase activity to mRNA, normalized to the construct with the initiator AUG mutated to GUG (pMHY3).

The β-galactosidase activities (expressed as percent of the control construct in which the initiator AUG codon has been changed to GUG) are arbitrarily divided into those constructs with Wild Typeactivity (3–5% that of control), Intermediate activity (12–15% that of control), and Weak activity (17–40% that of control).

Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate further the behavior of the mammalian uORF in yeast, sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed on extracts prepared from yeast strains containing selected β-galactosidase reporter constructs with wild type and modified AdoMetDC uORFs. As was shown in Table II, mutation of the initiator AUG codon of the uORF abolished translational suppression, and as expected, this mRNA was well loaded with ribosomes (Fig. 3). In yeast, as well as in mammalian cells, the presence of the wild type uORF caused the associated mRNA to be associated strongly with monosomes, disomes, and trisomes (Fig. 3). The mRNA from a construct with codon 5 changed from isoleucine to valine, which retained suppressive activity of the uORF (see Fig. 4), showed a polysome distribution similar to wild type (Fig. 3). In contrast, modification of codon 5 to leucine, which relieved translational suppression (see Fig. 4), produced an mRNA that was efficiently loaded with ribosomes (Fig. 3). Therefore, the polysome patterns of these uORF-containing constructs parallel their translational efficiencies in yeast and support the apparent parallel between the activities of theAdoMetDC uORF in yeast and in mammalian cells. To explore further the coding specificity of the mammalian uORF, we randomly mutagenized codons 4, 5, and 6 and tested the influence of these altered uORFs on expression of the attached β-galactosidase reporter gene in yeast cells (Fig. 4). The activities of these constructs were compared with those of control constructs in which the uORF initiation codon had been destroyed"

CD28 signaling may also play a role in balancing the inflammatory/humoral (Th1/Th2) responses during an immune reaction. CD28 costimulation has been shown to promote the production of Th2 cytokines including interleukin (IL)-4, a key cytokine essential for Th2 differentiation and for the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. In this study, we show that IL-4 mRNA and activity of the IL-4 promoter can be activated by the CD28 signal alone and are further augmented by CD28 costimulation of α-CD3- or mitogen-activated Jurkat T cells. Two important IL-4 enhancer elements, positive regulatory element (PRE)-I and P1, are found to respond to CD28 stimulation-induced transactivation. In contrast to the Th1 IL-2 CD28RE, activity of the IL-4 PRE-I and P1 can be induced by the CD28 signal alone. In correlation with CD28-induced transcriptional activation, AP-1 (c-Jun, JunD) and NF-κB/Rel (c-Rel, RelA) family members are found to bind to the two regulatory elements PRE-I and P1 upon CD28 stimulation. The data provide the first mapping of the CD28-responsive site in a Th2 cytokine gene, the IL-4 gene. They also show that the CD28 signal can directly activate a gene (e.g. IL-4) at the transcriptional level. CD28 serves as a costimulatory cell surface molecule in T cell activation.

T cell receptor interleukin antibody monoclonal antibody positive regulatory element CD28-responsive element polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Activation of T cells during an immune response requires two distinct signals: one from the engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR)1 with specific major histocompatibility complex antigens presenting peptides on antigen-presenting cells and a second signal originating from other cell surface receptors/ligands that mediate costimulation (1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Work over the last several years has demonstrated that the CD28 glycoprotein, expressed on the surface of 80% of human T cells and on virtually all murine T cells, is one of the major costimulatory molecules (2June C.H. Bluestone J.A. Nadler L.M. Thompson C.B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). Ligation of CD28 with anti-CD28 (α-CD28) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or cells expressing CD28 ligands (B7–1 and B7–2) in combination with limited concentrations of anti-CD3 (α-CD3) or antigen promotes cell cycle progression and increases interleukin (IL)-2 production by regulating IL-2 mRNA at both the level of transcription and translation (for a review, see Ref. 4Bluestone J.A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 555-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, CD28 can deliver biochemical signals that function in synergy with TCR-mediated signaling to initiate and maintain T cell responses. Recent findings indicate that CD28 ligation acts not only synergistically with TCR ligation to maximize T cell signaling but also promotes cell differentiation. Several studies both in mice (5Shahinian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Kawai K. Ohashi P.S. Thompson C.B. Mak T.W.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 2654-2662PubMed Google Scholar) support a fundamental role for CD28 in the early differentiation of T helper (Th) subsets toward a Th2 phenotype. In the absence of CD28 signaling, naive T cells are biased toward a Th1 phenotype. Th2 cells, which produce IL-4, -5, -6, -10, and -13, regulate humoral immune responses and Th1 cells, which secrete IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-β, and interferon-γ, are involved in cell-mediated and delayed type hypersensitivity immune responses. Thus, CD28 signaling may regulate the balance of inflammatory/humoral (Th1/Th2) responses during an immune reaction. It has been shown that CD28 costimulation may directly promote the production of Th2 cytokines (12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar). Both in humans (9King C.L. Stupi R.J. Craighead N. June C.H. Thyphronitis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and in mice (12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar), increased CD28 ligation resulted in increased production of IL-4 and IL-5. Purified naive human T cells stimulated with α-CD3 in the absence of CD28 costimulation produce only IL-2 and interferon-γ, whereas the addition of α-CD28 mAb induced IL-4 (9King C.L. Stupi R.J. Craighead N. June C.H. Thyphronitis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). IL-4 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide rage of biological effects on many hemopoietic and nonhemopoietically derived cells and tissues (13Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 is also a well known cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation by promoting Ig class switching to IgE (13Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, IL-4 was also shown to be the major determining factor in the differentiation of naive T cells into the Th2 phenotype and facilitating the humoral immune response (6Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 635-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 14Le Gros G. Ben-Sasson S.Z. Seder R. Finkelman F.D. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In the absence of IL-4, Th cells develop mainly into the Th1 phenotype (15Parronchi P. de Carli M. Manetti R. Simonelli C.

Up-regulation of the IL-4 production by CD28 signaling may be one of the mechanisms that promotes Th2 differentiation. The effect of CD28 on transcriptional activity of the Th1 IL-2 gene has been intensively studied. A NF-κB-like sequence between −164 and −154 and an adjacent AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter was found to respond to the CD28 signal (17Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A.

CD28 inducibility was shown to be conferred by the AP-1 component in NF-AT/AP-1 composite elements (24Rooney J.W. Sun Y-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although the CD28-responsive element of the IL-2 gene has been well studied, the CD28 response element of the IL-4 gene has not been characterized. Like the IL-2 gene, the IL-4 gene is regulated by multiple regulatory elements (for a review see Ref. 25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide the first report of CD28-responsive elements (CD28REs) in the IL-4 promoter. We show that two IL-4 promoter elements, PRE-I and P1, are responsive to the CD28 stimulation signal. In contrast to the IL-2 CD28RE, transcriptional activity of the IL-4 CD28REs can be activated by the CD28 signal alone. Upon CD28 stimulation, AP-1 (c-Jun, JunD) and NF-κB (c-Rel, p65/RelA) family proteins bind to these two elements and are involved in governing the CD28 responsiveness of the two elements. PRE-I and P1 belong to the most important regulatory elements of the IL-4 gene (26Abe E., R. Malefyt D.W. Matsuda I. Arai K. Arai N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heinfling A. Reeves Grummt R.F. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5694-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Both sites are also shown to be involved in Th2-specific protein/DNA interactions and to be the potential regulatory elements for Th2-specific expression of the IL-4 gene (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wenner C.A. Szabo S.J. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of PRE-I and P1 as CD28REs may lead to a better understanding of CD28-mediated activation of the IL-4 gene. The cells used in this study were the human T-lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat (J16-77). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies), 6 mmHEPES (Life Technologies; 1 m solution), and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies; 200 mm solution). Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT). PCR amplification was then performed for 35 cycles with specific primers (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) for the human IL-4 (456-base pair PCR product) and the human β-actin (661-base pair PCR product) protein, respectively. The PCR products were then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The luciferase reporter plasmid pLuc-IL4 (−269/+11) was constructed as described previously (31Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Laur O. Klevenz S. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389PubMed Google Scholar). Multimer constructs containing DNA sequence of 1–3 copies of P1 (AATCTGGTGTAACGAAAATTTCCAATGTA) and PRE-I (AGCAAATTATGGTGTAATTTCCTATGCTGAA) and four copies of NF-κB consensus binding site (TCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGCG) were constructed by ligation of each DNA sequence into the multicloning site of pATAT-Luc vector (a kind gift from Dr. T. Wirth, Institut für Medizinische Strahlen und Zellforschung, Würzburg, Germany). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing analysis. The p65/RelA expression plasmid (pCMV-p65) was kindly supplied by Dr. K. Schulze-Osthoff, Medizinische Klinik, Universität Tübingen, Germany). The c-Rel expression plasmid (pRSV-cRel) was kindly supplied by Dr. R. M. Schmid (Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universität Ulm). Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected by electroporation. 4 × 106/ml cells in RPMI 1640 medium and 15 μg of reporter plasmids were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad GmbH, München, Germany) set at 960 microfarads, 240 V. The transfected cells were allowed to recovered overnight and divided into aliquots. Each aliquot was further treated with α-CD3 mAb (OKT3 coated at 10 μg/ml), α-CD28 mAb (5 μg/ml), or α-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb for 8 and 16 h. Luciferase activity was determined in 10 μl of cell extract using the luciferase assay substrate (Promega) with an Duolumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold, Germany). Nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells unstimulated and stimulated for 2 h with either α-CD3 mAb (OKT3 coated at 10 μg/ml) or α-CD3 plus α-CD28 mAb (5 μg/ml) were prepared as described previously (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as published previously (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar).

(Santa Cruz, CA). The α-NF-κB/RelA(p65) antibody was purchased from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Antibody specific for c-Jun B was kindly supplied by Dr. P.

CD28 costimulation has been shown to increase production of IL-4 protein both in human and mouse T cells (9King C.L. Stupi R.J. Craighead N. June C.H. Thyphronitis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the CD28 signal involved in expression of the human IL-4 gene at the transcriptional level, we chose an IL-4-producing Jurkat T cell subline for our studies. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with phytohemogglutinin or α-CD3 (OKT3) mAb alone resulted in induction of IL-4 mRNA expression. The production of IL-4 mRNA was clearly increased upon co-stimulation with α-CD28 mAbs in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1). CD28 is known to serve as a costimulatory cell surface molecule in T cell activation. Interestingly, we observed that stimulation of Jurkat cells with α-CD28 mAb alone could induce a low but significant level of IL-4 mRNA expression. The capability of α-CD28 mAb in induction of IL-4 mRNA expression was also observed in a second Jurkat T cell line (data not shown). This indicates that CD28 ligation does not only provide a costimulatory signal but may also directly induce expression of the IL-4 gene at the transcriptional level. The experiments also demonstrate that the CD28 signal is involved in generating a high level of IL-4 expression in Jurkat T cells. To investigate the biological function of the human IL-4 promoter in response to CD3 and CD28 signals, the human IL-4 promoter fragment −269 to +11 (which contains the important regulatory elements identified so far) was placed in front of the luciferase reporter gene. Activities of the IL-4 promoter were analyzed by transfection of the IL-4-luciferase construct into Jurkat T cells. The experiments showed that stimulation of Jurkat cells with α-CD3 mAb alone resulted in a 3-fold (for 8-h stimulation) to 7-fold (for 16-h stimulation) induction of IL-4 promoter activity. When the cells were costimulated with α-CD28 mAb, the IL-4 promoter activity was enhanced. A 6-fold (for 8-h costimulation) to 9-fold (for 16-h costimulation) increase in IL-4 promoter activity was obtained (Fig. 2). Stimulation of the cells with α-CD28 mAb alone for 8 h also led to an increase of promoter activity to a similar level as that stimulated by α-CD3 mAb alone. The effect of the CD28 signal on IL-4 promoter activity was more pronounced at the early stage (8 h) than the later stage of stimulation (16 h) (Fig. 2). Therefore, the following transfection experiments were performed at 8 h of stimulation. The IL-4 −269 to +1 promoter fragment contains multiple regulatory transcriptional elements (25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To study the CD28-responsive DNA binding sites of the IL-4 promoter, we prepared nuclear proteins from Jurkat T cells unstimulated and stimulated by α-CD3, α-CD28 or a combination of α-CD3 and α-CD28 mAbs and analyzed them by EMSA. Two regulatory elements, PRE-I at −250 to −221 (27Li-Weber M. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1371-1382PubMed Google Scholar) and P (also referred as P1) at −77 to −67 (26Abe E., R. Malefyt D.W. Matsuda I. Arai K. Arai N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Szabo S.J. Gold J.S. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were shown to interact with nuclear proteins of cells stimulated with α-CD28 or α-CD3/α-CD28 mAbs (Fig. 3). Two complexes (PRE-I-I and PRE-I-II), detected by the PRE-I probe, and three complexes (P1-I, P-1-II, and P1-III) detected by the P1 probe were clearly shown in CD28-stimulated cells. P1-I and P1-II were also formed in CD3 stimulated cells. Formation of P1-I and P1-II was enhanced in cells stimulated with both α-CD3 and α-CD28 mAbs (Fig. 3). In contrast, PRE-I-I was not found in cells stimulated by α-CD3 mAb alone. Formation of PRE-I-I was not increased by CD28/CD3 costimulation. PRE-I-II and P1-III could be detected in nonstimulated cells. Formation of these two complexes was increased upon induction. The data indicate that PRE-I and P1 are the binding sites for CD28-induced nuclear factors and, therefore, may be the sites responsive to CD28 signaling. To investigate the transcriptional activity of PRE-I and P1 upon CD28 costimulation, we constructed luciferase reporter plasmids each containing 1–3 copies of the PRE-I or the P1 element linked to a minimal promoter containing a TATA box only. The biological function of the two elements was analyzed by transfection of the constructs into Jurkat T cells. For controls, four copies of the NF-κB consensus binding site were also constructed in the luciferase-TATA plasmid and used in the transfection studies. The experiments showed that three copies of both elements could confer CD28-dependent inducibility to the reporter gene (Fig. 4). However, one and two copies of the elements were not sufficient to respond to CD28 stimulation. Differences in response to CD3 stimulation were observed between the two elements. Stimulation with α-CD3 mAb alone did not induce transcriptional activity mediated by the PRE-I multimer construct. In contrast, α-CD3 mAb alone induced more than 8-fold expression of the multimerized P1 element (Fig. 4). CD28 ligation was shown to act synergistically with TCR ligation to increase the transcription on the P1 element. The TATA-luciferase vector did not respond to any stimuli (data not shown). The experiments demonstrate that PRE-I and P1 are responsive to CD28 signaling, and the transcriptional activity of the two elements correlates with the DNA binding activity analyzed. AP-1 proteins have been shown to play a role in CD28 inducibility (20McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rooney J.W. Sun Y-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that in Jurkat T cells proteins of the AP-1 family are involved in binding to PRE-I upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or PMA/ionomycin stimulation (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the α-CD3 and α-CD28 mAb-induced complexes, oligonucleotides containing binding sites for several known inducible factors were used as DNA competitors in EMSA. The experiment showed that formation of the CD28-inducible complex PRE-I-I was specifically competed by an excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 and NF-AT binding sites (Fig. 5). To further investigate whether AP-1 proteins are involved in binding to PRE-I upon CD28 stimulation, α-c-Jun/AP-1, broadly reactive with c-Jun, JunB, and Jun p39 proteins and α-c-Fos (k-25), broadly reactive with c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2, were used in EMSA. Antibody analysis showed that in α-CD28-treated cells, α-c-Jun/AP-1 antibody slightly supershifted PRE-I-I. No effect was obtained by the α-c-Fos antibody (Fig. 6 A). This indicates that PRE-I-I may contain proteins of the Jun family. We further investigated the components of the PRE-I binding complexes using antibodies specifically against c-Jun, JunB, or JunD. Our experiments showed that PRE-I-I and PRE-I-II were supershifted by α-JunD Ab (Fig. 6A). Formation of PRE-I-I was also blocked by α-c-Jun Ab (Fig. 6 A). The experiments demonstrate that CD28 stimulation leads to binding of c-Jun and JunD to PRE-I. We also investigated whether the components of PRE-I binding complexes changed in α-CD3/α-CD28-costimulated cells. In contrast to the cells stimulated by α-CD28 alone, in the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells, PRE-I-I was completely blocked by the α-c-Jun/AP-1 antibody (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the components of PRE-I-I in α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells may differ from those in α-CD28-stimulated cells. Indeed, α-JunB Ab, which did not interfere with the formation of PRE-I-I in the α-CD28-stimulated cells, reduced PRE-I-I in the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, α-c-Jun Ab interfered with the formation of PRE-I-I in α-CD28-stimulated cells but not in the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells. JunD was detected in the PRE-I binding complexes in both α-CD28- and α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells. Fos was not found to participate in binding to PRE-I in α-CD28- or the α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells.Figure 6Antibody analysis of the PRE-I binding nuclear factors. EMSA was carried out with nuclear extracts prepared from α-CD28- or α-CD3/α-CD28-induced Jurkat T cells in the presence of the antibodies indicated. −, assays were carried out without antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Formation of PRE-I-II was enhanced after CD3 stimulation (Fig. 3). Competition experiments showed that formation of PRE-I-II was competed by NF-κB and NF-AT oligonucleotides (Fig. 5). Antibody analysis showed that PRE-I-II formed in α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells reacted with the α-p65 and α-NF-ATc antibodies, indicating participation of p65 and NF-AT in PRE-I-II formation upon α-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 6). The P1 site (located at −67 to −77) shares DNA sequence homology with the NF-AT as well as the NF-κB consensus sequence and was shown to interact with both NF-AT and NF-κB upon PMA and A23187 induction (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Competition experiments showed that formation of the inducible P1 complexes were competed by oligonucleotides containing the NF-AT and NF-κB binding sites (Fig. 5). The P1 probe used in our EMSA experiments did not contain the putative AP-1 site (25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, formation of all three inducible P1 complexes was competed by the AP-1 oligonucleotide, indicating that AP-1 proteins might be involved in binding to the P1 site (Fig. 5). Antibody analysis of the P1 binding complexes of the α-CD28-stimulated cells showed that all three complexes were supershifted by the α-JunD Ab (Fig. 7). Therefore, JunD was also involved in binding to the P1 site in α-CD28-stimulated cells (Fig. 7 A). Besides, α-p65/RelA and α-c-Rel Abs blocked formation of P1-I demonstrating that c-Rel and RelA of the NF-κB proteins were involved in binding to the P1 site upon CD28 stimulation (Fig. 7 A). In α-CD3/α-CD28-stimulated cells, α-c-Fos and α-NF-ATc Abs also reduced formation of the P1 binding complexes, indicating that NF-AT and other members of the AP-1 family of proteins may form the P1-binding complexes upon CD3 stimulation (Fig. 7 B). The above studies demonstrate that JunD, p65/RelA, and c-Rel are involved in binding to the IL-4 promoter regulatory elements during CD28 costimulation. Engagement of the TCR leads to activation of two (the protein kinase C and the calmodulin-dependent) signal transduction pathways. It is known that PMA activates protein kinase C and that calcium ionophores (such as ionomycin and A23187) increase the level of intracellular free Ca2+. Therefore, the physiological stimulation of T cells via TCR may be mimicked by the combination of PMA and ionomycin. Previously, Casolaro et al. (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that activation of human IL-4 transcription through A23187 was diminished by PMA in Jurkat T cells and that overexpression of RelA down-regulated human IL-4 promoter activity in A23187-stimulated Jurkat T cells. They proposed that NF-κB (activated by PMA) may compete with NF-AT (activated by A23187) for binding to the P1 site and, consequently, inhibit NF-AT-dependent transcription at this site. To investigate the functional relevance of NF-κB on the P1 site upon CD3 stimulation, we cotransfected the P1 multimer construct together with a RelA or a c-Rel expression plasmid into Jurkat T cells. As shown in Fig. 8, overexpression of RelA or c-Rel increased the P1-mediated transcription in CD3-stimulated Jurkat T cells. Therefore, NF-κB may enhance transcriptional activity at the P1 site in physiologically stimulated T cells. In recent years, experimental evidence showed that signal transduction through CD28 not only augmented TCR-mediated proliferation, IL-2 production, and T cell survival but also played an important role in differentiation of Th cells into either type 1 or type 2 cells (11Palmer E.M. van Seventer G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2654-2662PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1996; 4: 527-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CD28 costimulation has been shown to promote production of Th2 cytokines including IL-4 (12Rulifson I.C. Sperling A.I. Fields P.E. Fitch F.W. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 658-665PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking the CD28-B7 interaction blocks the induction of IL-4 synthesis (5Shahinian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Kawai K. Ohashi P.S. Thompson C.B. Mak T.W. Science. 1993; 261: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 6Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1992; 257: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), indicating that CD28 costimulation is important in regulation of IL-4 synthesis. Since IL-4 is not only a critical cytokine for Th2 differentiation but also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation, we investigated the CD28-responsive element of the human IL-4 promoter. We show here that IL-4 mRNA levels and activity of the IL-4 promoter are increased by CD28 costimulation of α-CD3- or mitogen-activated Jurkat T cells. Interestingly, in addition, we found that α-CD28 mAb alone could induce IL-4 mRNA expression and activate the IL-4 promoter to a significant level. This indicates that CD28 ligation, so far known to provide a costimulatory signal in T cell activation, may also directly activate transcription. Two of the IL-4 promoter regulatory elements, PRE-I and P1, are shown to confer CD-28-stimulation-induced transactivation. PRE-I was previously shown to interact with AP-1 and NF-AT in Th2 cells (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1 transcriptional activity in T cells has been shown to be strongly induced by α-CD28 induction (37Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and CD28 costimulation is necessary for the optimal activation of AP-1, via c-Jun phosphorylation (33Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the multimerized PRE-I element may contribute to an approximately 4-fold transcriptional activation in response to CD28 signaling. Our experiments also show that binding of c-Jun and JunD to PRE-I is specifically induced via CD28 stimulation. These data indicate that PRE-I may be a CD28-responsive element in the IL-4 gene. P1 contains a strong NF-AT binding site (24Rooney J.W. Sun Y-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Li-Weber M. Laur O. Davydov I.V. Hu C. Salgame P. Krammer P.H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It also shares DNA sequence similarity with the DNA binding sequence for NF-κB and binds both NF-AT and proteins of the NF-κB family (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The corresponding P1 sequence in the human IL-4 promoter differs by two nucleotides from the mouse sequence (TGGAAATTTC instead of TGGAAAATTTT) and was shown to bind NF-AT with 4-fold lower affinity and NF-κB with 4-fold higher affinity than does the mouse sequence (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the Rel-related κB proteins are downstream targets in CD28 signaling (38Snapper C.M. Zelazowski P. Rosas F.R. Kehry M.R. Tian M. Baltimore D. Sha W.C. J.

CD28 stimulation can directly activate the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors via down-regulating the expression of the NF-κB inhibitor I-κB and increasing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel (22Bryan R.G.

NF-κB/Rel transcription factors are found to participate in the formation of the IL-2 CD28-responsive element-specific complex and to be involved in CD28-stimulated transactivation (21Ghosh P. Tan T. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J.H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We show here that JunD, c-Rel, and p65/Rel are involved in binding to the IL-4 promoter P1 element after CD28 stimulation. The multimerized P1 element confers 6–8-fold inducible transcriptional activity to the reporter gene upon CD28 stimulation. The data suggest that P1 may be the second CD28-responsive site of the IL-4 gene and that JunD and Rel-related proteins are involved in activation at this site. PRE-I and P1 elements were previously shown to be essential for expression of the human (27Li-Weber M. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1371-1382PubMed Google Scholar) and murine (28Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves Grummt R.F. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5694-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) IL-4 gene. Deletion or mutation of PRE-I and P1 leads to impairment of both basal and inducible activity of the IL-4 promoter (26Abe E., R. Malefyt D.W. Matsuda I. Arai K. Arai N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Li-Weber M. Krafft H. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1371-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R.

Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that PRE-I and P1 may play an important role in the differential regulation of IL-4 gene expression levels in Th2 cells (29Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1194-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wenner C.A. Szabo S.J. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of PRE-I and P1 as the CD28-responsive sites further confirms the importance of the two elements for IL-4 gene expression and also demonstrates that the CD28 signal regulates IL-4 gene expression through the most important regulatory elements. Differences between the IL-2 CD28RE and the IL-4 PRE-I and P1 are observed. 1) Inducible binding of nuclear factors to the IL-2 CD28RE requires both the CD28-induced signal together with either phorbol myristate acetate or α-CD3 (19Curtiss V.E. Smilde R. McGuire K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3567-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike the IL-2 CD28RE, inducible binding of nuclear proteins to the IL-4 PRE-I and P1 elements is readily detected in nuclear extracts prepared from α-CD28-stimulated cells. 2) The CD28 signal alone cannot activate the IL-2 CD28RE (23Lai J.H. Horvath G. Subleski L. Bruder J. Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-4 PRE-I and P1 elements may function as a “pure” CD28RE and respond to CD28 stimulation alone. 3) Although NF-κB/Rel family members make up the IL-2 CD28RE protein complex, the IL-2 CD28RE does not function independently but works only in conjunction with the adjacent proximal AP-1 binding site (20McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the IL-4 P1 element binds both NF-κB/Rel and AP-1 family members, although the P1 probe used does not contain an AP-1 site. This indicates that NF-κB and AP-1 proteins may interact with each other to bind together to a NF-κB-like regulatory element upon CD28 stimulation. Using reagents such as PMA and A23187 for T cell stimulation, Casolaroet al. (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that activation of human IL-4 transcription through A23187 (the Ca2+-dependent pathway) was diminished by PMA (protein kinase C stimulation). They proposed that NF-κB (activated by PMA) may compete with NF-AT (activated by A23187) for binding to the P1 site and, consequently, inhibit the NF-AT-dependent transcription at this site. In our experiments, we stimulated Jurkat T cells through TCR by α-CD3 mAb coated at 10 μg/ml. Under these conditions, the activity of the multimerized P1 element was augmented by CD28 costimulation. Overexpression of RelA/p65 and c-Rel increased the P1-mediated transcription in CD3-stimulated Jurkat T cells. Therefore, NF-κB can activate transcription at the P1 site at physiological conditions of stimulation. However, when Jurkat cells were optimally activated by α-CD3, the P1 multimer reporter activity (but not the IL-4 promoter activity) was reduced by 10–15% when costimulated with α-CD28 mAb (data not shown). Therefore, as reported by Casolaro et al. (34Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), NF-κB may exert a negative effect at the P1 site when transcription is maximally regulated by NF-AT. Even in this case, the IL-4 promoter activity was augmented upon CD28 costimulation indicates positive involvement of other CD28-responsive elements (such as PRE-I). Transcriptional regulation of the IL-4 gene is controlled by multiple regulatory promoter elements. Therefore, action of other, yet undefined DNA-binding factors may also be involved in the transcriptional synergy observed upon CD28 costimulation. Besides PRE-I and P1, the IL-4 promoter also contains several composite sites that bind AP-1 and NF-AT cooperatively (31Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Laur O. Klevenz S. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389PubMed Google Scholar, 45Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Krammer P.H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Activation of T cells by α-CD28 has been shown to strongly induce AP-1 transcriptional activity via posttranslational modification (37Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, sites involved in interaction with AP-1 may also contribute to transcriptional activation in response to CD28 signaling. Stimulation of the CD28 surface molecule has also been shown to specifically regulate the stability of messenger RNAs for IL-2, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (46Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Thus, increase of RNA stability via the CD28 pathway may be one of the mechanisms to account for the CD28 costimulation-enhanced gene production. Whether this mechanism is also involved in the synergistic effects of CD28 costimulation on the expression of the IL-4 gene needs to be investigated. We are grateful to W.

https://openalex.org/W2083728258,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) has been demonstrated in several types of tumors, including osteosarcoma, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We detected SV40 sequences by PCR, followed by hybridization, in nine of 35 osteosarcoma tumors and one of 11 osteosarcoma explants. PCR can detect fewer than one virus per cell but gives little detail of the gross structure and abundance of the virus. Analysis by Southern blotting of total DNA from ten osteosarcomas, positive for SV40 by PCR, found viral integration in half of these. Analysis showed integration of one to four copies per cell of rearranged SV40. No SV40 was detectable on blots of the remaining five SV40+ osteosarcomas, perhaps because of the lesser sensitivity of direct hybridization. Inactivation of the p53 and Rb tumor suppressors is a key activity of SV40 T-antigen. Unexpectedly, correlation of these findings with our prior studies indicated that five of ten osteosarcomas positive for SV40 DNA had mutations of p53, and two had deleted Rb. Apparently clonal integration with pre-existing alteration of a tumor suppressor gene, suggests that SV40 may play a role in the final conversion to malignant osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2041376177,"Trinucleotide repeats in human genetic disorders showing anticipation follow two inheritance patterns as a function of length. Inheritance of 35–50 repeats show incremental changes, while tracts greater than 80 repeats show large saltatory expansions. We describe a bacterial system that recapitulates this striking bimodal pattern of CTG amplification. Incremental expansions predominate in CTG tracts < Okazaki fragment size, while saltatory expansions increase in repeat tracts ≥ Okazaki fragment size. CTG amplification requires loss of SbcC, a protein that modulates cleavage of single-stranded DNA and degradation of duplex DNA from double-strand breaks. These results suggest that noncanonical single strand–containing secondary structures in Okazaki fragments and/or double-strand breaks in repeat tracts are intermediates in CTG amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2024735070,"Human P-glycoprotein is synthesized in HEK 293 cells as two major products: the 150-kDa core-glycosylated intermediate and the 170-kDa mature proteins.

P-gp1 is an ATP-dependent drug pump that actively extrudes a broad range of hydrophobic substrates from the cell (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). Human P-gp, encoded by the MDR1 gene, consists of 1280 amino acids organized in two tandem repeats of 610 amino acids joined by a linker region of 60 amino acids. Each repeat consists of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain containing six potential TM sequences followed by a hydrophilic domain containing a nucleotide binding site (2Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). P-gp is a very useful model protein for studying protein folding and trafficking (protein kinesis) of polytopic plasma membrane transport proteins because these processes can be manipulated by mutations (6Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or substrates (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Point mutations throughout the molecule cause the protein to be trapped in the ER as a core-glycosylated intermediate in association with molecular chaperones such as calnexin (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hsc70 (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The effects of these processing mutations, however, can be overcome by carrying out synthesis in the presence of drug substrates (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recent results suggest that processing mutants are structurally similar to the core-glycosylated form of the wild type enzyme but are trapped in an early step of the folding pathway. Drug substrates promote superfolding of the processing mutants through interaction with the TM domains (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). P-gp mutants in the ER that are not processed to the mature enzyme are rapidly degraded (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that cytosolic proteasomes are involved in the degradation of proteins in the ER (11Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 12Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The cytosolic proteasomes may also participate in the degradation of misprocessed mutants of P-gp (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Degradation of protein in the ER involves the retrograde translocation of the misfolded protein through the translocon for digestion by cytosolic proteasomes. This process may involve the participation of chaperones (13Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Retrograde translocation of polytopic proteins is more difficult to imagine because extraction of large TM domains (such as that found in P-gp and CFTR) out of the lipid bilayer may not be energetically favorable. This process could be simplified if ER proteases can cleave the protein, presumably between the TM segments before extraction from the ER. In this study we found that P-gp contains a protease-sensitive site in the first extracellular loop that was important for the maturation of the mutant protein. The results also show that ER proteases are important contributors in the quality control of protein folding. Full-length MDR1 cDNA, modified to encode the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 at the COOH-terminal end, was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT21 as described previously (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27488-27492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification purposes a full-length MDR1 cDNA was modified to encode for 10 histidine residues at the COOH terminus of the protein (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The sequence at the COOH terminus of full-length P-gp that would normally end as TKRQ now became TKRA(His)10LDPRQ. Construction of Cys-less P-gp in which all cysteines were changed to alanine has been described previously (3Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A glycosylation-deficient mutant was made by mutating the three consensus glycosylation sites (N91A,N94A,N99A). HEK 293 cells on 60-mm diameter dishes were transfected with the desired cDNA. After 24 h, the transfected cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in methionine- and cystine-free media with 100 μCi/ml Trans 35S-label (ICN Biomedicals). The labeling medium was then replaced with medium containing 10% (v/v) calf serum. At various intervals, the monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 10 mm EDTA. P-gp-A52 was recovered by immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of monoclonal antibody A52 and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Membranes were prepared from fifty 10-cm plates of HEK 293 cells expressing single cysteine P-gp-A52 mutants that were treated with 10 μm MG-132 for 24 h (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The membranes were suspended in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and solubilized with 1% (w/v) SDS. Insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The solubilized sample was incubated at 22 °C for 30 min with 0.1 mm biotin maleimide (3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)-biocytin) (Molecular Probes). The reaction was quenched with 20 mm cysteine, pH 7.0, and unreacted biotin maleimide was removed by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100), and P-gp-A52 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a sheet of nitrocellulose, and biotinylated P-gp was detected by using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence (3Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For purification of P-gp mutants, HEK 293 cells transfected with the cDNA coding for the histidine-tagged P-gps were solubilized with 1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the mutant P-gps were purified by nickel-chelate chromatography (Qiagen). Drug-stimulated ATPase activity was determined as described previously (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). P-gp is synthesized in the ER as a 150-kDa core-glycosylated biosynthetic intermediate. The carbohydrates are then modified in the Golgi apparatus to yield the mature 170-kDa form of the enzyme that is subsequently delivered to the cell surface. Fig. 1 (lane 1) shows that both the 150- and 170-kDa forms of Cys-less P-gp can be detected when P-gp cDNA is expressed in HEK 293 cells. For some mutants such as G341C, no full-length protein could be detected. Instead, the major product was a polypeptide with an apparent mass of 130 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 7) that was smaller than the unglycosylated P-gp (lane 4). This result suggested that the protein was being rapidly degraded either during or immediately following biosynthesis. To inhibit or retard the degradation of mutant G341C, synthesis was carried out in the presence of proteasome inhibitors such as MG-132 or lactacystin, because the major cellular degradation pathway is mediated by proteasomes (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (lanes 8 and 9) shows that proteasomes are probably not involved because the 130-kDa protein was still the major product when mutant G341C was synthesized in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. In contrast to mutant G341C, the proteasome inhibitors had a dramatic effect on synthesis of the Cys-less parent. No mature protein could be detected, and the major products corresponded to the core-glycosylated intermediate and 130-kDa putative breakdown product (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). The 130-kDa product was also observed when the glycosylation-deficient (N91A,N94A,N99A) mutant was expressed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). The A52 epitope tag at the COOH terminus of P-gp facilitated detection of the proteolytic digestion product. Therefore, the presence of a degradation product of 130 kDa in the Cys-less parent P-gp and in mutant G341C suggested that the protein had been cleaved at the NH2-terminal end. The size of the degradation product indicated that the proteolytic site may lie within the first extracellular loop between predicted TM1 and TM2. This loop is glycosylated at positions 91, 94, and 99 (Fig. 2 A). Because the size of the 130-kDa P-gp product was not altered by treatment with endoglycosidases H or F (data not shown), the cleavage site must be located on the COOH-terminal side of the glycosylation sites. To identify this site, we used a Cys-less P-gp and cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to test for inhibition of cleavage. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the 130-kDa product of mutant R113C was not detected, whereas the amount of the core-glycosylated 150-kDa protein was increased. Mutant Y114C showed reduced amounts of the 130-kDa product and increased amounts of core-glycosylated product. The effects were specific to Arg113 and Tyr114. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of residues 108–112 and 115–118 (Fig. 2 B) or residues 119–180 (data not shown) had no detectable effect on the amount of 130-kDa product after expression with proteasome inhibitors. These results suggested that cleavage must be close to residue Arg113. A decrease of approximately 12 kDa between the glycosylation-deficient mutant and the 130-kDa digestion product is consistent with the removal of about 113 amino acids at the NH2-terminal end of P-gp. We then used a modified method of Duncan et al. (18Duncan E.A. Dave U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17801-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to confirm that the 130-kDa P-gp product was indeed a degradation product. The cysteine P-gp-A52 mutants were treated with SDS to expose the reactive site, labeled with biotin-maleimide, and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. The rationale for this approach was that if the 130-kDa protein was indeed a degradation product, then only the cysteine residues on the COOH-terminal side of the cleavage site should be labeled. This was indeed the case. As shown in Fig. 2 C, no biotinylation product was observed for the 130-kDa P-gp products of mutants that had a cysteine residue on the NH2-terminal side of Arg113. In contrast, the cysteine residues on the COOH-terminal side were labeled. These results provide further evidence that the 130-kDa protein is a degradation product. We then tested the effects of different amino acids at position 113. We found that mutation of Arg113 to Lys, Met, Glu, Ala, or Cys all blocked cleavage of P-gp (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–7). None of these mutations affected maturation of the mutant P-gp when grown without MG-132 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 8–13). The effects of mutation to Tyr114 were also studied. Mutation of Tyr114 to Cys, Lys, Met, or Glu resulted in reduced amounts of 130-kDa product in the presence of MG-132. In contrast, no 130-kDa product was observed in mutant Y114A (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the residue at position 114 does influence the digestion of P-gp. Misprocessed mutants of human P-gp accumulate in the ER as 150-kDa core-glycosylated intermediates and are rapidly degraded (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was reasoned that if we prolonged the half-life of the core-glycosylated intermediate, then the intermediate would fold into the mature enzyme. Although the presence of MG-132 increased the yield of the core-glycosylated intermediate (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it also appeared to block maturation of P-gp (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3, and Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Therefore, another possible way to prolong the half-life of the intermediates would be to inhibit cleavage by mutating the residue at Arg113. Accordingly, cells expressing a misprocessed mutant (G268V) with or without an additional R113A mutation were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cystine to monitor the fate of the mutant. Mutant G268V is a temperature-insensitive processing mutant (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that yields mature enzyme (170 kDa) only when synthesized in the presence of drug substrates (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that there was no detectable difference between the maturation of the core-glycosylated wild type enzyme and the (wild type + R113A) mutant. By contrast, the core-glycosylated G268V protein failed to mature and was almost undetectable by 24 h. In the double mutant (G268V + R113A), however, there was a 5–10-fold increase in the amount of P-gp at 0 h, but the mutant still failed to mature and was degraded by 24 h. A similar pattern was observed for the processing mutant G269V (data not shown). Mutant G341C appeared to have a greater folding defect than the G268V misprocessed mutant. This mutant was degraded more rapidly because the only product observed was the 130-kDa breakdown product. It also differed from the processing mutants in that its maturation was not promoted by synthesis in the presence of drug substrates such as cyclosporin A (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). This suggested that the mutant was cleaved either during or immediately after synthesis. The R113A mutation was then introduced to block cleavage of the G341C mutant. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lane 3), the introduction of an R113A mutation significantly affected the synthesis of mutant G341C. The 130-kDa breakdown product became undetectable, and both core-glycosylated and mature forms of the enzyme were now present. Increased levels of mature protein were obtained in the presence of cyclosporin A (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). To determine whether the mature mutant protein was functional, the histidine-tagged mutant (G341C + R113A) was expressed in HEK 293 cells and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity of the mutant protein was determined in the presence of lipid. Fig. 5 B shows that the molecule was active. Mutant (G341C + R113A) exhibited verapamil- and vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activities that were similar to the parent enzyme. These results show that blockage of the Arg113 cleavage site completely rescued the defects associated with the G341C mutation. We could not determine whether the 130-kDa product of mutant G341C was active because the histidine-tagged protein was not retained by the nickel column, a property also exhibited by the core-glycosylated intermediates of other P-gp processing mutants (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The inability of the histidine-tagged 130-kDa product of mutant G341C to bind the nickel column was not due to loss of the histidine tag. Immunoblot analysis of the histidine-tagged protein with an antibody specific for the histidine tag (Qiagen) still showed the presence of the tag (not shown). The results in this study show that proteolytic enzymes within the ER are important components in the quality control of P-gp folding. The lumenal proteases probably monitor folding of the extracellular loops during protein synthesis. Synthesis of proteins likely involves an equilibrium between those that have folded correctly (super-folded) and those that have either folded incorrectly or are slow to fold. The correctly folded proteins would have their protease-sensitive site(s) masked and thus escape digestion, whereas the incorrectly folded or slow-folding proteins would have their protease-sensitive cleavage sites accessible for digestion. This effect was enhanced in mutant G341C, such that the 130-kDa protein was the only product detected. Remarkably, the effects of the G341C mutation could be overcome by mutating out the hypersensitive protease cleavage site. Apparently, the G341C mutation does not cause complete misfolding of the protein because introduction of an additional R113A mutation to prevent degradation converts the mutant to a functional enzyme with characteristics indistinguishable from parent enzyme (Fig. 5 B). It has been reported that COOH-terminal sequences can also affect membrane anchorage of TM1 and TM2 of MDR3 P-gp (19Zhang J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1709-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cytosolic proteasome is the primary site in mammalian cells for degradation of soluble (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) and polytopic membrane proteins (11Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 12Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mechanism for extraction of defective polytopic transport protein from the ER membrane, however, is not known. In membrane proteins that have a single TM segment, the mechanism may involve retrograde translocation through the translocon channel (13Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The process seems more complicated when it involves a polytopic protein such as P-gp. It seems that the presence of twelve TM segments would make retrograde translocation energetically unfavorable. The process, however, is simplified if the proteases in the lumen of the ER can cleave the protein between the TM loops so that the individual TM segments could then be extracted from the membrane through retrograde translocation. There must be other protease-sensitive sites in these P-gp mutants because removal of R113 did not significantly increase the half-life of the processing mutant. These results suggest that maturation of proteins in the ER is to some extent controlled by proteolytic processes that can be manipulated to control expression of functional proteins. By inhibiting digestion at Arg113, it was possible to increase expression of P-gp mutants such as G341C. Our results suggest that it may be possible to increase the efficiency of synthesis of other unstable proteins such as CFTR. It has been shown that about 25% of wild type CFTR synthesized is processed to the mature enzyme, with the remainder being degraded in the ER (21Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 22Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the removal of hypersensitive protease site(s) or removal of a key site would increase the efficiency of synthesis. The ability to generate a hyperstable protein by removal of protease-sensitive sites would provide an important tool for the treatment of diseases by gene therapy. Another interesting finding is the effect of proteasome inhibitors on maturation of wild type P-gp. The inhibitors prevented maturation of the 150-kDa core-glycosylated protein and prevented degradation of the 130-kDa proteolytic digestion products. Similar effects have been reported for CFTR (12Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and the insulin receptor (23Tomic-Carruthers N. Gorden P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), where the presence of proteasome inhibitors prevented maturation of the proteins. In contrast, the presence of lactacystin has been shown to increase the amount of LDL receptors at the cell surface (24Miura H. Tomoda H. Miura K. Takishima K. Omura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the proteasome inhibitors have pleiotropic effects. Some of these effects, however, can be used to advantage. Compounds or drugs could be designed or identified that would only inhibit maturation of drug transporters such as P-gp. The ability to prevent maturation of the transporter could then be reflected in the use of lower doses of toxic drugs during AIDS (25Kim R.B. Fromm M.F. Wandel C. Leake B. Wood A.J. Roden D.M.

The 2,3′ interaction between resolvase dimers is essential for synapsis and recombination. Using oriented resolvase heterodimers, we have identified half sites of res that must be occupied by a 2,3′-proficient protomer. For synapsis, only four of the eight subunits bound to sites II and III, those at II-L and III-L, require a 2,3′-proficient interface. This 2,3′ interaction, apparently between protomers bound to adjacent sites, may nucleate assembly of the core synaptic complex. For recombination, 2,3′-proficient subunits are also required at sites I-R and III-R, suggesting an important communication between the crossover site and the core of the synapse."

Previous studies performed under a limited range of solution conditions have found that nucleosome core particles and nucleosomal arrays can be acetylated by Gcn5p only when it is complexed with other proteins, e.g. Gcn5-Ada, HAT-A2, and SAGA. Here we demonstrate that when assayed in buffer containing optimum concentrations of either NaCl or MgCl2, purified yeast recombinant Gcn5p (rGcn5p) efficiently acetylates both nucleosome core particles and nucleosomal arrays. Furthermore, under conditions where nucleosomal arrays are extensively folded, rGcn5p acetylates folded arrays ∼40% faster than nucleosome core particles. Finally, rGcn5p polyacetylates the N termini of free histone H3 but only monoacetylates H3 in nucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays. These results demonstrate both that rGcn5p in and of itself is catalytically active when assayed under optimal solution conditions and that this enzyme prefers folded nucleosomal arrays as a substrate.

Histone acetylation is a reversible dynamic process that occurs at specific lysine residues in the N termini of all the core histone proteins and has been correlated with several key biological processes, including nucleosome assembly and modulation of gene expression (1Allfrey V.

Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), have directly linked histone acetylation with nucleosome assembly and transcriptional activation, respectively. Hat1p and Gcn5p are specific examples of the two general families of HATs, termed HAT-A and HAT-B. The HAT-A enzymes reside in the nucleus and acetylate the core histone N termini following their assembly into nucleosomes and chromatin. HAT-B type enzymes are primarily cytoplasmic and acetylate only free histones prior to nucleosome assembly (6Parthun M. Widom J. Gottschling D. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), although Hat1p has recently been localized in the nucleus as well (8Ruiz-Garcı́a A.B. Sendra R. Galiana M.

Hat1p is the catalytic subunit of both the major cytoplasmic HAT-B complex and the nuclear HAT-A3 complex (8Ruiz-Garcı́a A.B. Sendra R. Galiana M. Pamblanco M. Pérez-Ortı́n J.E. Tordera V. J. Biol.

Consistent with their roles in nucleosome assembly, recombinant Hat1p, the HAT-B complex, and the HAT A-3 complex all acetylate free histone H4 in vitro but do not acetylate H4 after its incorporation into nucleosomes (5Kleff S.

However, seemingly at odds with its role as a HAT-A enzyme, Gcn5p has been reported to acetylate free histones H3 and H4 but not nucleosomal H3 or H4 (10Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A.

This result has been reconciled by a model in which Gcn5p acetylates nucleosomal substrates only when a component of specific multiprotein complexes and is supported by the recent identification of several Gcn5-Ada complexes that are capable of acetylating histone H3 and to a lesser extent H4 in nucleosomes (12Grant P.A.

Nevertheless, because all previous studies of rGcn5p activity were performed using a very limited range of buffer and substrate conditions, it remains to be determined whether other proteins are absolutely required for the HAT activity of Gcn5p or whether these proteins coincidentally accentuate Gcn5p activity in vitrounder the conditions tested previously. To address this issue, we have assayed the HAT activity of rGcn5p over a wide range of NaCl or MgCl2 concentrations, using an excess of free core histones, nucleosome core particles, and differentially folded nucleosomal arrays as substrates. Under optimal salt conditions, we find that both nucleosome core particles and nucleosomal arrays are efficiently acetylated by rGcn5p. Moreover, relative to core particles, highly condensed nucleosomal arrays are acetylated much more rapidly. Finally, whereas free histone H3 is polyacetylated by rGcn5p, nucleosomal H3 is only monoacetylated. These results demonstrate that when studied under appropriate solution conditions, rGcn5p both exhibits pronounced catalytic activity in the absence of other protein subunits and prefers folded nucleosomal arrays as a substrate. They further suggest that the structure of the H3 N termini changes upon assembly of free histones into nucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays. Whole chicken blood was purchased from Pel-Freeze. BL21 cells containing plasmid pRSET-yGCN5 were obtained from Dr. David Allis (University of Virginia). DNA templates consisting of 12 tandem repeats of a 208-base pair sequence derived from theLytechinus 5 S rRNA gene (208–12 DNA) were grown and purified from plasmid using pPOL208–12 as described previously (17Georgel P. Demeler B. Terpening C. Paule M.R. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1947-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All chemicals were of reagent grade. Core histones were purified from chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes and stored as described previously (18Hansen J.C. Ausı́o J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Core histones used in histone acetyltransferase assays were concentrated to ∼1.0 mg/ml and dialyzed into 15 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mmEDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5.0% glycerol, pH 7.8 (DB) buffer. Saturated 12-mer nucleosomal arrays (12 octamers/DNA) were assembled by combining the 208–12 template with core histone octamers and performing the salt dialysis method previously as described (18Hansen J.C. Ausı́o J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Reconstitutes were then concentrated to ∼1.0 mg/ml and dialyzed into DB buffer. Nucleosomal core particles were isolated by digestion of native chicken oligonucleosomes with micrococcal nuclease as described (19Ballestar E. Abad C. Franco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18817-18824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Core particles were concentrated to ∼1.0 mg/ml and dialyzed in DB buffer. All samples were concentrated using an Amicon Centricon concentrator (molecular weight cutoff 10,000). A 50-ml culture of Escherichia coli BL21 cells containing pRSET-yGCN5 was grown in LB broth containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin to anA 600 ≈0.30–0.50. Cells were then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Recombinant Gcn5p was purified using a Ni2+-agarose affinity column as described (7Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), concentrated to ∼70 μg/ml, and dialyzed into DB buffer. The purity of the isolated rGcn5p was determined by silver staining of overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics as described (20Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheA 260 of the samples was between 0.6 and 0.8. The integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients was determined by the method of van Holde and Weischet (21van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using Ultrascan data analysis software version 2.95 (Borries Demeler; University of Texas Health Science Center). HAT activity assays were performed with 15 μg of either free histone proteins, nucleosome core particles, or 12-mer nucleosomal arrays as substrates using a slightly modified version of the procedure described previously (22López-Rodas G. Pérez-Ortı́n J.E. Tordera V. Salvador M.L. Franco L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In a final reaction volume of 60 μl, 5 μl (0.35 μg) of rGcn5p was mixed with 0.2 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (7.2 Ci/mmol; ICN) and DB buffer containing the indicated salt concentration (shown on Fig. 1). Reactions were initiated by the addition of either histone or nucleosomal substrates, incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and quenched by spotting the sample onto GF/F glass filters (Whatman). Filters were then washed 4 times with 5 ml of 25% trichloroacetic acid and then 4 times with 5 ml of 100% ethanol using a Millipore vacuum manifold. The amount of [3H]acetate incorporated into the substrate was determined by scintillation counting. In some cases, 0.1 μCi of [14C]acetyl-CoA (63 mCi/mmol; ICN) was used in the above reaction, and samples were loaded onto either an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) or acetic acid/urea/Triton (AUT) (24Bonner W.M.

Briefly, free core histones were incubated with rGcn5p, 2.5 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA, and 2.25 nmol of unlabeled acetyl-CoA for 90 min and then resolved on an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The histones were transferred to PSQ-polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) at 1.5 mA/cm2 in a Millipore semi-dry electrophoresis unit. The band corresponding to histone H3 subsequently was excised and sequenced as described. Previous assays of rGcn5p activity have been performed exclusively in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and either no salt (7Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y.

To determine whether rGcn5p possesses the ability to acetylate nucleosomal substrates when studied over a wider range of salt conditions, HAT assays were conducted in the presence of 15 mm Tris-HCl and either 0–300 mm NaCl or 0–10 mm MgCl2, using free core histones, nucleosome core particles, and defined 12-mer nucleosomal arrays as substrates. The ability of rGcn5p to acetylate free histones remained the same in all the NaCl or MgCl2 concentrations tested, indicating that these salts do not affect Gcn5p activity per se (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, both nucleosome core particles and nucleosomal arrays were acetylated by rGcn5p only in the presence of a relatively narrow range of NaCl or MgCl2, with maximum acetylation observed in 50 mm NaCl or 2 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 1,B and C, respectively). Under conditions utilized previously by other laboratories, i.e. 0 or 100 mm monovalent cations, we also detected essentially no HAT activity using nucleosomal substrates (Fig. 1 B). In addition, rGcn5p acetylated nucleosomal arrays in 50 mm KCl but not 50 mm KCl/50 mm NaCl (data not shown), indicating that the previously reported inability of rGcn5p to acetylate nucleosomal substrates was because of the use of non-optimal salt concentrations rather than an inhibitory effect of K+. Finally, it is important to note that despite the lack of rGcn5p activity in ≥100 mm NaCl alone (Fig. 1 B), acetylation of nucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays was observed in the presence of the physiologically relevant mixture of 150 mmNaCl and 2 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). Acetylation of nucleosome core particles and nucleosomal arrays by rGcn5p in 50 mm NaCl was very similar, although nucleosomal arrays appeared to be slightly preferred under these conditions (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, rGcn5p acetylated nucleosomal arrays ∼40% faster than nucleosome core particles in 2 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 1 C). The enhanced rates of acetylation of nucleosomal arrays relative to nucleosome core particles was strongly correlated with the degree of array folding; nucleosomal arrays were only partially folded in 50 mm NaCl and extensively folded in 2 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 1 D; see Refs. 18Hansen J.C. Ausı́o J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 20Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas nucleosome core particles sedimented at the expected value of 11 S (26van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar) in both salt conditions (Fig. 1 D, inset). Importantly, no salt-dependent histone dissociation occurred under the conditions used for the HAT assays as indicated by both the sedimentation data (Fig. 1 D) and native agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). In addition, neither nucleosomes nor nucleosomal arrays were acetylated by rHat1p under comparable ionic conditions, indicating that the ability to acetylate nucleosomal substrates was rGcn5p-specific (data not shown). Taken together, the data in Fig. 1 demonstrate both that rGcn5p alone is capable of significantly acetylating nucleosomal substrates under optimal salt and substrate conditions and that rGcn5p more efficiently acetylates extensively folded nucleosomal arrays compared with partially folded arrays and nucleosome core particles. Acetylated free histones, nucleosome core particles, and nucleosomal arrays next were electrophoresed on an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine which specific core histones had been modified by rGcn5p (Fig. 2). When free histones were incubated with rGcn5p, both H3 and H4 were acetylated in 50 mm NaCl (lane 1) and 2 mm MgCl2 (lane 2), consistent with previous results (7Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, under these conditions rGcn5p acetylated essentially only H3 in both nucleosomal arrays (lanes 5 and 6) and nucleosome core particles (lanes 9 and 10). In agreement with the liquid HAT assays (Fig. 1), the extent of H3 acetylation of nucleosomal arrays in 2 mm MgCl2 was significantly greater than that observed for nucleosome core particles (Fig. 2; lanes 6and 10, respectively). No acetate incorporation was observed in the absence of rGcn5p. These results demonstrate that rGcn5p primarily modifies H3 in nucleosomal core particles and nucleosomal arrays. Given that the assembly of histones into nucleosomes decreases the overall accessibility of the H3 N termini to rGcn5p (see Fig. 1,A–C), we investigated whether the acetylation target sites in the H3 N termini also were affected. Free histones, nucleosome core particles, and nucleosomal arrays were incubated with an excess of rGcn5p and acetyl-CoA in either 2 mm MgCl2 or 50 mm NaCl for 0–90 min and analyzed by AUT gel electrophoresis (24Bonner W.M. West M.H. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The results obtained in 2 mmMgCl2 are shown in Fig. 3. Under these conditions, the N termini of free histone H3 were polyacetylated. In contrast, only monoacetylated H3 was observed in both core particles and nucleosomal arrays. No unacetylated H3 molecules remained after 90 min of incubation, indicating that all of the H3 N termini were either polyacetylated or monoacetylated in free histones or nucleosomal substrates, respectively (data not shown). Hence, when assembled into nucleosomes, only the total number of acetylatable sites within the H3 N termini were limited to acetylation by rGcn5p. Results obtained in 50 mm NaCl were similar to those in MgCl2 (data not shown). To determine the specific H3 residues acetylated in the three different substrates, microsequence analyses of the first 30 amino acid residues were performed (Fig. 3, C–E). The amount of radioactivity present in each cycle was determined by scintillation counting. Results indicated that polyacetylation of free H3 occurred at lysines 9, 14, and 18 (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, H3 was acetylated only at lysine 14 in both nucleosomal core particles and nucleosomal arrays (Fig. 3, D and E). These data indicate that the structure and accessibility of the H3 N termini change upon assembly of free histones into nucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays. Recently, it has been reported that Gcn5p is required either directly or indirectly for the acetylation of residues 9, 14, and 18 of histone H3 in vivo (13Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 27Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Our results are both consistent with these observations and extend them by showing that rGcn5p can directly acetylate all three residues of free H3 in the absence of other proteins in vitro. The recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5p, to specific genes (16Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Cote J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and the ability of acetylation to decondense repressive higher order chromatin structures (28Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P.

Our results indicate that Gcn5p action and chromatin decondensation may be directly linked. Although it has been proposed that Gcn5p must interact with other protein subunits to acetylate nucleosomal arrays (10Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), our studies have demonstrated unequivocally that rGcn5p per se is capable of acetylating both nucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays under appropriate ionic conditions, including those that approximate the ionic environment present in the nucleus. Furthermore, rGcn5p exhibits a marked preference for extensively folded nucleosomal arrays as a substrate. Cumulatively, these observations necessitate several fundamental changes in the present model of how Gcn5p functions to regulate gene expression. Gcn5p is currently viewed as an inactive enzyme that is recruited to specific promoters through interaction(s) with transcriptional coactivators and when complexed subsequently leads to local acetylation-dependent disruption of the structure of specifically targeted nucleosomes (16Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Cote J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 27Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The available data now indicate that Gcn5p both is capable of acetylating chromatin in the absence of coactivators and likely functions at the level of global chromosomal domains (i.e. ≥2–3 nucleosomes) by facilitating targeted chromatin decondensation. In support of the latter view, it is well established that extensively folded nucleosomal arrays are repressive to transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerases (28Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 31Hansen J.C. Wolffe A.P.

A. 1994; 91: 2339-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and it has recently been shown that an unexpectedly low threshold level of acetylation dramatically enhances transcription initiation and elongation by causing array decondensation (28Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Importantly, studies performed with antibodies that specifically recognize histone H3 diacetylated at Lys-91 and Lys-14 (27Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) do not contradict a more global function for Gcn5p, because these experiments would not have detected any nucleosomes acetylated only at Lys-14 of H3 (Fig. 3) that were located away from the promoter. As chromatin folds into progressively higher order structures with increasing salt concentrations, the N termini undergo significant changes in their location and accessibility (33Usachenko S.I. Bavykin S.G. Gavin I.M. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol.

Hence, the most likely explanation for the ability of Gcn5p-transcription factor complexes to acetylate nucleosomal substrates in the absence of saltin vitro (7Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T.

Although there is clearly a genetic relationship between Gcn5p and Ada proteins in yeast in vivo(35Georgakopoulos T. Gounalaki N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Candau R. Zhou J.X. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the mechanistic roles of these accessory proteins remain to be fully defined. One function may be to potentiate the activity of Gcn5p (30Syntichaki P. Thireos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, actions unrelated to inducement of Gcn5p catalytic activity, such as targeting to specific chromosomal loci or regulation of multiple acetylation site usage, also must be considered. In this regard, it should be noted that the mammalian Gcn5p has an extra ∼350-amino acid N-terminal extension not found in the yeast homologue (37Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.J.

This is in agreement with previous studies (7Stevens T.H. Brudvig G.W. Bocian D.F. Chan S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9Boelens R.

Scr. 1988; 28A: 41-46Google Scholar) which showed that a reaction with oxidized COX was only observed following prolonged incubation with NO, inducing uncoupling of cytochrome a 3 and CuB. In contrast, recent data (11Wilson M.T. Torres J. Cooper C.E. Sharpe M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12Cooper C.E. Torres J.

In this paper, we provide an explanation for these conflicting observations. On the basis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements, it has been suggested that Cl− may be bridging oxidized cytochrome a 3 and CuB when the enzyme is purified in the presence of this anion (14Li P.M. Gelles J. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Scott R.A. Li P.M. Chan S.I. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Acta. 1991; 1059: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) reported that addition of Cl− to a Cl−-free enzyme preparation is associated with slow changes in the Soret and in the reactivity toward cyanide. In addition it has been suggested that when the enzyme undergoes a cycle of reduction and reoxidation (i.e. is pulsed), Cl− dissociates (15Scott R.A. Li P.M. Chan S.I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To clarify if Cl− has an effect on the reaction of oxidized COX with NO, we have carried out a series of stopped-flow and amperometric measurements in the presence and absence of Cl−. Nitric oxide was mixed with bovine heart oxidized COX in either of two states, i.e. (i) the enzyme as prepared following the procedure of Soulimane and Buse (18Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which yields a highly active (TN > 200 s−1), fast cyanide binding and presumably Cl−-bound protein; or (ii) the same preparation having undergone a cycle of reduction and reoxidation to yield the pulsed, Cl−-free enzyme (13Torres J. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8756-8766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,19Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T. Proc.

The experiments reported below resolve the apparent discrepancies in the literature, showing that the same preparation of oxidized enzyme may or may not react rapidly with NO depending on Cl− removal/addition. Cytochrome c oxidase from beef heart, prepared according to Soulimane and Buse (18Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yields the so-calledfast enzyme as defined by Baker et al. (22Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration is expressed in terms of functional units (aa 3). NO was from Air Liquide (Paris, France). To remove Cl− and generate the pulsed state, we followed an unpublished protocol kindly provided by Prof. F. Malatesta (University of L'Aquila, Italy). Briefly, the enzyme (in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% lauryl maltoside) was reduced with dithionite and passed through a G25 column equilibrated with the above buffer containing 2 mm dithionite and catalytic amounts of catalase. After elution, the enzyme was oxidized by addition of 0.5 mm ferricyanide in air and then passed through a second G25 column and immediately used for the experiments with NO. The whole procedure typically takes ∼10 min. Stopped flow experiments were carried out using either a Durrum-Gibson apparatus equipped with a photodiode array (TN6500; Tracor Northern, Madison, WI), which acquires a 1024-elements spectrum in 10 ms, or using a single wavelength apparatus (DX.17MV; Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Noise filtering of experimental spectra was performed by singular value decomposition (23Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were collected at room temperature by using a V-550 Jasco spectrophotometer, 1 cm light-path. Amperometric NO measurements were performed at room temperature using a Clark-type NO electrode (ISO-NO, World Precision Instruments, UK) following the procedure given by Stubauer et al. (24Stubauer G. Giuffrè A. Brunori M. Sarti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For the EPR measurements, 25–40 μm COX was mixed with NO at molar ratios of 1:1, 12:1, and 30:1 NO/aa 3, and the mixture was frozen in ∼15 s. EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker EMX spectrometer with an ER 041XG microwave bridge (X-band). When NO is mixed with oxidized COX, a large absorbance change is seen with the pulsed enzyme, whereas with the enzyme as prepared only a small signal is detected (Fig. 1). The reaction corresponds to the reduction of 50–60% of cytochromea, with no spectral changes assigned to cytochromea 3 showing, in agreement with earlier work (11Wilson M.T. Torres J. Cooper C.E. Sharpe M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12Cooper C.E. Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Torres J. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8756-8766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), that the reaction with NO is only observed when the enzyme is subjected to a “pulsing” protocol. The small optical change seen with the oxidized enzyme as prepared may be due either to heterogeneity or to binding of NO to CuB, as reported by Brudvig et al. (8Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). EPR experiments (not shown) in which oxidized COX as prepared was frozen in the EPR tube within 15 s after mixing with NO showed no new signals, suggesting essentially no binding of NO to the enzyme as prepared. The reaction of oxidized COX with NO was also followed amperometrically (Fig. 2). Addition of oxidized oxidase, as prepared, to NO yields a very small signal corresponding to ∼20% of the total aa 3 (trace a); treatment of the enzyme as prepared with cyanide (3 mm for ∼1 h at 25 °C) completely abolished this reaction (trace b). The reactivity of COX toward NO increased after “pulsing,” yielding a 1:1 stoichiometry (trace c); also this reaction was abolished by incubation with cyanide (10 mm). Interestingly, when Cl− was added to the pulsed enzyme, the reactivity toward NO decayed as a function of time and reached a level similar to that of the enzyme as prepared with a half-time of ∼70 min (bottom panel of Fig. 2). Because Cl− binds to the binuclear site and affects its reactivity (14Li P.M. Gelles J. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Scott R.A. Li P.M.

Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), these experiments have been repeated in the absence of Cl−. To remove Cl− bound to the enzyme, the 2-column “pulsing” procedure, described under “Materials and Methods,” was carried out using Cl−-free buffers. Amperometric and stopped-flow experiments show that, after “pulsing” in the absence of Cl−, the extent of the NO reaction (Fig. 3, left) and cytochromea reduction (Fig. 3, right) are both time-independent (over several hours). Only upon addition of KCl does NO reactivity decay, with a half-time of ∼40–50 min (Fig. 3); this time course is similar to that of the spectral shift of the absorption maximum (from 424 to 423 nm, see Fig. 4) observed upon Cl− addition and previously assigned to Cl− binding to the enzyme (17Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This all-or-none effect on NO reactivity is because of Cl− binding and not because of an increase in ionic strength since it was not observed by adding 33 mm K2SO4 (data not shown).Figure 4Kinetics of chloride binding to oxidized cytochrome c oxidase. Time course of Cl−binding measured spectroscopically after addition of 100 mmKCl to 2.2 μm pulsed COX. Data shown were obtained by singular value decomposition analysis of the absorption changes observed over 160 min, corresponding to a shift of the Soret peak from 424 to 423 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The bimolecular rate constant of the reaction of NO with the Cl−-free enzyme was measured by stopped-flow following the reduction of cytochrome a with pulsed oxidase (Fig. 5). Amplitude analysis shows independence on [NO] down to equimolar concentration, suggesting high affinity, as already indicated by amperometric measurements (Fig. 2). Up to 200 μm NO, the observed rate constant increases linearly with ligand concentration, yielding a bimolecular rate constantk = 2.2 × 105m−1 s−1; at higher concentrations, a deviation from linearity was observed, with a limiting rate extrapolated at approximately 150–300 s−1. Torres et al. (13Torres J. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8756-8766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that, upon mixing NO with oxidized pulsed COX, a rapid (ms) reduction of cytochrome ais observed. This process was suggested to proceed via reaction of NO with the cytochrome a 3/CuB binuclear center and was presumed to occur through initial reduction of CuB and migration of the electron to the cytochromea/CuA site. Using NO concentrations >100 μm and the pulsed enzyme, as much as 50% of cytochrome a and 20% of CuA became reduced. It was argued that one electron equivalent per functional unit of the enzyme (aa 3) is donated by one NO molecule (13Torres J. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8756-8766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because this redox reaction was not observed in seemingly similar spectroscopic experiments (5Giuffrè A. Sarti P. D'Itri E. Buse G. Soulimane T. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33404-33408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Brunori M. Giuffrè A. D'Itri E. Sarti P. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1, we have been able to induce two different responses to NO for the same preparation of oxidized bovine heart COX (18Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar): (i) consistent with previous results (13Torres J. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8756-8766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), rapid reduction of cytochrome awas seen if the enzyme was subjected to a “pulsing” protocol before exposure to NO (Fig. 1, bottom); whereas in agreement with Giuffrè et al. (5Giuffrè A. Sarti P. D'Itri E. Buse G. Soulimane T. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33404-33408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), only a small reduction was observed when the enzyme as prepared was used (Fig. 1,top). Brudvig et al. (8Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) showed that, despite some sample heterogeneity, NO reacts slowly with CuB2+ and breaks the coupling between this metal and the heme of cytochromea 3, permitting the latter to exhibit its inherent g = 6 high-spin ferric signal. The reaction was shown to be slow and with low affinity (K d∼200 μm), to be reversible, and to yield no optical change; partial reduction of the binuclear center was only observed on a long time scale (hours) (8Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Palmer et al. (10Palmer G. Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Chem. Scr. 1988; 28A: 41-46Google Scholar), using a fast enzyme preparation, observed that over a 10-min period approximately 20% of the enzyme developed the g = 6 signal. Consistent with these reports (see Baker et al. (22Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), addition of NO to the fast enzyme as prepared does not generate new EPR signals within the first 15 s. Had binding to CuB2+ taken place, we would have expected to see an EPR signal arise, but we did not. Therefore, even with the fast cyanide-binding oxidized enzyme prepared by the method of Soulimane and Buse (18Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), NO (at 100 μm) does not bind within seconds. This behavior is strikingly different from the same preparation after “pulsing”, in which electron migration to cytochrome aoccurs within 100 ms at 0.85 mm NO. Incidentally, it was previously observed that the sluggish reactivity of the binuclear center of this preparation toward CO and H2O2is dramatically increased following the “pulsing” procedure (13Torres J. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8756-8766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometry of the reaction of NO with the oxidized enzyme (before and after “pulsing”) and to test if the binuclear site is the unique target for NO, we carried out amperometric measurements. The results clearly show, consistent with our stopped-flow and EPR data, that the enzyme as prepared can only react with NO to a small extent (∼20%), whereas after the “pulsing” procedure NO reaction occurs with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 2). Because these amperometric experiments were performed at very low NO and enzyme concentrations (<1 μm), we conclude that the pulsed enzyme has a high affinity for NO. In addition, since this reaction is prevented by pre-incubation of the enzyme (either as prepared or pulsed) with cyanide, this demonstrates that the binuclear site is the unique target for NO on the time scale explored. We have reconciled, therefore, experiments reported in the literature regarding the reactivity of oxidized COX with NO by showing (Fig. 1) that the NO-unreactive preparation becomes reactive after “pulsing.” However the NO reactivity of the pulsed enzyme is totally different in the presence or absence of Cl−. After “pulsing” the enzyme, the NO reactivity decreases in the presence of Cl− (Fig. 2), but is time-independent in its absence (Fig. 3) unless Cl− is added (in which case, the reactivity of the enzyme as prepared is restored). These results suggest that the enzyme as prepared according to Soulimane and Buse (18Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) contains Cl− bound, as expected from the presence of Cl− in the buffers used in the purification. During the “pulsing” procedure, reduction of the binuclear center is associated to loss of Cl−, allowing fast reaction of NO with the oxidized site, unless Cl− is newly added. In agreement with this interpretation, a spectral shift (from 424 to 423 nm) synchronous with the decay of NO reactivity was observed upon addition of Cl− to the pulsed enzyme (Fig. 4); this spectral perturbation was previously assigned to the binding of Cl− to the binuclear center of the oxidized enzyme (17Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The results depicted in Fig. 5 show that upon Cl− removal, the oxidized cytochrome a 3-CuB site is highly reactive toward NO, with a bimolecular rate constant of k = 2.2 × 105m−1 s−1 at 20 °C. An interesting observation is that at high NO concentrations (>200 μm), the rate at which cytochrome a is reduced is no longer linear with ligand concentration. This behavior is consistent with a bimolecular reaction between NO and CuB2+, followed by an intramolecular reverse electron transfer to cytochrome a (see Scheme I). Because the latter process is monomolecular, at high NO concentrations it may become rate-limiting for the reduction of cytochrome a at a rate of k = 150–300 s−1. In conclusion, our results show that the reactivity toward NO of bovine oxidized COX depends on Cl−. Our observation is in general agreement with the results on the reaction of NO with oxidizedbo from Escherichia coli, recently reported by Butler et al. (25Butler C.S. Seward H.E. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16259-16266Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the basis of optical and EPR titrations, these authors argue that, in this bacterial oxidase, two molecules of NO can bind to CuB2+ with different affinities (K d ≈ 2.3 and 33 μm) in the absence of Cl−, whereas in the Cl−-bound enzyme only one NO molecule seems to have access to the metal. Therefore, in both terminal oxidases, Cl−seems to have a similar effect, controlling the accessibility of NO to the oxidized a 3-CuB binuclear site. However, the 2:1 stoichiometry reported for NO binding to Cl−-free bo oxidase (25Butler C.S. Seward H.E. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16259-16266Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although inferred by indirect spectroscopic evidence and not measured directly by NO amperometry, seems inconsistent with the 1:1 stoichiometry measured in the case of the mitochondrial enzyme. This difference may underlie a distinct property of the two enzymes, but it cannot be excluded that the mitochondrial enzyme may bind a second NO, though with much lower affinity; our amperometric measurements may have missed detecting the second reaction, having been performed at very low enzyme and NO concentrations (<1 μm) to assess in vivoevents (4Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The point of general interest is whether this effect of Cl− might be relevant to our understanding of the reaction of NO with mitochondrial COX in vivo. Because Cl− is removed from the binuclear center by a redox cycle, and re-binding to the oxidized enzyme is extremely slow (Fig. 4), it is very likely that the enzyme during turnover is Cl−-free. One may therefore expect that in vivo the oxidized cytochrome a 3-CuB center of COX is reactive toward NO, as expected from our in vitroexperiments in the absence of Cl−. On the other hand, the reaction of NO with oxidized Cl−-free oxidase is much slower (k = 2.2 × 105m−1 s−1) than binding to reduced cytochrome a 3 (k = 1 × 108m−1 s−1, (26Blackmore R.S. Greenwood C. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19245-19249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); moreover, at the NO concentrations prevailing in different tissues (≤ 1 μm, (4Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar)), the reaction of NO with the oxidized cytochrome a 3-CuB site is expected to be much slower (≤ 0.2 s−1) than the rate of reduction of cytochrome a 3 (20–25 s−1), independent of the physical interpretation of this rate that has been assigned either to a proton gate (27Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or an electron gate (6Brunori M. Giuffrè A. D'Itri E. Sarti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19870-19874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In conclusion, it is clear that several intermediates of COX (including the O2 intermediates) can bind NO, and some of them can accept an electron from NO. The preferential target for NO based on kinetics is expected to be reduced cytochromea 3; however, because during turnover the different intermediates are differently populated, a more complete assessment of the mechanism of inhibition by NO demands an estimate of the relative populations of the various species as well as their reactivity toward NO, a job in progress."

DNA lesions that impede replication pose a severe threat to cellular survival. Much of our basic understanding of the ways that DNA damage is repaired or endured comes from bacterial systems. Exposure of Escherichia coli to factors that damage DNA or interfere with DNA replication induces the SOS regulon (1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Walker G.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 425-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This global stress response initially induces enzymes that function in the high fidelity modes of excision and recombinational repair; however, when damage is too extensive to be corrected by such conventional means, a mutagenic process is activated that permits replicative synthesis past lesions but in an error-prone manner (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995Google Scholar). The products of the umuCand umuD genes are essential to this translesion synthesis (4Kato T. Shinoura Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 5Steinborn G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although DNA polymerase III itself is capable of some misincorporation (6Bridges B.A. Mutat. Res. 1988; 198: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the UmuC and UmuD′ proteins facilitate continued extension from the mispaired base (7Bridges B.A. Woodgate R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and very recent data suggest that UmuC and UmuD′ proteins directly affect nucleotide mis-insertion (8Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) as well. Expression from the umuDC operon is induced when RecA protein is activated by single-stranded regions within damaged DNA to stimulate autodigestion of the LexA protein, the transcriptional repressor of SOS genes (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995Google Scholar). In addition to this regulatory function, “activated” RecA protein is also responsible for proteolytic processing of the inactive UmuD protein to yield the mature UmuD′ product, which is essential for mutagenesis (9Burckhardt S.E. Woodgate R. Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Kato T. Nakata A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Homodimers of the UmuD′ polypeptide associate with UmuC protein to form a mutagenically active Umu(D′)2C complex that compels DNA polymerase III to perform translesion synthesis (12Woodgate R. Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The observation that arecA deficient strain expressing UmuD′ and all other SOS-controlled proteins at constitutive levels remains nonmutable revealed that, besides mediating derepression of the umugenes and maturation of the UmuD protein, activated RecA protein has a more direct role in the mutagenic process (11Nohmi T.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3030-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The current prevailing model suggests that RecA protein targets a limiting number of Umu(D′)2C complexes to lesions within DNA, thereby ensuring productive encounters with DNA polymerase III (14Sweasy J.B.

Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Bridges B.A. Woodgate R. Mutat.

A. 1992; 89: 10777-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Evaluation of this proposal was previously hindered due to the inherent insolubility of the UmuC protein. Recently, this imitation was overcome by the efficient purification of soluble intact Umu(D′)2C complex without the need for denaturing conditions (21Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and by the subsequent reconstitution in vitro of lesion bypass that is dependent on the Umu(D′)2C mutagenic complex and RecA protein (8Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in SOS induction and mutagenesis, RecA protein promotes the homologous pairing and exchange of DNA, a process that is fundamental to genetic recombination (22Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To promote DNA strand exchange, RecA protein assembles on ssDNA1 to form a nucleoprotein filament known as the presynaptic complex; this filament then seeks homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Although the roles of RecA protein in genetic recombination and in the induction of cellular responses to DNA damage require remarkably different activities, they share a common prerequisite: assembly of an active nucleoprotein complex. Previous studies established that Umu(D′)2C overexpression antagonizes both conjugal recombination in vivo (23Sommer S. Bailone A. Devoret R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Boudsocq F. Campbell M. Devoret R. Bailone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and homologous DNA pairing assayed on membranes using crude bacterial extracts (25Szpilewska H. Bertrand P. Bailone A. Dutreix M. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Devoret and colleagues (23Sommer S. Bailone A. Devoret R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Boudsocq F. Campbell M. Devoret R. Bailone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the Umu(D′)2C proteins might bind the tip of a growing RecA protein filament, thereby both blocking RecA protein function and delivering Umu(D′)2C to the DNA lesion. Thus, it is likely that the mutagenic-targeting function of RecA protein involves the binding of Umu(D′)2C to the functional form of RecA protein and the redirection of the function of this filament to assist with mutagenic lesion bypass. To further our understanding of the initial steps in mutagenic bypass, the interaction between the purified Umu(D′)2C complex and RecA protein was examined. Here we establish that the Umu(D′)2C complex can bind along the entire length of the RecA nucleoprotein filament. RecA protein was purified using a preparative protocol based on spermidine acetate precipitation (26Griffith J. Shores C.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in combination with polyethyleneimine precipitation (27Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). SSB protein was prepared as described (28LeBowitz J. Biochemical Mechanism of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage Lambda DNA Replication.Ph.D. Thesis. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1985Google Scholar). Concentrations of RecA and SSB proteins were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 2.7 and 3.0 × 104m−1 cm−1, respectively. The Umu(D′)2C complex was purified as previously reported (21Bruck I. Woodgate R. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10767-10774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with modifications to reduce minor contaminating ATPase, nuclease, and DNA polymerase activities (8Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). RecA nucleoprotein filaments were assembled on a 5′-biotinylated oligomer (48 nucleotides in length derived from an M13mp7 sequence) that was immobilized through avidin to the carboxymethylated dextran surface of an IAsys cuvette. The two different saturated RecA-ssDNA complexes containing 1× and 2× amount of RecA protein were prepared in reaction buffer comprised of 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm ATPγS, and either 1 or 10 mmmagnesium acetate, respectively; these two different magnesium acetate concentrations enable formation of stoichiometric RecA protein-ssDNA complexes that differ by 2-fold in RecA protein content (29Lauder S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5450-5458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After each addition of Umu(D′)2C, the cuvette was washed with reaction buffer containing 2 m NaCl and again with reaction buffer to eliminate nonspecific interactions. Assays were conducted as described previously (30Rehrauer W.M. Lavery P.E. Palmer E.L. Singh R.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23865-23873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 1 mm ATP, 6 μm M13mp7 ssDNA, and 1 μm RecA protein and were initiated by the simultaneous addition of 5, 10, or 20 μm of the LexA repressor and Umu(D′)2C. The agarose gel assay for DNA strand exchange was conducted as described previously (31Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4004-4010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained 5 μm M13mp7 ssDNA, 3 μm RecA protein, 0.45 μm SSB, protein and 9 μmM13mp7 dsDNA that was linearized with EcoRI restriction endonuclease and radiolabeled at the 5′ end. Reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of the dsDNA and Umu(D′)2C. Quantitation was done using a Molecular Dynamics Storm system. The binding of Umu(D′)2C complex to a RecA nucleoprotein filament was measured directly using a biosensor instrument by monitoring the change in refractive index due to the accompanying increase in mass. In Fig. 1, two nucleoprotein filaments saturating at different concentrations of RecA protein (designated 1× and 2×) were each titrated with mutagenic complex; the filaments were formed using ATPγS, resulting in a filament that is irreversibly bound to the ssDNA and, hence, nondissociable. In both reactions, the change in refractive index (mass) increased linearly with addition of Umu(D′)2C complex until it approached an apparent plateau; the change in mass upon saturation of the nucleoprotein filament is proportional to the amount of initially bound RecA protein. Thus, the Umu(D′)2C complex binds to the RecA nucleoprotein filament with a defined stoichiometry. Given that the molecular mass of the Umu(D′)2C complex (∼ 71.4 kDa) is 1.8-fold greater than the RecA protein (∼ 38.7 kDa), if each mutagenic complex interacted with a single RecA monomer, the refractive index increase upon saturation by Umu(D′)2C would be 1.8 times that of the RecA nucleoprotein filament; if it interacted with only the tip of each filament, the increase would be negligible. Fig. 1 demonstrates that, at the equivalence point, Umu(D′)2C complex adds about 0.9-fold more mass than present at the start (the gradual, further increase is nonspecific binding to the surface, 2W. M. Rehrauer, I. Bruck, R. Woodgate, M. F. Goodman, and S. C. Kowalczykowski, unpublished observations. suggesting a stoichiometry of 2 RecA protein monomers/Umu(D′)2C complex. This binding was further confirmed by gel electrophoretic, band-shift experiments. 3E. G. Frank, N. Cheng, I. Bruck, E. H. Egelman, M. F. Goodman, A. C. Steven, and R. Woodgate, unpublished observations. Given the stoichiometry of the Umu(D′)2C-RecA protein interaction, it is reasonable to expect that the most likely binding site would be the deep groove of the RecA nucleoprotein filament. This groove is large and is the site for binding of other cellular effectors such as LexA protein (32Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). If the Umu(D′)2C complex binds to the same site, then its binding to the RecA nucleoprotein filament would be mutually exclusive with LexA repressor binding. To potentially map the interaction site of Umu(D′)2C binding, the effect of the mutagenic complex on repressor cleavage was assayed. The rate of LexA repressor proteolysis stimulated by RecA protein decreased with increasing amounts of Umu(D′)2C complex (Fig. 2). Moreover, at a constant amount of the mutagenic complex, increasing concentrations of LexA repressor result in higher rates of proteolytic digestion. These characteristics suggest that the Umu(D′)2C complex acts competitively to inhibit RecA protein-promoted cleavage of LexA repressor (with aK i of less than 0.5 μm). The simplest interpretation is that the mutagenic complex binds to the RecA nucleoprotein filament at the same or at an overlapping site as LexA repressor, although an alternative interpretation is that allosteric changes restrict binding of LexA repressor. The former conclusion is supported by direct visualization of the RecA protein-Umu(D′)2C interaction via electron microscopy.3 The binding of Umu(D′)2C complex to this site, the deep groove of the RecA filament, should occlude an interaction between the filament and homologous dsDNA, a situation similar to that established for the uncleavable LexA protein (33Harmon F.G. Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23874-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test this supposition, the effect of the Umu(D′)2C complex on the recombination function of RecA protein was tested. The mutagenic complex indeed inhibits DNA strand exchange between homologous circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA; increasing amounts of the Umu(D′)2C complex cause a greater decrease in activity (Fig. 3 A). No decrease in activity is seen in parallel reactions using either UmuD or UmuD′ proteins (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the interaction between UmuD or UmuD′ and the RecA nucleoprotein filament is much weaker than that of the Umu(D′)2C complex. Quantitative analysis of this in vitro reaction reveals that the stages of initial joint molecule formation and DNA heteroduplex extension display different sensitivities to the mutagenic complex (Fig. 3 B). Nascent joint molecule formation slows appreciably over the range of 1.0–2.0 μm of Umu(D′)2C, concentrations that are roughly equivalent to the amount of RecA protein (1.7 μm) present as part of the presynaptic complex. In comparison, the complete exchange of DNA strands to yield a circular gapped heteroduplex product is far more susceptible, approaching maximum inhibition at levels that are approximately 4-fold lower (0.30 μmUmu(D′)2C). The strong inhibition of DNA heteroduplex extension, maximal at Umu(D′)2C concentrations of 0.25–5.0 μm, shows that RecA protein recombination function is impeded at even subsaturating amounts of Umu(D′)2C. Inhibition of DNA strand exchange by Umu(D′)2C varies directly with the amount of RecA protein and ssDNA (data not shown). The inhibition of homologous pairing and exchange of DNA strands is not dependent on SSB protein,2 a characteristic that both distinguishes the effects of Umu(D′)2C proteins from those of LexA repressor (30Rehrauer W.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23865-23873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and is in precise agreement with the physiological consequences of SSB protein overproduction in vivo (34Moreau P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Umu(D′)2C affects the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein minimally.2 Collectively, these data argue that a specific interaction between the Umu(D′)2C complex and the RecA protein nucleoprotein filament is responsible for abrogating recombination function and, consequently, providing DNA polymerase III with a scaffold decorated with Umu(D′)2C that can be used for mutagenic bypass. We have established that the mature mutagenesis complex Umu(D′)2C binds directly to the activated form of RecA protein, the nucleoprotein filament that assembles on ssDNA, and that the binding site of this complex is likely to be the deep groove between turns of the RecA nucleoprotein helix. We conclude, therefore, that the Umu(D′)2C complexes modify the activity of the RecA nucleoprotein filament to which they are bound, preventing the filament from participating in both LexA repressor cleavage and normal recombination function. Although at first glance the participation of RecA protein in each of these three biological processes appears diverse, it is clear that all three processes have the common prerequisite for RecA protein in its so-called activated form. This activated form is the extended nucleoprotein filament that assembles on ssDNA in the presence of ATP or a suitable NTP analog. A major role of RecA protein is to mediate homologous recombinational repair of dsDNA breaks that arise from ever-present cellular metabolites and from interrupted DNA replication during normal cell growth (35Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). When the cell is exposed to DNA-damaging agents or when it acquires mutations that increase the normal cellular amount of ssDNA, the SOS response is induced and SOS mutagenesis occurs. Thus, in addition to its recombination function, the RecA nucleoprotein filament protein assumes new, cellular functions that are crucial for survival when excessive DNA damage is encountered. However, as we have shown here and previously (30Rehrauer W.M. Lavery P.E. Palmer E.L. Singh R.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23865-23873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Harmon F.G. Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23874-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), these functions represent mutually exclusive activities of the filament. The site for dsDNA binding is most likely to be within the deep helical groove of the RecA nucleoprotein filament (36Howard-Flanders P. West S.C. Stasiak A. Nature. 1984; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 37Stasiak A. Stasiak A.Z. Koller T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 561-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that LexA repressor binds to the same site (32Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and that such binding inhibits DNA strand exchange (30Rehrauer W.M. Lavery P.E. Palmer E.L. Singh R.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23865-23873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Harmon F.G. Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23874-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We established that the mature mutagenesis complex Umu(D′)2C behaves similarly, binding to the RecA presynaptic filament and saturating it at a stoichiometry of one Umu(D′)2C complex for every two RecA protein monomers. Furthermore, we established that the binding of Umu(D′)2C to the filament inhibits both LexA repressor cleavage and DNA strand exchange but not ATPase activity; thus blockage of these function results from the binding of Umu(D′)2C to nucleoprotein helix rather than from displacement of RecA protein from the ssDNA by Umu(D′)2C. In agreement, recent data suggest that the precursor of UmuD′ protein, the unprocessed UmuD protein, may also occupy the same site on RecA protein as do dsDNA, LexA repressor, and the Umu(D′)2C complex (38Nastri H.G. Guzzo A. Lange C.S. Walker G.C. Knight K.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 39Konola J.T. Guzzo A. Gow J.B. Walker G.C. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although our studies provide essential insight into the mechanism of SOS-induced mutagenesis, they do not, however, fully explain a critical feature of the so-called “direct role” of RecA protein in this process; it remains unclear how the Umu(D′)2C complex is actually targeted to a DNA lesion so that it can productively encounter the stalled DNA polymerase III required for translesion DNA synthesis. Indeed, if Umu(D′)2C bound randomly and with equal affinity to all sites on the RecA nucleoprotein filament, it is unlikely that the normally limiting amounts of the Umu(D′)2C complex that are produced under physiological conditions in vivo (40Woodgate R. Ennis D.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 41Sommer S. Boudsocq F. Devoret R. Bailone A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) would be sufficient to permit appropriate positioning of a Umu(D′)2C complex at a DNA lesion. Such targeting clearly occurs, however, as efficient Umu-dependent translesion synthesis is only observed in vitro in the presence of activated RecA (8Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One appealing hypothesis is that only the Umu(D′)2C proteins that are bound to the very end of the filament participate in SOS mutagenesis (24Boudsocq F. Campbell M. Devoret R. Bailone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas those bound elsewhere along the filament simply inhibit recombination and LexA cleavage. Another possibility is that the RecA nucleoprotein filament assembled on DNA-containing a lesion is somehow different from that formed on undamaged ssDNA; the DNA damage might introduce a distortion into the filament, permitting preferential recognition by the Umu(D′)2C complex and thereby targeting it to a particular location in the nucleoprotein filament, namely, the actual site of the DNA damage. The RecA protein nucleofilament is clearly an adaptable structure that can participate in recombination, SOS induction, or mutagenesis but each in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 4). These processes represent branched, competing pathways that are all potentially occurring simultaneously, depending only on the cellular levels of homologous DNA, LexA protein, or Umu(D′)2C complex, respectively, and on their relative affinities for the filament. Thus, when physiological conditions are altered to produce high levels of the Umu(D′)2C complex, recombination is inhibited. Therefore, filament-binding proteins such as Umu(D′)2C can determine the function of the RecA nucleoprotein complex and redirect a filament toward mutagenic repair. This concept leads to an encompassing view that not every RecA protein monomer need be recruited for mutagenesis, but rather only a few of the filaments are appropriated for mutagenic repair. Both the in vivo and in vitro data support the idea that a given filament can only perform one of these functions at any given time and that Umu(D′)2C is one of the factors that modifies the function of a subpopulation of nucleofilaments. With RecA protein in excess, the task of Umu(D′)2C is to appropriate an amount of that protein and use it in the mutagenic process, rather than to allow the RecA protein to participate in the (competitive) recombination process.

However, a high resolution three-dimensional structure of the nAChR or any other neuroreceptor is still missing. If available, it could provide a molecular correlate for the recognition function of the receptor and thereby also for rational drug design.Prompted by the fact that all attempts to crystallize the detergent-solubilized whole nAChR protein have been unsuccessful for the past more than 20 years, we have begun to overexpress selected domains of the receptor in bacterial expression systems. If successfully renatured, the domains that are not transmembranous should be water-soluble and thus should provide a better material for protein crystallization than the detergent-solubilized whole receptor protein. Moreover, if small enough in size, such fragments should be suited for multidimensional NMR analysis (13Fraenkel Y. Shalev D.E. Gershoni J.M. Navon G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 273-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As presented here for the N-terminal extracellular region of the nAChR α-subunit, we attempted and achieved expression as a water-soluble globular protein that displays ligand binding properties comparable to or better than those of the SDS gel-isolated α-subunit. To achieve appropriate renaturation, we developed a protocol for the complete unfolding (by means of chaotropic agents and disulfide-reducing agents) and refolding (by means of an oxido shuffling system and l-arginine as structure-stabilizing agent) of the expressed polypeptide (14Rudolph R. Tscheche H. Modern Methods in Protein and Nucleic Acid Research. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1990: 149-171Google Scholar). The experimental conditions were such that self-organization of the unfolded protein was favored at the expense of (unwanted) aggregation and denaturation. In this way, we are able to prepare large quantities of the functional ligand binding domain from inclusion bodies of transformed Escherichia coli bacteria. Our results confirm that the N-terminal extracellular domain indeed harbors major elements of the ligand recognition function of the nAChR, as has long been suggested on the basis of affinity labeling and immunological studies (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Maelicke A.

To date, it has been impossible to obtain high resolution structural information at the atomic level due to resistance of the receptor protein to crystallization attempts (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Maelicke A. Barnard E.A. Burgen A.S.V. Roberts G.C.K. Receptor Subunits and Complexes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 119-162Google Scholar,2Lindstrom J. Mol.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Therefore, attention has focused on the expression of relevant functional domains of the nAChR (such as the large extracellular loops of nicotinic α-subunits, which contain most of the determinants for binding of agonists and competitive antagonists) in heterologous systems, always with the hope of finding a general method to obtain substantial amounts of material, suitable for structural analysis at the atomic level by NMR or x-ray/crystallography.Large scale expression of recombinant proteins in E. colioften results in confinement of the desired protein in so-called inclusion bodies, which concentrate the heterologous protein in a denatured and aggregated conformation. Recently, methods have been developed to restore the functional native conformation of recombinant proteins by ensuring conditions that allow correct refolding and disulfide bond formation starting from solubilized denatured material (14Rudolph R. Tscheche H. Modern Methods in Protein and Nucleic Acid Research. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1990: 149-171Google Scholar, 28Rudolph R. Lilie H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 29Sadana A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 48: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 43Chaudhuri J.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 721: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Using an oxido shuffling system with reduced and oxidized glutathione and l-arginine as a stabilizing agent, we have been able to obtain large amounts of an α-nAChR fragment that is soluble in aqueous buffers without the use of detergents and contains the first 209 N-terminal amino acids, including relevant binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists, as demonstrated by radioligand binding experiments. The affinity for α-bungarotoxin (K D value, 0.5 nm) is lower than for whole membrane-bound receptor (0.01 nm) (26Maelicke A. Fulpius B.W. Klett R.P. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4811-4830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Maelicke A. Reich E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1976; 40: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but higher than for detergent-solubilized isolated α-subunit (100 nm) (40Haggerty J.G. Frohner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8294-8297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gershoni J.M. Hawrot E. Lentz T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These differences in affinity probably arise from the fact that in native nAChR, ligand binding sites are composed of discontinuous subsites, which contribute to the actual ligand binding domain. Most of these determinants reside within α-subunits, although there is also some contribution from neighboring (mainly β) subunits. Moreover, evidence from photoaffinity labeling experiments seemed to indicate location of toxin binding sites at the interface of subunits (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Maelicke A. Barnard E.A. Burgen A.S.V. Roberts G.C.K. Receptor Subunits and Complexes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 119-162Google Scholar, 2Lindstrom J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 15: 193-222Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar, and 16Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The missing interaction of ligands with these additional subsites could be the explanation for the 40-fold lower affinity of α-bungarotoxin to α nAChR1–209 fragment compared with the native pentameric receptor. On the other hand, the affinity of α-bungarotoxin to isolated and solubilized nAChR α-subunit is even 200-fold weaker when compared with α nAChR1–209 fragment, probably because the use of detergents is disturbing crucial secondary structure elements (see also Table II).In native nAChR, there are different agonist-binding states, namely low and high affinity states. Events leading to opening of the receptor intrinsic ion channel involve sequential binding of two molecules of agonist to the two α-subunits at relatively low affinity (EC50 of 0.1–10 μm, depending upon agonist used), followed by conformational changes that are associated with an approximately 100–1000-fold increase in affinity for nicotine, for example, and a desensitized state of the receptor, which can no longer be activated by agonist (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Maelicke A. Barnard E.A. Burgen A.S.V. Roberts G.C.K. Receptor Subunits and Complexes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 119-162Google Scholar, 2Lindstrom J. Mol.

Cybern. 1996; 75: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).K I values for displacement of α-bungarotoxin from the renatured αnAChR1–209 fragment by small nicotinic ligands are as follows: acetylcholine (69 μm), nicotine (0.42 μm), anatoxin-a (3 μm),d-tubocurarine (400 μm), and methyllycaconitine (0.12 μm); these values are very close to those reported from equilibrium binding studies employing entireTorpedo receptor (26Maelicke A. Fulpius B.W. Klett R.P. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4811-4830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the isolated Torpedoα-subunit (40Haggerty J.G. Frohner S.C. J. Biol.

A. 1983; 80: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Only in the case of acetylcholine was the affinity obtained for the αnAChR1–209 fragment significantly lower. These results again would imply that high affinity binding states for ACh might result from conformational changes recruiting additional subsites from other subunits, possibly at interfaces between subunits (see Table II for summary and comparison of K I and K D values).Secondary structure determination of the renatured α nAChR1–209 fragment by CD spectroscopy indicated 15% α-helical and 45% β-strand structure. Whereas the value for β-strand structure is consistent with data obtained for the membrane-bound and solubilized whole Torpedo nAChR by CD measurements (30Mielke D.L. Wallace B.A. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that have been obtained in two studies published so far explicitly concerning the extracellular N-terminal domain of nicotinic α-subunits. The first study used cryoelectron microscopy (36Ortells M.O. Proteins. 1997; 29: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the differences observed could be explained in terms of subtle conformational changes due to interactions at interfaces to other subunits; the theoretical model makes a prediction (20% α-helix) that is nearer to the value we obtained (15%) than to the 30% α-helix derived from cryoelectron microscopy. Taken together, the biophysical data suggest that the renaturation procedure resulted in a α nAChR1–209 fragment that appeared to be structurally homogenous and to display a secondary structure composition that is consistent with previous predictions.Expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli results in the absence of posttranslational modifications, like N-glycosylation, which are not part of the synthetic repertoire of bacteria. Native α-subunits of Torpedo nAChR are glycosylated on Asn 141, glycosylation does not affect ligand binding properties but rather seems to play an important role in transport of the different types of subunits to the plasma membrane and in the assembly of the receptor pentamer (see, e.g. Ref. 56Gehle V.M.

The biochemical parameters confirm the homogeneity and functionality of the protein, which presents an example for the production and characterization of ligand binding domains of other nAChR, namely neuronal subtypes, which are not available from natural sources in high amounts, or from other members of the multigene superfamily of five-subunit ionotropic receptors, like γ-aminobutyric acidA, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptamine3 or glutamate receptors.To date, only the expression of short nicotinic receptor-fragment peptides, comprising mainly the assumed acetylcholine-binding site around the two adjacent cysteines 192 and 193, has been achieved in E. coli (41Gershoni J.M. Hawrot E. Lentz T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and a NMR solution structure of such peptides in complex with α-bungarotoxin has been published (44Basus V.J. Song G Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12290-12298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, there were entries in the Protein Data Bank at Brookhaven National Laboratory of the NMR solution structures of the M2 membrane-spanning domains (which are assumed to contribute to the ion channel pore) of rat nAChR and human glutamate receptor of N-methyl-d-aspartate-subtype NR1, which have been expressed in E. coli and reconstituted in artificial micelles (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1A11 and 2NR1). In summary, expression in E. coli and reconstitution of functional domains of neurotransmitter receptors appears to be an attractive possibility to obtain detailed structural information in the absence of successful crystallization of the whole receptor protein. Alternative strategies include recent successful attempts to express the N-terminal domain of mouse muscle α-nAChR in the membranes of Xenopus oocytes or Chinese hamster ovary cells (53West Jr., A.P.

Solubility and yield remained problematic, although these systems have advantages with respect to posttranslational modifications.Also, for drug screening, large scale expression of neuroreceptor ligand binding domains offers attractive perspectives: pathological alterations of ligand-gated neuroreceptor ion channels are implicated in diseases or pathological conditions such as endogenous depression (γ-aminobutyric acidA receptors and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors) (47Broekkamp C.L.

So far, most of our knowledge on the three-dimensional structure of neuroreceptors is based on a combination of electronmicroscopical, biochemical and immunological data obtained for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)1 from the electric ray Torpedo (1Maelicke A.

However, a high resolution three-dimensional structure of the nAChR or any other neuroreceptor is still missing. If available, it could provide a molecular correlate for the recognition function of the receptor and thereby also for rational drug design. Prompted by the fact that all attempts to crystallize the detergent-solubilized whole nAChR protein have been unsuccessful for the past more than 20 years, we have begun to overexpress selected domains of the receptor in bacterial expression systems. If successfully renatured, the domains that are not transmembranous should be water-soluble and thus should provide a better material for protein crystallization than the detergent-solubilized whole receptor protein. Moreover, if small enough in size, such fragments should be suited for multidimensional NMR analysis (13Fraenkel Y. Shalev D.E. Gershoni J.M. Navon G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 273-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As presented here for the N-terminal extracellular region of the nAChR α-subunit, we attempted and achieved expression as a water-soluble globular protein that displays ligand binding properties comparable to or better than those of the SDS gel-isolated α-subunit. To achieve appropriate renaturation, we developed a protocol for the complete unfolding (by means of chaotropic agents and disulfide-reducing agents) and refolding (by means of an oxido shuffling system and l-arginine as structure-stabilizing agent) of the expressed polypeptide (14Rudolph R. Tscheche H. Modern Methods in Protein and Nucleic Acid Research. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1990: 149-171Google Scholar). The experimental conditions were such that self-organization of the unfolded protein was favored at the expense of (unwanted) aggregation and denaturation. In this way, we are able to prepare large quantities of the functional ligand binding domain from inclusion bodies of transformed Escherichia coli bacteria. Our results confirm that the N-terminal extracellular domain indeed harbors major elements of the ligand recognition function of the nAChR, as has long been suggested on the basis of affinity labeling and immunological studies (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Maelicke A.

DISCUSSIONThe Torpedo nAChR has been established as the prototypic model for fast ligand-gated ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system due to its abundance in electric organs of electric fish (Torpedo and Electrophorus), which made it accessible to detailed biochemical and biophysical studies. To date, it has been impossible to obtain high resolution structural information at the atomic level due to resistance of the receptor protein to crystallization attempts (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Maelicke A.

https://openalex.org/W2317626938,"The SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, negatively regulates hematopoietic cell signaling. SHP-1 is associated with a tyrosine phosphorylated, plasma membrane-spanning glycoprotein, pp130, in colony stimulating factor-1 stimulated or unstimulated macrophages. This association is phosphotyrosine dependent and is mediated by the amino-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1. pp130 behaves as a substrate of SHP-1 in vitro and is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine in SHP-1 deficient macrophages from viable-motheaten mice. Co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that pp130 is the product of the mouse p91/PIR-B gene that encodes a member of the killer cell inhibitory receptor (KIR)/leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LIR) family. By analogy to the KIRs, p91/PIR-B may represent a novel class of macrophage receptors which act to suppress macrophage activation. These observations identify SHP-1 interactions with and regulation of p91/PIR-B as a potential mechanism for inhibiting the signaling cascades linking extracellular stimuli to macrophage activation and/or development."

Among insects, oxygen-carrying molecules are very rare. They have been reported for a few Hemiptera (Macrocoryxa, Buenoa, Anisops), where they are intracellularly localized monomeric molecules with a tendency to dimerization (Mb1-type). In the Diptera, globins are found, in high concentrations, in the hemolymph of midge larvae (Hb-type). Despite their extracellular location, dipteran Hb have low M r and are found in monomeric (M r ∼16,000) or dimeric forms. The Hbs of all insect species studied show a high degree of polymorphism. InChironomus thummi thummi, 12-stage and tissue-specific Hb types have been identified at the protein level, whereas at the gene level even more globin genes can be identified. A similar situation can be expected to exist in other species as well (1Goodman M. Braunitzer G. Kleinschmidt I. Aschauer H. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol.

Although the chironimid Hbs have no more than ∼20% residues in common with sperm whale Mb, they display a similar tertiary structure. The orientation of the heme group in the apolar pocket of these globins, however, differs from that in vertebrate Mbs and Hbs by a 180° rotation about the α-γ-meso axis (4Huber R. Epp O.

Globin genes of many species from deeply separated eukaryotic phyla, contain a B- and a G-helix intron at the positions B12.2 and G7.0, respectively, whereas plant Hb genes contain an additional intron in the E-helix (E15.0) (for reviews, see Refs. 2Vinogradov S.N.

The conservation of the B- and G-helix intron insertion position during globin gene evolution is frequently used as an argument for the intron early theory (9Gilbert W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Gilbert W. Glynias N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 135: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Gilbert W. Souza S.J.

Nature. 1984; 310: 795-797Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, Chironomus globin genes containing an E-helix intron have been characterized recently, and it is suggested that this intron must be the result of a recent insertion event, supporting the intron late theory (14Cavalier-Smith T.

In the lower metazoa, both intron number and insertion position in globin genes are variable (2Vinogradov S.N. Walz D.A. Pohajdak B. Comp. Biochem.

TheChironomus globin gene structure is therefore not a valid paradigm of insect globin genes. The larvae of the bot fly, Gastrophilus intestinalis(Insecta, Diptera) live attached to the inside of horses' stomachs. A Hb is present at millimolar concentration in highly tracheated cells forming the posterior spiracular plate (19Keilin D. Wang Y.L. Biochem.

It enables the larvae to make better use of intermittent contact with air swallowed with food. Preliminary measurements showed that thek off for this Hb is an order of magnitude lower than that observed for vertebrate Mb and Aplysia and lamprey Hb (20Phelps C. Antonini E. Brunori M. Kellett G. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown for nematode Hbs that the oxygen affinity may be strongly influenced by the nature of the B10 side chain (22De Baere I. Perutz M. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Proc.

Therefore, knowledge of the primary and tertiary structure of G. intestinalis Hb will be required for a detailed understanding of its functional properties, particularly in relation to the many known examples of amino acid substitutions in hemoglobin distal sites (24Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We here describe the isolation and functional and structural characterization of globins and a globin gene from the parasitic dipteran G. intestinalis. Live specimens of G. intestinaliswere collected from a local slaughterhouse. The spiracular plates were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and powdered. After extraction in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM; Boehringer Mannheim) and 0.5% (w/w) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, the suspension was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 and 110,000 × g for 10 and 45 min, respectively. Hb was collected in the fraction precipitating between 65 and 95% ammonium sulfate (20Phelps C. Antonini E. Brunori M. Kellett G. Biochem.

Hydrophobic interaction chromatography was performed on a phenyl-Sepharose CL 4B column (1 × 15 cm) equilibrated in 1.8 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1. Purified Hb was eluted with 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Ion exchange chromatography was run on Whatman DE-52 and CM-Sepharose 4B according to previously published methods (25Blaxter M.L.

NativeM r was determined by gel filtration on a Zorbax GF 450 column in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl using bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, myoglobin, and cytochrome c as standard proteins for calibration. Absorption spectra of G. intestinalis Hb were measured for the various forms and conditions using an SLM (DW2000) spectrophotometer or an HP 8453 equipped with a diode array detector. To study autoxidation, the sample was first reduced with a slight excess of sodium dithionite to obtain a ferrous deoxy stock of about 100 mm. An aliquot was then diluted 9-fold by injection into a cuvette containing buffer at 37 °C and equilibrated under 1 atmosphere of oxygen, and the spectra were recorded versustime. Kinetics of ligand binding were measured by flash photolysis. Laser pulses of 10 ns at 532 nm (Quantel, France) were used, with detection at 436 nm. The kinetics were studied for samples equilibrated with air or CO. To determine the oxygen off-rate, kinetics were measured by stopped flow (Biologic, Claix, France) by mixing an oxyHb sample with a solution of sodium dithionite. The association rate of CN was measured by taking spectra every 10 s using the HP 8453 spectrometer after mixing solutions of KCN and oxidized G. intestinalis Hb. Electrospray mass spectra were recorded on a VG Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Manchester, UK) equipped with a Kontron HPLC system (Kontron Instruments, Milan, Italy) consisting of a 325 pump, an HPLC autosampler, and a 332 HPLC detector as described previously (26Rashid K.A.

Elsevier North Holland, Amsterdam1989Google Scholar). Resulting peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, subjected to electroblotting and RP-HPLC using a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile system. Peptides were sequenced in a ABI 471-B sequencer operated as recommended by the manufacturer. A degenerate primer was designed based on the protein sequence data. GU1 (5′-CAYTTYCCNTGGTTYAARGA-3′) is a 20-mer with 64 redundancies, corresponding to the sense strand predicted by the peptide fragment His-Phe-Pro-Trp-Phe-Lys-Glu. mRNA was isolated from G. intestinalis with a FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using an oligo(dT) primer. A PCR reaction was then performed using the GU1 and oligo(dT) primers. Positive fragments were purified, cloned, and sequenced as described (29Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M-L. Vanfleteren J. Esmans E.L. Marden M. Griffon N. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19865-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The 5′-end was obtained by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment (30Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the specific primer GPH3, (5′-TTGACGACGACAATCTACTA-3′). A poly(A) tail was added to the 3′-end of the cDNA with terminal deoxytransferase. A PCR was then carried out using oligo(dT) and the specific nested primer GPH5 (5′-TCGTCAACCTGACGCAAGAT-3′). Amplification was done for 30 cycles each consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min of 72 °C. A nested PCR was then performed on the amplified product using oligo(dT) and GPH6, (5′-GTTCTCAGGCAAGTCGTCGA-3′). Positive fragments were subsequently purified, cloned, and sequenced as described. Genomic DNA was isolated fromG. intestinalis tissue using theN-acetyl-N, N, N-trimethylammoniumbromide method (31Winnepenninckx B. Backeljau T. De Wachter R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 409Google Scholar). The gene was amplified in two parts. First, a PCR of 30 cycles, each consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C, was done using the primers GPH7 (5′-CGCAAGTGCTCATTCTAATTCC-3′) and GPH6. On this amplification mixture, a nested PCR was done with the primers GPH7 and GPH4. A second fragment was obtained using the primers GU1 and GPH3 in a PCR of 35 cycles, each consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C. This mixture was reamplified under the same conditions to give a positive fragment. Both fragments were subsequently purified, cloned in the TA vector pMOS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequenced as described. Genomic DNA was digested separately withEcoRI, EcoRV, and HindIII. Restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and denatured DNA was transferred to a Hybond N membrane (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After immobilizing by ultraviolet irradiation and prehybridization (in 40% formamide, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.9 m NaCl) at 42 °C for 3–4 h, the filter was hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the same prehybridization mixture with the denatured probe added. A genomic PCR fragment from the Hb of G. intestinalis,32P-labeled by nick translation, was used as a probe. The filter was washed at 65 °C 1 time for 15 min in 2× disodium citrate, 0.1% SDS; rinsed in 2× disodium citrate; and exposed to autoradiography for 5 days at −70 °C. The physicochemical conditions for freshly made G. intestinalis Hb crystal growth were explored using ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycols as precipitating agents, varying protein concentration and pH, at 4 °C. Despite the isolation of thin needle-like crystals from ammonium sulfate solutions in a wide pH range (5.5–8.5), large G. intestinalis Hb single crystals (about 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.4 mm3) could be grown only from polyethylene glycol 4000 solutions (25%, w/v), 0.02m Tris buffer, in the pH 8–9 range, at a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml. These crystals grow as rounded, hollow hexagonal prisms, in equilibrium with noncrystalline precipitated protein. The use of different molecular weight polyethylene glycols (400 up to 8000) and the addition of different salts did not improve the crystal growth yield. Isolated crystals were dissolved in diluted buffer and subjected to electron spray mass spectrometry analysis. A preliminary x-ray diffraction data set was collected on one crystal, at room temperature, using a Rigaku R-axis IIc image plate system coupled to a RU200HB rotating anode generator, measuring diffracted intensities to approximately 3-Å resolution. Data reduction and analysis was performed with MOSFLM and programs from the CCP4 suite (33Leslie A. Crystallographic Computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 110-125Google Scholar, 34Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). mRNA was extracted as described earlier. Full-length cDNA of the Hb was obtained by RT-PCR using specific primers containing the correct adaptors. The forward primer (5′-GCGCATATGAACAGCGAGGAAGTCAATGAC-3′) contains a NdeI restriction site that covers the initiating Met codon of the globin gene. The reverse primer (5′-GCGGGATCCGCGAGTTGTTGCTTCGAGAGTAG-3′) contains a BamHI restriction site. The amplified product was cleaned and cut with NdeI and BamHI and subsequently ligated into the equivalently cleaved expression vector pET3a (35Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Recombinants obtained in the E. coli strain XL1-Bleu were tested by PCR and restriction digests. The complete sequence and correct orientation were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The expression plasmid, which we designate SDGASEXP5, was then transformed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. The cells were grown at 25 °C in LB media containing 300 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid. The culture was induced at A 600 = 0.8 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and growth was continued overnight. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 1 mm EDTA, pH 8; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; and a protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were then exposed to 3 freeze-thaw steps and were sonicated until completely lysed. The overexpression of the globin in the total cell extract was verified by spectral analysis and SDS-PAGE. Gel filtration, under native conditions, of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated Hb fraction clearly demonstrates a single Hb peak with an apparentM r of 21,700 ± 1500 (Fig. 1 A). This is in contrast with the M r of 35,000 reported from equilibrium centrifugation (19Keilin D. Wang Y.L. Biochem. J. 1946; 40: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Phelps C. Antonini E. Brunori M. Kellett G. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The possibility of a disulfide- and/or concentration-dependent dimerization, however, cannot be excluded. Analysis by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE reveals a broad band of M r 17,000 ± 1000, confirming the minimumM r of 17,500 calculated from heme content (20Phelps C. Antonini E. Brunori M. Kellett G. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B).The apparent difference in M r obtained by both techniques cannot be explained readily. Despite this difference, we conclude that theG. intestinalis Hb is monomeric and monodomain. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL 4B eliminates an enzyme impurity responsible for a fast oxidation of the Hb (not shown). After this treatment, the G. intestinalis Hb preparation is stable even at room temperature; autoxidation, however, still takes place. The number of globin chains in G. intestinalis Hb preparation was determined by mass spectrometry and IEF. Electron spray mass spectrometry analysis of the native Hb in solution reveals three major mass categories of 17,965 ± 2 (major fraction) and 18,080 ± 2 and 18,264 ± 2 (minor fractions). In crystallized Hb, the same mass types were recognized in equal amounts but at twice the M r found in solution (TableI). Analysis of the G. intestinalis Hb fraction by IEF under native and denaturing conditions results in patterns with multiple bands. This could arise through several mechanisms: (i) different charge types due to ligand heterogeneity; (ii) presence of a single Hb isoform with post-translational modifications; (iii) presence of different genetically defined isoforms; (iv) the creation of artificial isoforms by the IEF method; or (v) a combination of all above mentioned reasons.Table IMass of G. intestinalis globin isoforms as determined by mass spectrometryMassabcTotal hemoglobin in crystals35,926 ± 236,154 ± 236,528 ± 2Total hemoglobin in solution17,965 ± 218,080 ± 218,264 ± 2After isoelectrofocusing17,965 ± 218,080 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Separation of the Hb fraction by native IEF without stabilizing the ligand resulted in six major bands (Fig. 2 A). Eluting and rerunning each single band results in the creation of an additional “position.” Assuming combined effects of progressive loss of oxygen and oxidation during the elution and IEF process, we hypothesize that there are two major “positions,” one representing the oxyHb form and the other representing the metHb form. At least two major bands were visible in each of these positions (Fig. 2 A). The shift of the oxyHb form to more basic pI by oxidation is compatible with this view. The eluted six major bands were subjected to mass spectrometry. Two mass types of 17,965 ± 2 and 18,080 ± 2 were found, confirming previous results. Therefore, we conclude that G. intestinalis contains at least two different globin chains, which occur as dimers in the crystallized Hb. The fact that the 18,264 ± 2 mass compound cannot be seen in IEF is most likely due to its low abundance (minor fraction). IEF of total G. intestinalis Hb under denaturing conditions results in a pattern with four major bands and a few minor ones (Fig. 2 B).When each band observed under native as well as denaturing conditions is rerun under denaturing conditions, a nearly identical pattern is obtained. We therefore conclude that the band multiplicity observed under denaturing conditions is probably artificially created by the IEF method used. Many examples exist of pure proteins displaying a multiple banding/spot pattern under two-dimensional electrophoretical conditions (27Gorg A. Boguth G. Obermaier C. Posch A. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Attempts to separate these globin chains by ion exchange chromatography and/or RP-HPLC under different conditions were unsuccessful. Therefore one-dimensional semipreparative IEF on pH 6–10 linear immobilized pH gradient strips in denaturing conditions followed by C4 RP-HPLC was performed to collect homogeneous G. intestinalis Hb1 (Fig. 3). Mass spectrometry of purifiedG. intestinalis Hb1 reveals a single component with a mass of 17,965 ± 2, confirming our previous data. G. intestinalis Hb shows absorption spectra typical of Hb or Mb for the oxy, deoxy and carbon monoxy forms. This is generally the case, since the ferrous protein spectra are not sensitive to moderate structural changes (36Brantley Jr., R.E. Smerdon S.J. Wilkinson A.J. Singleton E.W. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6995-7010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the spectrum of the oxidized form (metHb) is sensitive to pH and protein structure. As a function of pH, they will show an acid-alkaline transition when a water molecule is replaced by an OH− as the heme iron ligand. The pK of this transition is also influenced by the residue at the distal position (E7). For human Hb and sperm whale Mb, both displaying an E7 His, this pK is about 8–9, whereas for Aplysia Mb, having an E7 Val it is 7.6 (37Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). The apparent pK for the acid-alkaline transition of G. intestinalis Hb is near pH 7.7 (Fig. 4). This is low for a hemoprotein with an E7 His, suggesting the effect of other residues of the heme environment. For G. intestinalis Hb, an oxygen association rate of 10 μm−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate of 2.4 s−1 at 25 °C were determined from the ligand rebinding kinetics (Fig. 5). These results are compatible with those of Phelps (20Phelps C. Antonini E. Brunori M. Kellett G. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), who obtained an oxygen dissociation rate of 1 s−1 at 20 °C and calculated a partition coefficient (K CO/ KO2) of 0.5. The hemoglobin from G. intestinalis can therefore be classified as a high affinity Hb having normal on-rates but a reduced rate of oxygen dissociation (TableII).Table IIKinetic constants for selected hemoglobins and myoglobinsSpeciesk on(O2)k off(O2)k on (CO)M(K CO/K O2)1/k oxReferenceμm−1s−1s −1μm−1s−1hHuman Hb (Vertebrata)405062000.0237Antonini E.

https://openalex.org/W2330878451,"Although paclitaxel is an important chemotherapy agent for the treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, its utility is significantly limited by the frequent development of drug resistance. Recent evidence suggests that resistance to chemotherapy may be partly related to defects in the apoptotic pathway. In this study we have investigated whether enhancement of apoptotic pathway function through stable expression of the BAD protein is capable of sensitizing human epithelial ovarian cancer cells to the effects of chemotherapy. Expression of HA-BAD in six separate clonal transfectants from two different ovarian cancer cell lines was found to significantly enhance the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel, vincristine, and, to a lesser extent, etoposide. Enhancement of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in HA-BAD-expressing clones was demonstrated by trypan blue exclusion, clonogenic cell assay, and flow cytometric evaluation. Importantly, this effect was associated with binding of HA-BAD to BCL-xL and concomitant disruption of BAX:BCL-xL interaction. Taken together, these data suggest that the development of small molecules which mimic the effects of BAD may represent a new class of drugs capable of preventing or reversing resistance to chemotherapy agents such as paclitaxel."

Several overlapping genomic clones containing the murine HSF-1 gene were isolated from a phage genomic library. Results indicate that the HSF-1 gene contains 13 exons that span at least 30 kilobase pairs. Sequence analysis of the 5′-untranslated region of HSF-1 suggests that it contains sequences of a recently described Bop1 gene in reverse orientation within its first 331 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translation initiation site. The minimal promoter sequence required for HSF-1 basal expression was identified by deletion analysis from −4 kilobase pairs to −331 bp of the promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene using transient transfection assays. Results indicate that 331 bp upstream of the HSF-1 translation start site is required for maximal basal expression in NIH3T3 and F9 cells. This fragment also results in high levels of luciferase activity in the reverse orientation, that is, 5′ to the Bop1 gene, suggesting that this segment is bidirectional and could be utilized for basal expression of both HSF-1 and Bop1 genes. This segment of the promoter contains recognition elements for Sp1 and CCAAT-box binding transcription factors, which when mutated in either sense or antisense orientations to the HSF-1 gene results in a reduction of basal expression by 50–75% relative to wild type, suggesting that these sites are critical for basal expression of both HSF-1 and Bop1 genes.

Comparisons of HSF protein structure in a variety of organisms indicate the presence of a conserved DNA binding domain and three hydrophobic heptad repeats that constitute the trimerization domain. These domains are located within the amino-terminal region of the protein. The stress-responsive transcriptional activation domain is located in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule. Intramolecular interactions between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal coiled coil domains of HSF keep the protein in an inactive state under nonstress growth conditions (8Rabindran S.K. Raymond R.I.

In human and mouse, HSF-1 has been shown to activate transcription of various heat shock proteins in response to heat shock as well as other environmental stresses (5Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 7Schuetz T.J. Gallo G.J. Sheldon L. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HSF-2, on the other hand, does not respond to heat stress but has been shown to activate transcription of heat shock proteins in response to hemin in erythroleukemia cells (28Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Philips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar,29Mivechi N.F. Young-Mee K.Park Ouyang H. Shi X-Y. Hahn G.M. Leuk. Res. 1994; 18: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HSF-2 activity is also detected during mouse spermatogenesis (30Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.K. Kirby J.D. Mayo K.E. Morimoto R.I. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1334-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The third HSF isoform, HSF-3, is found in chicken and has recently been shown to be activated by c-Myb in the absence of cellular stress (6Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1983-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,31Kanei-Ishii C. Tankawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another isoform, HSF-4, has been found in human cells but seems to lack the property of a transcriptional activator (32Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Other levels of regulation described for HSF-1 and HSF-2 in mammalian cells is the presence of α and β isoforms (33Fiorenza M.T. Farkas T. Dissing M. Kolding D. Zimarino V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These are alternate splice variants of HSF-1 and HSF-2 that recently were shown to be expressed differentially during development (35Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In these studies, we have isolated and analyzed several overlapping genomic clones of murine HSF-1 to examine its gene structure. The HSF-1 promoter was also analyzed to determine the minimal promoter sequences required for basal expression and the binding sites for transcription factors responsible for HSF-1 basal expression. Our results show that HSF-1 contains 13 exons, which span an area of more than 30 kb. The promoter analysis of HSF-1 suggests the presence of binding sites for several transcription factors, some of which appear to be involved in tissue-specific expression for HSF-1. Further, the first exon of the recently described Bop1 gene is found within the first 331 bp upstream of the HSF-1 translation initiation site. The Bop1 gene is in an opposite orientation to the HSF-1 gene. Furthermore, HSF-1 and Bop1 control elements are at least partly shared, as the fragment between them drives transcription of both genes.DISCUSSIONWe have reported the cloning and sequencing of a large segment of the murine HSF-1 gene as well as its 5′-flanking region. The gene spans over 30 kb of DNA and contains 13 exons. Exon 1 and 2 are separated by an intron larger than 18 kb. The murine HSF-1 gene expresses two alternative splice variants (33Fiorenza M.T. Farkas T. Dissing M. Kolding D. Zimarino V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O-K. Sarge K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5288-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Exon 11 is present in the α isoform but deleted in the β isoform. The significance of the α and β isoforms is not clear at the present time. However, in the case of HSF-2, it has been suggested that the shorter version, HSF-2β, is a negative regulator of HSF-2α during development (35Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Saarento H. Sarge K.D. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15293-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential expression of α and β isoforms could regulate the activity of HSF-2 by possibly competing for trimer formation. A similar function has not been proposed for murine HSF-1β. Although the cDNA sequence originally cloned for HSF-1 represented the shorter HSF-1β isoform, it appears to be transcriptionally active in the context of an HSF-1 chimeric protein in which the heterologous GAL-4 DNA binding domain was fused to HSF-1 (39Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).An interesting finding is the observation that the murine HSF-1 promoter belongs to the family of TATA-less promoters. Other genes whose expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner and often are housekeeping genes also lack TATA consensus sequences. These include synapsin I (40Sauerwald A. Hoesche C. Oschwald R. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), brain specific aldolase C (41Buono P. DeConciliis L. Olivetta E. Izzo P. Salvatore F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), nerve growth factor (42Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and lymphocyte CD4 (43Salmon P. Giovane A. Wasylyk B. Klatzmann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7739-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There is also no CAAT box at the appropriate position, usually 25 bp upstream of the transcriptional start-site (44Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar), although there is one located 95 bp upstream of the transcription start site, and it appears to be an active site (Fig. 6).Another feature of the murine HSF-1 gene is the presence of the Bop1 gene within 331 bp of the HSF-1 translation initiation site. This region of the HSF-1 promoter appears to be bidirectional and drives the expression of both HSF-1 and Bop1 genes in a manner similar to the human monoamine oxidase A or mouse thymidylate synthase genes (45Zhu Q.-S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Liao W.-C. Geneg Y. Johnson L.F. Gene. 1994; 146: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the 331-bp fragment of the HSF-1 promoter yields higher levels of basal expression for Bop1 than for HSF-1 by as much as 3-fold. The activity of the larger promoter fragments, that is, the 379-bp or 1-kb fragments fused to the luciferase reporter gene in the direction of HSF-1 gene, were progressively reduced. The activity of the 2-kb promoter fragment was consistently higher than the 1-kb fragment. The activities of 3- and 4-kb fragments were again reduced from that observed for the 2-kb fragment fused to the luciferase gene.Basal promoter function for HSF-1 was demonstrated by comparison of relative luciferase activities of specific constructs in NIH3T3 and F9 cells. Studies designed to show inducibility by serum following serum starvation or cotransfection with c-Ha-Ras expression plasmids failed to show significant response to these inducers in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). As our results indicate, the 331-bp upstream of the HSF-1 translation start site drives the highest levels of basal expression. This segment contains two Sp1 sites, which were tested for DNA binding activity. Binding was observed for the Sp1–2 site but not the Sp1–1 site. This perhaps is not surprising because the Sp1–1 site is located downstream of the HSF-1 cDNA start site, although upstream of the initiator codon. Supershift experiments using anti-Sp1 antibody confirmed the identity of the factor binding at the Sp1–2 site. The Sp1 transcription factor has previously been shown to be bidirectional (47Guarguaglini G. Battistoni A. Pittoggi C. Dimatteo G. DiFiore B. Lavia P. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and, according to the data shown in Fig. 6, the Sp1–2 site contributes to the expression of both the HSF-1 and Bop1 genes. Sp1 sites represent functional elements in different cell types and promoter contexts and contribute to basal transcription from minimal promoters by promoting interactions between Sp1 and general factors of the preinitiation complex (48Pugh B.F. Tijian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is known that Sp1 elements can confer either negative or positive gene expression (49Datta P.K. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5444-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,50Shilling L.J. Farnham P.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar).There are several other potential binding sites within the 331-bp fragment of the HSF-1 5′-untranslated region that were also tested for their ability to drive basal expression of the HSF-1 or Bop1 genes. These included CTF, that is known to also drive basal expression and is found in promoters of heat shock genes (51Morgan W.D. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Greene J. Kingston R.E. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The mutation of this CTF site in sense or antisense orientations to the HSF-1 gene also reduced basal transcriptional activity, suggesting CTF is also contributing to the basal expression of both HSF-1 and Bop1 genes. The binding sites for transcription factors TCF-1α (T cell factor 1) and AP2, which may regulate tissue-specific expression of HSF-1, were also tested by gel mobility shift assay or mutational analysis. The TCF-1 binding activity using purified TCF-1α (LEF-1) protein also showed binding activity at the TCF-1α-1 site. The TCF-1α-1 binding site is located in the first exon of HSF-1 (Fig. 2) and therefore, most likely does not drive HSF-1 expression. However, it could drive the expression of the Bop1 gene. TCF-1 and the closely related LEF-1 are transcription factors expressed during murine T cell differentiation, which regulates the T cell receptor α enhancer (52Carlsson P. Waterman M.L. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 53Okamura R.M. Sigvardsson M. Galceran J. Verbeek S. Clevers H. Grosschedl R. Immunity. 1998; 8: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), although LEF-1 is 10 times more efficient in stimulating the T cell receptor α enhancer than TCF1. TCF-1α and LEF-1 have identical DNA binding properties, and binding sites have been identified in transcriptional control regions of several T lymphocyte-specific genes. Mutation of the TCF-1α-1 site in the sense orientation to Bop1 gene followed by its transfection into T cells suggested that this site could stimulate the expression of the Bop1 gene. The transcription factor AP2 was originally purified from HeLa cells. There are three different isoforms, namely, α, β and γ coded by three different genes. All three genes are coexpressed strongly in early promigratory and migrating neural crest cells (54Moser M. Pscherer A. Roth C. Becker J. Mucher G. Zerres K. Dixkens C. Weis J. Guay-Woodford L. Buettner R. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1938-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar,55Luscher B. Mitchell R.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mutation of the AP2 site, however, suggested it was not an active binding site for the AP2 transcription factor in NIH3T3 cells that have previously been shown to express this factor (36Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.A. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W.J. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).In terms of expression patterns of the HSF-1 and Bop1 genes, it appears that both genes are expressed constitutively via the activity of two transcription factors involved in basal expression, namely Sp1 and CTF. This is consistent with the previous reports that HSF-1 is present constitutively in all adult tissues (5Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 32Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), although less is known about its expression pattern during embryonic development. In the case of the Bop1 gene, there is no published report of its expression pattern or whether this gene is also a transcriptional regulatory factor. However, in the studies reported here, the promoter fragment of the HSF-1 gene can drive high levels of basal expression of a luciferase reporter gene by as much as 500- to 1000-fold when compared with pGL2-Basic when fused to the luciferase gene in sense or antisense orientations. The heat shock transcription factors (HSFs)1 have been cloned from a variety of organisms. Studies suggest that yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and Drosophila each contain one gene (1Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B.

Biol. 1993; 13: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas two separate genes have been cloned in mouse cells and three genes each in human and chicken cell (4Rabindran S.K.

Comparisons of HSF protein structure in a variety of organisms indicate the presence of a conserved DNA binding domain and three hydrophobic heptad repeats that constitute the trimerization domain. These domains are located within the amino-terminal region of the protein. The stress-responsive transcriptional activation domain is located in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule. Intramolecular interactions between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal coiled coil domains of HSF keep the protein in an inactive state under nonstress growth conditions (8Rabindran S.K. Raymond R.I. Haroun I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, HSF-1 binds to conserved regulatory sequences known as heat shock elements, where it controls the expression of heat shock proteins in response to stress (9Wu C. Nature. 1984; 311: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 11Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B.

The heat shock elements consists of multiple inverted repeats of AGAAN located upstream of heat shock genes (15Cunniff N.F.A. Morgan W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8317-8324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7592-7603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, HSF is constitutively bound to heat shock elements, whereas in most organisms a stress is required for HSF to trimerize and bind to DNA (11Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Nature. 1987; 329: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cotto J.J. Kline M.

In mammalian cells, HSF-1 is phosphorylated under normal physiological growth conditions, and this phosphorylation has been shown to repress the activity of HSF-1 (22Kim J. Nueda A. Meng Y-H.

HSF in yeast is an essential gene, whereas in Drosophila it is not required for general cell growth and viability (1Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 27Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the function of HSF may not be solely to control transcription of heat shock proteins under stress conditions, but it may also control the expression of non-heat shock genes under normal physiological growth conditions (27Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple HSF genes in higher eukaryotes, in contrast to one HSF gene present in yeast and Drosophila, could indicate that individual proteins may be responsible for different biological functions.

During adaptation to low temperatures, Antarctic fishes have acquired special hematological features which clearly differentiate them from fishes of temperate and tropical climates. The hematocrit and hemoglobin (Hb)1concentration are highly reduced in the blood of Antarctic fishes (1Everson I. Ralph R. Bull. Br. Antarct. Surv. 1968; 15: 59-62Google Scholar, 2Hureau J.-C.

The hematological peculiarities of Antarctic teleosts prompted an investigation on the molecular structure and ligand binding properties of hemoglobins (Hbs) from these organisms, in order to characterize the adaptation of the oxygen-transport mechanism at the molecular level. We focused our interest on the suborder Notothenioidei, largely endemic and confined south of the Antarctic Polar Front. The suborder includes six families with 120 species, 95 of which are Antarctic (5Gon O. Heemstra P.C. Fishes of the Southern Ocean.

Notothenioids generally have a single major Hb (Hb 1), often accompanied by a minor component (Hb 2), accounting for approximately 95 and 5% of the total, respectively (8di Prisco G. D'Avino R.

A cathodal Hb (Hb C) is present in trace amounts, except in Trematomus newnesi, of the family Nototheniidae, in which Hb C is approximately 25–30% of the total (11D'Avino R. Caruso C. Tamburrini M.

In this study, the oxygen-transport system of species of the family Artedidraconidae, which comprises 24 of the 80 red-blooded Antarctic species of the suborder Notothenioidei so far identified (5Gon O. Heemstra P.C. Fishes of the Southern Ocean. JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology, Grahamstown, South Africa1990Crossref Google Scholar, 6Eastman J.T. Antarctic Fish Biology: Evolution in a Unique Environment. Academic Press, San Diego1993Google Scholar), was thoroughly investigated for the first time. Artedidraconids are benthic fish, have a wide depth distribution, and are largely confined in the Antarctic continental shelf and slope (12Andriashev A.P. Monogr. Biol. 1965; 25: 491-550Google Scholar). This paper reports the complete amino acid sequence of the α and β chains of the single Hbs of the artedidraconids Artedidraco orianae and Pogonophryne scotti, along with kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of ligand binding. The functional features of Hbs were very similar to those measured in whole blood, intact erythrocytes, and unstripped hemolysates. DEAE-cellulose (DE52) was from Whatman; trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), treated with l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone, from Cooper Biomedical; Tris and bisTris from Sigma; dithiothreitol from Fluka; all sequanal-grade reagents from Applied Biosystems; HPLC-grade acetonitrile from Lab-Scan Analytical. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. A. orianae was caught by means of Agassiz Trawl in the northeastern Weddell Sea, Antarctica, and P. scotti by gill nets in the vicinity of Terra Nova Bay Station, Ross Sea, Antarctica. Immediately after catch, fish were transferred to aquariums supplied with running, aerated seawater at approximately −1.0 °C. Blood samples were drawn from the caudal vein of living animals by means of heparinized syringes; the red blood cells were washed three times in isotonic saline solution (1.7% NaCl, in 1 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1). Hemolysates were prepared as described (13D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1988; 90: 579-584Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hb concentration and purification from minor contaminants was carried out by ion-exchange chromatography on a DE52 column (1 × 3 cm), equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and eluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1. Gel filtration was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia) on a ProteinPak 300 SW column (Waters), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Globins were precipitated with 10 volumes of acetone containing 5 mm HCl at −20 °C; α and β chains were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a μBondapak C18 column (Waters, 0.39 × 30 cm). In P. scotti, the eluents were (A) 45% acetonitrile containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid and (B) 55% acetonitrile; a linear gradient from 0 to 100% of eluent B in 15 min was used. In A. orianae, the eluents were (A) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and (B) acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid; the elution was carried out with a multistep gradient of eluent B. Flow rate was 1 ml/min. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis of hemolysates and purified Hbs and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified globins were carried out as described (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar, 15D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 699-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Globin denaturation, alkylation of the sulfhydryl groups with 4-vinylpyridine, tryptic digestion, and cleavage of Asp-Pro bonds were carried out according to described procedures (16D'Avino R. Caruso C. Romano M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Tamburrini M. Brancaccio A. Ippoliti R. di Prisco G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a μBondapak C18 column (Waters, 0.39 × 30 cm), equilibrated with eluent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid); peptides were eluted with a multistep gradient of eluent B (acetonitrile, containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid). Amino acid analyses were performed with an Applied Biosystems automatic derivatizer model 420 A, equipped with the hydrolysis option and with on-line detection of phenylthiocarbamyl amino acids. Alternatively, gas-phase manual hydrolysis was carried out for 1 h at 155 °C in 6 n HCl containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 1% phenol. Amino acid sequencing was carried out with an Applied Biosystems automatic sequencer model 477A, equipped with on-line detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. Sequencing of Asp-Pro-cleaved globins was performed after treatment with o-phthalaldehyde (18Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), to reduce the background due to sequencing from the N terminus. Molecular mass measurements were carried out with a Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer model 5989B, equipped with the electrospray source model 59987A. Oxygen saturation experiments were carried out at 2 °C, as described previously (15D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 699-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen-equilibrium curves were obtained by the tonometric method (19Giardina B. Amiconi G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) at 2, 10, and 20 °C, in the pH range 6.5–8.0. The heat of oxygenation was calculated from the integrated van't Hoff equation, ΔH=−4.574·[(T1·T2)/(T1−T2)]·ΔlogP50/1000(Eq. 1) and the values obtained were corrected for the heat of oxygen solubilization (−3 kcal/mol; 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). Kinetic measurements were carried out with a Gibson-Durrum stopped-flow system equipped with a 2-cm pathlength observation cell and interfaced to a computer for data acquisition (On Line System, Jefferson, GA). Oxygen dissociation measurements were undertaken mixing oxy-Hb of A. orianae (5 μm heme before mixing, in low-ionic strength HEPES buffer, pH 7.0) with sodium dithionite (20 mg/ml after mixing) in buffer at the desired pH at higher ionic strength. For carbon monoxide binding kinetics, deoxy-Hb of A. orianae or of P. scotti in sodium dithionite at low ionic strength and pH 7.0 (3 μm heme before mixing, in HEPES buffer) were mixed with a higher ionic strength buffer at the desired pH containing a given concentration of dissolved carbon monoxide. Both measurements were performed at 20 °C and monitored at 430 or 419 nm, following the appearance or disappearance of unliganded Hb. Electrophoretic analysis on cellulose acetate showed that the hemolysates of A. orianae and P. scotti have a single Hb. The α and β chains of each Hb were purified by HPLC (Fig. 1). The N terminus of the two α chains was unavailable to automated Edman degradation, indicating the presence of a blocking group. An internal region became accessible in both chains after cleavage of an Asp-Pro bond. After treatment with o-phthalaldehyde, sequencing proceeded from Pro96 to Thr119 in A. orianae, and from Pro96 to Ala122in P. scotti. Tryptic peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Fig. 2 shows the patterns of the α chains of A. orianae (panel A) and P. scotti(panel B). All peptides were identified and sequenced. The sequence of the blocked N-terminal peptides (residues 1–7) of the two chains was established after incubation in 30% trifluoroacetic acid at 55 °C for 2.5 h. The molecular mass of these peptides, obtained by electrospray mass spectrometry, was 834.6 Da, a value compatible with the presence of an acetyl group at the N terminus. In the α chain of A. orianae, mass spectrometry analysis also revealed a minor component having a molecular mass of 592.5 Da, corresponding to the sequence from acetyl-Ser1 to Lys5. In the α chain of A. orianae Hb, trypsin partially failed to cleave at Lys5 and Lys62. Thus, it was possible to recover two forms of peptide T10 (T10A and T10B), having Lys62 and Val63 at the N terminus, respectively. The sequence obtained after Asp-Pro cleavage provided overlap from T14 to T16. In the α chain of P. scotti Hb, trypsin failed to cleave at Lys5 and at Arg93; the alignment of T12 and T13 was thus obtained. The sequence obtained after Asp-Pro cleavage provided overlap from T13 to T15. Tryptic peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Fig. 2 shows the patterns of the β chains of A. orianae (panel C) and P. scotti (panel D) Hbs. All peptides were identified and sequenced. Direct sequencing from the N terminus proceeded for 30 (A. orianae) and 31 (P. scotti) residues, providing overlap from T1 to T3 and from T1 to T4, respectively. After cleavage of the internal Asp-Pro bond and treatment with o-phthalaldehyde, sequencing proceeded from Pro100 to Val114(A. orianae) and from Pro100 to Phe133 (P. scotti), providing overlap from T9 to T10 and from T8 to T11, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the complete sequence of the α (142 residues) and β (146 residues) chains of the two Hbs. The amino acid compositions are reported in TableI. Alignment of the tryptic peptides was established by the described overlaps and by homology with other known sequences. The calculated molecular masses were: (i) 15,499 and 15,566 (α chains); (ii) 16,203 and 16,129 (β chains), for A. orianae and P. scotti Hbs, respectively.Table IAmino acid composition of the α (A and B) and β (C and D) chains of A. orianae and P. scotti, respectivelyAmino acidABCDAsp/Asn12.6 (15)15.2 (15)13.8 (19)16.2 (16)Glu/Gln6.4 (5)5.2 (5)11.9 (11)11.7 (10)Ser10.1 (13)14.3 (14)8.0 (10)10.1 (11)Gly6.7 (6)6.8 (6)10.7 (11)10.7 (10)His8.6 (5)6.1 (6)7.2 (5)8.2 (9)Arg3.7 (3)3.0 (3)4.1 (4)3.0 (3)Thr5.4 (5)5.3 (5)5.0 (5)4.6 (4)Ala14.7 (18)16.9 (16)12.8 (13)15.1 (16)Pro6.7 (6)6.4 (6)4.0 (4)3.8 (4)Tyr3.7 (3)3.2 (3)5.6 (5)5.2 (5)Val9.9 (11)10.7 (12)10.1 (11)7.7 (9)Met1.6 (4)4.5 (4)1.2 (4)3.6 (3)CysND1-aND, not determined.

At 2 °C (close to physiological conditions) the affinity for oxygen of the two Hbs was high: at pH 8.0,P 50 was 2.45 and 4.6 mm Hg in the absence, and 3.63 and 5.5 mm Hg in the presence, of chloride and organophosphates, for A. orianae and P. scotti Hbs, respectively. In comparison with other notothenioids (10di Prisco G. D'Avino R. Caruso C. Tamburrini M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. Carratore V. Romano M. di Prisco G. Maresca B. Tota B. Biology of Antarctic Fish. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 263-281Crossref Google Scholar), the Hbs showed a modest, effector-enhanced alkaline Bohr effect (becoming virtually absent at 10 °C in A. orianae Hb, not shown) in the pH range 6.5–8.0 (Fig. 4, panels A and B); the Bohr coefficient ΔlogP 50/ΔpH was, respectively, −0.35 and −0.31 in the absence, and −0.51 and −0.44 in the presence, of the physiological effectors. Although the overall oxygen affinity of whole blood (as well as erythrocytes and unstripped hemolysate) of A. orianae and P. scotti (Fig. 4, panels A and B, respectively) was slightly lower than that measured in Hb in the presence of chloride and phosphates, the slopes of the oxygen-equilibrium curves were very similar in the pH range 7.0–7.5, where the Bohr effect is active. In the whole pH range, the Hill coefficient of the Hbs of both species was close to one (Fig. 4, panels C and D), regardless of the presence of chloride and organophosphates, with only slightly higher values observed in P. scotti. These results were taken as strong evidence of the absence of cooperative oxygen binding. In order to ascertain whether the low Hill coefficient values were due to subunit dissociation, A. orianae Hb was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration at pH 8.0 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The hemoprotein was eluted from the column at the retention time of tetrameric Hb (not shown), without any apparent dissociation. Therefore, the absence of subunit cooperativity is due to intrinsic properties of the tetrameric molecule; further work is required to establish correlations with molecular structure. The Root effect (20Root R.W. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1931; 61: 427-456Crossref Google Scholar, 21Brittain T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1987; 86: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) often displayed by fish Hbs, which leads to incomplete saturation of Hb in air, was not found, at 2 °C, in A. orianae and P. scotti Hbs in the absence of organophosphates, but it was induced to a limited extent by ATP or inositol hexakisphosphate (Fig. 5). The Root effect of A. orianae and P. scotti blood, erythrocytes, and unstripped hemolysate was very similar to that shown by the isolated Hb (Fig. 5, panels A and B). The regulation of the oxygen affinity by temperature was investigated in the range 2–20 °C. A very strong ΔH, larger than that of mammalian Hbs (22Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Smulevich G. Mantini A.R. Del Gaudio R. Piscopo M. Geraci G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was measured in A. orianae Hb at pH 8.0, in the absence and presence of chloride and ATP. However, lowering the pH to 7.0 brought about a dramatic decrease of the oxygen-binding enthalpy, which became almost zero in the presence of effectors (Table II).Table IIApparent heat of oxygenation of A. orianae and P. scotti HbsΔHpH 7.0pH 7.5pH 8.0kcal mol−1 oxygenWithout effectors A. orianae−6.75−19.6 P. scotti−9.96369With effectors A. orianae−1.55−15.1 P. scotti−12.06369 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6 shows the progress curve for oxygen dissociation of Hb of A. orianae at different pH values and at 21 °C, displaying a biphasic process characterized by two exponentials, which can be attributed to a different ligand dissociation behavior for the two subunits α and β of the tetramer, even though the kinetic heterogeneity is not as marked as in the Root effect Hb of the temperate fish Chelidonichthys kumu(23Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the process decreased as the pH was lowered (Fig. 6), indicating that A. orianae Hb was already partially deoxygenated at atmospheric oxygen pressure and at 21 °C, before mixing with sodium dithionite. However, this effect appeared markedly temperature-dependent, since at lower, physiological temperatures, no Root effect, i.e. no partial deoxygenation, was observed upon pH lowering at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 5). Both deoxygenation rate constants displayed a pH-dependent behavior in the observed pH range (Fig. 7); the data were analyzed according to, kobs=kalk/(1+Ka[H+])+kacKa[H+]/(1+Ka[H+])(Eq. 2) where k obs is the observed oxygen dissociation rate constant, k alk and k ac are the oxygen dissociation rate constants for the unprotonated and protonated Hb, respectively, and K a (=10pK a) is the proton binding constant to oxygenated Hb. The pH dependence described by the continuous lines indicated a single protonation event with a pK a = 7.1 ± 0.15, closely similar for both phases and essentially unaffected by 3 mm ATP (Fig. 7,panels A and B, and TableIII). This behavior suggests that the two subunits of the tetramer, although showing different values of the oxygen dissociation rate constants (as from the biphasic progress curves in Fig. 6), are functionally regulated by the same protonation process, indicating that differences in the observed rates should be related to variations in the conformation of the distal side of the heme pocket.Figure 7pH dependence of oxygen dissociation rate constant (k; s−1) of A. orianae Hb, in the absence (panel A) and presence (panel B) of 3 mm ATP.

The behavior, substantially unaffected by 3 mm ATP (data not shown), was investigated over a very wide pH range, spanning from pH 2.5 to 9.0. This range has been shown to be suitable in order to follow the effect of the protonation of the proximal and distal histidine on the CO binding process, since over this pH interval both events are taking place (24Coletta M.

The pH dependence was analyzed according to Equation 2 modified only in that k values of Equation 2 are substituted by l' since the rate constants are referring to the bimolecular carbon monoxide binding rate constants.

Similar results were obtained with blood, intact erythrocytes, or unstripped hemolysates. ATP slightly enhances the Bohr effect, and induces the Root effect to a limited extent. The Root effect is further induced upon addition of ATP to blood, intact erythrocytes, or unst"

Reciprocal dominant negative mutants consisting of Krox24 deleted for a crucial region of the zinc-finger domain (delta Krox24) or of the zinc-finger region alone (delta Krox24Zf) abolished the activation of transcription by Krox24 in P19 cells. Expression of Krox24 led to spontaneous differentiation of P19 cells in a lineage-independent fashion. Krox24 transfected populations, as well as individual clones randomly picked from them, displayed a wide array of diverse morphologies and expressed markers characteristic of a variety of differentiated cells. The dominant negative mutants blocked differentiation of P19 cells. We conclude that expression of Krox24 is sufficient for pluripotent differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells, and that expression of Krox24 or other egr family members is essential to this process."
https://openalex.org/W2141819351,"The susceptibility of purines to form a covalent attachment with proteins upon exposure to UV irradiation was applied to adenylyl cyclase by use of [32P]2'-d-3'-AMP, a dead-end inhibitor that binds to the post-transition configuration of the enzyme. [32P]2'-d-3'-AMP was synthesized enzymatically. It and [alpha-32P]5'-ATP were used for direct photocross-linking to individually expressed cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase. Both the C1 domain of the type V isozyme (VC1) and the C2 domain of the type II isozyme (IIC2) were labeled, whether alone or combined, upon photolysis of [32P]2'-d-3'-AMP in the presence of acetone. Labeling of VC1 and IIC2 was greatly enhanced in the presence of PPi, was almost completely suppressed by 50 microM 2',5'-dideoxy-3'-ATP, the most potent reported P-site inhibitor of adenylyl cyclases, but was partially suppressed by 1 mM 3'-IMP, a ligand that does not inhibit the enzyme via the P-site. Neither 3':5'-cAMP nor 5'-ATP had a major effect on labeling by [32P]2'-d-3'-AMP. Direct cross-linking of VC1 with [alpha-32P]5'-ATP was substantially suppressed by 2', 5'-dideoxy-3'-ATP and partially suppressed by 2'-d-3'-AMP, whereas cross-linking of IIC2 was less affected by the 3'-triphosphate. The data imply that either cytosolic domain can interact directly with either substrate or P-site ligand and that subunit interaction modifies the susceptibility of each domain to UV-induced covalent modification by either [alpha-32P]5'-ATP or [32P]2'-d-3'-AMP."
