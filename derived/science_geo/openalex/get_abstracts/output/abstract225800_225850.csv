https://openalex.org/W2061282806,"The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase ERp57 is a soluble protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and the closest known homologue of protein disulfide isomerase. The protein interacts with the two lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin and thereby promotes the oxidative folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Here we have characterized several fundamental structural and functional properties of ERp57 in vitro, such as the domain organization, shape, redox potential, and the ability to catalyze different thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Like protein disulfide isomerase, we find ERp57 to be comprised of four structural domains. The protein has an elongated shape of 3.4 ± 0.1 nm in diameter and 16.8 ± 0.5 nm in length. The two redox-active a and a′ domains were determined to have redox potentials of –0.167 and –0.156 V, respectively. Furthermore, ERp57 was shown to efficiently catalyze disulfide reduction, disulfide isomerization, and dithiol oxidation in substrate proteins. The implications of these findings for the function of the protein in vivo are discussed.

Covalent modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation and signal peptide cleavage, play an important role in protein maturation in the ER. In addition, the formation of disulfide bonds is often essential. By establishing covalent intra- and intermolecular cross-links, disulfide bonds allow a more productive folding of many polypeptides and provide a higher overall stability. The steady production of new proteins in the ER and the continued oxidation of cysteine thiols is supported by a constant supply of oxidizing equivalents.In recent years, the molecular mechanisms of disulfide bond formation in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria and in the ER of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been thoroughly characterized (reviewed in Ref. 1Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Google Scholar). In the ER of animal cells, disulfide bond formation is less well understood. Still, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an essential and well characterized ER resident enzyme, is known to interact with various substrates and to catalyze their oxidation, reduction, and isomerization (reviewed in Ref. 2Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Google Scholar). Recently, it has become evident that PDI obtains the oxidizing equivalents that it uses for oxidation of cysteine thiols from Ero1, a membrane-associated FAD-binding ER protein that transfers electrons from PDI to molecular oxygen (3Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Google Scholar, 4Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, an additional protein, Erv2p, performs a similar function to that of Ero1 (4Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Google Scholar, 5Sevier C.S. Cuozzo J.W. Vala A. Aslund F. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 874-882Google Scholar). Although orthologues of Erv2p do not seem to exist in higher eukaryotes, two human isoforms of Ero1 have been identified, Ero1α and Ero1β (6Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4827-4833Google Scholar).A number of mammalian PDI-like ER proteins are known (8Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Google Scholar), including ERp57, ERp72, P5, PDIR, PDIp, TMX, ERp44, and the more recently described ERdj5/JPDI (9Cunnea P.M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Bertoli G. Simmen T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2669-2676Google Scholar), ERp18/ERp19 (11Knoblach B. Keller B.O. Groenendyk J. Aldred S. Zheng J. Lemire B.D. Li L. Michalak M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1104-1119Google Scholar, 12Alanen H.I. Williamson R.A. Howard M.J. Lappi A.K. Jantti H.P. Rautio S.M. Kellokumpu S. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28912-28920Google Scholar), and EndoPDI/ERp46 (11Knoblach B. Keller B.O. Groenendyk J. Aldred S. Zheng J. Lemire B.D. Li L. Michalak M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1104-1119Google Scholar, 13Sullivan D.C. Huminiecki L. Moore J.W. Boyle J.J. Poulsom R. Creamer D. Barker J. Bicknell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47079-47088Google Scholar). They all contain one or more domains with sequence homology to thioredoxin, a cytosolic reductase. The redox activity of thioredoxin-like domains is provided by two cysteine residues present in a characteristic CXXC sequence motif. For several of the proteins mentioned above, the redox activity has been characterized in vitro (12Alanen H.I. Williamson R.A. Howard M.J. Lappi A.K. Jantti H.P. Rautio S.M. Kellokumpu S. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28912-28920Google Scholar, 14Kramer B. Ferrari D.M. Klappa P. Pohlmann N. Soling H.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 83-95Google Scholar, 15Matsuo Y. Akiyama N. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10032-10038Google Scholar), but in many cases the in vivo function is less well studied. Few endogenous substrates have been identified, and it is often not clear whether these PDI homologues serve a role in reduction, oxidation, or disulfide isomerization in the ER.Cell biological and biochemical studies have revealed ERp57 to be a component of the calnexin/calreticulin chaperone system that promotes the folding and quality control of glycoproteins in the ER (reviewed in Ref. 16Ellgaard L. Frickel E.-M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39: 223-248Google Scholar). Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) are homologous lectin chaperones that bind to the monoglucosylated glycan present on newly synthesized glycoproteins. Upon association with CNX and CRT (17Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar, 18Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar), ERp57 acts as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase for proteins carrying N-linked glycans. Transient disulfide-linked intermediates between ERp57 and nascent and newly synthesized glycoproteins have been observed in vivo (19Molinari M. Galli C. Piccaluga V. Pieren M. Paganetti P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 247-257Google Scholar). In vitro, the ERp57-enhanced oxidative refolding of RNase B, the glycosylated variant of RNase A, is critically dependent on its interaction with CNX and CRT (20Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Google Scholar). Two well characterized functions of ERp57 are as an important component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide loading complex (21Bouvier M. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 697-706Google Scholar, 22Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Elliott T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 75-81Google Scholar) and in the folding of influenza hemagglutinin (23Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Google Scholar).From the recently solved three-dimensional structures of the CRT P-domain and the luminal domain of CNX (24Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Güntert P. Braun D. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Google Scholar, 25Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar), it was revealed that both chaperones contain a globular lectin domain with a long, protruding arm-like extension, referred to as the P-domain. The site of interaction with ERp57 has been mapped to the outermost tip of the P-domain in both CNX and CRT (26Frickel E.-M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Google Scholar, 27Ellgaard L. Bettendorff P. Braun D. Herrmann T. Fiorito F. Jelesarov I. Güntert P. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 773-784Google Scholar, 28Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Google Scholar). The exact position of the binding site in ERp57 for the two lectin chaperones remains to be elucidated.The overall sequence identity at the amino acid level between ERp57 and PDI is 33% (8Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Google Scholar), making ERp57 the closest known homologue of PDI. The latter protein comprises four thioredoxin-like domains, two of which (denoted a and a′) are redox-active and contain a CGHC motif, whereas the other two domains (denoted b and b′) are redox-inactive and are devoid of CXXC motifs. The domains are arranged in the order a-b-b′-a′. In addition, PDI has an acidic C-terminal sequence. ERp57 lacks this negatively charged region, and its “QDEL” ER retrieval signal is directly preceded by the region corresponding to the PDI a′ domain (8Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Google Scholar). NMR structures of the a and b domains in PDI show a thioredoxin fold for both (29Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Google Scholar, 30Kemmink J. Dijkstra K. Mariani M. Scheek R.M. Penka E. Nilges M. Darby N.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 357-368Google Scholar), and it is thus likely that the a′ and b′ domains also exhibit this fold. At present, the spatial organization of the four thioredoxin-like domains in PDI is unknown.For ERp57, the information regarding the three-dimensional structure is limited to NMR assignments of the a′ domain (31Silvennoinen L. Karvonen P. Koivunen P. Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K. Kilpelainen I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 385-386Google Scholar), and like PDI, ERp57 contains two CGHC active-site sequence motifs. Overall, the protein remains poorly characterized at the molecular level. Here we have investigated the biophysical and enzymatic properties of ERp57 to gain a more detailed understanding of structural and functional aspects of this thioldisulfide oxidoreductase.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Expression and Purification—Full-length human ERp57, human PDI, Escherichia coli DsbA, E. coli thioredoxin (Trx), and human CRT were prepared as described previously (26Frickel E.-M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Google Scholar, 32Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Google Scholar, 33Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Google Scholar, 34Bouvier M. Stafford W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14950-14959Google Scholar). Bovine insulin was from Sigma. The ERp57 a and a′ domains were expressed and purified like full-length ERp57 (26Frickel E.-M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Google Scholar), except for the absence of reducing agent in all buffers used. The protein sequence for the human ERp57 a domain includes residues 1–112 and residues 353–473 for the ERp57 a′ domain. In this study, all ERp57 residue numbers refer to the human sequence after cleavage of the predicted signal peptide to generate the mature N terminus beginning with the sequence Ser1-Asp2-Val3. Gene products encoding the a and a′ domains were amplified by PCR and cloned into a pRSET A-derived E. coli expression vector (35Zahn R. Buckle A.M. Perrett S. Johnson C.M. Corrales F.J. Golbik R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15024-15029Google Scholar). Protein expression from this vector results in the production of a fusion protein with an N-terminal 17-amino acid affinity tag containing a hexahistidine sequence. The correct sequence of both constructs was verified by DNA sequencing.Protein Concentration Determination—The concentration of all proteins used in this study was determined from their absorbance at 280 nm by using the molar extinction coefficients calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (36Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). An extinction coefficient of 41,750 m–1 cm–1 was used for ERp57, 11,050 m–1 cm–1 for the ERp57 a domain, 13,490 m–1 cm–1 for the ERp57 a′ domain, 80,630 m–1 cm–1 for CRT, 21,620 m–1 cm–1 for DsbA, and 14,060 m–1 cm–1 for Trx.Limited Proteolysis of ERp57—Limited proteolysis was carried out in a buffer containing 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0, at 37 °C at the concentrations of ERp57 and the specific protease indicated in Fig. 1. For trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (Roche Applied Science), the digestions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonide fluoride to 5 mm and in the case of thermolysin (Roche Applied Science) by adding EDTA to 5 mm. After addition of electrophoresis sample buffer, the digests were analyzed on SDS-15% PAGE (w/v), blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing.Circular Dichroism Measurements—CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in a 1-mm path length cell at 25 °C. Spectra were averaged from 10 scans, and the buffer base line was subtracted. All proteins (6–11 μm) were in a buffer containing 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH, 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. ERp57 was reduced with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and oxidized with 2 mm GSSG. The a and a′ domains were reduced with 1 mm DTT and oxidized with 1 mm GSSG. Reduction and oxidation was performed by dialyzing against the respective buffers overnight. The spectra for the ERp57 a and a′ domains were not corrected for the presence of the unstructured N-terminal 17-amino acid affinity tag.Quantification of Free Thiol Groups—Analysis of free thiol groups in ERp57 by Ellman's reagent 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid was carried out at protein concentrations of 30 μm and 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid concentrations of 0.3 mm in 80 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2% w/v SDS. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the absorbance at 412 nm was recorded using an extinction coefficient of 13,600 m–1 cm–1 per free thiol (37Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Google Scholar).Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium analysis of ERp57 and sedimentation velocity analysis of a mixture of ERp57 and CRT were performed on a Beckman Instruments Optima XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge. The cells were equipped with sapphire windows and 12-mm aluminum-filled Epon double sector centerpieces.Sedimentation velocity runs for ERp57 were carried out at 20 °C and 50,000 rpm with patterns being acquired every 7 s. Sedimentation boundaries were analyzed using time derivative analysis as described previously (38Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Google Scholar, 39Stafford III, W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Google Scholar) and with the recently developed SEDANAL software for the analysis of interacting systems (40Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Google Scholar). Uncertainties in the fitted parameters were obtained using the bootstrap with replacement method. A stock solution of ERp57 at ∼2 mg/ml was dialyzed for at least 16 h against 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, containing 2 mm dithio-1,4-threitol (DTT). Solutions of ERp57 in the range 0.1–1.0 mg/ml were prepared using the dialysate as diluent. For this particular buffer, the density and viscosity were calculated with Sednterp to be 1.01141 g/ml and 1.0342 centipoise, respectively. The value of the partial specific volume, v̄ = 0.734 cm3/g, was calculated from the amino acid composition of recombinant human ERp57 using the consensus partial volumes of the amino acids (41Perkins S.J. Sim R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 155-168Google Scholar). The degree of hydration, δ1 = 0.418 g of H2O/g protein, was also calculated from the amino acid composition according to Kuntz and Kauzmann (42Kuntz Jr., I.D. Kauzmann W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1974; 28: 239-345Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic modeling of monomeric ERp57 was performed using the equation of Perrin for an equivalent, hydrated prolate ellipsoid of revolution (43Stafford W.F. Schuster T.M. Glaser J.A. Deutscher M.P. Hydrodynamic Transport Methods. An Introduction to Physical Methods for Protein and Nucleic Acid Research. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1995: 111-145Google Scholar).Sedimentation equilibrium runs for ERp57 were carried out at 4 °C as described previously (44Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Stafford III, W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 949-964Google Scholar). A stock solution of ERp57 at ∼2 mg/ml was dialyzed for at least 24 h immediately prior to analysis in the same buffer as for sedimentation velocity runs. In addition, a series of dilutions of ERp57 in the range 0.1–1.0 mg/ml were prepared using the dialysate as diluent. Six-channel external loading centerpieces (Beckman Coulter part numbers 366755 and 368115) were used. Optical blank runs were performed both before and after the run at the expected and actual speeds, respectively. Sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed by global fitting, combined data from three loading concentrations, and two speeds, as described previously (44Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Stafford III, W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 949-964Google Scholar).Interaction studies between ERp57 and CRT were executed by sedimentation velocity at 20 °C and 50,000 rpm. Separate stock solutions of ERp57 and CRT at ∼0.6 mg/ml were simultaneously dialyzed overnight against 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. To ensure the absence of any oxidized forms of ERp57 in solution, the protein was treated with 10 mm DTT for 1 h immediately prior to the dialysis step. Values of the partial specific volume and hydration of CRT were 0.698 cm3/g and 0.502 g of H2O/g protein as reported previously (34Bouvier M. Stafford W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14950-14959Google Scholar). The sedimentation velocity profiles were analyzed with the program SEDANAL to produce the g(s*) patterns and also fit to a 1:1 stoichiometry to obtain estimates of the equilibrium constants.Redox Equilibrium between the ERp57 a and a′ Domains and Glutathione—Fluorescence experiments were performed at 25 °C on a PTI Quantamaster QM-7/2003 Spectrofluorometer. All buffers used contained 1 mm EDTA and were filtered, degassed, and flushed with argon. Equilibration of the ERp57 a and a′ domains at different GSH/GSSG ratios in 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, was performed for at least 15 h at 25 °C. A protein concentration of 2 μm was used in all experiments. After excitation at 280 nm, the fluorescence intensity at 350 nm, the wavelength at which the maximal difference between the emission of oxidized and reduced protein was observed, was recorded for 20 s and averaged. To determine the equilibrium constant Keq for the ERp57 a and a′ domain/glutathione system, the fluorescence emission at [GSH]2/[GSSG] ratios from 10–5 to 1 m was measured. This was achieved by varying the GSH concentration between 0.03 and 11 mm at a constant GSSG concentration of 0.1 mm. The completely reduced protein was measured at 10 mm GSH and the completely oxidized protein at 0.1 mm GSSG. Ellman's reagent was used as described above to verify that the protein was completely oxidized. The measured fluorescence F was plotted against the [GSH]2/[GSSG] ratio and fitted according to Equation 1 to obtain Fox, the fluorescence of oxidized and Fred, the fluorescence of reduced protein. The relative amount of reduced protein at equilibrium (R), determined with Equation 2, was plotted against the [GSH]2/[GSSG] ratio, and the data were fitted according to Equation 1 to obtain Keq. The standard redox potentials of the ERp57 a and a′ domains were then calculated with the Nernst Equation 3 using the glutathione standard potential E′0GSH/GSSG of –0.240 V at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (45Williams C.H. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). F=Fox+(Fred-Fox)[GSH]2/[GSSG]Keq+[GSH]2/[GSSG](Eq. 1) R=F+FoxFred-Fox(Eq. 2) E0=E'0GSH/GSSG-(RT/nF)×lnKeq(Eq. 3) Reductase Assay with Insulin—The catalyzed reduction of insulin by DTT was monitored at different concentrations of various thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases as catalysts by measuring the increase in turbidity at 650 nm (46Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Google Scholar). Each assay was performed at 25 °C and contained 130 μm insulin and different concentrations of catalyst in 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The enzymes were pre-incubated in the DTT-containing buffer for 5 min, and the assay was started by the addition of insulin. The onset of aggregation was defined as the time where OD650 had reached the value of 0.025. The enzyme concentration at which this occurred was plotted against the onset of aggregation in order to obtain a concentration-dependent activity curve for the reductase activity of each oxidoreductase.Preparation of Scrambled RNaseA—Scrambled RNaseA (scRNaseA) was prepared by reducing and denaturing 70 mg of native RNaseA (natRNaseA) (Sigma) overnight at room temperature in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidinium chloride, and 150 mm DTT. Next, buffer exchange into 100 mm acetic acid/NaOH, pH 4.0, was obtained by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The reduced and denatured RNaseA was diluted to 0.25 mg/ml with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 6 m guanidinium chloride and subjected to air oxidation for 5 days in the dark. Finally, after concentration, RNaseA was gel-filtrated once again on a PD-10 column into 100 mm acetic acid/NaOH, pH 4.0, and stored at –20 °C. Both after reduction and oxidation the number of free thiols was determined by the Ellman's assay. The scRNaseA preparation lacked free thiols, as well as disulfide-linked dimers as shown by non-reducing SDS-PAGE.Disulfide Isomerase Assay with Scrambled RNaseA—The isomerase function of ERp57 and its redox-active domains was tested by the ability to reactivate scRNaseA. 40 μm scRNaseA was incubated with 10 μm (active-site concentration) of a given thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase previously reduced with an equimolar concentration of DTT. The isomerase reaction was performed in 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μm DTT, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. At various time points, 100-μl samples were taken from the reaction and added to 300 μl of 4 mm cCMP, and the hydrolysis of cCMP was followed on a Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer for 3 min at 296 nm. The hydrolysis rate of cCMP catalyzed by 40 μm natRNaseA was set to 100% activity, and all other samples were expressed as a percentage of this value.Construction of Plasmids for Periplasmic Protein Expression—The plasmid pDsbA3 (47Hennecke J.

Expression from this plasmid is under the control of the trc promoter/lac operator. The cDNA regions encoding ERp57 and PDI were amplified by PCR from the plasmids pHisERp57 (26Frickel E.-M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Google Scholar) and pET12PDI (48Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Google Scholar), respectively, using the following primers: ERp57OxF, 5′-GGTACTAGTGCGTCCGACGTGCTAGAACTC, and ERp57OxR, 5′-GCAGCCGGATCCTTAGAG; PDIOxF, 5′-AGCGCTAGCGCGGACGCCCCCGAGGAG, and PDIOxR, 5′-TACTAGTGCGGACGCCCCCGAGGAG. The resulting PCR products were digested with SpeI and BamHI and cloned into pDsbA3 where the segment encoding mature DsbA had been removed with NheI and BamHI, thus generating the pDsbAERp57 and pDs-bAPDI constructs. The ERp57 a domain and bb′a′ domain constructs were produced by PCR from the plasmid pDsbAERp57 using the phosphorylated primers ERp57aF, 5′-TAAGGATCCCCACGCGCC, and ERp57aR, 5′-CTGCTTCTTCAAGTGGCTG; ERp57bb′a′F, TACTAGTGCGGCAGGACCAGCTTCA, and ERp57bb′a′R, 5′-CCCGGATCCTTAGAGATCCTCCTG. Next, the resulting PCR fragments comprising the entire vector and the desired regions of the ERp57 gene were blunt-end ligated. The creation of the construct for the secretion of the PDI a domain has been described before (49Jonda S. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Mossner E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3271-3281Google Scholar). The DsbC construct used in the assay encodes the redox-inactive C98A/C101A variant as a negative control. The correct sequence of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing.In Vivo Complementation Assay—E. coli THZ2 cells (50Jacobi A. Huber-Wunderlich M. Hennecke J. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21692-21699Google Scholar) lacking the bacterial dithiol oxidase DsbA were transformed with the secretory expression plasmid of the oxidoreductase construct to be tested. Expression, correct localization to the periplasm, and processing of the leader peptide was verified for each construct by cell fractionation. Cytosolic and periplasmic fractions were compared on SDS-PAGE, and in certain cases by transfer to a PVDF membrane followed by N-terminal sequencing or detection by an antibody. To obtain the periplasmic fraction, cells grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at OD600 of 0.6 and grown for 3 h. Next, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and periplasmic proteins were extracted by stirring the cells for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polymyxin B sulfate. Spheroblasts were pelleted by centrifugation, and the periplasmic fraction remained in the supernatant. Because we did not detect expression of the isolated ERp57 a′ domain in this system, the triple domain construct of ERp57 bb′a′ was used to test the oxidase activity of the ERp57 a′ domain.DsbA complementation was analyzed by the recovery of motility of a single colony (51Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Google Scholar). 1 μl of LB culture inoculated with a single colony of THZ2 cells transformed with an oxidoreductase secretion construct and adjusted to OD600 = 0.7 was placed in the middle of an LB plate containing 0.3% (w/v) agar. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the diameter of the bacterial lawn was compared with that of E. coli THZ2 harboring pDsbA3 as a positive control and DsbC C98A/C101A as a negative control. Additionally, DsbA complementation was analyzed by oxidative inactivation of β-galactosidase fused C-terminally to MalF (52Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Google Scholar). Streak-outs of overnight cultures containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and transformed with the respective periplasmic expression plasmid were made on LB agar plates supplemented with 0.4% maltose and 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C followed by 6 h at 4 °C. DsbA complementation was classified as follows: white colonies (+), pale blue colonies (+/–), blue colonies (–).RESULTSDetermination of Domain Boundaries in ERp57—As a first characterization of recombinantly expressed full-length ERp57, we subjected the protein to limited proteolysis. This experimental approach not only gives information about domain boundaries but also about the relative stability of individual domains toward proteolysis.For proteolysis of ERp57 at pH 7.0 and 37 °C, we used trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and thermolysin. Each digestion mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and single bands were excised and N-terminally sequenced. Table I lists the N-terminal sequence obtained for each of the fragments corresponding to the bands indicated in Fig. 1.

Experimental support for this has come from studies demonstrating an increase in amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition following ovariectomy/castration. Because sex steroids and gonadotropins are both part of the HPG feedback loop, any loss in sex steroids results in a proportionate increase in gonadotropins. To assess whether Aβ generation was due to the loss of serum 17β-estradiol or to the up-regulation of serum gonadotropins, we treated C57Bl/6J mice with the anti-gonadotropin leuprolide acetate, which suppresses both sex steroids and gonadotropins. Leuprolide acetate treatment resulted in a 3.5-fold (p < 0.0001) and a 1.5-fold (p < 0.024) reduction in total brain Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 concentrations, respectively, after 8 weeks of treatment. To further explore the role of gonadotropins in promoting amyloidogenesis, M17 neuroblastoma cells were treated with the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH) at concentrations equivalent to early adulthood (10 mIU/ml) or post-menopause/andropause (30 mIU/ml). LH did not alter amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) expression but did alter AβPP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway as evidenced by increased secretion and insolubility of Aβ, decreased αAβPP secretion, and increased AβPP-C99 levels. These results suggest the marked increases in serum LH following menopause/andropause as a physiologically relevant signal that could promote Aβ secretion and deposition in the aging brain. Suppression of the age-related increase in serum gonadotropins using anti-gonadotropin agents may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

The one or more underlying biochemical mechanisms leading to AD are unknown. Genetic studies have shown that mutations in AβPP and the presenilin genes lead to early onset (≤65 years) AD, which accounts for ∼5% of all AD cases. The vast majority of these mutations promote the overproduction and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) (1Cai X.D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

The primary factors responsible for Aβ deposition and disease progression in late onset AD remain to be elucidated. Aging, the strongest risk factor for late-onset AD, is associated with major changes in serum concentrations of all hormones that comprise the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, including declines in the serum concentrations of the sex steroids, 17β-estradiol and testosterone. Such changes have been correlated with the prevalence of the disease (e.g. Refs. 10Jorm A.F. Korten A.E. Henderson A.S. Acta Psychiatr.

There also is biochemical evidence suggesting that sex steroids modulate Aβ deposition in animal models (18Petanceska S.S. Nagy V. Frail D. Gandy S. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Zheng H. Xu H. Uljon S.N. Gross R. Hardy K. Gaynor J. Lafrancois J. Simpkins J. Refolo L.M. Petanceska S. Wang R. Duff K. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies have driven the idea that the loss of sex steroids following menopause/andropause is primarily responsible for the cognitive and neuropathological changes observed in the disease. Sex steroid production is, however, under the control of complex feedback loops within the HPG axis, such that during menopause the loss of negative feedback by estrogen on gonadotropin production (20Couzinet B. Schaison G. Human. Reprod. Suppl. 1993; 2: 97-101Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) results in 3-4-fold and 4-18-fold increases in the concentrations of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), respectively (21Chakravarti S. Collins W.P. Forecast J.D. Newton J.R. Oram D.H. Studd J.W. Br. Med. J. 1976; 2: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Likewise, during andropause, men experience increases of more than 2- and 3-fold in LH and FSH, respectively (22Neaves W.B. Johnson L. Porter J.C. Parker Jr., C.R. Petty C.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Thus, the neurological and biochemical changes previously ascribed to sex steroids could just as easily be explained by the large increases in the circulating concentrations of LH and/or FSH or other hormones of the HPG axis that are dysregulated by menopause/andropause. Evidence for a role of gonadotropins in the disease process is indicated by the 2-fold increase in the concentration of circulating gonadotropins in individuals with AD, above that of the already elevated concentrations of serum gonadotropins in age-matched control individuals (13Bowen R.L. Isley J.P. Atkinson R.L. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Short R.A. Bowen R.L. O'Brien P.C. Graff-Radford N.R. Mayo Clin.

Further support for a role of LH in AD is given by the findings that the highest density of LH receptors in the brain is found within the hippocampus (24Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. Kornyei J.L. Licht P.

The next day, M17 cells were treated with human LH (0-30 mIU/ml; National Hormone and Peptide Program, Harbor-UCLA, Torrance, CA) or 17β-estradiol (0-100 nm) at 37 °C for various time periods as indicated in the results section. Medium was changed with fresh medium containing the appropriate hormone concentration every 2 days. Cell Lysis and Western Immunoblotting—Following incubation with LH the M17 cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS using a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to obtain a cell pellet. The pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS prior to lysing the cells with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Total protein (25 μg) was resuspended in sample buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 3.2% (w/v) SDS, 0.4 mm glycine, 6 m urea, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (w/v) phenol red) and separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer, the membranes were immunoblotted using the antibodies against full-length AβPP (WO2), PS1 (NT1), AβPP-C99 (C1/1.6), and/or LH receptor (rabbit polyclonal and 3B5) using standard techniques as previously described (29Verdile G.

Sub-cellular Fractionation and Quantitation of Aβ—Following incubation with LH, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. After washing, the cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), containing 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 20 min to obtain a supernatant and cell pellet. The supernatant (Triton-soluble fraction) was analyzed using ELISA. The cell pellet was washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), containing 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm NaCl, to remove remaining Triton-soluble proteins. The pellet was sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (33Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D.

Following centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was diluted 1:12 to give a final concentration of guanidine hydrochloride of 0.5 m (which has been shown not to affect protein-antibody binding (34Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). The samples were then subjected to a double sandwich ELISA as previously described (36Mehta P.D. Dalton A.J.

Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with the antibody 6E10, and the Aβ was captured with the rabbit polyclonal R208 antibody conjugated with biotin. The optical density was measured at 450 nm using a Bio-Rad Model 3550 microplate reader. All samples were treated similarly to allow comparisons between treatments. The levels of Aβ are expressed as picograms per milligram of total protein. Leuprolide Acetate Treatment of Mice and Quantitation of Brain Aβ—Female C57Bl/6J mice (3 months of age) received either leuprolide acetate (1.5 mg/kg, slow release (depot) formulation) or vehicle for 0, 4, or 8 weeks and were then sacrificed. Brains were removed and dissected in half, and one hemisphere was frozen (-80 °C) for biochemical analysis. This hemisphere (to maximize yield and minimize inter-animal variability) was homogenized and used to determine the concentrations of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 using an ELISA assay as described above or previously (38Beffert U.

Poirier J. Kar S. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2001; 21: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Each sample was run in duplicate or triplicate and normalized with α-tubulin content for each sample. As in other species, leuprolide acetate has been shown to lower serum gonadotropin and sex steroid levels in previous studies (40Okada H. Doken Y. Ogawa Y. Toguchi H. Pharm. Res. 1994; 11: 1199-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Okada H. Doken Y. Ogawa Y. J. Pharm.

Endocrinology. 1964; 74: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Exposed films from Western blots were scanned (transmission scanning) using a visual light scanner (UMAX) at a resolution of 600 dpi. Scanned images were quantified using the public domain program Image (National Institutes of Health; version 1.61) to measure the density of the protein bands. Data collation and analysis were performed using Microsoft® Excel 2000. This program was also used for statistical analysis of data via the Students t test (independent, two-tailed, assuming unequal variances). Gonadotropin Lowering Hormone Decreases the Concentration of Brain Aβ in Mice—To determine whether gonadotropins alter AβPP processing and Aβ generation, we administered a GnRH analogue (leuprolide acetate, 1.5 mg/kg) to depress serum LH concentrations in 3-month-old C57Bl/6J female mice (n = 6) and then analyzed Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels. Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist that down-regulates GnRH receptors and acts as a potent antagonist, suppressing LH and FSH secretion (reviewed in Ref. 42Schally A.V. Comaru-Schally A.M. Nagy A. Kovacs M. Szepeshazi K. Plonowski A. Varga J.L. Halmos G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 248-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The actions of GnRH and its analogues are mediated by high affinity receptors for GnRH found on the membranes of the pituitary gonadotrophs (43Clayton R.N. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1981; 2: 186-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). An acute administration of agonists of GnRH induces a marked initial release of LH and FSH. However, continuous stimulation of the pituitary by chronic administration of GnRH agonists produces an inhibition of the hypophyseal-gonadal axis through the process of “down-regulation” of pituitary receptors for GnRH, desensitization of the pituitary gonadotrophs, and a suppression of circulating levels of LH and sex steroids (42Schally A.V. Comaru-Schally A.M. Nagy A. Kovacs M. Szepeshazi K. Plonowski A. Varga J.L. Halmos G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 248-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This down-regulation of GnRH receptors, produced by sustained administration of GnRH agonists, prevents GnRH signaling for the secretion of LH and FSH and provides the basis for clinical applications in numerous reproductive hormone-related disorders (42Schally A.V. Comaru-Schally A.M. Nagy A. Kovacs M. Szepeshazi K. Plonowski A. Varga J.L. Halmos G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 248-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Leuprolide treatment dramatically reduced the concentration (picograms/mg of protein) of brain Aβ1-42, by 40% after 4 weeks (24.1 ± 2.0 versus 14.5 ± 2.6, p < 0.015) and further decreased the concentration to 71% (24.1 ± 2.0 versus 7.1 ± 1.0, p < 0.0001; mean ± S.E.) that of controls after 8 weeks (Fig. 1). Leuprolide treatment also reduced brain Aβ1-40 levels by 23% after 4 weeks (5.8 ± 0.3 versus 4.5 ± 1.1, ns) and further reduced the concentration to 35% (5.8 ± 0.3 versus 3.8 ± 0.4, p < 0.024) after 8 weeks compared with control mice. Given that leuprolide acetate suppresses serum gonadotropin concentrations, these results suggest that gonadotropin hormones may modulate Aβ generation (44Atwood C.S. Verdile G. Liu T.

Secreted, Triton-soluble, and Triton-insoluble Amyloid-β Levels in Cells Treated with LH—To determine how gonadotropins may be acting to modulate the concentration of Aβ in the brain, we next assessed the effects of gonadotropins on the expression and processing of AβPP in a neuroblastoma cell line. Because FSH receptors are primarily located in reproductive tissues, and others and we have not detected FSH receptors in neuronal cell types, we focused our efforts on biochemical changes modulated by LH. To test whether LH impacts Aβ generation we used the M17 neuroblastoma cell line (widely used for studying AβPP processing (1Cai X.D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal (Fig. 2D) and monoclonal (Fig. 2E) antibodies against LH receptor indicated that M17 neuroblastoma cells contain a number of LH receptor variants, including the mature glycosylated and phosphorylated LH receptor protein (∼92 kDa), the immature full-length LH receptor (59 kDa isoform (47Indrapichate K.

Accumulating evidence suggests a role for ATR in signaling DNA damage during S-phase. Here we show that ATR is recruited to nuclear foci induced by replication fork stalling in a manner that is dependent on the single stranded binding protein replication protein A (RPA). ATR associates with chromatin in asynchronous cell cultures, and we use a variety of approaches to examine the association of ATR with chromatin in the absence of agents that cause genotoxic stress.

Using centrifugal elutriation to obtain cells enriched at various stages of the cell cycle, we show that ATR associates with chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent manner, specifically during S-phase. Cell cycle association of ATR with chromatin mirrors that of RPA in addition to claspin, a cell cycle checkpoint protein previously shown to be a component of the replication machinery. Furthermore, association of ATR with chromatin occurs in the absence of detectable DNA damage and cell cycle checkpoint activation.

These data are consistent with a model whereby ATR is recruited to chromatin during the unperturbed cell cycle and points to a role of ATR in monitoring genome integrity during normal S-phase progression. DNA damage activates a cascade of phosphorylation events that affect a variety of cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, apoptotic cell death, and cell cycle progression. Cell cycle checkpoints are signal transduction pathways that result in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage to allow repair of DNA prior to duplication of DNA during S-phase, or segregation of the genome at mitosis (1Zhou B.B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Cell cycle checkpoints are critical for the maintenance of genome integrity, and this is reflected in the observations that dysfunction of these pathways can lead to a variety of clinical symptoms, including an increased risk of cancer (2Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar). Recently, much progress has been made in our understanding of the downstream effector proteins, activated in response to DNA damage, that lead to cell cycle arrest (3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms by which DNA damage is detected and signaled remain elusive. S-phase is a period of the cell cycle when the genome is particularly susceptible to gaining mutations. Replication stress can occur during S-phase when replication forks encounter un-repaired DNA lesions, or when DNA polymerase activity is inhibited by depletion of intracellular nucleotide levels or exposure of cells to chemical agents such as aphidicolin. Replication stress can result in stalling of replication forks that under certain circumstances induces replication fork collapse and DNA damage that is potentially lethal to the cell (4Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monitoring both DNA replication and signaling of stalled replication forks is therefore essential in maintaining the integrity of the genome. Several groups of proteins are required to detect and signal stalled replication forks in higher eukaryotes, including Rad9, Rad1, Hus1, claspin, and the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related; HU, hydroxyurea; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; siRNA, small interference RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RPA, replication protein A. -related kinase ATR (3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). RAD9, RAD1, HUS1, and RAD17 were originally identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and orthologues of these genes have subsequently been found in all organisms studied to date (3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 form a complex either in the absence or presence of DNA damage and exhibit limited sequence homology to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (5St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas Rad17 exhibits sequence similarity to the large subunit of replication factor C (8Griffiths D.J.F.

The Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex and Rad17 are believed to function in detecting DNA damage in a way that is analogous to the role of replication factor C and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in DNA replication by acting as a clamp loader to recruit the checkpoint and repair machinery to sites of DNA damage and replication stress. Consistent with this hypothesis the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex is recruited to chromatin in response to DNA damage in a Rad17-dependent manner and mutation of these genes leads to defective cell cycle checkpoints and sensitivity to genotoxic stress (12Melo J.A.

Another family of proteins central to the DNA damage response comprises the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases ATM and ATR (17Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). ATM is mutated in patients with the clinical disorder ataxia telangiectasia and is believed to be primarily responsible for detecting and signaling DNA double strand breaks (18Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Disruption of ATR activity results in sensitivity to a variety of genomic insults, including UV and methylmethane sulfonate-induced DNA damage, in addition to replication fork stalling induced by hydroxyurea (HU) (19Cliby W.A.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a large body of evidence suggests that ATR functions in detecting stalled replication forks. Loss of the ATR orthologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Mec1p) results in sensitivity to DNA damage and defective S-phase checkpoint control (3Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and Mec1p is required for replication fork stability and inhibition of late origin firing in response to DNA damage and replication stress (22Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 23Santocanale C. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Reconstituted DNA replication assays using Xenopus egg extracts have illustrated that ATR is recruited to chromatin when replication forks are induced to stall and that this is dependent on initiation of DNA replication (24Hekmat-Nejad M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies in mammalian cell culture have illustrated that ATR forms nuclear foci in response to aphidicolin, an agent that induces replication fork stalling by inhibiting DNA polymerase-α (28Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest a model whereby ATR plays a central role in monitoring DNA replication and detecting stalled replication forks. In this report we demonstrate that RPA is required to recruit ATR to stalled replication forks. Furthermore, we use a variety of approaches to examine the chromatin association profile of ATR during the unperturbed cell cycle. These experiments reveal that ATR is recruited to chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent manner, specifically during unperturbed S-phase in the absence of detectable DNA damage and checkpoint activation. The implications of these observations on how ATR becomes activated to signal DNA damage and stalled replication forks are discussed. Cell Culture and Maintenance—All cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and grown using standard procedures. Synchronization of cells at G1/S-phase was achieved by incubation of cells for 25 h in 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma). Cells were subsequently released from thymidine block and allowed to grow for a further 12 h in culture medium prior to incubation in 5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) for 20–24 h. Cells were then harvested (G1/S-phase) or released into medium containing 40 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) and harvested at time points post release to obtain populations of cells as they passed through S-phase into G2. To obtain cells synchronized at pro-metaphase, cells were first incubated for 25 h in the presence 2.5 mm thymidine. Cells were released from thymidine block by washing twice and growing in thymidine-free media for 6 h before addition of nocodazole (40 ng/ml) to cell cultures. After incubation in nocodazole for 12 h, enrichment of cells synchronized in mitosis was achieved by washing detached rounded cells from the plate. To obtain cell cultures enriched for cells in G1 phase, cultures were synchronized in pro-metaphase and isolated as described above. After isolation, mitotic cells were released from nocodazole block by washing twice and culturing in nocodazole-free media. Cells entering G1 were harvested 1–8 h after incubation in nocodazole-free medium. Swiss 3T3 cells were forced into G0 by growing in flasks for 3–5 days to achieve a maximum confluence of 1.3 × 104 cells/cm2 and contact inhibition. Cells were then incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, for a further 5–10 days. Cell synchronization in G0/G1 was analyzed by FACS, as well as observing cellular morphological changes. Cells were released from quiescence by being re-plated at a lower density in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. To stall replication forks, asynchronously growing cells were incubated in 5 μg/ml aphidicolin for 24 h. To induce DNA double strand breaks, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml bleomycin (Sigma) for 2 h prior to harvesting for analysis. Centrifugal Elutriation—Enrichment of Raji cells at different phases of the cell cycle was achieved by centrifugal elutriation in a Beckman Avanti J-20I centrifuge and a JE-5 rotor with a 40-ml chamber. Rotor speed was maintained at 1,500 rpm at room temperature, and the medium flow was controlled by a Cole-Parmer Masterflex pump. Cells were equilibrated in the chamber for 20 min with a constant flow rate of 40 ml/min for efficient separation and the removal of cellular debris. 500-ml fractions were collected at increasing flow rates ranging from 40 to 120 ml/min and samples from each fraction analyzed by FACS to establish distribution of cells through the cell cycle. Cells numbers were normalized prior to preparation of chromatin and whole cell extracts. Transfection of siRNA—Duplex siRNA oligonucleotides complementary to either RPA70 or GFP were annealed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dharmacon Research). Sequences of oligonucleotides were as follows: RPA70, 5′-CAUGAAAGAGGAUAGAGUGdTdT-3′ and 5′-CACUCUAUCCUCUUUCAUGdTdT-3′; GFP, 5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′ and 5′-UGCGCUCCUGGACGUAGCCUU-3′. Cells were grown in 24-well plates at a density of 1.1 × 104 cells/cm2 and transfected twice at 24-h intervals with a final concentration of 200 nm of oligonucleotide using Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed 96 h after the first transfection of oligonucleotides. Total cell extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis by harvesting cells in Laemmli buffer and heating at 100 °C for 20 min, whereas parallel cultures grown on coverslips were used for immunofluorescence studies (see below). Cell Fractionation—To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted before being resuspended in Laemmli buffer and immediately heated to 100 °C for 20 min. Biochemical fractionation of cells into cytosol (S2), soluble nuclear (S3), and chromatin (P3) fractions was performed as previously described (29Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) to a final concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml. Triton X-100 was added to final concentration of 0.1%, and the cells were incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were collected by low speed centrifugation for 4 min at 1,200 × g. The supernatant, containing soluble cytosolic proteins (S2), was collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g to remove cell debris and insoluble material. The nuclei were washed once with buffer A and lysed in buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Insoluble chromatin was collected by centrifugation for 4 min at 1,800 × g, and the supernatant containing soluble nuclear protein was collected (S3). The chromatin pellet was washed twice in buffer B and pelleted again as described above. The final pellet (P3) was re-suspended in Laemmli buffer and heated to 100 °C for 20 min. In instances when preparations were treated with microccocal nuclease, nuclei were re-suspended in buffer A supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 units of microccocal nuclease (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 min, nuclei were isolated and fractionated as described above. Antibodies—Sheep polyclonal antisera were generated against amino acids 400–480 of the N terminus of ATR (Scotland Diagnostics), and antibodies that recognize ATR were purified by affinity purification using standard procedures. Antibodies obtained from commercial sources were as follows: ATR/FRP1 (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-RPA70 (NA13, Oncogene Research Products) goat anti-RPA70 (C-21, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MCM5 (Serotec UK), histone H3 (Abcam), γ-H2AX (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), Erk (Zymed Laboratories), Orc2 (Oncogene Research Products), Rad9 (M-389, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies that recognize Ku70 and Ku80 were a generous gift from S. P. Jackson (Wellcome/CR UK Institute, Cambridge, UK). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown as monolayers on glass coverslips. After specified treatments, cells were treated essentially as previously described (30Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using an Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope equipped with Axiovision imaging software (Zeiss). ATR Is Recruited to Stalled Replication Forks in an RPA-dependent Manner—Consistent with a role in signaling stalled replication forks, ATR has previously been reported to re-locate to nuclear foci in response to inhibition of DNA polymerase-α activity by aphidicolin (28Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that ATR forms nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation induced DNA damage and that this is dependent on the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (31Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). Given the proposed role of ATR in the S-phase checkpoint, we were intrigued as to whether RPA is also required to recruit ATR to stalled replication forks. Accordingly, replication fork stalling was induced in HeLa cells by exposing cell cultures to aphidicolin for 24 h, and the formation of RPA70 and ATR nuclear foci was assessed by immunofluorescence. Both ATR and RPA70 formed nuclear foci in response to aphidicolin that co-localize, suggesting that these proteins are both recruited to sites of stalled replication forks (Fig. 1A). We next wished to establish whether RPA is required for ATR to be recruited to sites of stalled replication forks. To address this question, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene repression to knock down the expression of RPA70. Transfection of HeLa cells with a siRNA complementary to RPA70 resulted in a 75–85% reduction of levels of RPA70 when compared with untransfected cells, or in cells transfected with siRNA complementary to GFP (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, levels of ATR and Ku80 remained unaffected by either GFP or RPA70 siRNA, illustrating the specificity of this approach (Fig. 1B). Exposure of GFP-transfected cell cultures to aphidicolin for 24 h resulted in an increase of between 60 and 70% of cells exhibiting RPA70 and ATR nuclear foci (Fig. 1, C and D). As predicted, siRNA-mediated repression of RPA70 expression resulted in a reduction of RPA70 nuclear foci in aphidicolin-treated cultures to levels comparable to untreated controls (Fig. 1, C and D). Strikingly, however, loss of RPA70 resulted in a corresponding decrease in ATR foci induced by aphidicolin (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, in addition to being required to recruit ATR to sites of DNA damage, RPA is also required to recruit ATR to sites of stalled replication forks. ATR Associates with Chromatin in a Proliferation-dependent Manner—In addition to its role in signaling DNA damage, RPA functions in a number of pathways involved in DNA metabolism (32Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). For example, RPA coats single-stranded DNA when replication origins fire and promote the recruitment of DNA polymerase-α to these structures to synthesize the RNA primer that is a pre-requisite for DNA synthesis (32Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The requirement of RPA to recruit ATR to sites of DNA damage and stalled replication forks (Fig. 1, C and D) (31Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) in addition to its role in the normal cell division cycle raises the intriguing possibility that RPA may promote the recruitment of ATR to chromatin during normal cellular proliferation. To investigate this possibility, we subjected asynchronous HeLa cell populations to biochemical fractionation into cytosolic, soluble nuclear, and chromatin-containing fractions as described previously (29Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Briefly, this was achieved by isolating nuclei from cells lysed using Triton X-100 in a sucrose-rich buffer. Nuclei were then lysed using a no-salt buffer and chromatin isolated from nuclear lysates by centrifugation. The location of ATR within these fractions was assessed by Western blotting. Detection of histone H3 exclusively in chromatin-containing fractions (P3) and the growth factor signaling kinase Erk2 exclusively in cytosolic fractions (S2), illustrate the integrity of this cell fractionation procedure (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, although ATR is evident in the cytosol of asynchronous HeLa cells, a proportion of ATR was consistently observed to co-fractionate with chromatin. Treatment of chromatin fractions with micrococcal nuclease results in loss of ATR from P3 fractions, illustrating that co-fractionation of ATR is dependent on DNA (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained from Raji and HEK293 cells, illustrating that this phenomenon is not specific to HeLa cells (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports (15Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), exposure of cells to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation, or replication stress induced by aphidicolin resulted in enrichment of the cell cycle checkpoint protein Rad9 in chromatin-containing fractions (Fig. 2B). However, no significant enrichment of ATR on chromatin was observed in response to these forms of genotoxic stress (Fig. 2B). The observations that ATR co-fractionates with chromatin prepared from asynchronously growing cells might suggest this kinase is recruited to DNA during the normal cell division cycle. To investigate this possibility further and whether ATR association with chromatin is dependent on cell proliferation, we assessed the association of ATR with chromatin in Swiss 3T3 cell cultures forced to withdraw from the cell cycle into G0 by serum starvation. Consistent with data obtained from HeLa cells (Fig. 2A), a proportion of ATR is apparent in chromatin fractions prepared from asynchronous Swiss 3T3 cell populations (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, although the overall cellular levels of ATR remained constant, serum withdrawal resulted in a decrease in the amount of ATR that co-fractionates with chromatin at between 1 and 7 days (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar data were obtained forcing cells to enter a quiescent state by contact inhibition, illustrating that this observation is not a result of growth factor withdrawal (data not shown). Reduction in the amount of ATR that co-fractionates with chromatin followed similar kinetics to that of Mcm5, a replication-licensing protein previously described to dissociate from chromatin when cells withdraw from the cell cycle (33Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Krude T. Romanowski P. Marheineke K. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, release of cells from G0 resulted in the re-appearance of ATR in chromatin-containing fractions at between 12 to 18 h after addition of serum (Fig. 3B), a time that FACS analysis revealed coincided with cells entering S-phase (data not shown). At the time points investigated in this experiment, the kinetics of ATR re-association with chromatin is similar to that of Mcm5, a protein previously shown to associate with chromatin when cells reenter the cell cycle from quiescence, and replication origins are licensed in G1 (33Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Krude T. Romanowski P. Marheineke K. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data are consistent with ATR being recruited to chromatin in the absence of genotoxic stress in a cell proliferation-dependent manner. ATR Exhibits a Decreased Affinity for Chromatin during Mitosis or G1-phase of the Cell Cycle—The observation that ATR is recruited to chromatin as quiescent cells re-enter the cell cycle might suggest that ATR is recruited to chromatin either as cells license replication origins in G1, or as DNA replication is initiated at the beginning of S-phase. The observation that RPA is required for recruitment of ATR to sites of DNA damage and stalled replication forks (Fig. 1, C and D) (31Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) might argue that ATR is recruited to chromatin during normal S-phase progression. Consistent with this idea, using Xenopus DNA replication assays, ATR has been demonstrated to associate with chromatin in vitro in a manner that is dependent on RPA and DNA replication (24Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z.S. Yee M.C. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One prediction of this model would be that ATR is absent from chromatin as cells complete replication and enter mitosis. To investigate this possibility, HeLa cells were synchronized at pro-metaphase by incubation in nocodazole. Asynchronous and nocodazole-treated cells were fractionated into cytosol (S2), soluble nuclear (S3), or chromatin containing (P3) fractions, and the location of ATR in the cell investigated by Western blotting. Consistent with previous observations, a proportion of ATR is present in chromatin containing fraction in asynchronous cell populations, with a small amount located in the cytosol (Fig. 4A). However, synchronization of cells at pro-metaphase results in a reduction of the proportion of ATR that co-fractionates with chromatin, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of ATR present in the nucleosol and cytosol. Once more, the cellular location of ATR followed that of Mcm5, a protein shown to dissociate from chromatin as cells complete S-phase and enter mitosis (29Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Data presented in Fig. 3 illustrate that, similar to Mcm5, ATR is recruited to chromatin as cells re-enter the cell cycle from quiescence. Mcm proteins are recruited to chromatin during G1 of the cell cycle to license replication origins to fire at the initiation of S-phase (34Blow J.J. Hodgson B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 72-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although data presented in Fig. 3 might suggest ATR is recruited to chromatin along with Mcm5 as replication origins are licensed in G1, we wished to more finely dissect the recruitment of ATR and Mcm5 to chromatin during G1 phase of the cell cycle. To achieve this, we released cells from a nocodazole block and examined the chromatin association profile of ATR and Mcm5 as cells proceeded from mitosis into G1 at shorter time intervals than those employed in Fig. 3B. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, Mcm5 is recruited to chromatin at between 1 and 2 h after release from a mitotic block, a time that coincides with cells entering G1. However, no corresponding enrichment of ATR is observed in samples in which replication origins are being licensed, as judged by recruitment of Mcm5 to chromatin. These data therefore suggest that, under our experimental conditions, ATR exhibits a decreased affinity for chromatin at mitosis or as cells license replication origins in G1. ATR Associates with Chromatin during Unperturbed S-phase in the Absence of Checkpoint Activation—The observations, that ATR is associated with chromatin in asynchronous cell populations but is reduced in chromatin fractions prepared from cells blocked in pro-metaphase and early G1, might be consistent with ATR being recruited to chromatin during S-phase. To investigate this possibility further, whole cell or chromatin-containing extracts were prepared from Raji cells synchronized at either the G1/S transition by a thymidine/aphidicolin block or from cells at time points after release from this block as they passed through S-phase. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, ATR is enriched in chromatin-containing fractions isolated from cells halted at the transition from G1 into S-phase. Furthermore, ATR is evident in chromatin-containing fractions at time points after cells are released from this block and allowed to synchronously pass through S-phase, but is reduced in cells in late S-phase and mitosis. Similar data were obtained using HeLa and HEK293 cells (data not shown). Although data presented in Fig. 5A may be consistent with ATR being recruited to chromatin during S-phase, we were also keen to observe the chromatin association profile of ATR in synchronous cell populations that had not been exposed to chemical agents that effect normal cell metabolism. To achieve this, chromatin extracts were prepared from Raji cells that had been subjected to centrifugal elutriation to obtain cells enriched at G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 5, B–D). Consistent with previous reports (29Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), Mcm5 associated with chromatin in cell populations enriched for cells in late G1/S-phase (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, although cell populations enriched in G1 contained residual levels of chromatin-associated ATR, this was less than that associated with chromatin prepared from asynchronous cell cultures. Strikingly, however, levels of ATR associated with chromatin increased in cell populations enriched in S-phase (Fig. 5B). The profile of association of ATR with chromatin followed that of RPA, consistent with ATR being recruited to chromatin at the initiation of S-phase (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, claspin, a cell cycle checkpoint protein previously shown to associate with chromatin during S-phase in yeast (35Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 36Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), also associated with chromatin in a manner similar to ATR and RPA (Fig. 5C). One possible interpretation of these data could be that enrichment of ATR and claspin on chromatin is a result of these checkpoint proteins being recruited to replication forks that encounter DNA damage during DNA synthesis. To discount this possibility, extracts were assessed for the phosphorylation status of H2AX at serine 139 (γ-H2AX), a phosphorylation event previously shown to occur in an ATR-dependent manner in response to replication stress (37Redon C. Pilch D. Rogakou E. Sedelnikova O. Newrock K. Bonner W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 38Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Although a significant level of γ-H2AX is evident in extracts prepared from HeLa cells exposed to aphidicolin, no enrichment of γ-H2AX is observed in extracts prepared from cells in which ATR becomes enriched on chromatin (Fig. 5D). In vitro studies using Xenopus-reconstituted replication assays have led to the proposal that ATR signals to Chk1 during S-phase to prevent entry into mitosis before complete replication of the genome (24Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z.S. Yee M.C. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We were therefore intrigued to establish whether chromatin association of ATR during S-phase results in the activation of the S-phase checkpoint. Accordingly, we examined the phosphorylation status of Chk1 at S345 (pS345), a molecular marker of S-phase checkpoint activation. As illustrated in Fig. 5C, although a significant amount of pS345 Chk1 is apparent in extracts prepared from cells exposed to aphidicolin, no corresponding increase in the levels of Chk1 phosphorylated at this site are apparent in extracts prepared from cells enriched in S-phase by centrifugal elutriation. Taken together, these data illustrate that ATR exhibits an increased affinity for chromatin during S-phase in the absence of detectable DNA damage and activation of the S-phase checkpoint. ATR is a central component of the DNA damage-signaling machinery involved in detecting and signaling stalled replication forks (17Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which ATR is recruited to sites of stalled replication remain unknown. In this manuscript, we establish that, similar to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (31Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar), RPA is also required to recruit ATR to sites of stalled replication forks. Given the role of RPA in S-phase initiation and progression, we have investigated the possibility that ATR is recruited to chromatin during the cell cycle, and we present evidence that ATR is recruited to chromatin during unperturbed S-phase independently of detectable DNA damage and checkpoint activation. Contradictory data exist using different model systems to investigate the association of ATR with chromatin during S-phase. In vitro observations using Xenopus-reconstituted replication assays suggest ATR is recruited to chromatin at the onset of S-phase, and is subsequently enriched upon chromatin when replication forks stall (24Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z.S. Yee M.C. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, recent in vivo studies in S. cerevisiae illustrate that, although the checkpoint protein Mrc1p is recruited to replication origins at the initiation of DNA synthesis, the ATR orthologue Mec1p is recruited to chromatin only after induction of replication stress by HU (35Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 36Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Our data more closely resemble the situation in Xenopus, with a proportion of ATR being recruited to chromatin during S-phase in the absence of stalled replication forks induced by agents such as aphidicolin. However, dissimilar to studies performed in Xenopus (24Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z.S. Yee M.C. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we do not observe a significant increase in vivo of pS354 Chk1 levels as cells traverse S-phase. This would argue against detectable activation of the ATR-mediated checkpoint pathway during S-phase, despite the presence of ATR on chromatin. In support of this reasoning, disruption of ATR in mammalian cell culture results in dysfunction of the S-phase checkpoint and premature entry into mitosis only after cells are exposed to agents that cause DNA damage and/or replication stress (20Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.-S. Vaziri C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the cell cycle checkpoint protein claspin is recruited to replication origins as they fire and that it migrates with the replication fork (35Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 36Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 39Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is therefore interesting to speculate that ATR could also be recruited to replication origins at the initiation of DNA synthesis and be a component of the replication apparatus. Although the data presented in this report might be consistent with such a model, to date we have no data that directly supports this hypothesis. Under our experimental conditions, we observe only a small percentage of cells that exhibit weak ATR and RPA foci in asynchronous cell cultures. Although this might argue against ATR being present in replication factories, it is also possible that in an unstressed cell there is insufficient ATR associated with the replication fork to be detected by immunofluorescence. However, a recent study in S. cerevisiae has illustrated that Mec1p is only recruited to chromatin after replication forks are induced to stall by HU, arguing that the ATR orthologue in this organism is not a component of the replication machinery (36Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). ATR is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity during S-phase and loss of the atr gene in mice results in early embryonic lethality due to apoptosis caused by extensive chromosomal fragmentation (40Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 41de Klein A. Muijtjens M. van Os R. Verhoeven Y. Smit B. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 479-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This observation can be explained, in part, by a recent report illustrating the importance of ATR in maintaining fragile site stability during S-phase either in the presence or absence of replication stress (42Casper A.M. Nghiem P. Arlt M.F. Glover T.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 779-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Fragile sites are areas of the genome that are susceptible to DNA damage when cells are exposed to low doses of agents that cause replication stress such as aphidicolin (43Richards R.I. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 339-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). An apparently analogous phenomenon exists in S. cerevisiae, where Mec1p has been shown to be required for the maintenance of genome integrity during DNA synthesis through replication “slow zones” (44Cha R.S. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 297: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Although we cannot discount the possibility that ATR is a component of the replication machinery, an equally plausible explanation of our data might be that ATR is recruited to chromatin not in unperturbed S-phase per se, but as the replication machinery passes through fragile sites or other areas of the genome that are particularly susceptible to instability. One possible function of ATR being recruited to chromatin as cells traverse S-phase might be to stabilize the replication fork as it passes through regions of the genome that are particularly susceptible to DNA damage during replication. In support of this hypothesis, studies in S. cerevisiae have demonstrated that Mec1p is required to prevent the collapse of the replication forks when they stall (22Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In the future, it will be interesting to study the relationship between ATR, the replication machinery, and fragile site expression.

We have found that Ig-like Necl-5/Tage4 is up-regulated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic Ras (V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells) and heterophilically trans-interacts with a Ca2+-independent Ig-like cell adhesion molecule nectin-3, eventually enhancing their intercellular motility. We show here that Necl-5 furthermore enhances cell migration in a nectin-3-independent manner. Studies using L fibroblasts expressing various mutants of Necl-5, NIH3T3 cells, and V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells have revealed that Necl-5 enhances serum- and platelet-derived growth factor-induced cell migration. The extracellular region of Necl-5 is necessary for directional cell migration, but not for random cell motility. The cytoplasmic region of Necl-5 is necessary for both directional and random cell movement. Necl-5 colocalizes with integrin αVβ3 at leading edges of migrating cells. Analyses using an inhibitor or an activator of integrin αVβ3 or a dominant negative mutant of Necl-5 have shown the functional association of Necl-5 with integrin αVβ3 in cell motility. Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins are activated by the action of Necl-5 and required for the serum-induced, Necl-5-enhanced cell motility. These results indicate that Necl-5 regulates serum- and platelet-derived growth factor-induced cell migration in an integrin-dependent, nectin-3-independent manner, when cells do not contact other cells. We furthermore show here that enhanced motility and metastasis of V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells are at least partly the result of up-regulated Necl-5.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5531) Google Scholar). Cells migrate as individuals or as groups; leukocytes, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts migrate as individuals, whereas epithelial and endothelial cells migrate as groups. Cell migration is divided into at least four mechanistically separate steps: extension of protrusions, formation of new cell-matrix adhesions, contraction of cell body, and tail detachment (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar, 5Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Cell migration is normally directed and controlled by extracellular cues, such as growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules. These cues stimulate cell surface receptors to initiate intracellular signaling through second messengers, protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and heterotrimeric large and monomeric small G proteins to regulate the multiple steps. When migrating cells contact other cells, they stop migration and proliferation (6Abercrombie M. In Vitro. 1970; 6: 128-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 7Martz E. Steinberg M.S. J. Cell Physiol. 1972; 79: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is known for a long time as contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation. Transformation of cells causes disruption of cell-cell adhesion, increase of cell motility, and loss of contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation, eventually leading transformed cells to invasion into surrounding tissues and metastasis to other organs (4Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5531) Google Scholar, 8Abercrombie M. Nature. 1979; 281: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Cell-cell adhesion is mainly mediated by cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs), 1The abbreviations used are: AJ, adherens junction; aa, amino acid(s); PVR, poliovirus receptor; Necl, nectin-like molecule; V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells, NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic Ki-Ras; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Nef-3, the extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the human IgG Fc; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; non-tagged Necl-5-L cells, L cells stably expressing Necl-5; Necl-5-L cells, L cells stably expressing FLAG-Necl-5; Necl-5-ΔEC-L cells, L cells stably expressing Necl-5 of which extracellular region is deleted; Necl-5-ΔCP-L cells, L cells stably expressing Necl-5 of which cytoplasmic region is deleted; Necl-5-ΔCP-NIH3T3 cells, NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Necl-5 of which cytoplasmic region is deleted; Necl-5-ΔCP-V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells, V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Necl-5 of which cytoplasmic region is deleted; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FRET, fluorescent resonance energy transfer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein. where cadherins are key Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules (5Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar, 9Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Cadherins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through many peripheral membrane proteins, including α- and β-catenins, α-actinin, and vinculin, which strengthen cell-cell adhesion activity of cadherins. Nectins are Ca2+-independent Ig-like cell-cell adhesion molecules that also localize at cell-cell AJs and regulate organization of AJs in cooperation with cadherins (10Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 11Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Nectins are similarly associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin. Nectins comprise a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. Nectins have one extracellular region with three Ig-like loops, one transmembrane region, and one cytoplasmic region. All nectins except nectin-4 have a C-terminal conserved motif of four amino acid (aa) residues that interacts with the PDZ domain of afadin. Nectin-4 does not have this motif but binds afadin. Each nectin forms homo-cis-dimers, followed by formation of homo-trans-dimers (homo-trans-interaction), causing cell-cell adhesion. Nectin-3 furthermore forms hetero-trans-dimers (hetero-trans-interaction) with nectin-1 or -2, and the adhesion activity of the hetero-trans-dimers is stronger than that of the homo-trans-dimers. Nectin-4 also forms hetero-trans-dimers with nectin-1. In addition to the cell-cell adhesion activity, nectins have an activity to induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, which regulate cell-cell adhesion through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and gene expression through activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (12Kawakatsu T.

Nectins furthermore directly bind PAR-3, a cell polarity protein, and regulate cell polarization (15Takekuni K. Ikeda W. Fujito T. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Five other molecules with one extracellular region with three Ig-like loops, one transmembrane region, and one cytoplasmic region have thus far been identified.

Cancer. 1996; 68: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The domain structures of this group of molecules are similar to those of nectins, but they do not bind afadin (11Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 26Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A.

We have proposed that this group of molecules is tentatively called nectin-like molecules (Necls). Of these Necls, we focus here on Necl-5/Tage4/PVR/CD155. Tage4 was originally identified to be the product of a gene overexpressed in rat and mouse colon carcinoma (24Chadeneau C. LeMoullac B. Denis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15601-15605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chadeneau C. LeCabellec M. LeMoullac B. Meflah K. Denis M.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Tage4 gene has been mapped to rat chromosome 1q22 (27Chadeneau C. Liehr T. Rautenstrauss B. Denis M.G. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 157-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and mouse 7A2-B1 (28Chadeneau C. LeMoullac B. LeCabellec M. Mattei M. Meflah K. Denis M.G. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 636-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis has revealed that the Tage4 mRNA is expressed in normal adult rat and mouse tissues to small extents (24Chadeneau C. LeMoullac B. Denis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15601-15605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chadeneau C. LeCabellec M. LeMoullac B. Meflah K. Denis M.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tage4 has been shown to mediate entry of porcine pseudorabies virus and bovine herpesvirus 1 (29Baury B. Geraghty R.J. Masson D. Lustenberger P. Spear P.G. Denis M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PVR/CD155 was originally identified as a human poliovirus receptor (22Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 23Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The PVR/CD155 gene has been mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 19, and this region is homologous to the regions of rat and mouse Tage4 genes (23Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 29Baury B. Geraghty R.J. Masson D. Lustenberger P. Spear P.G. Denis M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PVR/CD155 has not been thought to be a cell-cell adhesion molecule because it does not homophilically trans-interact (30Aoki J. Koike S. Asou H. Ise I. Suwa H. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Nomoto A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PVR/CD155 has been shown to serve as an entry receptor not only for human poliovirus but also for porcine pseudorabies virus and bovine herpesvirus 1 (29Baury B. Geraghty R.J. Masson D. Lustenberger P. Spear P.G. Denis M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Geraghty R.J. Krummenacher C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Spear P.G. Science. 1998; 280: 1618-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). PVR/CD155 is overexpressed in human colorectal carcinoma and malignant glioma (32Masson D. Jarry A. Baury B. Blanchardie P. Laboisse C. Lustenberger P. Denis M.G. Gut. 2001; 49: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Gromeier M. Lachmann S. Rosenfeld M.R. Gutin P.H. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). PVR/CD155 has been shown to be physically associated with CD44 on human monocyte cell surfaces (34Freistadt M.S. Eberle K.E. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1247-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CD44 is known to be a transmembrane protein that is involved in cell migration and metastasis of cancer cells (35Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of PVR/CD155 has been reported to bind to the extracellular matrix molecule vitronectin (36Lange R. Peng X. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. Virology. 2001; 285: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region of PVR/CD155 binds to Tctex-1, a subunit of the dynein motor complex (37Mueller S. Cao X. Welker R. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7897-7904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the roles of Tage4 and PVR/CD155 as viral receptors have been established, but their physiological function(s) remained unknown. We have recently shown that Tage4 does not homophilically trans-interact, but heterophilically trans-interacts with nectin-3, that its expression is very low in normal adult tissues but up-regulated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic Ki-Ras (V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells) as estimated by Western blotting, and that the heterophilic trans-interaction of Tage4 with nectin-3 enhances intercellular motility of V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells (26Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consistently, Mueller and Wimmer (38Mueller S. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31251-31260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have recently shown that PVR/CD155 heterophilically trans-interacts with nectin-3. The phylogenetic analysis of nectins and Necls cannot clearly conclude that the genes of Tage4 and PVR/CD155 are derived from the common or different ancestor gene (26Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and their exact relationship is currently unknown. However, on the basis of similar properties of Tage4 and PVR/CD155 thus far elucidated (29Baury B. Geraghty R.J. Masson D. Lustenberger P. Spear P.G. Denis M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39Ravens I. Seth S. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we tentatively propose here that they are derived from the common ancestor gene and called Necl-5. Extending these earlier observations, we have first examined here whether Necl-5 regulates motility of cells that do not contact other cells expressing nectin-3 and have found that Necl-5 enhances serum- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced cell motility without its trans-interaction with nectin-3. We have then examined whether the serum-induced, Necl-5-enhanced cell motility requires integrins, because integrins have been shown to play a key role in cell motility (40Hood J.D. Cheresh D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), and have found that Necl-5 is functionally associated with integrin αVβ3 in cell motility. Analysis on the mode of action of Necl-5 has revealed that it enhances cell motility through activation of Cdc42 and Rac. We show here that Necl-5 regulates serum- and PDGF-induced cell motility in an integrin-dependent, nectin-3-independent manner. We furthermore show that enhanced motility and metastasis of V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells are at least partly the result of up-regulated Necl-5. Construction—Expression vectors were constructed in pCAGIZeo (41Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A.

Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 103 cells/35-mm dish. When the anti-Necl-5 mAb-i or vitronectin was added into the medium, the final concentration of the anti-Necl-5 mAb-i or vitronectin was 50 or 20 μg/ml, respectively. When the cells were incubated in the absence of serum, DMEM supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA was used. After incubation for 16 h, the samples were fixed with PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde and cell motility was analyzed by measuring the areas free of gold particles around a single cell. Five independent experiments were performed, and at least 24 independent samples in each experiment were picked up to determine the areas. The statistical significance was determined by paired t test. Boyden Chamber Assay—The Boyden chamber assay was performed as described (49Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Falcon™ cell culture inserts (8.0-μm pores, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were coated with 3 μg/ml vitronectin or 1% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. The inserts were then blocked with 1% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. NIH3T3 cell lines, which had been serum starved with DMEM supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA for 24 h, were detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA and then treated with a trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were then resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA and seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells/insert. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 14 h in the presence or absence of 30 ng/ml of PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB was added only to the bottom well to generate a concentration gradient. After incubation, the inserts were washed with PBS, the cells were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde and subsequently stained with 0.5% Crystal Violet (Sigma). The cells, which had not migrated, were removed by wiping the top of the membrane with a cotton swap. The number of stained cells in five randomly chosen fields per filter were counted by microscopic examination. Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Imaging—The FRET imaging was performed as described (13Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Necl-5-L, Necl-5-ΔEC-L, or Necl-5-ΔCP-L cells were transfected with pRaichu-Rac1 or pRaichu-Cdc42 using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. The FRET probes for wild-type Rac1 and Cdc42 consisted of a CRIB domain of PAK, Rac1 or Cdc42, a pair of green fluorescent protein mutants, and a CAAX box of Ki-Ras (50Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after the transfection, the cells were replated on the glass base dishes (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan). Sixteen h after replating, the cells were then imaged with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera, CoolSNAP HQ (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ), controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) (51Miyawaki A.

https://openalex.org/W1982121664,"ERp57 is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and characterized by its specificity for glycoproteins. Substrate selection by ERp57 is dependent upon its formation of discrete complexes with two ER resident lectins, soluble calreticulin and membrane-bound calnexin. It is these two lectins that directly associate with glycoproteins bearing correctly trimmed oligosaccharide side chains. Thus, ERp57 is presented with a preselected set of substrates upon which it can act, and the specific binding of calreticulin and calnexin to ERp57 is pivotal to the functions of the resulting complexes. To gain further insights into the formation of these ERp57-ER lectin complexes, we have investigated the regions of ERp57 that are specifically required for its binding to calreticulin. Using a quantitative pull-down assay to investigate the binding of ERp57/PDI chimeras to calreticulin, we define the b and b′ domains of ERp57 as the minimal elements that are sufficient for complex formation. This analysis further identifies a novel role for the distinctive C-terminal extension of ERp57 in reconstituting complex formation to wild type levels. Using our understanding of substrate binding to the b′ domain of PDI as a paradigm, we show that alterations to specific residues in the b′ domain of ERp57 dramatically reduce or completely abolish its binding to calreticulin. On the basis of these data, we propose a model where the region of ERp57 equivalent to the primary substrate binding site of archetypal PDI is occupied by calreticulin and suggest that the ER lectins act as adaptor molecules that define the substrate specificity of ERp57.

The ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BMH, bismaleimidohexane; ERp57ΔC, ERp57 lacking its C-terminal region (encodes residues Met1 to Ile490); ERp57Δss, ERp57 lacking its signal sequence and starting at an initiator Met followed by residue Ser25 of the full-length coding region; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CD, circular dichroism; TX-100, Triton X-100. contains a number of molecular chaperones and folding factors that facilitate the folding and assembly of newly synthesized polypeptides as they are translocated across the ER membrane and into its lumen. Among these, a set of glycoprotein-specific components have been identified and found to be dependent upon the covalent attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides to nascent polypeptides (1High S. Lecomte F.J. Russell S.J. Abell B.M. Oliver J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 38-41Google Scholar, 2Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Google Scholar). This recruitment process is tightly regulated by the glucose trimming of the N-linked glycans such that the monoglucosylated form of the oligosaccharide binds to two homologous ER lectins, calnexin and calreticulin, that are pivotal to the chaperone-mediated folding of glycoproteins (1High S. Lecomte F.J. Russell S.J. Abell B.M. Oliver J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 38-41Google Scholar, 2Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Google Scholar). There is evidence that the integral membrane protein calnexin, and the soluble luminal protein calreticulin, can act as bona fide molecular chaperones, and hence might influence protein folding directly (3Danilczyk U.G. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25532-25540Google Scholar, 4Leach M.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9072-9079Google Scholar). However, a primary function of calnexin and calreticulin is to bring newly synthesized glycoproteins together with the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)-like protein ERp57, and these ER lectin-ERp57 complexes significantly promote native disulfide bond formation in their glycoprotein substrates (5Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Google Scholar, 6Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Google Scholar). In practice, ERp57 has been shown to form stable complexes with both calnexin and calreticulin, and these complexes can be readily detected using an in vitro cross-linking assay (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). High resolution structures for substantial segments of calreticulin and calnexin are available (8Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Guntert P. Braun D. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Google Scholar, 9Ellgaard L. Bettendorff P. Braun D. Herrmann T. Fiorito F.

Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar). Further studies show that ERp57 binds to the tip of the P-domain of calreticulin (11Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Google Scholar, 12Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Google Scholar), an extended hairpin fold that protrudes from the compact globular domain containing the lectin activity and that is conserved in calnexin (10Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar). A second, zinc-dependent interaction of ERp57 with the globular domains of these ER lectins can also be detected in vitro (12Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Google Scholar). In contrast, the one or more regions of ERp57 that enable it to assemble specifically with calnexin and calreticulin are unclear (cf. Ref. 7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). All of the members of the PDI family are characterized by a modular structure, and both PDI and ERp57 have the same basic domain organization of a, b, b′, a′, and c where the a and a′ domains contain the thioredoxin-like motif Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys (see Ref. 13Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Google Scholar). For PDI, simple thiol-disulfide chemistry only requires the a or a′ domains, and simple isomerization requires one of these active domains in combination with the b′ domain (14Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Google Scholar, 15Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Google Scholar). However, complex isomerization requires all four PDI domains (abb′a′), but not the C-terminal region (14Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Google Scholar, 15Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Google Scholar). The b′ domain was found to be essential for PDI-protein substrate interactions and is sufficient for the binding of small peptides, although other domains contributed to the association of PDI with large peptides and partially unfolded proteins (16Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Google Scholar, 17Klappa P. Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ruddock L.W. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13213-13218Google Scholar, 18Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Google Scholar). Hence, the b′ domain of PDI appears to be its principle peptide binding site, although other domains may be required for interactions with larger substrates. The conserved modular structure of PDI and ERp57 has been exploited to generate chimeras that have then been used to define the one or more regions of PDI that facilitate specific interactions with other ER proteins to generate protein complexes with defined functions. Using this approach it was found that both the b′ and a′ domains of PDI are the minimum requirement for it to function as a subunit of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase and that the inclusion of the b domain enhances this activity significantly (19Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11287-11293Google Scholar). We have previously shown that ERp57 associates specifically with the two ER lectins, calnexin and calreticulin, whereas archetypal PDI does not (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). To establish the molecular basis for the specific assembly of ERp57 with calnexin and calreticulin, we have exploited chimeras derived from the two related proteins to map the domains of ERp57 that mediate its binding to the ER lectins. Using a newly established pull-down assay, we find that the principal binding site for calreticulin lies within the region defined by the b and b′ domains of ERp57 and show that its distinct C-terminal region enhances ERp57 binding. To more closely define the binding of calreticulin to ERp57, we have exploited our knowledge of substrate binding to PDI. Using previously characterized point mutants of the PDI b′ domain as a starting point (18Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Google Scholar), we show that the alteration of equivalent residues in the ERp57 b′ domain can completely abolish its binding to calreticulin while still allowing the protein to attain a structure comparable to that of the wild type protein. On the basis of these data we propose that regions of ERp57 equivalent to the substrate binding site of PDI are occupied by calnexin or calreticulin, and these lectins act as adaptors that specifically recruit glycoprotein substrates to the ERp57-ER lectin chaperone complexes. Materials—Bismaleimidohexane (BMH) was purchased from Pierce and Warriner (Chester, UK), restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Herts, UK), and RNA polymerase, transcription reagents, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were from Promega (Southampton, UK). Easytag l-[35S]methionine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Stevenage, UK), whereas all other chemicals were from BDH/Merck (Poole, UK) and Sigma (Poole, UK). The rabbit antiserum specific for the C-terminal region of human ERp57 was generated to order by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium), whereas the anti-calreticulin serum was obtained from Cambridge Bioscience (Cambridge, UK). Purified, recombinant PDI was a gift from Professor N. Bulleid, University of Manchester, UK. ERp57 and PDI Derivatives—Wild type human ERp57 and human PDI were as previously described (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). PDI/ERp57 chimeric constructs 2–6 (cf. Ref. 19Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11287-11293Google Scholar) were removed from the pVL1392 vector by restriction digestion and then ligated into either pBluescript KS II or pBluescript SK II under the control of the T7 promoter (cf. Ref. 7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). The ERp57Δss construct was generated by using PCR to remove the region encoding the signal sequence and to introduce an ATG start codon immediately before that encoding the first residue of the mature sequence. The precise origin of each ERp57/PDI chimera is indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. The thirteen ERp57 b′ domain point mutants (V267A, V267W, Y269A, Y269W, E270A, K274A, R280A, N281A, V283A, V283L, V283W, F299A, and F299W) were generated by mutagenesis of the wild type coding region present in pBluescript KS II, and all mutants were authenticated by DNA sequencing. Cross-linking Analysis—The ability of wild type ERp57, and the various b′ domain point mutants, to associate with the endogenous calreticulin present in ER-derived canine pancreatic microsomes was carried out essentially as previously described (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). A flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system was used to synthesize the polypeptides at 30 °C for 1 h, and translation was terminated by treatment with 2 mm puromycin. Cross-linking with BMH (final concentration, 500 μm) and product identification by immunoprecipitation were also as previously detailed (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). Preparation of Biotinylated Calreticulin—A calreticulin cDNA fragment lacking the ER signal sequence was amplified by PCR from a plasmid containing the full-length cDNA (20Roderick H.L. Campbell A.K. Llewellyn D.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 181-185Google Scholar) utilizing a modified sense primer incorporating an NruI site at its 5′ end to facilitate its cloning downstream of the biotin purification tag present in the Pin-Point Xa-1 vector (Promega). Sequencing of the recombinant Pin Point construct confirmed that the mature calreticulin coding region was inserted adjacent to, and in frame with, the plasmid fusion tag with an intact factor Xa cleavage site. E. coli strain JM109 harboring the expression plasmid was grown to an optical density of 0.4–0.6 in media supplemented with 2 mm biotin, and expression of the fusion protein was induced with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested, lysed in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and the resulting cell lysate passed over a SoftLink avidin resin as described by the manufacturers (Promega). Biotin-tagged recombinant protein was eluted with buffer containing a gradient of 5 to 20 mm Biotin and exchanged into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl by dialysis. Samples were tested by Western blotting using streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase, and fractions containing the majority of the biotin-tagged calreticulin were pooled. The final concentration of biotin-tagged calreticulin was determined using the DC Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempsted, UK). Expression and Purification of His-tagged Proteins—A version of calreticulin lacking its ER signal sequence, and with an N-terminal 10× His tag, was generated in the vector pET16b and incorporated a factor Xa cleavage site between the poly-His tag and the calreticulin polypeptide. The recombinant protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli origami (DE3) strain (Novagen, Nottingham, UK) and purified under native conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Paisely, UK). Mature, wild type ERp57 was cloned into a modified version of pET23b, which encodes for the sequence MHHHHHHM, prior to the first amino acid of the mature sequence (21Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 367-374Google Scholar), and selected point mutants generated in this construct were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS grown either in LB media or in M9 minimal media at 37 °C, 200 rpm and induced at an A600 of 0.3 for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cell lysis and protein purification were carried out as per the purification of ERp18 (22Alanen H.I. Williamson R.A. Howard M.J. Lappi A.K. Jantti H.P. Rautio S.M. Kellokumpu S. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28912-28920Google Scholar). The concentration of each protein was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated absorption coefficient of 45,200 m-1 cm-1 (molecular weight of 55,276) for the wild type protein. ERp57 Pull-down Assay—UltraLink NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) were preincubated with 20% bovine serum albumin to block any non-specific binding sites and washed 5 times in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). In some cases, biotin-tagged calreticulin (5 μg), or an equimolar amount of biotin-tagged insulin (∼0.6 μg), was then immobilized on these beads by mixing overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.25% TX-100 in TBS. Control reactions also included a 10-fold molar excess of “native” or “scrambled” RNase A (∼1.4 μg), during the overnight incubation. The beads were recovered by centrifugation for 2 min at 3,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and washed three times in 0.25% TX-100 in TBS. 10 μl of a specific in vitro translation reaction, carried out in the absence of canine pancreatic microsomes and pre-spun at 1000 × g for 2 min, was then mixed with 20 μl of NeutrAvidin beads alone, 20 μl of NeutrAvidin beads loaded with biotin-tagged insulin, or 20 μl of NeutrAvidin beads loaded with biotin-tagged calreticulin. Competition experiments were performed together with a 10-fold molar excess of His-tagged calreticulin (25 μg) or recombinant PDI (∼30 μg). 50 μl of TBS with 0.25% (v/v) TX-100 was added to each sample, they were mixed at room temperature for 2 h, and the beads were then recovered by centrifugation, washed four times in TBS with 0.25% (v/v) TX-100, and then once with TBS. SDS-PAGE Analysis—Samples were denatured and solubilized in SDS sample buffer by heating to 70 °C for 10 min before being resolved on SDS-PAGE gels of 8% (cross-linking products) or 15% (pull-down assays) acrylamide. Gels were fixed, exposed to a phosphorimaging plate, and visualized on a Fuji BAS-1800 bioimaging system. Quantification was carried out using AIDA software supplied by Raytek Scientific Ltd. (Sheffield, UK). Where shown, statistical significance was determined by using a two-tailed Student's t test (Microsoft Excel). Biophysical Analysis—Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J600 spectrophotometer. All spectra were collected at 25 °C as an average of 8 scans, using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm, scan speed of 20 nm/min, a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a time constant of 1 s. The maximal high tension voltage was 750 V. All spectra were corrected for the blank spectra with no protein added. Although ERp57 and PDI share significant sequence identity and most likely have similar tertiary structures (13Freedman R.B. Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 136-140Google Scholar), we have previously shown that ERp57 forms stable complexes with calnexin and calreticulin, whereas PDI does not (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). In this study we have exploited a series of chimeras of PDI and ERp57 (19Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11287-11293Google Scholar), together with other ERp57 derivatives and point mutants, to define the domains of ERp57 that are required for its specific association with the ER lectins calreticulin and calnexin. Only a Subset of ERp57 Derivatives Bind to Calreticulin in an in Vitro Pull-down Assay—Our previous studies of ERp57 binding to ER lectins relied on a cross-linking assay (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar) that may be influenced by differences in the number and location of the cysteine residues present in the various chimeras (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, such assays are unable to formally distinguish binding from close proximity. We therefore established a quantitative “pull-down” assay that reflected authentic binding between two components to investigate the association between ERp57 and the ER lectin calreticulin. Recombinant calreticulin, containing an N-terminal biotinylated tag, was immobilized on tetrameric NeutrAvidin-coated beads and used as a ligand for 35S-labeled ERp57 and its derivatives that were generated by in vitro translation. When wild type ERp57 was incubated with immobilized calreticulin, a little over one-third of the radiolabeled protein was specifically recovered with the beads (Fig. 2A, cf. lanes 1 and 4, Fig. 2D). In contrast, only background levels of binding (∼3–5%) were found when beads alone or beads loaded with biotinylated insulin were used (Fig. 2A, cf. lanes 1–3, see also Fig. 2D). Preincubation of the calreticulin bait with a 10-fold molar excess of scrambled or native RNase A caused either a minor reduction in binding (to ∼30%; cf. 37%) or had no significant effect (∼38%; cf. 37%), respectively (Fig. 2A, cf. lanes 4–6, Fig. 2D). Thus, ERp57 binding to immobilized calreticulin bears the hallmark of complex formation rather than the binding of a potentially misfolded protein (ERp57) to a candidate molecular chaperone (calreticulin). As expected, a 10-fold molar excess of soluble recombinant His-tagged calreticulin efficiently competed with the immobilized biotinylated calreticulin for ERp57 binding, whereas a similar molar excess of recombinant Histagged PDI did not (Fig. 2A, lane 7, ∼5%; lane 8, ∼30%). Our previous cross-linking analysis indicated that the presence of an uncleaved signal sequence at the N terminus of ERp57 did not affect its ability to bind to calreticulin (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). We confirmed that this was the case by analyzing an ERp57 derivative lacking its N-terminal signal sequence (ERp57Δss) in the pull-down assay and finding that ERp57-calreticulin complex formation was essentially unaffected (Fig. 2, cf. A, B, and D). The specificity of the interaction between radiolabeled ERp57 and immobilized, biotinylated calreticulin was further underscored by the observation that only ∼2% of radiolabeled PDI was recovered in this pull-down assay under any of the various conditions tested (Fig. 2, C and D). Having established a robust pull-down assay, various ERp57 chimeras were investigated. Radiolabeled versions of ERp57ΔC and five chimeras (see Fig. 1, constructs 2–6) were synthesized in vitro and analyzed using the pull-down assay outlined above. As before, a substantial fraction of ERp57 (37%) was bound to beads loaded with biotin-tagged calreticulin but not to control beads (cf. Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4, Fig. 3H). When the ERp57ΔC polypeptide and the various ERp57/PDI chimeras were tested using the pull-down assay, it was immediately apparent that only a subset of these proteins displayed significant binding to the immobilized calreticulin (Figs. 3, B–H). Hence, although ERp57ΔC and chimeras 3 and 4 showed levels of specific binding substantially above the levels observed in matched controls (Fig. 3, B, D, E, and H), no such binding was detected with constructs 2, 5, or 6 (Fig. 3, C, F, G, and H). Quantification of the pull-down data (see Fig. 3H) showed that, although wild type ERp57, ERp57ΔC, and chimeras 3 and 4 all showed significant levels of binding to calreticulin, there was a clear and statistically significant difference in the efficiency of binding between the various constructs. Thus, only chimera 4 showed binding equivalent to wild type ERp57 (∼40 and ∼37% respectively, see Fig. 3H), whereas the binding of both ERp57ΔC and chimera 3 were both significantly reduced (∼19 and ∼23% respectively, see Fig. 3H). Thus, the b and b′ domains of ERp57 are the minimal elements necessary for calreticulin binding that are defined by this analysis (cf. Fig. 1). Furthermore, although the presence of the C-terminal region is not absolutely required for complex formation, it is required for levels of binding akin to that seen with the wild type protein. Generation of ERp57 b′ Domain Point Mutants and Their Analysis by Cross-linking—The b′ domain of PDI has been shown to play a major role in the binding of peptide substrates (16Klappa P. Ruddock L.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Google Scholar), and the b′ domains of ERp57 and PDI show substantial sequence divergence from one another (24% sequence identity, see Fig. 4; cf. 49% for the a domains, see Ref. 23Lappi A.K. Lensink M.F. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Lobell M. Juffer A.H. Ruddock L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 283-295Google Scholar). Our analysis of the ERp57/PDI chimeras indicated that the principal calreticulin binding site was located somewhere in its b and b′ domains, and we hypothesized that the b′ domain of ERp57 might make a major contribution to the calreticulin binding site analogous to the role of the PDI b′ domain in substrate binding. To investigate this possibility further, a number of targeted point mutations based on residues important for substrate binding to PDI (18Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Google Scholar) were introduced into the b′ domain of ERp57. The mutations were selected based on the alignment of the b′ domains from ERp57 and PDI (see Fig. 4) and the recently reported identification of the primary substrate binding site within the b′ domain of human PDI (18Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Google Scholar). In particular, several mutations were made in the four residues (Val267, Tyr269, Val283, and Phe299) analogous to those found to define the binding site in PDI, whereas single mutations to alanine were made in residues analogous to those juxtaposed to this site (Glu270, Lys274, Arg280, and Asn281). The ability of the various ERp57 b′ domain mutants to associate with calreticulin was initially screened using a previously established cross-linking assay (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). In all cases the ERp57 point mutants were efficiently synthesized and imported into microsomes (Fig. 5, A–D, data not shown). For most of the point mutants, some BMH-dependent cross-linking products were visible, although the intensity of these adducts was variable (e.g. Fig. 5, A–D, data not shown, see also Table I). Immunoprecipitation confirmed that most, although not all, of the point mutants formed distinct adducts with calreticulin (Fig. 5, A–D, lane 4; and data not shown). Where visible, multiple ERp57/calreticulin adducts were observed as previously described for the wild type protein (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). These multiple products most likely reflect cross-linking between different cysteine residues present within ERp57 and calreticulin (7Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). To compare the efficiency of cross-linking for the different b′ point mutants, the relative proportion of ERp57 cross-linked to calreticulin was determined for each of the mutants and expressed as a percentage of the value obtained with the wild type protein (see Table I). This quantitative analysis suggested that there was a significant variation in the efficiency of cross-linking of the ERp57 point mutants to calreticulin, with the F299W mutant generating no clearly discernable adducts (see Fig. 5D, lane 4, and Table I). We conclude that specific residues in the b′ domain of ERp57 (Arg280, Val283, and Phe299) are important for its ability to be cross-linked to calreticulin efficiently.Table IPercentage of ERp57 b′ domain point mutants found cross-linked to endogenous calreticulinERp57 b′ domain mutantWTaThe fraction of the membrane-associated ERp57 derivative that was cross-linked to the endogenous calreticulin present in canine pancreatic microsomes was established by quantitative phosphorimaging (see also Fig. 5).

By contrast, the evolutionarily related oxalate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.4) converts oxalate and dioxygen to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Divergent free radical catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for these enzymes that involve the requirement of an active site proton donor in the decarboxylase but not the oxidase reaction. The oxidase possesses only one domain and manganese binding site per subunit, while the decarboxylase has two domains and two manganese sites per subunit. A structure of the decarboxylase together with a limited mutagenesis study has recently been interpreted as evidence that the C-terminal domain manganese binding site (site 2) is the catalytic site and that Glu-333 is the crucial proton donor (Anand, R., Dorrestein, P. C., Kinsland, C., Begley, T. P., and Ealick, S. E. (2002) <i>Biochemistry</i> 41, 7659–7669). The N-terminal binding site (site 1) of this structure is solvent-exposed (open) and lacks a suitable proton donor for the decarboxylase reaction. We report a new structure of the decarboxylase that shows a loop containing a 3<sub>10</sub> helix near site 1 in an alternative conformation. This loop adopts a ""closed"" conformation forming a lid covering the entrance to site 1. This conformational change brings Glu-162 close to the manganese ion, making it a new candidate for the crucial proton donor. Site-directed mutagenesis of equivalent residues in each domain provides evidence that Glu-162 performs this vital role and that the N-terminal domain is either the sole or the dominant catalytically active domain."

Human SULT1A3 has been shown to be the major sulfotransferase that sulfonates dopamine. These two enzymes shares 93% amino acid sequence identity and have distinct but overlapping substrate preferences. The resolution of the crystal structures of these two enzymes has enabled us to elucidate the mechanisms controlling their substrate preferences and inhibition. The presence of two p-nitrophenol (pNP) molecules in the crystal structure of SULT1A1 was postulated to explain cooperativity at low and inhibition at high substrate concentrations, respectively. In SULT1A1, substrate inhibition occurs with pNP as the substrate but not with dopamine. For SULT1A3, substrate inhibition is found for dopamine but not with pNP. We investigated how substrate inhibition occurs in these two enzymes using molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analysis. The results show that residue Phe-247 of SULT1A1, which interacts with both p-nitrophenol molecules in the active site, is important for substrate inhibition. Mutation of phenylalanine to leucine at this position in SULT1A1 results in substrate inhibition by dopamine.

These substrates may undergo sulfonation directly as in phase II metabolism (e.g. minoxidil, paracetamol) or following phase I metabolism after introduction of a functional hydroxyl group (e.g. N-hydroxyl arylamines). The sulfonate donor for these reactions is 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS; Refs. 1Falany C.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1-2Google Scholar, 2Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C.

Sulfonation is generally considered to be a detoxification pathway for a broad range of compounds, because conjugation with a sulfonate (SO3-1) renders substrates more hydrophilic and facilitates their excretion. However, evidence has emerged in recent years that this reaction can lead to formation of highly reactive intermediates (e.g. with N-hydroxy heterocyclic and aromatic arylamines) that can bind to DNA resulting in mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (4Chou H.C.

Therefore, various studies have investigated its role in human cancer and in particular polymorphisms in SULT1A1 have been implicated in the predisposition to lung cancer (7Wang Y. Spitz M.R.

Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 199-211Google Scholar). SULT1, SULT2, SULT3, SULT4, and SULT5 gene families have been identified in mammals. Of these, only SULT1, SULT2, and SULT4 have been identified in humans. These include seven members of the SULT1 family (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1C1, SULT1C2, and SULT1E1), two members of the SULT2 family (SULT2A1 and SULT2B), and one member of the SULT4 family (SULT4A1). Although each SULT has distinct substrate preferences, the range of molecules accepted can be broad and may be overlapping. In general, the SULT1 family catalyzes sulfonation of small phenols, monoamine neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine), thyroid hormones, and estrogens, and the SULT2 family sulfonates steroid hormones. To date, neither an endogenous nor an exogenous substrate has been found for SULT4 A1.Although there has been an increase in structure function studies as a result of an expansion of SULT x-ray crystal structures published, substrate binding and inhibition mechanisms are still far from clear.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Google Scholar); in addition, site-directed mutagenesis of critical amino acids in these enzymes has provided information on catalytic mechanism of these enzymes. Recently, this laboratory also reported the structure of human SULT1A1, crystallized in the presence of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) with two p-nitrophenol (pNP) molecules bound in the active site (21Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Google Scholar). This structure is similar to the other SULT enzymes as it incorporates a core PAP binding site. However, it was the first structure to show two molecules of the substrate bound in the active site.Substrate inhibition is characteristic of many SULT enzymes and has been reported previously with human SULTA1 and SULT1A3 with pNP and dopamine, respectively (22Ganguly T.C. Krasnykh V. Falany C.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 945-950Google Scholar, 23Reiter C. Mwaluko G. Dunnette J. Van Loon J. Weinshilboum R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

The presence of two substrate molecules in the SULT1A1 structure was postulated to explain the slight cooperativity observed at low concentrations of substrate and the inhibition observed at higher concentrations of pNP. In previous work (21Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Google Scholar), we proposed that inhibition is caused by impeded catalysis when both binding sites are occupied. In SULT1A1, substrate inhibition is evident when the pNP is used as the acceptor molecule but not when dopamine is the substrate. To investigate this further, we modeled dopamine into the substrate-binding pocket of SULT1A1 to show that two dopamine molecules could fit. Dopamine is the preferred substrate of SULT1A3 and our initial resolution of SULT1A3 structure showed large stretches of disorder that account for about 25% of its structure, which may in part be caused by lack of substrate binding (15Bidwell L.M. McManus M.E. Gaedigk A. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L. Martin J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 521-530Google Scholar). Therefore, we have also modeled the substrate-binding pocket of SULT1A3 to investigate dopamine binding and to determine how substrate inhibition takes place in this enzyme. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on residues interacting with the substrate molecule at the active site of SULT1A1 indicated that the flexible residue Phe-247 is important for substrate inhibition by dopamine.MATERIALS AND METHODSSULT1A1 and SULT1A3 were previously subcloned into the pET 28a(+) vector (Novagen, Victoria, Australia). The substrates dopamine, pNP, and PAPS were purchased from Sigma. [35S]PAPS was purchased from Amrad Pharmacia Biotechnology (Victoria, Australia). The primers for sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from PROLIGO (New South Wales, Australia). The PCR kit Pfu-Turbo was obtained from Stratagene. The restriction enzyme DpnI was purchased from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were of molecular biology or analytical grade.Site-Directed Mutagenesis—Double-stranded primers encoding a single amino acid mutation in the SULT1A1 gene were used to obtain SULT1A1 mutants. Twenty cycles of PCR were carried out with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 12 min. The reaction contained 50 ng of DNA template, primers, 200 μm concentrations of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 1× PfuTurbo buffer, and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The PCR product was treated with DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C followed by transformation of BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. The transformed bacteria were used to amplify the plasmid for sequencing as well as for protein expression of the SULT1A1 mutants. The mutated cDNA sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing carried out by the Australian Genome Research Facility (Brisbane, Australia) with the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reactions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the T7-promoter and terminator universal primers.Expression, Purification, and Enzyme Activity—Expression of the recombinant proteins was performed as described previously (15Bidwell L.M. McManus M.E. Gaedigk A. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L. Martin J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 521-530Google Scholar, 25Gaedigk A. Beatty B.G. Grant D.M. Genomics. 1997; 40: 242-246Google Scholar, 26Brix L.A. Duggleby R.G. Gaedigk A. McManus M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 337-343Google Scholar). The protein was purified utilizing the hexahistadine tag on the N terminus of the SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 cDNAs by TALON cobalt affinity (Clontech Laboratories) chromatography. Protein purity was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and only fractions with the highest purity were used for enzyme assay. The purified protein was mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) and stored at -70 °C before use. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Sigma).Enzyme activity assays were performed using the method described by Foldes and Meek (27Foldes A. Meek J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 327: 365-374Google Scholar) as modified by Brix et al. (26Brix L.A. Duggleby R.G. Gaedigk A. McManus M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 337-343Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 20 μm [35S]PAPS, 0.1 μg/ml SULT1A1, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and varying concentrations of the substrates in a final volume of 500 μl. Reactions were started by adding the enzyme to the reaction mixture and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.1 m barium hydroxide, 0.1 m barium acetate, and 0.1 m zinc sulfate, precipitating the enzyme and unreacted [35S]PAPS. Assays were performed in duplicate and the radioactivity of the sulfonated product was determined using a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2500; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). The incubation time and protein concentration used were chosen to be within the linear range for product formation.Kinetic Data Analysis—Kinetic experiments were analyzed by nonlinear regression, fitting the appropriate equation to the data. This regression analysis was performed using the Grafit program, version 5 (Erithacus Software Limited, Surrey, UK).Molecular Modeling—Modeling of substrates into the human SULT1A1/SULT1A3 substrate-binding pocket was performed using the docking program GOLD (Cambridge University) with 10 genetic algorithm runs and default parameters (28Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Google Scholar). The structure of SULT1A3 was modeled using the crystal structure of human SULT1A1 (Protein Data Bank code 1LS6) and minimized in Crystallography and NMR System software (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The quality of the model was assessed with Procheck (30Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-391Google Scholar).RESULTSMolecular Modeling—Previously we proposed a kinetic model for SULT1A1 that explains slight cooperativity at very low substrate concentrations and inhibition at high substrate concentrations of pNP (21Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Google Scholar). When pNP is utilized as the acceptor molecule for SULT1A1, substrate inhibition is observed above 2 μm (Fig. 1a). However, when dopamine is used as the acceptor molecule, no obvious substrate inhibition is seen (Fig. 1b). The reverse is found for SULT1A3 (Fig. 1, c and d), where the preferred substrate dopamine exhibits substrate inhibition above 9 μm, whereas pNP follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The analysis of the crystal structure of SULT1A1 shows that two pNP molecules can be accommodated in the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 2a). To investigate why there is no substrate inhibition of SULT1A1 by dopamine, we modeled this substrate into the active site of SULT1A1 (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2a, pNP interactions with the SULT1A1 binding pocket as shown by the crystal structure of SULT1A1. pNP1 shows van der Waals interactions (shown by dotted lines) with Val-148 and Phe-247 and pNP2 shows interactions with Phe-247 and Ile-89.

The catalytically active dopamine molecule 1 (DP1) is shown in orange and dopamine 2 (DP2) in green. PAPS is shown as a stick model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our model of SULT1A1 with dopamine showed that the substrate-binding pocket could accommodate two molecules of dopamine, although some “clashes” were observed with a residue that seemed to have some flexibility (Phe-247) when positioning the second dopamine molecule. With a small shift in orientation, either the 3-OH or 4-OH of dopamine could be oriented for sulfonation. Because 3-O sulfonated dopamine is reported to be high in humans (16Dajani R. Cleasby A. Neu M. Wonacott A.J. Jhoti H. Hood A.M. Modi S. Hersey A. Taskinen J. Cooke J.M. Manchee G.R. Coughtrie M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37862-37868Google Scholar), the dopamine was orientated for sulfonation at the 3-O position. In this orientation, it seems to form close contacts with the flexible Phe-247 and Val-148. By rotating Phe-247 to an alternate conformation (Fig. 2b), the two dopamine molecules could fit within the substrate-binding pocket. To determine whether the smaller leucine residue, found at this position in human SULT1A3, facilitates the binding of second dopamine molecule, we modeled the substrate-binding pocket of SULT1A3 using the SULT1A1 structure and investigated the positioning of two dopamine molecules in the substrate-binding pocket.A computer model of SULT1A3 was constructed using the coordinates of SULT1A1 obtained from the Protein Data Bank (code 1LS6). Both enzymes have 295 residues, and 21 residues differ between these two enzymes. In the SULT1A1 structure, these residues were mutated to the corresponding SULT1A3 residues, the model was energy minimized in Crystallography and NMR System software, and the validity of the model was assessed. The backbone residues in the SULT1A3 model can be superimposed on the SULT1A1 crystal structure (295 Cα atoms with root-mean-square deviation 1.6 Å). PAPS was modeled into SULT1A3 based on the SULT1E1-PAPS structure (Protein Data Bank code 1HY3; Ref. 20Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Google Scholar) and dopamine was docked using the GOLD program with default parameters. The model of SULT1A3 (Fig. 2c) with dopamine showed that two molecules of substrate are easily accommodated in the substrate-binding pocket; positioning of the second dopamine molecule was easier with a leucine residue at position 247.Kinetic Analysis—Previously, we analyzed the substrate saturation and substrate inhibition kinetics of SULT1A1 toward pNP using an equation (Equation 1) derived from the observation that the enzyme structure contains two bound substrate molecules (21Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Google Scholar). v=V∞[S](K1+[S])/(K2K3+[S]K3+[S]2)(Eq. 1) The difficulty with this equation is that it contains three kinetic constants (K1, K2, and K3) that have no obvious physical meaning. Only V∞, the rate as [S] → ∞, relates directly to an observable quantity. We realized that this equation may be rewritten in terms of more normal constants, v=(Vm[S]+V∞[S]2/Ki)/(Km+[S]+[S]2/Ki)(Eq. 2) where Vm and Km are the conventional maximum velocity and Michaelis constant, respectively, that would be observed if there were no substrate inhibition, whereas Ki is the substrate concentration that would give a rate midway between Vm and V∞, if Km was very small. Although this equation fits the data very well, the nonlinear regression analysis showed that there are extremely high parameter correlations between the pairs Vm and Km, Vm and Ki, and Km and Ki. This means that estimates of each of the parameters are unreliable because the values are highly dependent upon one another.Further investigation showed that an empirical simplification could eliminate one parameter and these undesirable correlations, while maintaining a good fit. The revised equation is as follows. v=(ks[S]+V∞[S]2/Ks2)/(1+[S]2/Ks2)(Eq. 3) The parameter ks is the specificity constant, which corresponds to the ratio Vm/Km for an enzyme that exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Graphically, it is the slope of the tangent to the activity versus [substrate] curve at the origin. The specificity constant can be used to directly compare the efficiencies of different enzymes (or mutants) for any given substrate, or different substrates with any given enzyme. V∞ has the same definition as in Equations 1 and 2. The third parameter, Ks, is a “substrate constant” with no exact physical meaning but that acts as a scaling factor for the substrate concentration axis. It can be used as an intermediate vehicle to calculate the more meaningful parameters Sp (the concentration of substrate that results in the peak rate) or Vp (the rate at [S] = Sp) using the relationships below. Sp=(Ks2+2V∞/ks)1/2(Eq. 4) Vp=ksSp/2(Eq. 5) Although it would be desirable to use Equation 2 for the data analysis, we believe that it is preferable to use an Equation that yields reliable parameter values even though it has an empirical element. Kinetic data that exhibit substrate inhibition were fitted using the combined Equations 3, 4, and 5 to obtain best fit values and standard errors for ks, Vp, and V∞. Where data showed no substrate inhibition, a reparameterized version of the Michaelis-Menten Equation 6 was used for the analysis to obtain best fit values and standard errors for ks and Vm. v=ks[S]/(1+ks[S]/Vm)(Eq. 6) To determine whether substrate inhibition involves the three residues that interact with both pNP molecules (Ile-89, Phe-247, and Val-148; Fig. 2a), in particular residue 247 as suggested by the computer modeling, we employed site-directed mutagenesis. Residues 247 and 148 were exchanged to their counterpart residues in human SULT1A3 (F247L, V148A), whereas residue 89 was converted to the smaller ala-nine residue. His-108 was not mutated because it is reported to function as a catalytic residue for sulfonation (31Zhang H. Varmalova O. Falany F.M. Lehy T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10888-10892Google Scholar, 32Yoshinari K. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2001; 15: 67-75Google Scholar) and is found in all human sulfotransferases.SULT1A1-F247L—When modeled into the SULT1A1 structure, the leucine in the mutant of phenylalanine at 247 to leucine (F247L) does not form van der Waals interactions with the nitro groups of pNP1 and pNP2, but there is no change to the overall protein structure. Unlike wild-type human SULT1A1 with dopamine, this mutant showed substrate inhibition when dopamine was used as the acceptor molecule (Fig. 3a) and retained substrate inhibition with pNP (Fig. 3b). When this mutant was analyzed kinetically, it showed an increased affinity for pNP (Table I) and exhibited substrate inhibition at a slightly lower pNP concentration.Fig. 3Kinetics of the SULT1A1-F247L mutant toward p-nitrophenol and dopamine.

With dopamine as substrate, the peak rate is similar to Vm when compared with the wild-type enzyme, with substrate inhibition exhibiting a limiting rate of 78.9 nmol/min/mg (Table I).SULT1A1-V148A and SULT1A1-I89A—In the SULT1A1 crystal structure, the mutation of valine at 148 to alanine (V148A) removes van der Waals interaction to the nitro group of pNP1. The mutation of isoleucine at 89 to alanine (I89A) disrupts the binding of pNP2 to the enzyme. These mutants did not show any significant effect on substrate inhibition pattern with dopamine or pNP (Table I).DISCUSSIONSubstrate inhibition is a characteristic feature of many sulfotransferases, observed usually at high concentrations of their preferred substrates. However, in general, the Michaelis-Menten model has been used to explain catalysis by SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 at moderate substrate concentrations (26Brix L.A. Duggleby R.G. Gaedigk A. McManus M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 337-343Google Scholar, 33Lewis A.J. Kelly M.M. Walle U.K. Eaton E.A. Falany C.N. Walle T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1996; 24: 1180-1185Google Scholar). In previous work, we proposed a model that links the observed substrate inhibition to the finding that there are two substrate molecules bound near to the active site in the crystal structure of SULT1A1 (21Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Google Scholar). One substrate molecule (pNP1) is in the correct position for sulfonation, whereas the other (pNP2) blocks the channel that leads to the active site. In this model, inhibition results because the rate constant for catalysis is higher when pNP2 is absent than when it is present. Thus, there is impeded catalysis when both binding sites are occupied, which we imagine is caused by molecular crowding that perturbs the positioning of pNP1. In addition, when the pNP2 alone is bound, access to the active site is prevented. The combination of these two effects results in the observed substrate inhibition.In our present study, the differing patterns of substrate inhibition relating to the substrates (pNP and dopamine) of SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 suggested to us that the substrate-binding pocket of SULT1A1 may not accommodate two molecules of dopamine or that binding of the second substrate molecule may have been impeded in some way. To investigate this, we modeled dopamine into the substrate-binding pocket of the human SULT1A1 structure. We found that the substrate-binding pocket of SULT1A1 could accommodate two molecules of dopamine, although one enzyme residue (Phe-247) made unfavorable interactions with the second molecule. This led us to hypothesize that this residue may be important in substrate inhibition. Site-directed mutagenesis of Phe-247 to the smaller leucine residue found in SULT1A3 gave rise to substrate inhibition in SULT1A1, suggesting that dopamine can be accommodated in the second binding site without making unfavorable interactions with the enzyme. Therefore, this residue seems to be involved in the phenomenon of substrate inhibition, because mutations in other residues that interact with pNP (Ile-89 and Val-148) exhibited kinetic profiles that are similar to the wild-type SULT1A1.The size and nature of the substrate binding pocket of SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 suggest that much larger molecules than pNP can be accommodated. Endogenous substrates such as iodothyronines and 17β-estradiol (E2) have shown to be catalyzed by SULT1A1 with a clear substrate inhibition (34Kester M.H.A. Kaptein E. Roest T.J. van Dijk C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 159-166Google Scholar). SULT1A3 also sulfonates the above substrates with a low affinity (34Kester M.H.A. Kaptein E. Roest T.J. van Dijk C."
https://openalex.org/W1967830166,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is involved in mammalian mismatch repair at a step prior to or at mismatch excision, but the molecular mechanism of this process is not fully understood. To examine the role of PCNA in mismatch-provoked and nick-directed excision, orientation-specific mismatch removal of heteroduplexes with a pre-existing nick was monitored in human nuclear extracts supplemented with the PCNA inhibitor protein p21. We show here that, whereas 3' nick-directed mismatch excision was completely inhibited by low concentrations of p21 or a p21 C-terminal fusion protein, 5' nick-directed excision was only partially blocked under the same conditions. No further reduction of the 5' excision was detected when a much higher concentration of p21 C-terminal protein was used. These results suggest the following. (i) There is a differential requirement for PCNA in 3' and 5' nick-directed excision; and (ii) 5' nick-directed excision is conducted by a manner either dependent on or independent of PCNA. Our in vitro reconstitution experiments indeed identified a 5' nick-directed excision pathway that is dependent on PCNA, hMutSalpha, and a partially purified fraction from a HeLa nuclear extract."
https://openalex.org/W2067462159,"Semi-conservative DNA synthesis reactions catalyzed by the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme are initiated by a strand displacement mechanism requiring gp32, the T4 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, to sequester the displaced strand. After initiation, DNA helicase acquisition by the nascent replication fork leads to a dramatic increase in the rate and processivity of leading strand DNA synthesis. In vitro studies have established that either of two T4-encoded DNA helicases, gp41 or dda, is capable of stimulating strand displacement synthesis. The acquisition of either helicase by the nascent replication fork is modulated by other protein components of the fork including gp32 and, in the case of the gp41 helicase, its mediator/loading protein gp59. Here, we examine the relationships between gp32 and the gp41/gp59 and dda helicase systems, respectively, during T4 replication using altered forms of gp32 defective in either protein-protein or protein-ssDNA interactions. We show that optimal stimulation of DNA synthesis by gp41/gp59 helicase requires gp32-gp59 interactions and is strongly dependent on the stability of ssDNA binding by gp32. Fluorescence assays demonstrate that gp59 binds stoichiometrically to forked DNA molecules; however, gp59-forked DNA complexes are destabilized via protein-protein interactions with the C-terminal “A-domain” fragment of gp32. These and previously published results suggest a model in which a mobile gp59-gp32 cluster bound to lagging strand ssDNA is the target for gp41 helicase assembly. In contrast, stimulation of DNA synthesis by dda helicase requires direct gp32-dda protein-protein interactions and is relatively unaffected by mutations in gp32 that destabilize its ssDNA binding activity. The latter data support a model in which protein-protein interactions with gp32 maintain dda in a proper active state for translocation at the replication fork. The relationship between dda and gp32 proteins in T4 replication appears similar to the relationship observed between the UL9 helicase and ICP8 ssDNA-binding protein in herpesvirus replication.

The relationship between dda and gp32 proteins in T4 replication appears similar to the relationship observed between the UL9 helicase and ICP8 ssDNA-binding protein in herpesvirus replication. DNA helicase acquisition by a nascent DNA replication fork is essential for reconstituting rapid, processive DNA synthesis. This principle is illustrated dramatically by the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication system (1Alberts B.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1987; 317: 395-420Google Scholar, 2Nossal N.G. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar). T4 encodes two DNA helicases known to affect the movement and properties of DNA replication forks; the gene 41 protein (gp41) and the dda protein, respectively. gp41 is the essential replicative helicase of the T4 phage. This hexameric enzyme translocates processively in a 5′ → 3′ direction on the displaced lagging strand of the dsDNA 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RFI, supercoiled plasmid form of M13-derived dsDNA; RFII, nicked circular form of M13-derived dsDNA; gp32-A, truncated form of gp32 containing amino acids 1-253; gp32-B, truncated form of gp32 containing amino acids 22-301; A domain, truncated form of gp32 containing amino acids 213-301; wt, wild type; fDNA, fork DNA; 2AP, 2-aminopurine; HLC, helicase loading complex. template, thus enhancing the rate and processivity of leading strand DNA synthesis catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme (gp43, gp44/62, and gp45 proteins) (1Alberts B.M.

In addition, gp41 is an obligatory component of the T4 primosome (helicase/primase complex) and is, thus, essential for lagging strand DNA synthesis (4Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7001-7010Google Scholar, 5Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10879-10885Google Scholar). A second T4-encoded DNA helicase, dda protein, stimulates leading strand DNA synthesis in vitro but is nonessential for phage DNA replication in vivo (6Jongeneel C.V. Bedinger P. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12933-12938Google Scholar, 7Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Google Scholar, 8Behme M.T. Ebisuzaki K. J. Virol. 1975; 15: 50-54Google Scholar). Like gp41, dda unwinds dsDNA in a 5′ → 3′ direction and is presumed to translocate on the lagging strand; however, unlike gp41 the unwinding reaction proceeds by a distributive rather than processive translocation mechanism (6Jongeneel C.V. Bedinger P. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12933-12938Google Scholar, 7Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Google Scholar). dda is proposed to play specialized but nonessential roles in T4 replication including helping DNA replication forks bypass template-bound proteins such as RNA polymerase (9Bedinger P. Hochstrasser M. Jongeneel C.V. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 115-123Google Scholar). In addition, a T4 dda deletion strain has a weak DNA delay phenotype, consistent with a role of dda protein in the initiation of DNA replication from T4 origins (10Gauss P. Park K. Spencer T.E. Hacker K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1667-1672Google Scholar). The effects of both gp41 and dda helicases on DNA replication have been studied using in vitro strand displacement DNA synthesis reactions in which replication is initiated from a nick in a dsDNA template. Strand displacement synthesis starting from a nick requires both DNA polymerase holoenzyme and gp32 (the T4 ssDNA-binding protein) and is stimulated by either T4 helicase (6Jongeneel C.V. Bedinger P. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12933-12938Google Scholar, 7Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Google Scholar, 11Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12220-12225Google Scholar). gp32 facilitates a relatively slow strand displacement reaction that generates the ssDNA tail required for DNA helicase acquisition by the nascent replication fork. Helicase acquisition is clearly modulated by gp32 and other protein components of the nascent fork. In the case of dda, which interacts strongly and specifically with gp32, the latter protein is an essential cofactor for dda stimulation of strand displacement synthesis (6Jongeneel C.V. Bedinger P. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12933-12938Google Scholar, 7Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Google Scholar). In the case of gp41, which does not interact with gp32 directly, the cooperative binding of gp32 to the displaced strand inhibits gp41 loading, causing a lag time in the onset of rapid DNA replication (12Barry J.E. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Google Scholar). This lag time is eliminated by gp59, a mediator protein that loads gp41 onto gp32-saturated ssDNA molecules (12Barry J.E. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Google Scholar, 13Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Google Scholar, 14Morrical S.W. Beernink H.T.H.

Liu J. Morrical S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8298-8305Google Scholar). gp59 also binds to specific DNA structures including forks and cruciforms and can recruit gp41 helicase to these structures (17Mueser T.C. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 597-612Google Scholar, 18Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27145-27154Google Scholar). It is clear that the loading of both gp41 and dda helicases, enzymes that must bind to and translocate on ssDNA at the T4 replication fork, involves complex functional and/or physical relationships with gp32, a protein that rapidly saturates and sequesters replication fork ssDNA through tight and cooperative binding. The properties of gp32 (34 kDa, 301 amino acids) have been studied extensively (19Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Google Scholar, 20Williams K.R. Shamoo Y. Spicer E.K. Coleman J.E. Konigsberg W.H. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 301-304Google Scholar). gp32 contains three modular domains, “A domain,” “B domain,” and “core.” The central core domain (amino acids 22-253) contains the ssDNA binding site consisting of an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold stabilized by a structural zinc atom (21Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Google Scholar). The acidic, C-terminal A domain (amino acids 254-301) is the site of protein-protein interactions with several T4 DNA replication and recombination proteins, including but not limited to gp59, dda, DNA polymerase (gp43), and primase (gp61) (14Morrical S.W.

The gp32-A fragment (amino acids 1-253) lacks the entire A domain and is deficient in protein-protein interactions with gp59, dda, gp43, etc. yet retains approximately wild-type levels of ssDNA binding affinity and cooperativity (14Morrical S.W.

We previously showed that the ability of different gp32 B domain mutants to support strand displacement DNA synthesis (in the absence of a helicase) correlates strongly with their hierarchy of relative ssDNA binding affinities, i.e. gp32 wild type ≈ R4K > K3A ≈ R4Q > R4T > R4G >> gp32-B (29Villemain J. Ma Y. Giedroc D.P. Morrical S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 31496-31504Google Scholar). The precise roles of gp32 protein-protein and protein-ssDNA interactions in helicase loading processes are poorly understood. To address these issues, we tested the abilities of gp41/gp59 and dda to stimulate strand displacement DNA synthesis reactions in the presence of the various truncated and missense forms of gp32. Our findings demonstrate the importance of gp32-gp59 and gp32-dda protein-protein interactions in acquisition of the gp41 and dda helicases, respectively, by the T4 replication fork. Surprisingly, the data indicate that gp32 mutations which weaken gp32-ssDNA binding affect gp41 and dda helicase acquisition differentially; loading of gp41 at the replication fork by gp59 is strongly inhibited as gp32 species affinity for ssDNA decreases, whereas acquisition of the dda helicase is relatively unaffected by the same gp32 mutations. In addition, the results of fluorescence assays indicate that the A domain of gp32 attenuates gp59-fork DNA interactions. Together, the data suggest different models for the active forms of gp41 versus dda present at T4 replication forks and for the nucleoprotein intermediates that form during helicase assembly at replication forks. Reagents and Enzymes—Radionuclides α-[32P]dTTP and α-[32P]dCTP were purchased either from ICN or PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All nonradioactive ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The bacteriophage fd gene 2 protein (gp2) was purified as described (30Dotto G.D. Enea V. Zinder N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5421-5424Google Scholar). All other chemicals, biochemicals, and commercial enzymes were purchased from Sigma unless specifically noted. T4 DNA Replication and Recombination Proteins—Purification and storage conditions for T4 proteins including gp43 (DNA polymerase), gp44/62 and gp45 (DNA polymerase processivity factors), gp32 (ssDNA-binding protein; 34 kDa, 301 amino acids), gp41 and dda (DNA helicases), and gp59 (mediator/loading protein for gp41 helicase) were as previously described (12Barry J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 447-455Google Scholar). gp32 protein fragments gp32-A (amino acids 1-253), gp32-B (amino acids 22-301), and A domain (amino acids 213-301) were purified from overexpressing strains as described (14Morrical S.W. Beernink H.T.H. Dash A. Hempstead K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20198-20207Google Scholar, 22Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Google Scholar). gp32 point mutant species R4K, R4Q, R4T, R4G, and K3A were also purified according to published procedures (27Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Google Scholar, 28Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27623-27629Google Scholar). The concentrations of gp32 wild type and B-domain mutant species were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 4.13 × 104m-1 cm-1 determined from the amino acid sequence (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). The concentrations of other T4 protein stock solutions were determined by a spectrophotometric Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin and wt gp32 standards. All purified protein stocks were tested for contaminating endo- or exonuclease activities by incubating protein (at reaction concentrations) with circular plus linear ssDNA, supercoiled plus nicked circular dsDNA, or linear dsDNA samples as appropriate, then examining the DNA on agarose gels. All protein stocks used in these studies were nuclease-free according to these criteria. Nucleic Acids—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon. Supercoiled RFI DNA from bacteriophage M13mp19 was isolated as described (36Miller H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 145-170Google Scholar). Nicked RFII DNA was generated by treating M13mp19 RFI DNA with the bacteriophage fd gene 2 protein as described (30Dotto G.D. Enea V. Zinder N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5421-5424Google Scholar). Circular single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13mp19 was isolated by extraction from purified phage particles (36Miller H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 145-170Google Scholar, 37Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Trieber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Google Scholar). All DNA concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm using conversion factors of 50 μg/ml/A260 for dsDNA and 36 μg/ml/A260 for ssDNA and are expressed in units of μmol of nucleotide residues per liter. Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis Reactions—Strand displacement DNA synthesis reaction mixtures contained the following components (final concentrations): 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 80 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm each ATP and GTP, 100 μm each dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 10 μCi [α-32P]dTTP or [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity = 3000 C/mmol), and 10 μm (nucleotides) M13mp19 RFII DNA plus T4 proteins gp43 (4 μg/ml), gp44/62 (24 μg/ml), and gp45 (8 μg/ml). Reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of gp41 (18 μg/ml when present), gp59 (5 μg/ml when present), dda (5 μg/ml when present), and the various gp32 species (each 1.45 μm when present). Exact helicase and gp32 compositions for each reaction are given in the figure legends. Constant salt conditions were maintained between reactions through the addition of appropriate amounts of gp32, gp59, gp41, and/or dda storage buffers. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C. All reaction components except DNA, dNTPs, and α-[32P]-dTTP or -dCTP were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C, then the reaction was initiated by the addition of the missing components. Reactions were allowed to proceed for up to 10 min at 37 °C depending on the experiment. DNA synthesis was monitored both quantitatively via trichloroacetic acid precipitation and qualitatively via alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis. Time courses of DNA synthesis reactions were obtained as follows. From an initial reaction volume of 45 μl, 10-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and spotted onto Whatman GF/A glass filters; these were soaked for 15 min in 250 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, 10% saturated sodium pyrophosphate solution at 4 °C, then washed successively with 4 × 250 ml of cold 1 m HCl and 2 × 250 ml of cold 95% ethanol, dried under a heat lamp, and transferred to a scintillation counter where the extent of incorporation of acid-insoluble label was quantitated. For fixed time point assays and electrophoretic analyses, reactions in 25 μl (final volume) were carried out for 10 min at 37 °C and then stopped by the addition of 28 mm EDTA (final concentration) and transferred to an ice-water bath. A portion of each sample was removed for quantitative analysis by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described above. The remainder was prepared for alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis by adding 10% sucrose, 30 mm NaOH, and 0.04% bromcresol green (final concentrations). Samples were then loaded onto a horizontal 0.8% alkaline agarose gel that was prepared and run as described (38Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were neutralized by soaking for 30 min in TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and then stained in TBE containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Stained gels were photographed on a UV light box to record marker positions and then dried under vacuum onto Whatman DE81 DEAE-cellulose paper. Dried gels were autoradiographed at -70 °C using Eastman Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. Fluorescence Assays for gp59-Fork DNA Interactions—Fluorescent 2-aminopurine labeled fork DNA (fDNA) molecules containing two non-complementary 18-base ssDNA arms and a complementary 12-base pair duplex arm were prepared by annealing two partially complementary 30-mer oligonucleotides as described (17Mueser T.C. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 597-612Google Scholar). Fork DNA molecules fDNA1 and fDNA2 contained oligonucleotides with the following sequences, where X = 2-aminopurine. fDNA1 and fDNA2 contain identical bottom strands as diagrammed, whereas their top strands differ only in the position of a single 2-aminopurine label. In fDNA1 the label is located in the sixth position of the 5′ ssDNA arm (top strand as diagrammed), whereas in fDNA2 the label is in the fourth position of the duplex arm defined relative to the top strand. fDNA1 and fDNA2 are identical to the 2 × 30-mer fDNA molecule described in Mueser et al. (17Mueser T.C. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 597-612Google Scholar) except at positions where 2-aminopurine was substituted for adenine.fDNA2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) gp59 interactions with fDNA1 and fDNA2 molecules were monitored via the enhancement of 2-aminopurine fluorescence that occurs upon complex formation. Fluorescence readings were made in a thermojacketed SLM 8000 fluorimeter, which was connected to a circulating water bath to maintain a constant temperature of 20 °C in the cuvette chamber. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 320 and 359 nm, respectively. Reaction buffer (1.5-ml starting volume) contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 90 mm potassium acetate. The concentration of fork DNA (fDNA1 or fDNA2) was 12 μm (nucleotide residues) in all experiments. Concentrations of gp59 and the A-domain fragment of gp32 varied as described in each experiment. Constant salt conditions were maintained between different experiments by adding appropriate balancing amounts of gp59 and/or gp32 storage buffers. Forward titrations of fork DNA with gp59 were performed by sequentially adding small aliquots of a concentrated gp59 stock solution in storage buffer to a magnetically stirred, pre-equilibrated solution containing reaction buffer plus either fDNA1 or fDNA2 while recording 2-aminopurine fluorescence. Back titrations of gp59-fDNA complexes with gp32 A domain were performed as follows. gp59 (2 μm) was preincubated with fDNA1 or fDNA2 (12 μm) in reaction buffer, then small aliquots of a concentrated A domain stock solution were added sequentially (with magnetic stirring) while recording 2-aminopurine fluorescence. All fluorescence data were corrected for the effects of dilution and for contributions of proteins plus storage buffers to the fluorescence signal. The latter was determined empirically for each experiment by titrating blank solutions lacking fDNA with equivalent volumes of protein plus storage buffer. Both photo-bleaching and inner filter effects were found to be negligible under the conditions of these experiments; therefore, no corrections were necessary for these factors. gp32 Truncations Differentially Affect Helicase Stimulation of Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis—We compared the effects of no gp32, full-length gp32, gp32-A, gp32-B, and gp32 A domain fragment on strand displacement DNA synthesis reactions catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme (gp43, gp44/62, and gp45 proteins) in the presence and absence of the gp41/gp59 and dda helicases (Fig. 1). Fig. 1A shows time courses of strand displacement synthesis in the absence of gp41, gp59, and dda. Here, significant amounts of DNA synthesis are observed only with full-length gp32 and with the gp32-A truncation mutant. The rate of DNA synthesis is ∼2-fold higher for full-length gp32 than for gp32-A (Fig. 1A), suggesting that gp32-polymerase interactions are required for optimal strand displacement DNA synthesis in the absence of a DNA helicase. This observation is consistent with previously published data (23Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Hosoda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11484-11493Google Scholar). Note that reactions with the gp32-B and A-domain fragments are indistinguishable from the reaction with no gp32; all are essentially at background (Fig. 1A). Clearly the low affinity, distributive binding of gp32-B to ssDNA is insufficient to support strand displacement synthesis under these conditions. Likewise, the failure of the A domain fragment to support the reaction demonstrates that gp32-polymerase interactions alone are insufficient for strand displacement synthesis. The time courses shown in Fig. 1B represent reactions performed in the presence of the dda helicase; conditions were otherwise identical to Fig. 1A. Under these conditions, the dda helicase affords a 2-3-fold stimulation of the rate of strand displacement synthesis in the presence of full-length gp32 relative to the equivalent reaction in the absence of dda (Fig. 1, A and B). dda does not stimulate strand displacement synthesis in reactions lacking gp32 (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with previous reports (6Jongeneel C.V. Bedinger P. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12933-12938Google Scholar, 7Jongeneel C.V. Formosa T. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12925-12932Google Scholar). dda also fails to stimulate reactions containing gp32-A (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that dda-gp32 protein-protein interactions are required for dda stimulation of strand displacement synthesis. This conclusion is supported by the observation that gp32-B supports moderate levels of strand displacement synthesis in the presence of dda protein (Fig. 1B), whereas gp32-B does not support the reaction in the absence of dda (see Fig. 1A). The activity of gp32-B is less than that of full-length gp32 but substantially higher than with gp32-A, which does not respond to dda (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that dda-gp32 protein-protein interactions play a central role in the stimulatory activity of the dda helicase toward the strand displacement DNA synthesis reaction and that the ssDNA binding affinity and cooperativity of the gp32 species are relatively unimportant in this process. Intriguingly, the addition of the A-domain fragment of gp32 to reactions containing dda causes a small but reproducible increase in strand displacement synthesis above background levels (Fig. 1B and data not shown), suggesting that dda-A domain interactions may be sufficient to drive a small number of helicase molecules into an active conformation (see “Discussion”). The reactions in Fig. 1C were performed in the presence of the gp41 helicase; otherwise, conditions were identical to Fig. 1A. In reactions containing either no gp32, gp32-A, or full-length gp32, the results obtained with gp41 as helicase were extremely similar to the corresponding data obtained with dda as helicase (Fig. 1, B and C) (the concentration of gp41 used was chosen empirically so as to approximately match the levels of DNA synthesis seen with dda). One dramatic difference is apparent. The gp32-B species fails to support strand displacement synthesis in the presence of gp41 (Fig. 1C), whereas this truncated form of gp32 is active in the dda-stimulated reaction (Fig. 1B). These results appear to support the notion that significant gp32-dependent strand displ"
https://openalex.org/W2080397041,"MuB, a protein essential for replicative DNA transposition by the bacteriophage Mu, is an ATPase that assembles into a polymeric complex on DNA. We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe the behavior of MuB polymers on single molecules of DNA. We demonstrate that polymer assembly is initiated by a stochastic nucleation event. After nucleation, polymer assembly occurs by a mechanism involving the sequential binding of small units of MuB. MuB that bound to A/T-rich regions of the DNA assembled into large polymeric complexes. In contrast, MuB that bound outside of the A/T-rich regions failed to assemble into large oligomeric complexes. Our data also show that MuB does not catalyze multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis while remaining bound to DNA. Rather, a single ATP is hydrolyzed, then MuB dissociates from the DNA. Finally, we show that “capping” of the enhanced green fluorescent protein-MuB polymer ends with unlabeled MuB dramatically slows, but does not halt, dissociation. This suggests that MuB dissociation occurs through both an end-dependent mechanism and a slower mechanism wherein subunits dissociate from the polymer interior.

DNA transposition is used by many organisms to regulate the dispersion of their genetic material throughout a host cell population (1Craig N.L. Annu. Rev.

The bacteriophage Mu transposition reaction is initiated by the binding of the transposase protein MuA to specific sites at the ends of the phage genome (3Craigie R. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1984; 39: 387-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). MuA then assembles into a series of nucleoprotein complexes, collectively referred to as transpososomes, that are responsible for catalyzing the DNA processing reactions required to complete transposition (4Craigie R.

A second protein, the ATPase MuB, is also required to complete the transposition reaction (8Chaconas G. Giddens E.B. Miller J.L. Gloor G. Cell. 1985; 41: 857-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Chaconas G. Gloor G. Miller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2662-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).MuB performs multiple functions during transposition, including stimulating assembly of the transpososomes, stimulating the MuA catalyzed DNA processing reactions, influencing the selection of the DNA target site, and regulating the disassembly of the transpososome (10Baker T.A.

Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1989; 57: 41-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MuB does not share extensive sequence similarity with any other known protein. However, like many other ATPases, MuB does contain two conserved amino acid motifs, Walker A and B boxes, that are essential for the binding and hydrolysis of nucleotide triphosphates (14Nakayama C. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10851-10857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5509-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, MuB assembles into large oligomeric complexes on DNA, making the bound DNA an efficient target for strand transfer (16Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6159-6167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MuB accumulates on DNA that is not bound by MuA, resulting in a strong preference for transposition to occur at DNA sites at least 10-20 kb from MuA-bound regions (12Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1988; 53: 257-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Manna D. Higgins P.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is called target immunity and provides a critical mechanism for Mu to prevent disruption of its genome through an aberrant transposition event.We have established a system that allows us to observe single complexes of MuB bound to an immobilized molecule of DNA (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that MuB forms a large oligomer on DNA and that these oligomers were tightly bound to A/T-rich sequences (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These same A/T-rich regions were preferentially used as transposition targets by the MuA transposase. Based on these observations, we proposed that MuB could exist in either a high- or low-affinity state and conversion to the high-affinity conformation was dictated by the base composition of the DNA to which the polymer was bound (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In this study, we further examine the assembly and disassembly of MuB target complexes bound to surface-tethered molecules of DNA. We demonstrate that polymer assembly is initiated by a nucleation event in which a small unit of MuB binds to A/T-rich DNA in a relatively stable state. This is followed by the sequential net addition of small subunits to the growing complex. When complexes are assembled in the ATP-bound state, the subunits within each complex are unable to exchange ATP for ATPγS without dissociating from DNA, providing further evidence for our previous hypothesis that ATP hydrolysis and DNA dissociation are directly and obligatorily coupled. Finally, the disassembly rates of individual enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate.-MuB polymers were dramatically decreased when the ends of the polymers were protected by the addition of unlabeled MuB. We propose that the MuB polymers can disassemble by at least two pathways: either by the dissociation of MuB from the ends of the individual polymers or by the relatively slow dissociation of MuB subunits from the interior of the polymeric complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTotal Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy—The total internal reflection fluorescence microscope was a custom-designed system built around a Nikon TE300 Eclipse and has previously been described previously (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, an argon laser (Spectra-Physics model 543; 488 nm, 100 mW) was focused through a custom-made fused silica prism (J.R. Cumberland, Inc.) onto a flow-cell containing the immobilized target complexes. Fluorescence images were collected through an objective lens (100× Plan Apo, numerical aperture 1.4; Nikon) and captured with an intensified CCD (Pentamax ICCD; Roper Scientific) and image acquisition controlled by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Flow cells were assembled as described previously (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) from fused silica microscope slides (Esco), glass coverslips (Fisher), and acrylic transfer tape (25 μm thick, 3 m). Before use, flow cells were coated with neutravidin (Pierce) and then rinsed with disassembly buffer (20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glucose, 0.05 mg/ml glucose oxidase (USB), 0.01 mg/ml catalase (Calbiochem), and 2 mg/ml α-casein (Sigma)) and incubated for 30 min. Biotinylated λ and EGFP-MuB were prepared as described (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Target complexes were assembled on ice using 10 pmbiotinylated λ, 0.1 μm EGFP-MuB, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C and then chilled on ice until use. For immobilization, the target complexes were diluted 1:10 in wash buffer containing 2 mm ATP and injected into a neutravidin-coated flow cell. Buffer flow was stopped for 10 min to allow binding, and unbound complexes were removed by resuming buffer flow. Image processing and data analysis were performed as described previously (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).RESULTSAssembly of Single MuB Target Complexes—We have reported the development of a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope system for monitoring the behavior of single EGFP-labeled MuB polymers bound to DNA (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, biotinylated molecules of λ DNA were tethered to the surface of a flow cell, and buffer flow was used to extend the DNA horizontally so that the entire DNA molecule was parallel to the surface of the flow cell. We were then able to observe EGFP-MuB bound to the immobilized DNA by illuminating the sample with total internal reflection.To examine the assembly of single MuB polymers on the tethered DNA molecules under pre-steady-state conditions, we employed a strategy similar to that previously used for monitoring the disassembly of single polymers (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). First, the microscope objective was focused on the imaging plane, and assembly was initiated by rinsing the naked DNA molecules with 2 mm ATP and various concentrations of EGFP-MuB (Fig. 1A). Progress of the reaction was monitored by capturing images at defined intervals after initiating assembly and quantitating the fluorescence signal emitted from EGFP-MuB bound to the individual DNA molecules (Figs. 1B and 2A). Initial evaluation of the assembly behavior showed that both the rate and extent of assembly were dependent upon the concentration of EGFP-MuB (Fig. 1B). At higher concentrations of EGFP-MuB, 250 and 500 nm, assembly was very rapid, but the details of the mechanism were obscured at the earliest time points of the experiment because of the high concentration of free protein relative to the DNA-bound protein (data not shown). At lower concentrations, 50 and 100 nm, assembly was much slower, requiring longer than 15 min to reach a steady state. These conditions may be more representative of in vivo conditions, in which where DNA is always expected to be in excess over MuB. The lower concentration of EGFP-MuB made it possible to distinguish early events in the assembly reaction because of the reduced background fluorescence from the free protein. Therefore, we chose to analyze the assembly mechanism in more detail at lower concentrations of protein.Fig. 2MuB oligomers assemble at discrete regions on DNA.A, EGFP-MuB complexes were assembled by rinsing the λ DNA molecules with buffer containing 50 nm EGFP-MuB and 2 mm ATP. Images were captured at 30-s intervals after initiating the reactions, and each image represents 1 s of data capture. A typical DNA molecule is shown and the time points are indicated in minutes at the top of the figure. The tethered ends of the DNA molecules were located at the top of each image, and a scale demarking the positions of the prominent binding sites relative to the tethered ends is indicated at the right hand side of the images. B, signal from each region was quantitated as described previously (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and plotted as a function of time. Both the total fluorescence emission and the estimated number of MuB molecules bound to the DNA are indicated. On rates were calculated by fitting the assembly curves to a linear equation. C, the assembly rates of 232 individual polymers were determined as described above. The data were then plotted as a histogram of the assembly rates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The time course presented in Fig. 2A shows an example of the assembly reaction on a single molecule of λ DNA with 50 nm EGFP-MuB. At the outset of the reaction, no fluorescence signal was detected on the DNA molecule (Fig. 2A, t = 0 min). As the reaction progressed, the molecule of DNA gradually became visible because of the binding of EGFP-MuB (Fig. 2A). The gradual increase in fluorescence signal at distinct sites on the DNA indicated that MuB bound to the DNA as small units, rather than large preassembled complexes. During assembly, MuB did not become uniformly distributed on the DNA; rather, there were very distinct clusters of intense fluorescence signal. We have previously shown that during dissociation from DNA molecules saturated with MuB, the regions corresponding to A/T-rich sites were the most tightly bound (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These same A/T-rich regions corresponded to the sites on λ DNA where MuB oligomer assembly occurred preferentially.Close inspection of the DNA molecules, such as those shown in Fig. 2A, revealed that the initiation of assembly did not occur simultaneously at the different positions on the DNA. Rather, the assembly of the different MuB oligomers seemed to be initiated at slightly different times, even though they were all on the same molecule of DNA (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3B). This suggested that the assembly reactions were started by individual nucleation events that led to the formation of larger MuB polymers. Most of the largest oligomers were assembled at the positions corresponding to the A/T-rich sites, but there did not seem to be a conserved order in which assembly was initiated at the different positions on the DNA (Fig. 3 and data not shown).Fig. 3Positioning of the EGFP-MuB polymers on the DNA.A, EGFP-MuB polymers were assembled on the immobilized DNA as described in Fig. 2. Images of nine different DNA molecules were then aligned next to one another to allow comparison of the polymer positions. As in Fig. 2, the tethered ends of the DNA molecules were located at the top of each image, and a scale is indicated at the right hand side of each time course demarking the length of the DNA molecules relative to their tethered ends. The grayscale and contrast of each image was adjusted to emphasize the spatial distribution of EGFP-MuB on the DNA; therefore, the image intensities are not scaled equivalently for the different time points. Top, the DNA molecules 3 min after initiating assembly. Bottom, same set of DNAs 15 min after initiating assembly. B, the positions of two different polymers located 3.5 and 5.5 μm from the tethered end of the DNA are indicated. As the assembly reaction proceeds, the polymer at 5.5 μm stops growing and is no longer visible by 7 min. In contrast, the 3.5 μm polymer continues to assemble during the observation time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To measure the rate of assembly after nucleation, we monitored the increase in photon emission from individual EGFP-MuB polymers over time (Fig. 2B; see Ref. 17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar for details of signal quantitation). The fluorescent signal from the individual polymers of MuB shown in Fig. 2A increased linearly over time, corresponding to an estimated rate of ∼8-14 molecules of EGFP-MuB per minute. The assembly rates for 232 different MuB polymers exhibited an estimated average net assembly rate of ∼12 molecules of MuB per minute (Fig. 2C). Some of the polymers seemed to assemble much faster than others, with rates up to 38 molecules per minute. However, it was possible that in these instances there may have been two or more closely juxtaposed polymers that we could not spatially resolve. Taken together, these results suggest that assembly of the MuB oligomers was initiated by a stochastic nucleation event involving smaller order oligomers of MuB. This was followed by incorporation of additional MuB during the continued assembly of the complexes.Stochastic Nucleation and Oligomer Stability—To examine the details of the early nucleation events, we aligned the images of nine different DNA molecules captured at either 3 or 15 min after initiating the assembly reactions (Fig. 3A). This showed that the sites on the DNA at which the early nucleation events occurred could vary quite dramatically from molecule to molecule. However, the distribution pattern of MuB on different DNA molecules did not differ greatly in reactions that were allowed to reach steady state. Fig. 4 shows the MuB distribution patterns on four different molecules of DNA 30 min after assembly was initiated. In this case, the images were captured at 5-min intervals, starting from the 30-min time point and continuing until 60 min. These images show that once the reactions have reached steady state, the distribution of MuB is similar on the different DNA molecules and remains constant (Fig. 4). The punctate pattern of MuB binding observed in Fig. 4 also correlates with the A/T distribution in λ DNA, and we have shown previously that during disassembly, EGFP-MuB remains more tightly bound to A/T-rich regions of the λ DNA (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Not all of the polymers we observed continued to increase in size during the course of the experiment. For example, compare the polymers at the 3.5 and 5.5 μm positions in Fig. 3B. Both polymers began to assemble at ∼2 min after initiating the reaction (Fig. 3B). From 4 to 6 min, both polymers increase in size at similar rates. However, after 6 min, the polymer at the 3.5-μm position continued to assemble, whereas the signal from the 5.5-μm region no longer increased and the polymer itself could no longer be clearly resolved after ∼7 min. Together, these results indicated that over time only the most stably bound DNA sites remained bound by large MuB polymers and that the MuB bound to the less preferred sites eventually dissociated from the DNA.Fig. 4The distribution of MuB remains constant at steady state. Target complexes were assembled with 2 mm ATP and 50 nm EGFP-MuB and allowed 30 min to reach a steady-state distribution. The time course was then initiated, and images were captured at 5-min intervals for a total of 30 min. Four typical examples are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ATP Hydrolysis Is Linked to Dissociation of MuB from DNA—We have proposed previously that MuB is unable to catalyze more than a single round of ATP hydrolysis before dissociating from DNA (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To further support this hypothesis, we examined the effects of ATPγS on the dissociation rate of MuB initially bound to DNA in the presence of ATP. MuB is unable to efficiently hydrolyze ATPγS, and bulk experiments have shown that when complexes of MuB are assembled in the presence of ATPγS, the protein is essentially irreversibly bound to the DNA (16Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6159-6167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope, we have previously shown that MuB initially bound to λ DNA in the presence of ATPγS does not dissociate even after washing for several hours in the absence of any nucleotide (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these previous results, we reasoned that if MuB were capable of catalyzing multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis without dissociating from DNA, this would be revealed as the complete inhibition of the disassembly reaction when the complexes assembled with ATP were chased with ATPγS (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Nucleotide turnover for DNA-bound MuB is limited to a single event.A, a diagram showing the experimental design for determining the influence of ATPγS on the disassembly of the target complex. Complexes were assembled with 2 mm ATP and 50 nm EGFP-MuB. These complexes were then chased with buffer that contained 2 mm ATPγS but did not contain any MuB. B, the images of typical complexes when chased with buffer lacking nucleotide (top) or buffer containing ATPγS (bottom). All images are shown at the same scale and contrast.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5B shows examples of target complex disassembly during a chase with either no nucleotide (top) or when 2mm ATPγS was included in the chase buffer. In the absence of nucleotide, the disassembly data could be fit to a single exponential decay curve, each with an apparent rate constant of ∼0.4 min-1 (data not shown). The dissociation rate was the same, ∼0.4 min-1, when ATPγS was included in the chase buffer, and the vast majority of the MuB was able to dissociate even though ATPγS was present (Fig. 5B). This was consistent with our previous conclusions and indicated that the majority of the MuB within the target complex does not hydrolyze multiple molecules of ATP before dissociation. Although most of the MuB dissociated from the DNA when chased with ATPγS, a small fraction (∼5%) of MuB remained bound to the DNA after the ATPγS chase (Fig. 5B). It is likely that a small fraction of the protein in the assembly buffer bound to ATPγS when inadvertently mixed with the chase buffer during the buffer switch, and this protein could then bind stably to the DNA.EGFP-MuB Dissociation Is Slowed in the Presence of Unlabeled MuB—Previously we proposed a mechanism in which the disassembly of the MuB polymers occurred through an end-dependent reaction (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by the observation that the polymers containing up to ∼100-200 monomers behaved as individual entities and exhibited stochastic behaviors during disassembly (17Greene E.C. Mizuuchi K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the disassembly kinetics were not linear, as would be expected for an end-dependent dissociation mechanism. The observed kinetics could be fit to single exponential decays more consistent with a random dissociation mechanism. To further analyze the mechanism of polymer disassembly, we decided to examine the behavior of the MuB target complex when both disassembly and assembly can occur simultaneously. In an attempt to examine the possibility that polymer disassembly was occurring via an end-dependent mechanism, we included unlabeled MuB in the chase buffer. If dissociation were random, then the probability of a particular MuB subunit dissociating from the DNA should be independent of that subunit's positions within the polymer (i.e. relative to the polymer ends). In this case, the disassembly of the EGFP-MuB polymers should not be influenced by the presence of the unlabeled MuB in the chase buffer. If, however, the disassembly mechanism were not random and occurred via an end-dependent process, then the presence of unlabeled MuB in the disassembly buffer would be expected to influence the dissociation rate of the fluorescent MuB (Fig. 6A).Fig. 6Dissociation of EGFP-MuB is slowed when the oligomer ends are “capped” with wt MuB.A, target complexes were preassembled with 2 mm ATP and 50 nm EGFP-MuB. These complexes were then chased with buffer containing 2 mm ATP and 500 nm unlabeled MuB. B, the images of a typical complex are shown during the disassembly time course in the presence of unlabeled MuB (top) along with the fluorescence signal quantitation for disassembly reactions in the presence (○) and absence (□) of unlabeled MuB (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Target complexes were assembled with 50 nm EGFP-MuB and 2 mm ATP and then chased with buffer containing 2 mm ATP and 500 nm unlabeled MuB (Fig. 6B). At this concentration of unlabeled MuB, the protein is expected to saturate the available DNA sites very rapidly (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the DNA will be covered primarily by unlabeled MuB that is interspersed by shorter polymers of EGFP-MuB. When the unlabeled MuB was included in the chase buffer, the disassembly rate of the EGFP-MuB was dramatically decreased (Fig. 6B). The dissociation rate of EGFP-MuB was reduced from 0.4 min-1 to 0.086 min-1, corresponding to an increase of nearly 5-fold in the half-life of the EGFP-MuB bound within the target complex (1.7 versus 8.1 min). These results suggest that the dissociation of MuB from the target complex does not occur via the random dissociation of subunits. On the other hand, it is also possible that saturating the DNA with unlabeled MuB induces some completely different disassembly pathway that does not occur at lower concentrations of protein. However, we believe that this is unlikely because the disassembly rate for EGFP-MuB does not vary over a wide range of protein concentrations (data not shown).In addition to the slower dissociation rate in the presence of the unlabeled MuB, two other changes were observed in all the DNA molecules examined (>25). First, when the unlabeled MuB entered the flow cell, all of the DNA molecules seemed to increase in length by ∼1 μm (compare the 0- and 2-min data in Fig. 6B). This suggested that binding of MuB results in a slight lengthening of the bound DNA. Second, there was a small increase in the fluorescence signal on the target complex that also coincided with the initial binding of the unlabeled protein (Fig. 6B). We considered the possibility that the increase in the total amount of protein bound to the DNA resulted in a conformational change in the DNA bound EGFP-MuB that may have led to an effective increase in the quantum yield of EGFP-MuB. However, we were unable to observe similar increases in fluorescence intensity in ensemble measurements when unlabeled MuB was titrated into reaction mixes containing EGFP-MuB; therefore, we consider this possibility unlikely (data not shown). A second, more likely, explanation is that the high concentration of unlabeled protein stimulated the binding of additional EGFP-MuB via cooperative interactions during the initial stage of the buffer exchange.DISCUSSIONThe Assembly of the MuB Target Complex—Fig. 7 depicts a possible model describing the assem"

Drosophila hairy is a primary pair-rule gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix class transcriptional repressor that is required for proper segmentation. Previous characterization of Hairy-binding proteins has implicated two different classes of histone deacetylase as mediators of Hairy repression. Here, we present the characterization of a novel Hairy-interacting protein (dTopors) that binds specifically to the basic region of Hairy, but does not affect the ability of Hairy to bind DNA. By reducing the gene dose of dtopors, we demonstrate that it acts genetically as an antagonist of Hairy-mediated transcriptional repression. Consistent with this genetic interaction, we show that that recombinant dTopors protein possesses ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity in vitro and that dTopors mediates Hairy polyubiquitination and can lead to Hairy degradation. This work provides the first evidence that regulated proteolysis of Hairy is required for correct segmentation.

This work provides the first evidence that regulated proteolysis of Hairy is required for correct segmentation. Transcriptional repression is a critical regulatory mechanism for a vast number of developmental processes, including establishment of the Drosophila embryonic body plan. Drosophila segmentation occurs via sequential subdivision of the embryo, leading ultimately to the formation and determination of each body segment. This hierarchy of segmentation gene expression begins with the translation of maternally deposited transcripts (maternal genes), followed by the expression of the zygotic gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity genes. hairy is a pair-rule class gene that encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. transcriptional repressor that occupies a key position in the segmentation gene hierarchy: it is one of the first genes to show an overt reiterated periodicity that is central to the establishment of proper embryonic body plan throughout Metazoa (1Howard K.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2729-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Hairy is one of a family of 13 structurally related bHLH transcriptional repressors that compose the HES family, which includes seven Enhancer of Split proteins E(spl)m3, E(spl)m5, E(spl)m7, E(spl)m8, E(spl)mβ, and E(spl)mγ and Deadpan, which regulate neural cell fate and sex determination, respectively (6Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Members of the HES class share several conserved functional motifs, including a basic DNA-binding region, an HLH dimerization domain, an Orange specificity region, and a C-terminal region required for binding the cofactor Groucho. The isolation and characterization of the Hairy-binding proteins Groucho, dSir2, and dCtBP have suggested that Hairy represses transcription through a chromatin-remodeling mechanism. The conserved C-terminal WRPW residues of Hairy are required for the recruitment of the corepressor protein Groucho (7Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Groucho is unable to bind DNA directly, but is able repress transcription when recruited to a promoter by interacting with DNA-bound repressors (7Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 8Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although Groucho has been proposed to utilize a chromatin-remodeling mechanism through its recruitment of histone deacetylases, the evidence for the significance of this interaction is mixed (9Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar). Groucho interacts genetically and physically with the Drosophila histone deacetylase Rpd3: interaction of Groucho with Rpd3 is necessary for efficient Groucho-mediated repression, and its activity is sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (9Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, the relatively mild phenotypic defects associated with the Rpd3 (histone deacetylase-1) mutation led to the suggestion that Groucho does not function solely through recruitment of Rpd3 (11Mannervik M. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6797-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Significantly, recruitment of Groucho is not the only mechanism by which Hairy is able to repress transcription, as deletion of the WRPW tetrapeptide reduces (but does not abolish) the ability of Hairy to repress transcription of target genes in in vitro and in vivo assays (12Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Zhang H. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This Groucho-independent Hairy repression activity may be explained in part by the binding of a second histone deacetylase, dSir2 (14Rosenberg M.I. Parkhurst S.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). dSir2, the Drosophila homolog of the yeast silencing protein Sir2, interacts directly with Hairy in vitro and behaves genetically as a Hairy corepressor protein. Hairy is therefore able to recruit two classes of histone deacetylase proteins: Rpd3 indirectly via Groucho and dSir2 by direct interaction. In contrast, the binding of the Drosophila homolog of the E1a C-terminal binding protein (dCtBP) acts to antagonize Hairy repression. Reducing the gene dose of groucho enhances a hairy embryonic segmentation phenotype, as would be predicted by its ability to act as a canonical corepressor (7Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Conversely, reducing the gene dose of dCtBP suppresses a hairy embryonic segmentation phenotype, indicating that dCtBP acts to negatively regulate Hairy activity (13Zhang H. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Phippen T.M. Sweigart A.L. Moniwa M. Krumm A. Davie J.R. Parkhurst S.M. J. Biol.

Consistent with this observation, overexpression of Hairy lacking its dCtBP-binding site has an enhanced ability to repress transcription in vivo (13Zhang H. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Genetic and molecular evidence suggests that the binding of dCtBP to Hairy antagonizes the ability of Groucho to recruit Rpd3, impairing the ability of Hairy to repress transcription (15Phippen T.M.

It is not yet known whether Hairy is able to simultaneously recruit all of these cofactors to any promoter target. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of Hairy-mediated repression, we have characterized additional Hairy-binding proteins. Here, we describe a novel RING finger-containing Hairy-interacting protein, dTopors. Both the genetic and biochemical data presented are consistent with a model in which dTopors acts a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) that negatively regulates Hairy function during embryogenesis. Clones for Expressing Bacterial Proteins–-The GST-Hairy fusion proteins bHLH, Orange-WRPW, N30 (an N-terminal 30-amino acid fragment of Hairy), Basic (basic DNA-binding elements), and HLH have been described previously (5Van Doren M.

His6-dTopors, pCS2-dTopors, and pCS2-dTopors(C102A) are BglII fragments cloned into the BamHI site of pRSETA (Invitrogen) or pCS2. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Proteins—GST fusion proteins were made essentially as described by Van Doren et al. (5Van Doren M. Bailey A.M. Esnayra J. Ede K. Posakony J.W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2729-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), except that the bacterial strain JM109 was used. In all cases, the yield of bacterially expressed protein was estimated by comparing the intensity of the purified GST-protein with known amounts of bovine serum albumin on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. His6-dTopors in strain HMS174(DE3) was induced at A600 = 0.7 with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were lysed in 30 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 6 m guanidine HCl by sonication. Denatured His6-dTopors was bound to Talon beads (Clontech); washed with 30 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 8 m urea; and then eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 25 μm ZnSO4, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol to allow the protein to renature. GST Pull-down Assays—GST pull-down assays were performed as described by Poortinga et al. (16Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M.

Full-length dTopors is a BamHI fragment cloned into pCITE4a (Novagen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Complementary oligonucleotides containing the Hairy-binding site (C-box) from the achaete promoter were used for EMSA. The primer sequences for wild-type oligonucleotides are 5′-TAAACCGGTTGGCAGCCGGCACGCGACAGGGCCAGGTTTT and 5′-AAAACCTGGCCCTGTCGCGTGCCGGCTGCCAACCGGTTTA, where the Hairy-binding sites are underlined. Oligonucleotides with an altered Hairy C-box previously shown to disrupt Hairy DNA binding (5Van Doren M. Bailey A.M. Esnayra J. Ede K. Posakony J.W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2729-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) are 5′-TAAACCGGTTGGCAGCCGGGACGCGACAGGGCCAGGTTTT and 5′-AAAACCTGGCCCTGTCGCGTCCCGGCTGCCAACCGGTTTA, where the single base changes within the Hairy-binding site are in boldface. Annealed oligonucleotides were radiolabeled, and 0.4 ng of probe was used per binding reaction. Reactions contained 40 ng of GST-Hairy protein, 7% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. For supershift experiments, 20 ng of His6-dTopors was added to each binding reaction. After a 15-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) with 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA at 20 V/cm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. For analysis of proteins within EMSA bands, EMSA was performed, and the wet gel was exposed to film. The region of the gel corresponding to the “supershifted” band was excised and electroeluted at 100 V for 16 h at room temperature, separated on an 8–16% gel (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose. The resulting Western blot was probed with mouse anti-dTopors polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and detected using ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Ubiquitination assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 5 μg of ubiquitin in the presence of 100 ng of yeast ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 100 ng of human UbcH5a (Boston Biochem), and 50–100 ng of His6-dTopors. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 90 min, stopped by addition of SDS, and run on an 8–16% or Novex acrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody P4D1 (1:500 dilution; gift from D. Gottschling) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), detected using ECL, and exposed to film. For reactions containing substrate, 0.5 μlof in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein was added to the ubiquitination reaction, and the products were separated on a 4–12% gel, dried, and exposed to film. Antibodies—Anti-dTopors antibodies were raised against a GST-dTopors fusion protein encoding amino acids 494–919 of dTopors. A 1.3-kb EcoRI fragment was taken from pCITE-dTopors (including 24 bp of polylinker sequence) and subcloned into pGEX3x. GST-dTopors-(494–919) was bacterially expressed and purified as described for other GST proteins. Strain BALB/cByJ-Rb(8.12)5Bn r/J (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used for antibody production. Mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 and anti-Gal4 monoclonal antibody RK5C1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the His5 epitope was obtained from QIAGEN Inc. Tissue Culture—293T cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Co-immunoprecipitations using monoclonal antibody 9E10 were carried out by transfecting 50 ng of Myc-tagged Hairy (pCS2-Hairy) and Gal4-dTopors as previously described (15Phippen T.M. Sweigart A.L.

Fly Strains—A dtopors deletion was made by the imprecise excision of the EP(2)2435 element inserted in the proliferation disruptor (prod) gene. EP(2)2435/CyO females were crossed with wgSp-1/CyO;Δ2–3Dr/TM6, and non-Sternopleural (wgSp-1) Drop (Dr) male flies were selected in the next generation. Male EP(2)2435/CyO;+/Δ2–3Dr flies were then crossed with Sco/CyO, and flies that had lost the mini-w+ marker from the EP and that did not have the Δ2–3Dr chromosome were crossed with Sco/CyO. EP(2)2435REV/CyO progeny from this cross were then interbred to generate a stock. The limits of deficiencies generated were mapped by Southern blotting and PCR sequencing across the deletion breakpoint. dtoporsAA removes 4.1 kb including the dtopors promoter and translation initiation site, resulting in null mutations of both prod and dtopors (see Fig. 2A). A dtopors-specific mutation was generated by cloning a 5.1-kb prod genomic region from the start of dtopors transcript to a HindIII site 3′ to the prod transcript into the pCaSpeR4 P element vector. Transgenic P{prod+} flies were crossed into the dtoporsAA deletion background to generate flies of the genotype dtoporsAA/CyO; P{prod+} (which we refer to as dtoporsAA+P). dtoporsAA+P flies are homozygous viable. All fly strains were cultured and crossed on yeast/cornmeal/molasses/malt extract medium at 25 °C. The hairy (h) alleles used were the severe nonsense allele h7H (T72A) and the hypomorphic missense allele h12C (P336L) (18Wainwright S.M. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2475-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The prod allele prod1 was obtained from P. Bryant. Embryo Analysis—Cuticle preparations were carried out as described by Wieschaus and Nüsslein-Volhard (19Wieschaus E. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 199-226Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (20Parkhurst S.M. Bopp D. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1990; 63: 1179-1191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and visualized with substrate kit II reagents (Vector Labs, Inc.). dTopors Is a Hairy-interacting Protein—We have previously used a yeast two-hybrid assay to isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that show Hairy-specific binding activity (16Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). 2S. M. Parkhurst, unpublished data. One of these cDNAs (CG15104) encodes a 1038-amino acid protein that interacts with Hairy in a GST pull-down assay using in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein (Fig. 1A; see Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, recombinant His6-tagged CG15104 bound to GST-Hairy in vitro (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that this interaction is direct. Currently available anti-Hairy and anti-dTopors antibodies were unable to immunoprecipitate their cognate proteins from embryonic extracts (data not shown). Thus, to show that the interaction between CG15104 and Hairy can occur in vivo, Hairy complexes were analyzed by transfecting Myc-Hairy and Gal4-CG15104 into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, immunoprecipitation of Hairy using anti-Myc epitope antibody 9E10 and subsequent Western blotting with anti-Gal4 antibody showed the association of Hairy and CG15104 specifically when antibody 9E10 was present and both Gal4-CG15104 and Myc-Hairy were transfected into cells.Fig. 3dTopors-Hairy interaction domain mapping.

B, dTopors interacts with the basic region of Hairy. Regions of Hairy tested for interaction with dTopors are indicated in the schematic. 35S-Labeled dTopors (20% input; lane 1) was tested for binding to GST (lane 2), GST-Hairy (lane 3), GST-bHLH (lane 4), GST-Orange-WRPW (lane 5), GST-HLH (lane 6), GST-N30 (lane 7), and GST-Basic (lane 8). C, similarity between Hairy, Deadpan, and Enhancer of Split proteins E(spl)m3 and E(spl)m8 over the 19-amino acid region required for dTopors to bind Hairy. Identity between Hairy family proteins is depicted by black boxes, and similarity by gray boxes. 35S-Labeled dTopors (20% input; lane 1) was incubated with GST (lane 2), GST-Hairy (lane 3), GST-E(spl)m3 (lane 4), GST-E(spl)m8 (lane 5), and GST-Deadpan (lane 6). 35S-Labeled Hairy protein was used as a control for the integrity of purified GST-proteins, as Hairy did not bind GST (lane 8), but could homodimerize (lane 9) and heterodimerize with GST-E(spl)m3 (lane 10), GST-E(spl)m8 (lane 11), and GST-Deadpan (lane 12). D, the binding of Hairy to dTopors requires the 187-amino acid region of dTopors shown in the schematic. 35S-Labeled dTopors (20% input; lane 1) did not bind GST (lane 2), but did bind GST-Hairy (lane 3). Similarly, dTopors-(495–682) (20% input; lane 4) did not bind GST (lane 5), but did bind GST-Hairy (lane 6).

Saleem A. Rasheed A. Ahmed F. Su E.W. Liu L.R. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); a p53-binding protein, p53BP3 (22Zhou R. Wen H. Ao S.-Z. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 235: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); and a protein highly expressed in the lung that binds palindromic DNA sequences, LUN (23Chu D. Kakazu N. Gorrin-Rivas M.J. Lu H.P. Kawata M. Abe T. Ueda K. Adachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14004-14013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Like human Topors, CG15104 interacted with Drosophila topoisomerase I and p53 (Dmp53) in vitro (Fig. 1A; see Fig. 3A). On the basis of this similarity and the conserved binding activities, we have named this Drosophila protein dTopors. The human and Drosophila Topors proteins share several structural motifs, including an N-terminal RING finger, a region rich in RS/SR dipeptide repeats, bipartite nuclear localization sequences, and PEST sequences (Fig. 1D). The N-terminal C3HC4-type RING finger of dTopors is most similar to the ICP0 family of viral proteins involved in activation of latent herpesvirus (24Everett R.D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The similarity between dTopors and ICP0 proteins is restricted to a 64-amino acid region that includes both the RING finger and adjacent residues that have been shown to contribute to ICP0 function (24Everett R.D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The central region of both human and Drosophila Topors proteins is rich in RS (or SR) repeats, containing 33 and 17 RS/SR dipeptides, respectively. Such SR/RS-rich regions are found in mRNA splicing factors, where they are targets of regulated phosphorylation (25Furuyama S. Bruzik J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5337-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Gravely B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). However, dTopors has a reduced density of RS repeats and lacks the consensus RNA-binding domain characteristic of RS domain splicing factors. This suggests that, although the SR region of dTopors may be involved in protein-protein interactions or phosphorylated, it is unlikely to be a direct regulator of mRNA splicing. dTopors is also predicted to be a short-lived nuclear protein, as there are four partially overlapping bipartite nuclear localization sequences and four PEST sequences, which serve as proteolytic signals for a variety of cellular proteins (27Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). dtopors Genetically Interacts with hairy—To investigate the functional interaction of dTopors and Hairy in vivo, we generated a dtopors mutant. A dtopors deletion was made by imprecise excision of a P element inserted in the gene adjacent to dtopors, prod. This deletion allele (dtoporsAA) resulted in null mutations of both prod and dtopors (Fig. 2A). dtoporsAA homozygotes die at the third larval instar and show phenotypes identical to those described for prod mutants (28Török T. Harvie P.D. Buratovich M. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To generate a dtopors-specific mutant, a wild-type copy of the prod locus was introduced into dtoporsAA deletion flies by P element-mediated transformation (dtoporsAA;P{prod+}; see “Materials and Methods”). These flies, which we refer to as dtoporsAA+P, are homozygous viable, demonstrating that zygotic dTopors function is not essential for viability. We next examined the effect of reducing the gene dose of dtopors on a hairy embryonic pair-rule phenotype to determine whether dtopors influences Hairy-mediated repression. In wild-type embryos, Hairy acts indirectly to represses Fushi tarazu (Ftz) expression, resulting in seven Ftz stripes along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo and correct determination of each larval segment (Fig. 2, B and C) (29Carroll S.B. Scott M.P. Cell. 1986; 45: 113-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 30Howard K. Ingham P. Cell. 1986; 44: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Embryos trans-heterozygous for h7H and h12C show a pair-rule phenotype resulting from derepression of Ftz expression, leading to loss of every second segment (Fig. 2, D and E). This hairy pair-rule phenotype has been shown to be sensitive to the gene dosage of factors required for Hairy-mediated repression (7Paroush Z. Finley R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 15Phippen T.M. Sweigart A.L. Moniwa M. Krumm A. Davie J.R. Parkhurst S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37628-37637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Halving the gene dose of dtopors (dtoporsAA;h7H/h12C or dtoporsAA+P;h7H/h12C) resulted in suppression of the h7H/h12C mutant phenotype, as shown by the increased number of denticle bands and more distinct Ftz stripes (Fig. 2, F and G). To ensure that the suppression of the hairy mutant phenotype is specific to dtopors, we verified that the original EP line from which the dtoporsAA allele was generated did not genetically interact with hairy (data not shown). Suppression of the hairy mutant phenotype by dtopors indicates that dTopors negatively regulates the ability of Hairy to repress transcription in vivo. dTopors Interacts with the Basic Domain of Hairy—To investigate the molecular basis of the dtopors suppression of the hairy phenotype, we mapped the minimal regions within each protein required to mediate this protein-protein interaction. Truncated GST-tagged Hairy proteins were tested for their ability to bind full-length dTopors in GST pull-down assays. dTopors bound full-length Hairy and truncated bHLH and Basic, but not Orange-WRPW, HLH alone, N30, or GST alone (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the 20 amino acids of the basic domain previously shown to be required for DNA binding compose the minimal region of Hairy required for binding dTopors. Because the basic region of Hairy that mediates dTopors binding is similar among the Hairy/E(spl) family of proteins (Fig. 3, A and C), we examined whether dTopors could bind the related E(spl)m3, E(spl)m8, and Deadpan proteins in a GST pull-down assay. dTopors bound specifically to Hairy, but not to E(spl)m3, E(spl)m8, or Deadpan (Fig. 3C). As a positive control, we confirmed the ability of the E(spl)m3, E(spl)m8, and Deadpan proteins to dimerize with Hairy. dTopors is therefore not a general cofactor for Hairy/E(spl) family proteins. To determine whether Hairy binds to a conserved region within dTopors, truncated dTopors proteins were tested for Hairy binding activity in the GST pull-down assays described above (Fig. 3D). The minimal region of dTopors required for specific binding by GST-Hairy is a 187-amino acid region that includes a PEST sequence and eight RS repeats within the RS domain. Smaller protein fragments derived from this region were unable to bind Hairy, suggesting that the binding site may be bipartite or that the secondary structure of this region may be critical for Hairy interaction. dTopors Is Able to Form a Stable DNA-binding Complex with Hairy—The binding of dTopors to the basic domain of Hairy suggests that dTopors might either alter or preclude the ability of Hairy to bind DNA. To determine whether Hairy and dTopors form a complex on DNA in vitro, EMSA was carried out using bacterially expressed and purified GST-Hairy and His6-dTopors. GST-Hairy (but not GST alone) bound specifically to a 40-mer oligon"
