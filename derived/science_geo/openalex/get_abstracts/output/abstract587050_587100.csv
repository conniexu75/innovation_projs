https://openalex.org/W2614144400,"The molecular mechanisms underlying folding of mammalian chromosomes remain poorly understood. The transcription factor CTCF is a candidate regulator of chromosomal structure. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Furthermore, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading. Beyond defining the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, these results provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization."
https://openalex.org/W2616848081,"Maintenance of proper levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is critical for a wide variety of biological processes. We demonstrate that the N6-adenosine methyltransferase METTL16 regulates expression of human MAT2A, which encodes the SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. Upon SAM depletion by methionine starvation, cells induce MAT2A expression by enhanced splicing of a retained intron. Induction requires METTL16 and its methylation substrate, a vertebrate conserved hairpin (hp1) in the MAT2A 3' UTR. Increasing METTL16 occupancy on the MAT2A 3' UTR is sufficient to induce efficient splicing. We propose that, under SAM-limiting conditions, METTL16 occupancy on hp1 increases due to inefficient enzymatic turnover, which promotes MAT2A splicing. We further show that METTL16 is the long-unknown methyltransferase for the U6 spliceosomal small nuclear RNA (snRNA). These observations suggest that the conserved U6 snRNA methyltransferase evolved an additional function in vertebrates to regulate SAM homeostasis."

Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells."

Typically performed in atomic gases, there is now interest in extending such a process to the solid state. Yoshikawa et al. pumped single-layer graphene with intense polarized pulses of infrared light to generate ultraviolet light, up to the ninth harmonic. Theoretical analysis of the process suggests that the effect could be transferred to other solid-state systems, providing a possible route to develop coherent light sources across the spectrum.

Whether this increase translates into differences in interaction rates among species, however, remains unclear. To simplify the problem, Roslin et al. tested for predation rates by using a single approach involving model caterpillars across six continents. Predator attack rates were higher toward the equator, but only for arthropod predators. Science , this issue p. 742"

Microporous adsorbents such as zeolites are used for this purpose, but they often need to be heated to temperatures up to 250°C to remove the water so that they can be reused.

Little is known about the neural circuitry that underlies this understanding. Sliwa and Freiwald scanned monkey brains as the monkeys watched static or moving stimuli. A subset of brain areas was exclusively active during monkey-monkey interactions, as opposed to physical interactions between two objects. This network shares some of its components with the monkey mirror neuron system mapped previously by others and with a possible homolog of the human network involved in the theory of mind.

https://openalex.org/W2615774542,"Inactivating mutations in the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) cause severe psychomotor retardation in children. Animal models do not reflect the biology of the human disease. Using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we generated MCT8-deficient neural cells that showed normal TH-dependent neuronal properties and maturation. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls TH entry into the brain, and reduced TH availability to neural cells could instead underlie the diseased phenotype. To test potential BBB involvement, we generated an iPSC-based BBB model of MCT8 deficiency, and we found that MCT8 was necessary for polarized influx of the active form of TH across the BBB. We also found that a candidate drug did not appreciably cross the mutant BBB. Our results therefore clarify the underlying physiological basis of this disorder, and they suggest that circumventing the diseased BBB to deliver active TH to the brain could be a viable therapeutic strategy."

Here, we report detailed genotypes and phenotypes of TALEN-edited MECP2 mutant cynomolgus monkeys serving as a model for a neurodevelopmental disorder, Rett syndrome (RTT), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the human MECP2 gene. Male mutant monkeys were embryonic lethal, reiterating that RTT is a disease of females. Through a battery of behavioral analyses, including primate-unique eye-tracking tests, in combination with brain imaging via MRI, we found a series of physiological, behavioral, and structural abnormalities resembling clinical manifestations of RTT. Moreover, blood transcriptome profiling revealed that mutant monkeys resembled RTT patients in immune gene dysregulation.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that mostly manifests in girls with a morbidity rate of 1:10,000–1:15,000 (Amir et al., 1999Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar). Almost 95% of RTT is believed to be caused by mutations of an X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) (Rett, 1966Rett A. [On a unusual brain atrophy syndrome in hyperammonemia in childhood].Wien. Med. Wochenschr. 1966; 116: 723-726PubMed Google Scholar, Amir et al., 1999Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q.

Neonatal encephalopathy in two boys in families with recurrent Rett syndrome.J. Child Neurol. 1998; 13: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). MECP2 mutations are most often embryonic lethal for boys, except for very few, who are born with severe encephalopathy leading to death before 2 years of age (Schanen et al., 1998Schanen N.C.

RTT girls seem to have normal development for up to 6–18 months but manifest a series of symptoms associated with intellectual disability, loss of acquired language, and compromised cognitive, social, and motor skills, etc. (Hagberg et al., 1983Hagberg B.

As RTT is a monogenic disorder, genetic modification technologies have made it possible to develop animal models for further study. RTT animal models were first generated in mice and recently in rats (Chen et al., 2001Chen R.Z. Akbarian S. Tudor M. Jaenisch R.

It is interesting that RTT-related neurological phenotypes mostly occur in adult male rodents, which is different from the human disease (Lombardi et al., 2015Lombardi L.M. Baker S.A. Zoghbi H.Y.

It is therefore conceivable that gene-edited nonhuman primates (NHPs) would serve as a better choice for modeling genetic neurological disorders including RTT (Jennings et al., 2016Jennings C.G. Landman R. Zhou Y. Sharma J. Hyman J. Movshon J.A. Qiu Z. Roberts A.C. Roe A.W. Wang X. et al.Opportunities and challenges in modeling human brain disorders in transgenic primates.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although monkeys and humans are different in many ways given that evolution has separated the Old World primate lineage into different paths, NHPs, such as rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys, still share high levels of genetic, physiological, social behavioral, and CNS developmental similarities with humans, making them suitable for the study of neurodevelopmental disorders (Shultz et al., 2011Shultz S. Opie C. Atkinson Q.D. Stepwise evolution of stable sociality in primates.Nature. 2011; 479: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Izpisua Belmonte et al., 2015Izpisua Belmonte J.C.

Mitchell J.F. et al.Brains, genes, and primates.Neuron. 2015; 86: 617-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we reported the successful application of TALEN-mediated mutagenesis to produce MECP2 mutant monkeys (Liu et al., 2014Liu H. Chen Y. Niu Y. Zhang K. Kang Y. Ge W. Liu X. Zhao E. Wang C. Lin S. et al.TALEN-mediated gene mutagenesis in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which opened up great opportunities for using monkey models to better understand RTT and to develop potential treatments for the disease. In this study, using the same technology, we generated additional MECP2 mutants, from which we recapitulated embryonic lethality of mutant males and physiological and behavioral abnormalities of mutant females, including primate-unique eye tracking, which are seen with RTT patients. Moreover, brain imaging by MRI, MeCP2 protein measurements by semiquantitative western blotting, and transcriptome profiling of peripheral blood all demonstrated that these phenotypes (and/or endophenotypes) of the MECP2 mutant monkeys were strikingly similar to RTT clinical manifestations, which can be used for disease mechanistic studies as well as development of potential therapeutic interventions for RTT. In our previous report, one live female mutant monkey and three spontaneously aborted male mutant fetuses were generated using TALENs (Liu et al., 2014Liu H. Chen Y. Niu Y. Zhang K. Kang Y. Ge W. Liu X. Zhao E. Wang C. Lin S. et al.TALEN-mediated gene mutagenesis in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After that, we generated another six live monkeys (four female mutants and two non-affected wild-type [WT] males) and five spontaneously aborted fetuses (two male mutants, two female mutants, one non-affected WT female). The fact that all male mutant monkeys were embryonic lethal recapitulated the human disease (Chen et al., 2001Chen R.Z. Akbarian S. Tudor M. Jaenisch R. Deficiency of methyl-CpG binding protein-2 in CNS neurons results in a Rett-like phenotype in mice.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, Guy et al., 2001Guy J.

Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) but different from Mecp2 knockout mice. In this study, we gathered all available animals, i.e., five female mutants and five spontaneously aborted male fetuses from 41 surrogate recipients, and carried out the following studies (Figures 1A and 1B ; Table S1). Mutations of the MECP2 gene from live monkeys and aborted fetuses were verified through T7EN1 cleavage, Sanger sequencing, and genome alignment. Live female mutants were further analyzed using Sanger sequencing of PCR-based clones from accessible tissues and compared with the reference for detection of missense, nonsense mutations, and/or indels on exon 3 of the MECP2 gene (Table S2 and Figures 1C–1F). Distributions and frequencies of mutations for the #1 female MECP2 mutation-carrying monkey (ID: 130958) can be found in the previous report (Liu et al., 2014Liu H. Chen Y. Niu Y. Zhang K. Kang Y. Ge W. Liu X. Zhao E. Wang C. Lin S. et al.TALEN-mediated gene mutagenesis in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As for the other four newborn mutant females, mutations detected in placenta, blood, and skin were plotted in Figure 1C. All detected point mutations were plotted based on their positions and mutation rate in the entire targeted 351 bp of exon III. MeCP2 protein levels in tissues (placentae and fibroblasts) of live monkeys and in brains (cortices) of aborted fetuses were overall lower in mutants as compared with those for WT controls (Figure 1G). Reduction of protein levels is shown in all five mutant monkeys (Figure 1G, a and b). Since it is not feasible to sample from cerebral cortices from live female monkeys due to technical and ethical concerns, we only compared MeCP2 levels in cortices from aborted fetuses from mutants and WT monkeys. Data from aborted male monkeys’ cerebral cortices showed substantial reductions in MeCP2 levels (Figure 1G, c), which indirectly suggested that brain MeCP2 levels were also likely to be reduced in live mutant female monkeys. These data support the previous report that MeCP2 is a key regulator for neural development, which affects brain functions and behaviors (Chen et al., 2001Chen R.Z. Akbarian S. Tudor M. Jaenisch R. Deficiency of methyl-CpG binding protein-2 in CNS neurons results in a Rett-like phenotype in mice.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Concerning potential off-target effects, we used a genome-wide TALEN off-target site prediction tool named TALENoffer (Grau et al., 2013Grau J. Boch J. Posch S. TALENoffer: Genome-wide TALEN off-target prediction.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 2931-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2014Liu H. Chen Y. Niu Y. Zhang K. Kang Y. Ge W. Liu X. Zhao E. Wang C. Lin S. et al.TALEN-mediated gene mutagenesis in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The statistical model of TALENoffer assumes that possible nucleotides on a target site can be traced from the repeat-variable di-residue of the corresponding repeat, which determines DNA binding specificity. Using a definite cutoff (TALENoffer score > −1.8) to define potential off-targets in the whole genome, a total of 41 exonic loci were predicted to be potential off-target sites (Table S3). The fragments of all the potential off-target loci from three pairs of TALENs were PCR amplified and subjected to Sanger sequencing. No mutations were found on these sites (Table S3). These data indicate that we did not detect off-target mutations on all 41 potential off-target sites from the four new monkeys and 11 WT control monkeys (Table S3). Non-invasive neuroimaging is a very useful approach to assist diagnosis and monitoring longitudinal disease progression over time, which is particularly suitable for neural developmental disorders including RTT (Bjure et al., 1997Bjure J.

We used MRI scanning to measure global or regional structural changes in brains of MECP2 mutant monkeys. Similar MRI scanning has been done with RTT patients and reported (Bjure et al., 1997Bjure J.

Neuroradiol. 2008; 29: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In our study, MRI scanning was conducted three times with the first scanning performed at 7–8 months after birth, the second at 15 months, and the third at 20 months. A total of 60 subregions of each monkey’s brain was segmented, and data were analyzed by both rank-sum test and false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple comparisons. Mutant monkeys showed significantly reduced cortical gray matter (GM) volumes in 16 regions at least at one stage when compared to normal controls (Figure 2, a–j). Younger (8 months old) mutant monkeys had more cortical areas showing statistically significant reductions as compared to WT controls, whereas at the 20th month of age only bilateral occipital gyri, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right annectant gyrus displayed statistically significant reduction in volumes. In contrast, the difference in right annectant gyrus only became significant at the 20th month but not at younger ages (Figure 2, a–j). Widespread reductions in GM volumes of specific sub-cortical areas and region-specific white matter (WM) volumes were also apparent in MECP2 mutant monkeys (Figure 2, k–p). Total brain GM and WM volumes, as well as total cortical volumes, total cortical surface areas, and average cortical thicknesses, were consistently smaller (with mean values) at all time points (i.e., 8, 15, and 20 months) in mutant monkeys, compared with WT controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (Figure S1). When these parameters were measured in a regional-specific manner, statistically significant alterations in mutant monkeys could be observed (Figures S1 and S2). Given that all five MECP2 mutant monkeys have different repertoires of MECP2 mutations, these results suggest that abnormal brain development in mutant monkeys, including reductions of subregional GM and WM volumes, specific cortical surface area, and cortical thickness, are likely due to MeCP2 deficiency. This is further supported by consistent abnormalities reported in previous MRI studies on human subjects with RTT (Naidu et al., 2001Naidu S. Kaufmann W.E. Abrams M.T. Pearlson G.D. Lanham D.C.

In addition, to investigate whether MECP2 mutant monkeys have any differences in growth and development compared to age- and gender- matched WT controls, basic parameters including body weight, body length, head circumference, and biparietal diameter were measured every 3 months.

Based on aforementioned symptoms, we used a battery of behavioral assays to analyze the phenotype of MECP2 mutant monkeys. Sleep pattern was classified into awake and asleep phases (including relaxed and transitional sleep). Frequency and duration will be an important index to evaluate the sleep pattern. Thus, we recorded and analyzed these two indexes in MECP2 mutants and WT control monkeys. The total awake durations of mutants were found to be significantly longer while the total sleep durations were shorter than those of WT controls (Figure 4A, a). Remarkably, sleep in mutants was more fragmented than that in control monkeys, with more bouts of awaking and sleep (Figure 4A, b–d). It seemed difficult for mutant monkeys to have a continuous and longer-hour sleep, which is similar to RTT patients with abnormal circadian rhythms as well as Mecp2 mutant mice (Li et al., 2015Li Q. Loh D.H. Kudo T. Truong D. Derakhshesh M. Kaswan Z.M. Ghiani C.A. Tsoa R. Cheng Y. Sun Y.E. Colwell C.S.

We examined monkeys’ responses to heat stress and found that WT monkeys moved their feet frequently and constantly in response to rising temperatures, while mutants made no attempt to escape from the heating plate (Movie S1). When temperature rose further to certain threshold, both mutant monkeys and WT controls exhibited nocifensive behaviors involving withdrawal and/or licking of either hind- and/or forelimbs, but mutants had a higher threshold for pain sensation toward higher temperatures (Figure 4B, a). Active avoidance test was conducted with a high decibel level noise (120 dB noise) that was used as a source to trigger fear responses in monkeys according to a previous report (Winslow et al., 2002Winslow J.T.

The mutant monkeys could hear the auditory stimuli (Movie S2), but they covered their ears and hid themselves in the corner of the cage rather than escaping as WT controls did when the noise was presented (Figure 4B, b, Movie S2). These behaviors are very similar to those found in RTT patients with retarded reactions (Neul et al., 2010Neul J.L. Kaufmann W.E. Glaze D.G. Christodoulou J. Clarke A.J. Bahi-Buisson N. Leonard H.

Here, we mined the human immune response to natural EBOV infection and identified mAbs with exceptionally potent pan-ebolavirus neutralizing activity and protective efficacy against three virulent ebolaviruses. These mAbs recognize an inter-protomer epitope in the GP fusion loop, a critical and conserved element of the viral membrane fusion machinery, and neutralize viral entry by targeting a proteolytically primed, fusion-competent GP intermediate (GPCL) generated in host cell endosomes. Only a few somatic hypermutations are required for broad antiviral activity, and germline-approximating variants display enhanced GPCL recognition, suggesting that such antibodies could be elicited more efficiently with suitably optimized GP immunogens. Our findings inform the development of both broadly effective immunotherapeutics and vaccines against filoviruses."

The structural mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the Escherichia coli nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The structures reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs."

https://openalex.org/W2615053258,"The physiological relevance of structures within mammalian mRNAs has been elusive, as these mRNAs are less folded in cells than in vitro and have predicted secondary structures no more stable than those of random sequences. Here, we investigate the possibility that mRNA structures facilitate the 3'-end processing of thousands of human mRNAs by juxtaposing poly(A) signals (PASs) and cleavage sites that are otherwise too far apart. We find that RNA structures are predicted to be more prevalent within these extended 3'-end regions than within PAS-upstream regions and indeed are substantially more folded within cells, as determined by intracellular probing. Analyses of thousands of ectopically expressed variants demonstrate that this folding both enhances processing and increases mRNA metabolic stability. Even folds with predicted stabilities resembling those of random sequences can enhance processing. Structure-controlled processing can also regulate neighboring gene expression. Thus, RNA structure has widespread roles in mammalian mRNA biogenesis and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2616831184,"While neutralizing antibodies are highly effective against ebolavirus infections, current experimental ebolavirus vaccines primarily elicit species-specific antibody responses. Here, we describe an immunization-elicited macaque antibody (CA45) that clamps the internal fusion loop with the N terminus of the ebolavirus glycoproteins (GPs) and potently neutralizes Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Reston viruses. CA45, alone or in combination with an antibody that blocks receptor binding, provided full protection against all pathogenic ebolaviruses in mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets. Analysis of memory B cells from the immunized macaque suggests that elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for ebolaviruses is possible but difficult, potentially due to the rarity of bNAb clones and their precursors. Unexpectedly, germline-reverted CA45, while exhibiting negligible binding to full-length GP, bound a proteolytically remodeled GP with picomolar affinity, suggesting that engineered ebolavirus vaccines could trigger rare bNAb precursors more robustly. These findings have important implications for developing pan-ebolavirus vaccine and immunotherapeutic cocktails."

https://openalex.org/W2615901364,"The gut harbors many symbiotic, commensal, and pathogenic microbes that break down and metabolize host carbohydrates. Sialic acids are prominent outermost carbohydrates on host glycoproteins called mucins and protect underlying glycan chains from enzymatic degradation. Sialidases produced by some members of the colonic microbiota can promote the expansion of several potential pathogens (e.g. Clostridium difficile, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli) that do not produce sialidases. O-Acetyl ester modifications of sialic acids help resist the action of many sialidases and are present at high levels in the mammalian colon. However, some gut bacteria, in turn, produce sialylate-O-acetylesterases to remove them. Here, we investigated O-acetyl ester removal and sialic acid degradation by Bacteroidetes sialate-O-acetylesterases and sialidases, respectively, and subsequent utilization of host sialic acids by both commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains. In vitro foraging studies demonstrated that sialidase-dependent E. coli growth on mucin is enabled by Bacteroides EstA, a sialate O-acetylesterase acting on glycosidically linked sialylate-O-acetylesterase substrates, particularly at neutral pH. Biochemical studies suggested that spontaneous migration of O-acetyl esters on the sialic acid side chain, which can occur at colonic pH, may serve as a switch controlling EstA-assisted sialic acid liberation. Specifically, EstA did not act on O-acetyl esters in their initial 7-position. However, following migration to the 9-position, glycans with O-acetyl esters became susceptible to the sequential actions of bacterial esterases and sialidases. We conclude that EstA specifically unlocks the nutritive potential of 9-O-acetylated mucus sialic acids for foraging by bacteria that otherwise are prevented from accessing this carbon source."

https://openalex.org/W2616359747,"Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use a syringe-like apparatus called a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host cells. Some of these effectors are enzymes that modify host proteins to subvert their normal functions. NleB is a glycosyltransferase that modifies host proteins with N-acetyl-d-glucosamine to inhibit antibacterial and inflammatory host responses. NleB is conserved among the attaching/effacing pathogens enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and Citrobacter rodentium Moreover, Salmonella enterica strains encode up to three NleB orthologs named SseK1, SseK2, and SseK3. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the activities and host protein targets among the NleB/SseK orthologs. Therefore, here we performed in vitro glycosylation assays and cell culture experiments to compare the activities and substrate specificities of these effectors. SseK1, SseK3, EHEC NleB1, EPEC NleB1, and Crodentium NleB blocked TNF-mediated NF-κB pathway activation, whereas SseK2 and NleB2 did not. C. rodentium NleB, EHEC NleB1, and SseK1 glycosylated host GAPDH. C. rodentium NleB, EHEC NleB1, EPEC NleB1, and SseK2 glycosylated the FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein). SseK3 and NleB2 were not active against either substrate. We also found that EHEC NleB1 glycosylated two GAPDH arginine residues, Arg197 and Arg200, and that these two residues were essential for GAPDH-mediated activation of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 ubiquitination. These results provide evidence that members of this highly conserved family of bacterial virulence effectors target different host protein substrates and exhibit distinct cellular modes of action to suppress host responses."
https://openalex.org/W2614167833,"ATG9 is a membrane protein that is essential for autophagy and is considered to be directly involved in the early steps of autophagosome formation. Yeast Atg9 is mainly localized to small vesicles (Atg9 vesicles), whereas mammalian ATG9A is reportedly localized to the trans-Golgi network, the endosomal compartment, and other unidentified membrane structures. To dissect the ATG9A-containing membranes, we examined the subcellular localization of ATG9A and performed immunoisolation of those membranes. ATG9A-green fluorescent protein in human culture cells was observed as numerous puncta that move rapidly throughout the cytoplasm. We isolated these cytoplasmic membranes and found that they were small vesicles that resemble the yeast Atg9 vesicle. One of the proteins obtained via proteomic analyses of the mammalian ATG9A vesicle was Rab1, a small GTPase that is essential in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi vesicle trafficking. Knockdown studies of Rab1B showed a suppression of autophagy. In these Rab1B-depleted cells, ATG9A accumulated in intermediate membrane structures at autophagosome formation sites. These results indicate that Rab1B is involved in regulating the proper development of autophagosomes.-Kakuta, S., Yamaguchi, J., Suzuki, C., Sasaki, M., Kazuno, S., Uchiyama, Y.

Here, we assessed the impact of LOX overexpression on ventricular function and cardiac hypertrophy in a transgenic LOX (TgLOX) mouse model with a strong cardiac expression of human LOX. TgLOX mice exhibited high expression of the transgene in cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts, which are associated with enhanced LOX activity and H2O2 production and with cardiofibroblast reprogramming. LOX overexpression promoted an age-associated concentric remodeling of the left ventricle and impaired diastolic function. Furthermore, LOX transgenesis aggravated angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, which triggered a greater fibrotic response that was characterized by stronger collagen deposition and cross-linking and high expression of fibrotic markers. In addition, LOX transgenesis increased the Ang II–induced myocardial inflammatory infiltrate, exacerbated expression of proinflammatory markers, and decreased that of cardioprotective factors. Mechanistically, LOX overexpression enhanced oxidative stress and potentiated the Ang II–mediated cardiac activation of p38 MAPK while reducing AMPK activation. Our findings suggest that LOX induces an age-dependent disturbance of diastolic function and aggravates Ang II–induced hypertrophy, which provides novel insights into the role of LOX in cardiac performance.—Galán, M., Varona, S., Guadall, A., Orriols, M., Navas, M., Aguiló, S., deDiego, A., Navarro, M.

We investigated the effect of SMS2 deficiency on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine colitis and found inhibition of DSS-induced inflammation in SMS2-deficient (SMS2-/-) mice. DSS treatment induced a significant increase in ceramide levels, with a decrease of SM levels in SMS2-/- colon tissue, and demonstrated attenuation of the elevation of both inflammation-related gene expression and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, and MAPK and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation. After undergoing transplantation of wild-type bone marrow, SMS2-/- mice also exhibited inhibition of DSS-induced inflammation in the colon, which suggested that SMS2 deficiency in bone marrow-derived immune cells was not involved in the inhibition of colitis. Finally, in an azoxymethane/DSS-induced cancer model, SMS2 deficiency significantly decreased tumor incidence in the colon. Our results demonstrate that SMS2 deficiency inhibits DSS-induced colitis and subsequent colitis-associated colon cancer via inhibition of colon epithelial cell-mediated inflammation; therefore, inhibition of SMS2 may be a potential therapeutic target for human colitis and colorectal cancer.-Ohnishi, T., Hashizume, C., Taniguchi, M., Furumoto, H., Han, J., Gao, R., Kinami, S., Kosaka, T., Okazaki, T.

However, how Orb2 expression and aggregation are regulated still remains largely unexplored. The Orb2 gene has two distinct protein isoforms, Orb2A and Orb2B (Figure 1A). A single mRNA encodes Orb2A, while Orb2B has several mRNA isoforms (Figure S1A) (Hafer et al., 2011Hafer N. Xu S. Bhat K.M. Schedl P.

The Orb2B protein is abundant, while the Orb2A protein is extremely rare with sparse expression (Krüttner et al., 2012Krüttner S. Stepien B. Noordermeer J.N. Mommaas M.A. Mechtler K. Dickson B.J.

There are broadly three types of alternative splicing: exon skipping, alternative use of splice sites, and intron retention (Wang and Burge, 2008Wang Z. Burge C.B. Splicing regulation: from a parts list of regulatory elements to an integrated splicing code.RNA. 2008; 14: 802-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Among these three splicing events, intron retention is the least studied; it is primarily thought to be a consequence of inefficient splicing since retained introns can affect mRNA transport and stability. However, intron rention is quite prevalent in plants (Ner-Gaon et al., 2004Ner-Gaon H. Halachmi R. Savaldi-Goldstein S. Rubin E. Ophir R. Fluhr R. Intron retention is a major phenomenon in alternative splicing in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2004; 39: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and unicellular organisms, and it can act as a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism (Boothby et al., 2013Boothby T.C. Zipper R.S. van der Weele C.M. Wolniak S.M. Removal of retained introns regulates translation in the rapidly developing gametophyte of Marsilea vestita.Dev.

Here, we report that in Drosophila melanogaster, a retained intron in Orb2A couples ongoing internal states, such as starvation, to transient external stimuli, such as food and odor, to control Orb2A protein expression and long-lasting memory formation. Failure to remove the intron specifically impairs long-term memory but not learning, and the intron removal is modulated by specific isoforms of the RNA-binding protein Pasilla. In our attempts to understand regulation of Orb2A protein expression, we analyzed Orb2A mRNA expression in single adult fly heads and bodies. Surprisingly, independent of sex or age, the predominant Orb2A transcript in the adult fly head retains a 297-nt intron with multiple stop-codons in all reading frames (Figure 1A). The intron separates the 113-nt long Orb2A specific exon from the common Orb2A/B exon. The intron-retained Orb2A transcript is present in the nervous system of other Drosophila species (Figure S1B). In contrast to Orb2A, all Orb2B introns are spliced, producing protein-coding transcripts (Figure S1C). Using a genomic construct, we confirmed that the Orb2A transcript is an independent transcript rather than a by-product of Orb2B transcription (Figure S1D). Outside the nervous system, the Orb2A transcript is also found in the male germline (Xu et al., 2012Xu S. Hafer N. Agunwamba B. Schedl P. The CPEB protein Orb2 has multiple functions during spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1003079Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There, however, the spliced, protein-coding form of Orb2A mRNA predominates (Figures 1B and S1B and S1D). Taken together, these results suggest that intron-retaining Orb2A transcript is stably expressed specifically in the adult Drosophila nervous system. Intron retention could affect Orb2A protein expression in two non-mutually exclusive ways (Figure 1A1). First, the intronic sequence could terminate translation and prevent expression of Orb2A protein. Second, an Orb2A protein could be expressed from a downstream in-frame methionine (Figure 1A1, position 708) lacking the N-terminal 108 amino acids. To determine whether the inclusion of the Orb2A-specific exon is important for long-term memory, we generated flies lacking only the Orb2A-specific exon (Δorb2:pattB-Orb2ΔAflies). The removal of this sequence did not interfere with Orb2B protein expression (Figure S1E). To determine the consequence in memory, we used male courtship suppression, in which a male fly, upon repeated exposure to an unreceptive female, suppresses its courting behavior for days (Hall, 1994Hall J.C. The mating of a fly.Science. 1994; 264: 1702-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In this paradigm Orb2ΔA flies, in contrast to wild-type flies, failed to form stable long-term memory (Figure 1C). Taken together with other studies (Keleman et al., 2007Keleman K. Krüttner S. Alenius M. Dickson B.J. Function of the Drosophila CPEB protein Orb2 in long-term courtship memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Krüttner et al., 2012Krüttner S. Stepien B. Noordermeer J.N. Mommaas M.A. Mechtler K. Dickson B.J. Keleman K.

The prevalence of unspliced transcript in the brain may partly explain the extremely low abundance of the Orb2A protein and raise the possibility that the abundance of the protein-coding, spliced transcript could be a regulatory step in Orb2A protein expression. Therefore, we sought to measure the abundance of spliced Orb2A mRNA following behavioral training. To this end, we used the associative appetitive memory paradigm for reasons elaborated below. In this paradigm, hungry flies learn to associate an odor with a food reward (sucrose), and the resulting associative memory persists for days (Krashes and Waddell, 2008Krashes M.J. Waddell S.

Acad. Sci. USA. 1983; 80: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To establish a quantitative assay that reliably measured the low-abundance spliced Orb2A mRNA in individual fly heads, we used Orb2 gene-specific primers to synthesize cDNA. In regular RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), and RNA sequencing, mature Orb2B mRNA abundance did not change significantly following behavioral training (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we measured the spliced Orb2A mRNA relative to Orb2B mRNA by RT-qPCR (Figure 2A) using exon-exon junction-specific TaqMan probes (Medhurst et al., 2000Medhurst A.D. Harrison D.C. Read S.J.

Methods. 2000; 98: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To confirm that the method indeed specifically detects spliced Orb2A mRNA, we used as controls flies that (1) lack the entire Orb2 locus, (2) lack the Orb2A specific exon, and (3) lack the probe binding site of the Orb2A/Orb2B common exon. In all cases, no measurable qPCR signal was detected. Based on these results, we proceeded to assay Orb2A mRNA levels following behavioral training.Figure 2Some but Not All Behavioral Training Increases Spliced Orb2A mRNA Level in the Adult HeadShow full caption(A) Schematic of experimental design.

Our previously published results demonstrated that histatin-1 (Hst1) promotes cell–substrate adhesion in various cell types and hinted that it could also be involved in cell–cell adhesion, a process of fundamental importance to epithelial and endothelial barriers. Here we explore the effects of Hst1 on cellular barrier function. We show that Hst1 improved endothelial barrier integrity, decreased its permeability for large molecules, and prevented translocation of bacteria across epithelial cell layers. These effects are mediated by the adherens junction protein E-cadherin (E-cad) and by the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1, as Hst1 increases the levels of zonula occludens 1 and of active E-cad. Hst1 may also promote epithelial differentiation as Hst1 induced transcription of the epithelial cell differentiation marker apolipoprotein A-IV (a downstream E-cad target). In addition, Hst1 counteracted the effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducers on the outgrowth of oral cancer cell spheroids, suggesting that Hst1 affects processes that are implicated in cancer progression.—Van Dijk, I.

Emerging evidence has shown that coagulation factors can directly mediate cancer-associated complications either by enhancing thrombus formation or by initiating various signaling events leading to metastatic cancer progression. It is well established that, apart from its distinct role in blood coagulation, coagulation factor FVIIa enhances aggressive behaviors of breast cancer cells, but the underlying signaling mechanisms still remain elusive. To this end, we investigated FVIIa's role in the migration and invasiveness of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Consistent with previous observations, we observed that FVIIa increased the migratory and invasive potential of these cells. We also provide molecular evidence that protease-activated receptor 2 activation followed by PI3K-AKT activation and GSK3β inactivation is involved in these processes and that β-catenin, a well known tumor-regulatory protein, contributes to this signaling pathway. The pivotal role of β-catenin was further indicated by the up-regulation of its downstream targets cyclin D1, c-Myc, COX-2, MMP-7, MMP-14, and Claudin-1. β-Catenin knockdown almost completely attenuated the FVIIa-induced enhancement of breast cancer migration and invasion.

Although TF-FVIIa-induced thrombin generation contributes to some of these pathophysiological processes via activation of platelets, fibrin deposition and activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated cell signaling (10.Ruf W. Mueller B. Thrombin generation and the pathogenesis of cancer.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2006; 32: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it does not account for all TF-dependent processes. Studies so far on TF-FVIIa signaling from several groups have already established that TF–FVIIa binary complex activates PAR2, which is one of the major contributors of tumor growth in breast carcinoma (11.Morris D.R.

Although it has already been established that TF-FVIIa interaction induces migratory ability of various cancer cells including breast cancer (16.Hjortoe G.M. Petersen L.C. Albrektsen T. Sorensen B.B. Norby P.L. Mandal S.K. Pendurthi U.R. Rao L.V. Tissue factor-factor VIIa-specific up-regulation of IL-8 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells is mediated by PAR-2 and results in increased cell migration.Blood. 2004; 103: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the detailed signaling mechanism involved still remains elusive. Reports also demonstrate that TF-FVIIa signaling modulates several molecules involved in adhesion, inflammation, proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis including β3 integrin, cyclin D1, interleukin-1, survivin, and vascular endothelial growth factor in various cancer cells (17.Bluff J.E. Brown N.J. Reed M.W. Staton C.A. Tissue factor, angiogenesis and tumour progression.Breast Cancer Res. 2008; 10: 204Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the prometastatic activity of cells is dependent on the extracellular proteolytic activity of FVIIa (17.Bluff J.E. Brown N.J. Reed M.W. Staton C.A. Tissue factor, angiogenesis and tumour progression.Breast Cancer Res. 2008; 10: 204Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that overexpression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor attenuates the migration of cells by inhibiting TF-FVIIa-induced signaling (18.Stavik B. Skretting G. Aasheim H.-C. Tinholt M. Zernichow L. Sletten M. Sandset P.M. Iversen N. Downregulation of TFPI in breast cancer cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation signaling and increases metastatic growth by stimulating cell motility.BMC Cancer. 2011; 11: 357Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hence, involvement of TF in the enhancement of cancer aggressiveness is likely. β-Catenin, a key member in the Wnt signaling pathway, has also been reported to be involved in multitasking from embryonic development to cancer progression (19.Huang H. He X. Wnt/β-catenin signaling: new (and old) players and new insights.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Upon activation of Wnt signaling, β-catenin accumulates in the cells and ultimately regulates differentiation and developmental processes. It also leads to several human diseases of connective tissue, epithelial tissue, bone, and cancer including breast cancer (20.Clevers H. Nusse R. Wnt/β-catenin signaling and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 1192-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3992) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that, apart from canonical Wnt signaling, multiple non-canonical pathways also result in cellular accumulation of β-catenin (21.Rao T.P. Kühl M. An updated overview on Wnt signaling pathways: a prelude for more.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1798-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In this study, we address the accumulation of β-catenin in MDA-MB-231 cells by FVIIa through PAR2 receptor activation followed by PI3K-AKT activation and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) inactivation. TF-FVIIa-induced cell signaling promotes transcriptional activation of proteins such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, COX-2, MMP-7, MMP-14, and Claudin-1 directly by manipulating the β-catenin transcriptional complex. Interestingly, these proteins have been previously designated as being downstream of the β-catenin transcriptional complex in the Wnt signaling pathway (21.Rao T.P. Kühl M. An updated overview on Wnt signaling pathways: a prelude for more.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1798-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Our findings provide strong evidence that FVIIa-mediated enhanced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells are guided by β-catenin. These results also provide supportive evidence for a novel signaling mechanism through which activation of a G protein-coupled receptor family protein, PAR2, contributes to enhanced aggressiveness of human breast cancer cells and suggest that the pathway can be targeted to achieve improved cancer therapeutics to arrest breast tumor growth and increase longevity. Enhanced migration of cancer cells plays a significant role in cancer metastasis. Among various signaling pathways contributing to the enhancement of migratory potential of cancer cells, Wnt signaling is one of the most prevalent (20.Clevers H. Nusse R. Wnt/β-catenin signaling and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 1192-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3992) Google Scholar, 22.Anastas J.N. Moon R.T. WNT signalling pathways as therapeutic targets in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that TF-FVIIa interaction leads to increased breast cancer cell migration and motility (16.Hjortoe G.M. Petersen L.C. Albrektsen T. Sorensen B.B. Norby P.L. Mandal S.K. Pendurthi U.R. Rao L.V. Tissue factor-factor VIIa-specific up-regulation of IL-8 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells is mediated by PAR-2 and results in increased cell migration.Blood. 2004; 103: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Atypical accumulation of β-catenin has been well studied in various complications of cancer, including breast cancer (23.Brennan K.R. Brown A.M. Wnt proteins in mammary development and cancer.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2004; 9: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of cytoplasmic/nuclear β-catenin accumulation has been identified in 40–60% of human breast tumors and is correlated with poor prognosis (24.Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y. Pestell R.G. Hung M.C. β-Catenin, a novel prognostic marker for breast cancer: its roles in cyclin D1 expression and cancer progression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 25.Nakopoulou L. Mylona E. Papadaki I. Kavantzas N. Giannopoulou I. Markaki S. Keramopoulos A. Study of phospho-β-catenin subcellular distribution in invasive breast carcinomas in relation to their phenotype and the clinical outcome.Mod. Pathol. 2006; 19: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). β-Catenin accumulation due to genetic mutations in Axin, APC, or β-catenin has been diagnosed in several other tumor types but is unusual in breast cancer (26.Candidus S. Bischoff P. Becker K.F. Höfler H. No evidence for mutations in the α- and β-catenin genes in human gastric and breast carcinomas.Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 49-52PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that breast cancer cells adapt an alternate or additional mechanism for β-catenin accumulation. As mentioned earlier, the basic mechanism behind breast cancer cell migration due to FVIIa has yet to be elucidated. Hence, to examine the existence of any correlation between breast cancer cell migration and FVIIa, we challenged MDA-MB-231 human metastatic breast cancer cells with FVIIa for 5 h after 2 h of serum deprivation. Interestingly, we observed a consistent time-dependent increase in the β-catenin level up to 4 h (Fig. 1, a and b). Our data also indicates an increase in the rate of nuclear β-catenin accumulation in a temporal manner (Fig. 1, c and d). Furthermore, semiquantitative PCR analysis revealed an unaltered mRNA level of β-catenin upon subsequent treatment of cells with FVIIa (Fig. 1, e and f). Fluorescence microscopic images further confirmed that β-catenin protein accumulates in a significant level inside the cell nucleus at the 4-h time point after FVIIa exposure (Fig. 1g). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that FVIIa treatment results in β-catenin accumulation in MDA-MB-231 cells without altering its expression level, and this leads to β-catenin translocation inside the cell nucleus. Previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of FVIIa-mediated signaling is dependent on PAR2 (27.Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Tissue factor- and factor X-dependent activation of protease-activated receptor 2 by factor VIIa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar); hence, we questioned whether FVIIa-modulated β-catenin accumulation in MDA-MB-231 cells is through PAR2 activation. To investigate this, we knocked down PAR2 with PAR2 siRNA and then treated cells with FVIIa and PAR2 activation peptide (PAR2AP; a positive control). The efficiency of PAR2 knockdown with PAR2 siRNA was estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 2, a and b). Interestingly, we found complete reversal of FVIIa-mediated β-catenin accumulation in PAR2-knocked down cells, strongly establishing the involvement of PAR2 in FVIIa-dependent β-catenin accumulation (Fig. 2, c and d). Next, we aimed to examine the status of β-catenin in the nucleus of PAR2-activated cells and observed a significant increment of β-catenin inside the nucleus (Fig. 2, e and f). Here we used histone H3 as a loading control for nuclear lysate and tubulin to measure the purity of nuclear isolation. Consistent with the cellular accumulation, we also observed a suppressed level of β-catenin accumulation in PAR2-deficient cells after FVIIa treatment (Fig. 2, g and h). Fluorescence microscopic images also support less accumulation of β-catenin (red) in the cell cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (green) in PAR2-silenced FVIIa-challenged cells as compared with treated cells (yellow nuclei due to green DAPI and red β-catenin co-localization) (Fig. 2i). Quantification of the intensity of β-catenin is presented in Fig. 2 for the nucleus (j) and cells (k). As a whole, the findings suggest that PAR2 activation is absolutely required for FVIIa-mediated accumulation of β-catenin in MDA-MB-231 cells. Next, we examined the involvement of TF in the context of FVIIa-mediated β-catenin accumulation. To analyze the importance of TF, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with TF-blocking antibody prior to FVIIa addition and observed complete attenuation of β-catenin accumulation (Fig. 3, a and b), which confirms that FVIIa-induced β-catenin accumulation is solely TF-dependent. To explore this further, we used another human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. We estimated β-catenin accumulation in MCF-7 cells after treatment with FVIIa for 5 h and observed no alteration in the β-catenin level (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, we found that MCF-7 cells are devoid of any TF and express lower levels of PAR2 as compared with MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3, d and e). Therefore, we transfected MCF-7 cells with TF-GFP and PAR2-YFP plasmid constructs, either one or both, followed by FVIIa treatment, and cellular β-catenin accumulation was analyzed (Fig. 3, f and g). TF-overexpressing MCF-7 cells showed increased levels of cellular β-catenin upon FVIIa treatment. Further elevation in β-catenin accumulation was observed in cells co-transfected with both TF and PAR2 followed by FVIIa treatment. Overall, the data reflect that TF is absolutely needed for FVIIa to cleave PAR2 and induce accumulation of cellular β-catenin. In addition, this result also establishes that PAR2-mediated β-catenin accumulation is not specific for MDA-MB-231 cells but also can take place in other breast cancer cells. GSK3β is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that synchronizes various cellular functions such as gene expression, apoptosis, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell proliferation (28.Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. The glamour and gloom of glycogen synthase kinase-3.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Its activity is perturbed by phosphorylation, which leads to alterations in downstream targets (28.Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. The glamour and gloom of glycogen synthase kinase-3.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). In the absence of any upstream stimulus, β-catenin is secluded in an idle state by a multimeric “destruction complex” comprising GSK3β, Axin, and APC (29.Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. The promise and perils of Wnt signaling through β-catenin.Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 30.Kimelman D. Xu W. β-Catenin destruction complex: insights and questions from a structural perspective.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). APC and Axin act as scaffolding proteins, allowing GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, which leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (30.Kimelman D. Xu W. β-Catenin destruction complex: insights and questions from a structural perspective.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). AKT, an upstream regulator of GSK3β, has been reported to play an important role in cellular migration and cancer (31.Åberg M. Siegbahn A. Tissue factor non-coagulant signaling—molecular mechanisms and biological consequences with a focus on cell migration and apoptosis.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2013; 11: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); therefore, we determined whether PAR2 activation in MDA-MB-231 cells triggers AKT activation via phosphorylation as well as GSK3β inactivation. We found that PAR2 activation by TF-FVIIa or PAR2AP leads to increased phosphorylation of both AKT (Thr-308 and Ser-473) and GSK3β (Ser-9), which remain unaffected upon PAR2 knockdown (Fig. 4, a–f). We also observed that FVIIa or activation peptide not only cause AKT/GSK3β phosphorylation but also decrease phosphorylation of β-catenin, which leads to its subsequent accumulation inside the cell (Fig. 4, a and b). To further elucidate the importance of AKT, we blocked the PI3K/AKT pathway using two different chemical inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, separately followed by ligand treatment. As expected, inhibition of PI3K dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β and increased β-catenin phosphorylation, resulting in less β-catenin accumulation due to enhanced degradation of β-catenin (Fig. 4, g and h). We further confirmed the involvement of AKT by silencing AKT1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4i) followed by ligand addition (Fig. 4, j and k). Results suggest complete reduction of β-catenin accumulation in AKT1-silenced cells. These findings clearly indicate that β-catenin accumulation due to PAR2 activation occurs through PI3K/AKT pathway followed by GSK3β inactivation. The nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in the presence/absence of LY294002 in control and PAR2-activated cells was also evident in fluorescent microscopic images (Fig. 5a). Nuclei with DAPI stain (green) revealed no β-catenin accumulation in LY294002-treated or control cells, whereas FVIIa- or PAR2AP -treated cells with yellow nuclei (due to co-localization of β-catenin and DAPI) indicate significant β-catenin accumulation inside the nucleus. LY294002 addition also reduced nuclear β-catenin accumulation even after FVIIa or PAR2AP treatment.

Neoplasia. 2010; 15: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). To study the fate of nuclearly translocated β-catenin, a TCF/LEF luciferase assay was performed to measure the transcriptional efficiency of β-catenin. We observed a significant increase of luciferase activity in FVIIa- and PAR2AP-treated cells (Fig. 6a). This luciferase activity was abolished by introducing PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) (Fig. 6b), which is consistent with our previous observations. To further establish the role of TF and PAR2 in the context of β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation, we overexpressed PAR2-YFP and TF-GFP in MCF-7 cells and performed the TCF-LEF luciferase assay (Fig. 6c). We observed that activation of PAR2 also leads to β-catenin accumulation followed by transcriptional activation in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the expression levels of downstream genes responsive to the β-catenin transcriptional complex. Our semiquantitative and real-time PCR analysis revealed a significant rise in the mRNA levels of cyclin D1, c-Myc, COX-2, MMP-7, MMP-14, and Claudin-1 during FVIIa and PAR2AP treatment. To establish the specific role of β-catenin, we knocked down β-catenin by β-catenin siRNA and observed complete attenuation of the above mentioned transcripts in PAR2-activated cells, indicating that the elevated levels of these transcripts by PAR2 activation are mediated via β-catenin (Fig. 6, d and e). Consistent with the transcriptional status, an increase in cyclin D1, c-Myc, COX-2, MMP-7, MMP-14, and Claudin-1 protein levels was also observed during PAR2 activation that remained unaltered by β-catenin knockdown or inhibition of PI3K (Fig. 6, f and g). These findings clearly indicate that β-catenin translocation inside the nucleus leads to the formation of active β-catenin transcriptional complex, which further up-regulates several downstream metastatic proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that PAR2-mediated signaling induces metastatic behavior of breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo (17.Bluff J.E. Brown N.J. Reed M.W. Staton C.A.

Therefore, to elucidate the signaling molecules involved in this transition, we assessed the metastatic potential by migration (Fig. 7, a–d) and invasion assays (Fig. 7, e and f). FVIIa- and PAR2AP-induced enhancement of MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion was perturbed by either inhibiting PI3K or silencing β-catenin, suggesting the active participation of the AKT-β-catenin axis in PAR2-dependent cancer metastasis. As a whole, these data clearly demonstrate that PAR2 activation by TF-FVIIa or PAR2AP leads to increased migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through the interplay of AKT, β-catenin, and related molecules. Our present in vitro study indicates that an intrinsic correlation exists between β-catenin accumulation and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells in response to PAR2 activation. Henceforth, to compare the level of β-catenin and its downstream proteins in human breast cancer tissue with respect to normal tissue, samples were collected according to human ethical regulations. Immunohistochemistry data depicts a significant level of β-catenin accumulation in cancer tissue as compare with normal tissue (Fig. 8a). Consistent with immunohistochemistry, Western blot data also revealed an elevated level of β-catenin and its downstream targets in breast cancer tissue (Fig. 8b). Interestingly, we also observed a considerable increment of the TF level in tumor tissue samples. To further analyze the expression profile of β-catenin downstream targets, we also performed real-time PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from cancer and normal breast tissues (Fig. 8c). Consistent with our previous observations, we found up-regulation of β-catenin target gene expression at the mRNA level. In conclusion, the enhanced pattern of si"

All GH31 enzymes share a consensus sequence harboring an aspartic acid residue as a catalytic nucleophile. Moreover, crystallographic structural analysis of isomaltase predicts that another aspartic acid residue functions as a proton donor in hydrolysis.

We expressed these SI variants in COS-1 cells and analyzed their structural, transport, and functional characteristics. All of the mutants revealed expression levels and maturation rates comparable with those of the wild-type species and the corresponding nonmutated subunits were functionally active. Thereby we determined rate and substrate specificity for each single subunit without influence from the other subunit. This approach provides a model for functional analysis of the single subunits within a multidomain protein, achieved without the necessity to express the individual subunits separately. Of note, we also found that glucose product inhibition regulates the activities of both SI subunits. We experimentally confirmed the catalytic function of the predicted proton donor residues, and sequence analysis suggested that these residues are located in a consensus region in many GH31 family members.

Within SI, SUC is the major α-1,2-glucosidase of the intestinal lumen (25Gray G.M. Lally B.C. Conklin K.A. Action of intestinal sucrase-isomaltase and its free monomers on an α-limit dextrin.J. Biol.

Both subunits together contribute to 60- 80% of maltose hydrolysis in the intestine (17Quezada-Calvillo R. Sim L. Ao Z. Hamaker B.R. Quaroni A. Brayer G.D. Sterchi E.E. Robayo-Torres C.C. Rose D.R.

Based on sequence similarities, Asp505 in IM and Asp1394 in SUC within the conserved motif of DGLWIDMNE (underlined) constitute the catalytic nucleophile residues in the active site (27Sim L. Willemsma C. Mohan S. Naim H.Y. Pinto B.M. Rose D.R. Structural basis for substrate selectivity in human maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase N-terminal domains.J. Biol.

By resolving the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of SI, Asp604 in the HWLGDN motif has been predicted to function as the proton donor in the IM active site cleft for the acid/base catalysis (27Sim L. Willemsma C. Mohan S. Naim H.Y. Pinto B.M. Rose D.R. Structural basis for substrate selectivity in human maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase N-terminal domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of the SUC domain is not resolved yet; however, based on its strong sequence homologies to the IM subunit, a potential proton donor residue in SUC can be predicted by in silico analysis. Characterization of the function of a single active site in either SUC or IM requires specific inactivation of the other subunit. Given the striking structural homology between SUC and IM and their conserved active sites, the inhibition of the catalytic activity of one subunit by a particular substance may also inhibit the other subunit (29Amiri M. Naim H.Y. Miglustat-induced intestinal carbohydrate malabsorption is due to the inhibition of α-glucosidases, but not β-galactosidases.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2012; 35: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the functional capacities of SUC and IM by expression of the individual subunits is potentially possible. Nevertheless, such an approach ignores the complexity of the domain-domain interactions of SUC and IM during folding and acquisition of functional maturity and therefore does not reflect the native structure of the complete and intact SI (30Jacob R. Pürschel B. Naim H.Y. Sucrase is an intramolecular chaperone located at the C-terminal end of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32141-32148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the implication of the motif HWLGDN in the functional capacities of IM and SUC with particular emphasis on the two aspartic acid residues predicted to participate in the α-glucosidase activity as proton donors. The study utilized site-directed mutagenesis of the individual aspartate residues. The generated mutants have provided a model to study enzymatic characteristics of IM and SUC without the functional overlapping of the other subunit. The nucleophilic catalytic residue of human SI is located in the DGLWIDMNE sequence, which is conserved among all members of the GH31 family of enzymes (12Ernst H.A. Lo Leggio L. Willemoës M.

By resolving the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of human SI, Asp604 in the HWLGDN motif is predicted to function as the proton donor for the acid-base catalysis in IM (27Sim L.

To experimentally validate the contribution of this residue to the sugar hydrolysis, Asp604 was exchanged by mutagenesis PCR to amino acid residues that have similar or different physicochemical characteristics as presented in Fig. 2. SUC reveals a striking sequence homology to IM; however, its crystal structure is not defined yet. Therefore, based on amino acid sequence alignment, we predicted Asp1500 in the consensus sequence of HWLGDN in SUC to function as the proton donor residue for hydrolysis (Fig. 2). This site was subjected to mutagenesis similar to that of IM. As a control, Asp505 in IM or Asp1394 in SUC within the conserved DGLWIDMNE catalytic site was mutated to glutamic acid.Figure 2Localization of catalytic aspartic acid residues within SI and overview of generated mutants.

As shown in Fig. 3, properly processed wild-type SI appears mainly as a complex N- and O-glycosylated 245-kDa endo H-resistant form (SIc) (32Jacob R. Zimmer K.P. Schmitz J. Naim H.Y. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency arising from cleavage and secretion of a mutant form of the enzyme.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This form represents the mature and functionally active SI that is properly processed in the Golgi apparatus (1Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J.

Expression and intracellular transport of microvillus membrane hydrolases in human intestinal epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Analysis of the SI mutants revealed essentially a similar electrophoretic pattern as that of the wild-type protein with a comparable ratio of SIc to SIh (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the biosynthesis, processing, and trafficking of the SI mutants were not altered because of the introduced mutations in the HWLGDN or DGLWIDMNE motifs. Similar relative protein expression levels of the mutants compared with SI wild type (Table 1) provide further evidence that the SI mutants are not subjected to any trafficking hindrances or proteolysis. Additionally, similar biosynthetic patterns strongly suggest that causal alterations on the protein folding of the mutants may have not occurred. Nevertheless, the possibility of partial misfolding cannot be completely excluded, because the exchanged amino acids in the SI mutants differ from aspartate in their physiochemical characteristics. We first addressed the folding of the SI-D604E and SI-D1500E mutants by comparing their tryptic digestion profiles to that of the wild-type SI, a procedure that has been frequently utilized to investigate the folding of the SI protein (30Jacob R. Pürschel B. Naim H.Y. Sucrase is an intramolecular chaperone located at the C-terminal end of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex.J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14393-14399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is based on unique structural properties of SI that harbors 149 potential trypsin cleavage sites in its primary structure, and yet only one of these sites becomes exposed and cleaved by trypsin in the intestinal lumen when SI is properly folded (36Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud Se Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Protein identification and analysis tools on the ExPASy server.in: Walker J.M. In The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). The cleavage of properly folded SI generates the two subunits, SUC and IM, which maintain their association through noncovalent interactions (32Jacob R. Zimmer K.P. Schmitz J. Naim H.Y. Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency arising from cleavage and secretion of a mutant form of the enzyme.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of the SI mutants to trypsin can be assessed in immunoblots by antibodies specific to IM or SUC (Fig. 4). Given the large number of potential trypsin sites in the linear SI sequence, a different tryptic pattern would be anticipated in the case of an altered folding of SI. As shown in Fig. 4, mutations in the predicted proton donor residue Asp1500 of SUC did not affect the tryptic pattern of the SI mutants, neither in the IM nor in the SUC domains compatible with proper folding of these mutants. Likewise the D505E and the D1394E mutations in the nucleophilic residue did not induce alterations in the tryptic pattern of the SI mutants. However, SI mutants in Asp604, the predicted protein donor in the IM subunit, revealed different sensitivities toward trypsin. Although the folding of the SUC domain in all the Asp604 mutations did not change, the IM domain was affected except for the D604E mutation. These folding alterations in IM are likely not substantial, because the trafficking and maturation of the corresponding SI mutants were comparable with that of wild-type SI (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, we took into consideration these folding variations when analyzing the functional capacities of the SI mutants in which Asp604 has been mutagenized.Table 1Relative protein expression of SI mutants compared to the wild type SIMutantRelative protein expression% WT SISI-D505E96 ± 15SI-D604E108 ± 7SI-D604N84 ± 8SI-D604S91 ± 12SI-D604Y89 ± 15SI-D1394E86 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Tryptic structural analysis to determine the folding of SI catalytic site variants. Immunoprecipitants of wild-type SI or its variants prepared from transiently expressing COS-1 cells were subjected to 500 BAEE units of trypsin and detected by Western blotting in comparison with the untreated controls. Immunoblotting (IB) was either performed with the HBB2/614/88 antibody to detect the SUC subunit or the HBB3/705/60 antibody to detect the IM subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having analyzed the SI mutants and determined that their maturation, post-translational processing, and trafficking were comparable with those of wild-type SI, we assayed the functional capacities of the mutants toward sucrose, maltose, and isomaltulose to determine the α-1,2-, α-1,4-, and α-1,6-hydrolytic activities, respectively. For this purpose, the mutants or wild-type SI were expressed in COS-1 cells, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to enzyme activity measurements. Fig. 5 shows that all mutant variants of SUC and IM at the potential proton donor residue revealed drastic reductions or even complete loss of enzyme activities of the targeted subunit. Thus the mutations targeting the Asp1500 residue of SUC including D1500E, D1500N, D1500S, and D1500Y became inactive toward α-1,2-glucosidic linkages, the SUC preferred substrate configuration. The IM activity on the other hand was completely retained, and in comparison with wild-type SI, a slight to moderate reduction in the α-1,4-hydrolytic activity of the SUC-based mutants was observed. This latter reduction strongly suggests that SUC contributes to the overall digestive capacity of maltase-glucoamylase in vivo. Likewise, mutations of the Asp604 residue in IM entirely abolished the IM activity, reduced maltose hydrolysis, but did not lead to a loss or reduction in SUC (Fig. 5). The SI mutants that targeted Asp505 in IM and Asp1394 in SUC, both in the conserved well established DGLWIDMNE catalytic site, also revealed similar activity profiles as the SI mutants of HWLGDN. Taken together, these results support the view that predicted proton donor residues in HWLGDN are implicated in the enzyme function of SUC and IM. We have aligned the amino acid sequence of 59 different members of the GH31 family and compared them for the stretch containing the proton donor residue in the human SI subunits. The data illustrate a conserved region surrounding the target aspartic acid residue (Fig. 6), suggesting a consensus motif in this family, most likely with a conserved function for the aspartic acid residue in its center as a proton donor for carbohydrate hydrolysis. As mentioned earlier, SI shares the α-1,4-glucosidic activity in the intestine with its homologue disaccharidase MGAM. Because of its higher abundance in the intestine than MGAM, SI is assumed to be responsible for 60–80% of the maltase activity in the intestine (26Quezada-Calvillo R. Robayo-Torres C.C. Ao Z.

Clinical aspects and treatment of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency.J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2012; 55: S7-S13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, the contribution of each SI subunit to this activity is not defined yet. Based on the data presented in Fig. 5, single active SUC and IM respectively express ∼80 and ∼50% of the total maltase activity of the wild-type SI. Surprisingly, the sum of the SUC and IM maltase activities exceeds that recorded for the wild-type nonmutagenized SI species. Likewise, the hydrolysis of the sucrose or isomaltose substrates by the individual subunits SUC or IM respectively increases in the absence of an active form of the other subunit. We have therefore addressed the elevated catalytic capacity of the mutagenized SI species by analyzing their kinetic parameters in comparison with wild-type SI in hydrolyzing maltose. SI-D1500Y variant representing active IM and SI-D604Y variant representing active SUC species of SI were used for this purpose. Based on the Michaelis-Menten equation, the theoretical maximum velocity (Vmax) calculated for SUC is comparable with that of wild type, whereas IM presents almost 60% of the wild-type Vmax in hydrolyzing maltose (Fig. 7). The affinity of the active sites to maltose is higher in intact SI as implied by a lower Km value, which is expected because of the presence of two active subunits in the wild-type protein. However, upon increasing substrate concentration, the rate of maltase activities is reduced, which indicates a gradual inhibitory function in correlation with maltose concentration. Different species show unique thresholds in responding to the inhibitory effect, among which the wild type is the most sensitive one. Analyzing the kinetics of maltose digestion of wild-type SI, SUC, and IM constructs with the Hill equation does not reveal any negative cooperativity between the functional subunits of SI (data not shown). The observed inhibition cannot be exclusively considered as substrate inhibition, because the sensitivity of the tested constructs for the inhibitory effect appears at different concentrations of the substrate; i.e. >4 mm for wild type, >10 mm for IM (SI-D1500Y), and >20 mm for SUC (SI-D604Y). Therefore we evaluated a potential role for product inhibition in regulating SI catalytic function. For this purpose human intestinal brush border membrane preparations containing the fully active in vivo forms of SI and sucrose or isomaltose substrates were used to determine Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the presence or absence of excess glucose. As presented in Fig. 8, both SUC and IM activities are subjected to a functional inhibition in the presence of 0.7 mm glucose. Reduction in the Vmax value combined with an increased Km value indicates a mixed type of inhibition of SI activities in the presence of glucose, i.e. a combination of competitive and uncompetitive inhibitions. Competitive inhibition is compatible with the affinity of glucose to the active sites of SUC and IM. This type of inhibition is likely to occur at high glucose concentrations. The uncompetitive inhibition, on the other hand, is an allosteric inhibition of the catalysis by affecting the conversion of enzyme-substrate complex to the enzyme and the product. In total, the combination of these inhibitions reduces the catalytic efficiency of sucrase and isomaltase by almost 20% in comparison with the control sample (Fig. 8). In view of these data, the increased maltase capacity of IM or SUC variants in comparison with wild-type SI as presented in Fig. 5 can be explained by the microenvironmental concentrations of glucose. Appearance of functional inhibition is linked to a threshold concentration of glucose, which is achieved at similar activity levels for all constructs (Fig. 7). In the wild-type enzyme, both subunits are active, thus increasing the concentration of liberated glucose in the microenvironment with a higher rate in comparison with the variants with a single active subunit. IM or SUC constructs, on the other hand, reach this level of activity at higher substrate concentrations. Therefore collection of maltase activities from IM and SUC in separate reactions results in a higher value than that of wild-type SI. The inhibitory characteristics of glucose on SI mimic the function of N-butyl deoxynojirimycin, an iminosugar analogue of d-glucose on intestinal SI (29Amiri M. Naim H.Y. Miglustat-induced intestinal carbohydrate malabsorption is due to the inhibition of α-glucosidases, but not β-galactosidases.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2012; 35: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Amiri M. Naim H.Y. Long term differential consequences of miglustat therapy on intestinal disaccharidases.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2014; 37: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In fact, we have previously reported that this iminosugar can inhibit intestinal α-glucosidases including SI in a mixed inhibitory manner (29Amiri M. Naim H.Y. Miglustat-induced intestinal carbohydrate malabsorption is due to the inhibition of α-glucosidases, but not β-galactosidases.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2012; 35: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Amiri M. Naim H.Y. Long term differential consequences of miglustat therapy on intestinal disaccharidases.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2014; 37: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It can be postulated that N-butyl deoxynojirimycin shares the same allosteric binding site on SI with glucose. In a physiological context, product inhibition or negative feedback is a known regulatory mechanism for many metabolic enzymes (40Liu X. Kim C.S. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Dual mechanisms for glucose 6-phosphate inhibition of human brain hexokinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31155-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 41Eggert M.W. Byrne M.E. Chambers R.P. Impact of high pyruvate concentration on kinetics of rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase.Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2011; 165: 676-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The inhibitory function of glucose on the SI activity is likely a regulatory mechanism in the body to control excess release of glucose in the intestine and so modulate the glycemic level in the blood. The average luminal concentration of glucose in the small intestine is estimated to range between 0.4 and 24 mm (42Ferraris R.P. Yasharpour S. Lloyd K.C. Mirzayan R. Diamond J.M. Luminal glucose concentrations in the gut under normal conditions.Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G822-G837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of experimental limitations, the amount of glucose applied in this study belongs to the lowest levels of this range. Therefore it is plausible to propose a more effective role for this inhibitory function when the luminal concentration of the glucose is elevated by consumption of carbohydrate-rich diet. This study demonstrates the implication of the sequence motif HWLGDN in SUC and IM in the functional capacities of the two enzymes, emphasizing the role of the two aspartic acid residues predicted to participate in the α-glucosidase activity as potential proton donor residues. Three-dimensional resolution of the IM subunit suggested a role of aspartate within the HWLGDN motif in the catalytic activity of IM (27Sim L. Willemsma C. Mohan S. Naim H.Y. Pinto B.M. Rose D.R. Structural basis for substrate selectivity in human maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase N-terminal domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Additionally, sequence alignments illustrate that the stretch HWLGDN containing the predicted proton donor residue is also found in SUC and conserved among members of the GH31 family as a consensus motif (43Henrissat B. A classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on amino acid sequence similarities.Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). The current study provides direct experimental evidence on the role of this residue in the context of the HWLGDN motif and the SI function. The exchange of the predicted aspartate residues in IM or SUC (Asp1500 and Asp604) affects neither the intracellular processing of the SI variants nor the activity of the nonmutated subunit. Therefore this approach provides a model for functional analysis of the single subunits within a multidomain protein, achieved without the necessity to express the individual subunits separately (27Sim L. Willemsma C. Mohan S. Naim H.Y. Pinto B.M. Rose D.R. Structural basis for substrate selectivity in human maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase N-terminal domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Individual expression of the subunits abolishes their potential interaction and does not eventually reflect the actual digestive capacities and the contribution of each subunit to the functionality of the other. This is borne out by the fact that these two strikingly homologous subunits are assembled as pseudo-heterodimers within the SI protein (30Jacob R. Pürschel B. Naim H.Y. Sucrase is an intramolecular chaperone located at the C-terminal end of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32141-32148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The current study clearly validates participation of the predicted proton donor residue in IM and its counterpart in SUC in the overall enzyme function of SI. The (G/F/Y)(L/I/V/M/F)WXDM(N/S/A)E pattern, including the nucleophilic aspartic acid, is a well known characteristic of the GH31 family of enzymes (consensus motif PS00129, PROSITE). Our data unequivocally demonstrate that (T/L/G/S/I/A)(G/Y)DXXX(W/Y/F) is a conserved motif in the GH31 family of enzymes that likely contains the proton donor aspartic acid for the catalysis in all of the members of this family. However, the latter pattern cannot be assigned as a consensus pattern unique to the GH31 family because it is also present in some other classes of proteins (e.g. kinases, helicases, cytochromes, etc.) as analyzed by ScanProsite online tool (44de Castro E.

Pharmacological blocking of EphA4 has been suggested to be a therapeutic strategy for these disorders. Therefore, the aim of our study was to generate potent and selective Nanobodies against the ligand-binding domain of the human EphA4 receptor.

Using Alphascreen technology, we found that both Nanobodies displaced all known EphA4-binding ephrins from the receptor. Furthermore, Nb 39 and Nb 53 inhibited ephrin-induced phosphorylation of the EphA4 protein in a cell-based assay. Finally, in a cortical neuron primary culture, both Nanobodies were able to inhibit endogenous EphA4-mediated growth-cone collapse induced by ephrin-B3. Our results demonstrate the potential of Nanobodies to target the ligand-binding domain of EphA4.

To this end, using deletion mutants, we mapped the Pex19 regions required for peroxisome biogenesis in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Surprisingly, import-competent peroxisomes still formed when Pex19 domains previously believed to be required for biogenesis were deleted, although the peroxisome size was larger than that in wild-type cells.

Peroxisomes are single membrane-enclosed organelles that are vital in the maintenance of cellular metabolic homeostasis (1Subramani S. Components involved in peroxisome import, biogenesis, proliferation, turnover, and movement.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In response to the metabolic needs of the cell, peroxisomes can alter their enzyme content and modulate their number and size (2Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. Biochemistry of mammalian peroxisomes revisited.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in peroxisome assembly, division, and inheritance are known as peroxins and encoded by PEX genes. Over a dozen peroxins conserved from yeasts to mammals are essential for normal human development (3Schrader M. Fahimi H.D. The peroxisome: still a mysterious organelle.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 421-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A failure in peroxisome biogenesis can have detrimental, even lethal consequences in humans as exemplified by the Zellweger syndrome spectrum, a series of genetic disorders leading to craniofacial and ocular abnormalities (4Klouwer F.C.

Future improvements in the quality of life for those affected by peroxisomal metabolism defects rely on a more thorough understanding of peroxisome biogenesis, turnover, and homeostasis.

Agrawal G. Subramani S. Phosphorylation-dependent Pex11p and Fis1p interaction regulates peroxisome division.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Delille H.K.

These observations point to Pex3 and Pex19 as versatile, multifunctional proteins. The multiple roles of Pex19 raise the question as to how these functions correlate with the structural organization of the domains of this protein. In this study, we have identified the critical regions of Pex19 required for peroxisome biogenesis by segregating its N- and C-terminal domains. Several different constructions of the N- or C-terminal domains of Pex19 were expressed in Pichia pastoris and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and biochemical studies to characterize their individual contributions in promoting peroxisome biogenesis and proper PMP localization. The physical segregation of the Pex3- and mPTS-binding domains of Pex19 has provided novel insights into the role of Pex19. Our findings demonstrate novel functions of Pex25 in peroxisome biogenesis and successfully integrate the classical role of Pex25 in promoting cell growth by regulating peroxisome size and number. To study the essential structural domains of Pex19 necessary for supporting peroxisome biogenesis, we created several N- and C-terminal deletion constructs. To achieve proper folding, the length of the constructs was determined using several open source domain prediction tools (DomPred, DoBo, DOMpro, and Globplot 2) (36Bryson K. Cozzetto D. Jones D.T.

The N-terminal constructs (defined as Pex19 variants with deletions from the C terminus), are termed NTCs, and the C-terminal constructs (Pex19 variants with deletions from the N terminus), are termed CTCs. All Pex19 constructs were expressed from the inducible alcohol oxidase promoter (PAOX) in pex19Δ cells. FLAG and c-myc tags were attached to all the CTCs and NTCs, respectively. The bidirectional deletions that preserved the central domains had the c-myc tag at the N-terminal end (Fig. 1A). The start (ATG) and stop codons (TAA) were present at the 5′ and the 3′ ends of the PEX19 ORFs for all constructs (Fig. 1A). Full-length Pex19 with an N-terminal c-myc tag and another one with a C-terminal FLAG tag were used as wild-type (WT) controls. P. pastoris is a methylotropic yeast that utilizes methanol as a sole carbon and energy source (1Subramani S. Components involved in peroxisome import, biogenesis, proliferation, turnover, and movement.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 40Veenhuis M. Van Dijken J.P. Harder W. The significance of peroxisomes in the metabolism of one-carbon compounds in yeasts.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 1-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Primarily localized to peroxisomes, alcohol oxidase catalyzes a series of reduction-oxidation reactions in which methanol and its subsequent derivatives are oxidized and energy is stored in the form of NADH (41Sibirny A.A. Titorenko V.I. Gonchar M.V. Ubiyvovk V.M. Ksheminskaya G.P. Vitvitskaya O.P. Genetic control of methanol utilization in yeasts.J. Basic Microbiol. 1988; 28: 293-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, under methanol conditions, to meet cellular growth and maintenance demands, peroxisomes proliferate to metabolize methanol. Mutants such as pex19Δ, which lack Pex19 completely and are deficient in peroxisome assembly, do not grow in methanol. For this reason, strains expressing various NTC and CTC variants of Pex19 were examined for their growth characteristics in methanol medium for up to 80 h. Fig. 1, B and C, show the constructs used and the growth characteristics for only the Pex19 deletion mutants that supported peroxisome biogenesis in methanol medium, in comparison with the pex19Δ control. As expected, the pex19Δ strain showed no significant growth in methanol medium. The WT PPY12 cells and the strains expressing full-length Pex19 with either c-myc or FLAG tags exhibited similar growth profiles and normal peroxisome size (Figs. 1C and 2, A and B), suggesting that the fusion of these tags to Pex19 did not affect its function. Strains expressing the Pex19 NTCs, Pex19(1–180), Pex19(1–177), Pex19(1–170), Pex19(1–160), and the CTCs Pex19(68–300) and Pex19(89–300) displayed logarithmic growth in methanol media after an initial lag of nearly 14–24 h. However, the strain expressing the Pex19(1–150) showed a longer delay of nearly 30 h (Fig. 1C). The bidirectional deletion mutants, Pex19(89–230) and Pex19(89–220), grew very poorly with more than a 40–50-h delay (Table 1). This suggests that although specific regions in the N- and C-terminal domains of Pex19 are dispensable, a common central domain likely contains the minimum structural requirement for supporting peroxisome biogenesis. From these results, we identified Pex19(1–150) as containing the minimal region of Pex19 that supports peroxisome biogenesis. In addition, the longest constructs, Pex19(1–180) and Pex19(68–300) grew better than other mutants, whereas the shortest construct, Pex19(1–150) was the slowest with more than a 30-h delay (Fig. 1C). The common overlapping region between the functional Pex19 mutants was aa 89–150 (Fig. 1B), although this particular construct, Pex19(89–150), was non-functional when expressed alone (Table 1).Table 1Summary of Pex19 N- and C-terminal constructsConstructsPeroxisome reintroductionGrowth (methanol)Peroxisome sizeWTMyc-Pex19 (aa 1–300)+++++NormalPex19-FLAG (aa 1–300)+++++Normalpex19Δ−−No peroxisomesN-terminal constructs (NTCs)aa 1–180++++Enlargedaa 1–177+++Enlargedaa 1–170+++Enlargedaa 1–160+++Enlargedaa 1–150++Enlargedaa 1–146−−No peroxisomesaa 1–140−−No peroxisomesaa 1–128−−No peroxisomesaa 1–110−−No peroxisomesaa 1–88−−No peroxisomesaa 1–67−−No peroxisomesC-terminal constructs (CTCs)aa 68–300+++Enlargedaa 89–300+++Enlargedaa 101–300−−No peroxisomesaa 111–300−−No peroxisomesaa 121–300−−No peroxisomesaa 125–300−−No peroxisomesaa 131–300−−No peroxisomesaa 147–300−−No peroxisomesaa 151–300−−No peroxisomesaa 178–300−−No peroxisomesBi-directional deletionsaa 89–230+/−+/−Enlargedaa 89–220+/−+/−Enlargedaa 89–210−−No peroxisomesaa 89–200−−No peroxisomesaa 89–190−−No peroxisomesaa 89–180−−No peroxisomesaa 89–170−−No peroxisomesaa 89–160−−No peroxisomesaa 89–150−−No peroxisomes Open table in a new tab We monitored peroxisome formation and the localization of PMPs in our Pex19 mutants for over 70 h under peroxisome proliferation conditions. Previously, we observed that Pex11-CFP was relocated to the de novo formed peroxisomes when the PEX19 gene was reintroduced and expressed from the inducible alcohol oxidase promoter in pex19Δ cells (11Agrawal G. Joshi S. Subramani S. Cell-free sorting of peroxisomal membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 9113-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, Pex19 deletion mutants were also co-expressed with Pex11-CFP and mCherry-Sec61, an ER-marker, in pex19Δ cells. Pex11-CFP was expressed from the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PGAP) promoter, whereas the mCherry-Sec61 was expressed from its endogenous promoter. Under peroxisome proliferation conditions, in pex19Δ cells expressing the full-length Pex19 with either c-myc or FLAG tag, peroxisomes appeared within 4 h as characteristic punctate structures labeled with Pex11-CFP, depicting proper peroxisomal localization of this PMP (Fig. 2, A and B). This also affirmed that the fusion of a c-myc or FLAG tag to Pex19 did not affect normal peroxisome formation. All the Pex19 constructs that supported growth on methanol medium also formed peroxisomes. However, the peroxisomes formation was delayed by nearly 14–24 h and peroxisome size was remarkably larger as compared with that in WT cells (Figs. 2, C, D, and F). In addition, as expected the peroxisomes formed in the NTC and CTC variants were import competent, as seen from the significant co-localization of GFP-SKL (an artificial peroxisomal matrix protein marker) and Pex3-RFP (Fig. 2G). These large peroxisomal structures are reminiscent of a Δpex11 phenotype, suggesting that peroxisomal division may be impaired in these strains (42Erdmann R. Blobel G.

Redox-sensitive homodimerization of Pex11p: a proposed mechanism to regulate peroxisomal division.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, strains expressing the other Pex19 deletion mutants did not grow in methanol medium, had no detectable peroxisomal structures, and appeared similar to the pex19Δ cells (Fig. 2E). We identified six NTCs and eight CTCs that were non-functional and did not support peroxisome biogenesis (Table 1). We investigated whether the pairwise co-expression of any two of these non-functional constructs would restore peroxisome biogenesis. We constructed strains co-expressing various combinations of N- and C-terminal constructs, and analyzed them for growth on methanol medium and observed the localization of Pex11-CFP. However, none of the combinations disrupting the central domain from aa 89–150, including the two longest N- and C-terminal constructs (Pex19(1–140) with Pex19(101–300)), restored peroxisome biogenesis in these strains (Fig. 3A). The most pronounced growth advantage was observed when the C-terminal constructs were co-expressed with Pex19(1–177) (Fig. 3B), although the growth was not completely restored to the same level seen for the WT cells. Notably, the onset of the exponential phase was less visibly affected, regardless of the combination of constructs. In addition, the delay in peroxisome formation was reduced to 9–12 h as compared with 20–28 h, and the size of peroxisomes was also restored very close to that of the WT cells (Fig. 3A). Thus, by co-expressing the N-terminal Pex3-binding domain with the C-terminal mPTS-binding domain of Pex19, a synergistic effect on peroxisome biogenesis was observed, as long as the essential central domain between aa 89 and 150 was intact. Previous studies on the role of Pex19 as a chaperone and co-receptor for PMP insertion into the peroxisome membrane suggested that Pex19 should simultaneously interact with Pex3 and insert the bound PMP in the peroxisomal membrane and thus, have non-overlapping binding sites for both Pex3 and PMPs. To verify this, we analyzed the functional NTCs and CTCs for their interactions with Pex3 and other PMPs. Several co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) were performed to determine whether the functional Pex19 constructs maintained interactions with Pex3, Pex10, and Pex11. Pex3 was chosen due to the proposed importance of Pex19-Pex3 interactions for peroxisome biogenesis, whereas Pex10 and Pex11 were chosen due to their different binding sites on Pex19; Pex11 is suggested to bind within the internal domain, between aa 135 and 150, whereas Pex10 binds at the C-terminal mPTS-binding domain, between aa 180 and 300 (26Shibata H.

The ankyrin (ANK) repeats in the glutaminases were acquired early in their evolution. To obtain information on ANK folding, we solved two high-resolution structures of the ANK repeat-containing C termini of both kidney-type glutaminase (KGA) and GLS2 isoforms (glutaminase B and liver-type glutaminase). We found that the glutaminase ANK repeats form unique intramolecular contacts through two highly conserved motifs; curiously, this arrangement occludes a region usually involved in ANK-mediated protein-protein interactions. We also solved the crystal structure of full-length KGA and present a small-angle X-ray scattering model for full-length GLS2. These structures explain these proteins' compromised ability to assemble into catalytically active supra-tetrameric filaments, as previously shown for GAC.

https://openalex.org/W2616564106,"Migration of ideas comes not only from permanent migrants but also from temporary migrants, such as international students, conference attendees, and visitors at foreign laboratories and centers. Given that collaborations generally arise from personal connections ([ 1 ][1]), it is hard to imagine internationally coauthored research expanding absent researcher mobility. Ties between U.S. and Chinese researchers exemplify how migration advances knowledge and benefits source and destination country. The United States is the top destination of Chinese international students and postdocs, and China is the top source of foreign students in the United States, and they contribute to U.S. scientific productivity ([ 2 ][2]). Those who return to China tend to outperform other Chinese researchers in terms of citations in international scientific journals ([ 3 ][3]). Homophily in citations suggests that a paper with authors from two countries is likely to spread new ideas or findings more rapidly across borders than if the paper's authors were from the same country. Having a foreign collaborator with a network of researchers in another country usually attracts overseas attention to research. In scientific work, China and the United States are each others' biggest partners: 16% of U.S. international collaborations are with China, and 48% of China's international collaborations are with the United States ([ 4 ][4]). U.S. corporations conduct research and patent inventions in China, and Chinese firms buy U.S. start-ups and patent in the United States. About 15% of author names on papers written at U.S.-based institutions are Chinese, whose first names (e.g., Xu rather than David) identify them as born overseas ([ 5 ][5]). Connections between migrants and natives on papers, patents, and citations does not directly measure the migration of ideas, which requires latent semantic analysis of the content of the underlying documents. But network links between collaborators from different countries establish a prima facie case for policies that treat foreign-born students and migrant researchers as valuable contributors to the United States and home-country scientific and economic progress and as possible future U.S. citizens as well.

Ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans have increased in recent decades, particularly in coastal areas. This has been associated with increased algal blooms and, where these blooms include algal species that produce biotoxins, the potential for increases in cases of paralytic and diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. Gobler et al. used high-resolution records of sea surface temperature from 1982 to 2016 and temperature-dependent growth rates of two toxic algal species to create models of harmful algal blooms. These models were validated in areas of the North Atlantic by observations in other studies of increased bloom frequency and range that matched predicted locations.

They intend to do it through funding basic research and addressing gaps in biomedical technology. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropy launched by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, drew attention with its stated goal of helping to “cure, manage, or treat all diseases” by the end of the century. They intend to do it through funding basic research and addressing gaps in biomedical technology. When pediatrician Priscilla Chan and her husband Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook announced their intention to found a research-funding philanthropy that will try “to cure, prevent or manage all diseases by the end of this century,” many observers were skeptical. The goal is massive. After all, the US federal government invested more than 30 billion dollars in the National Institutes of Health in the 2016 fiscal year alone, and even though the Zuckerbergs have pledged to eventually donate 99% of their fortune to the philanthropy, the newly launched Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)’s science budget so far is only 3 billion. However, CZI’s science strategy—at least in its first decade of existence—will focus not on diseases themselves but on developing technologies and tools that biomedical scientists can use to explore a wide range of questions. “We have to recognize that there are a lot of other funding agencies out there—that we are 1% of the size of the NIH budget, smaller than Howard Hughes [Medical Institute]—and so we need to think about what we can do that’s unique and impactful,” says CZI President Cori Bargmann. “By developing tools and technologies, we can raise everyone’s game and advance all of science,” she added. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is not the first private philanthropic LLC to tackle basic research, but they hope to leverage their Silicon Valley connections to tackle technology problems in biomedicine that other organizations haven’t. “We’ve heard a number of philanthropists struggling with the issue of how to help with this [data analysis and data management],” says MIT professor and president of the Science Philanthropy Alliance Marc Kastner. The Zuckerbergs consulted with the Science Philanthropy Alliance during the earliest stages of planning the CZI, but neither Kastner nor the alliance is formally CZI-affiliated. “Part of the problem is just the salary structure because these kinds of folks [computer analysts] can get such high salaries in industry,” he continues. “The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative seems to really be tackling this head-on by hiring really outstanding computer scientists and developers and letting them address some of the problems that the scientific community has.” Rather than letting software engineers choose the problems, the CZI has turned to researchers themselves. CZI leadership met with several non-CZI-affiliated researchers in a series of workshops, the most recent of which was hosted at Stanford, and asked: how can we help biologists analyze their data? In these conversations, two areas stood out as places where improved computational tools could make a world of difference: single-cell data (such as transcriptome data that track changes in cells over time) and next-generation microscopy (where rendering an image or video requires computing thousands upon thousands of three-dimensional data points). Both are areas where the amount of data being collected is growing exponentially but the analytical tools are not. “When I was a graduate student, I would do an experiment, and it would take me a month,” says Bargmann. “And I would look at the results for ten minutes, I would think about it, and then I would spend another month doing the next experiment. Now it’s the exact opposite. Someone in my lab can take a movie in ten minutes that takes them the next month to analyze. So it’s a tremendous challenge to understand the sort of dense signals we can generate from the cutting-edge microscopes and from movies and four-dimensional datasets.” Distributing the analytical tools needed to make sense of these datasets may prove even more vital than distributing the lab equipment. Some programs, like Janelia Farm’s Advanced Imaging Center, follow a model in which biologists can visit the center, collect the data they need over the course of about a week, and then return their home institution to analyze the data there. If this model became more widespread, it would allow researchers at smaller institutions to ask questions that can only be answered with advanced lab equipment. However, researchers at those institutions would still need tools to find signals in their data. That’s where the Silicon Valley and its fondness for computing clouds comes in. “Part of our job is to make it easy for any one scientist to use the giant volume of data with a collection of cloud tools that are simple yet powerful,” says CZI’s chief technical officer and former Amazon executive Brian Pinkerton. “A lot of these [scientific] institutions have data centers of their own or they rely on government data centers … Public clouds are now where it’s easy to get cheap computing, so it’s a lot better to have your data on those than locked up on a data server in the closet.” Data sharing is a core value for the organization. The CZI not only encourages authors to publish in open-access journals and make datasets publicly available online, they go a step further and ask that all code developed in support of CZI-funded studies be published on public code depositories such as GitHub. Many of the CZI’s initial efforts focus on The Human Cell Atlas Project. The goal is to build a publicly available database that will organize molecular data gathered by hundreds of labs into a coherent map of “every cell type in the human body.” The Atlas will likely include gene expression data, microscope images, and interaction networks that show how cell types affect each other, among other types of data. CZI is not the only organization involved in the Cell Atlas Project but, rather, is part of a scientific network that also includes the Wellcome Trust’s Sanger Institute, as well as organizing committee members from 17 institutions in 10 different countries. “We want to create a catalogue of all the cell types in the human body in both health and disease. We think that’s going to be a really fundamental resource not just for basic science and physiology but a powerful new resource for development of therapies for a variety of human disease,” says Stanford biophysicist Stephen Quake. Quake is also co-president, along with UCSF’s Joe DeRisi, of the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub, a biomedical research center that Chan and Zuckerberg have established in San Francisco. The CZ BioHub is a non-profit organization, separate from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC, but the two organizations share some common goals: both are focused on developing technology platforms for enabling basic research, with the long-term goal of addressing all human diseases. Quake says that there will probably be a draft version of the Cell Atlas database in about five years but notes that molecular sequencing technology is changing rapidly and that ideas about what constitutes a “cell type” vary widely. (In fact, one of the ice-breakers at the Stanford Cell Atlas meeting was Quake asking all of the attendees to write their estimate of the number of cell types in the human body on their name tags. The range was “huge,” Quake says.) However, genomics researchers largely agree that a comprehensive database of cell types is needed. “Nearly everything that we’ve done in genomics/‘omics’ to date using tissues from human or really any multicellular organism has been confounded by cellular heterogeneity … Until we are able to obtain single-cell resolution, we’ll be fundamentally stuck,” genomicist Jay Shendure of University of Washington wrote in an email to Cell. Shendure attended the Stanford Cell Atlas Meeting but is not affiliated with the CZI or the CZ BioHub. “Comprehensive cell atlases of human as well as model organisms will be foundational resources, much like the reference human genome is, for understanding normal physiology and development, as well as what goes wrong in disease,” he wrote. Shendure also mentions that one potential pitfall ahead of the Cell Atlas project is the temptation to publish a draft atlas as quickly as possible at the expense of a well-thought-out framework for the data. He writes, “I hope that there is a phase that supports the development and integration of diverse technologies that support this long-term goal, rather than prematurely turning this into a data production project.” However, some observers are still skeptical. Shobita Parthasarathy, a professor of public policy at University of Michigan who analyzes large-scale biotech projects, notes that Human Cell Atlas is very similar to the Human Genome Project and that the CZI’s emphasis on collaboration closely mirrors the collaborative spirit of the Obama administration’s Cancer Moonshot program. “I’d argue that the Cancer Moonshot was, in fact, more innovative because it really explicitly addressed questions around data sharing and intellectual property, and the CZI doesn’t, as far as I can tell from their public statements,” she says. “So it’s not clear to me what exactly is so new.” Another common criticism of the CZI is that the leadership may be underestimating the difficulty of translating and distributing the benefits gained from biotech projects. Today, many diseases go untreated, not because we lack the scientific knowledge to treat them but because of a lack of economic incentives for drug manufacturers or because of difficulty convincing patients to opt in to new treatments. So far, the science arm of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative seems to be focused exclusively on basic biology research. Many, however, are welcoming the CZI’s emphasis on basic research. “I am very enthusiastic about CZI’s emerging plan to take a lead role in the development of a[n] open-access cloud-based database and associated informatics tools that will enable researchers from all over the world to get access to the Human Cell Atlas data and make fundamental discoveries about human biology,” NIH director Francis Collins wrote in an email to Cell. “While basic science is also the cornerstone of NIH’s diverse portfolio of biomedical research, our resources are currently insufficient to pursue all of the opportunities that are emerging at this remarkable time,” Collins added. The leadership of CZI itself remains optimistic that they can make an impact where few other groups have in biotechnology. “We are in a really strong position to bring modern computer science and artificial intelligence and machine learning to biology on a larger scale than has been possible,” says Bargmann. “We have the connections in the community. We have the local expertise. This is an opportunity that has not yet reached its full development in the existing system. The algorithms that Amazon uses to sell you books are more sophisticated than the algorithms we have for searching the literature. We have an opportunity here to help turn that around.” Pinkerton, the chief technical officer, agrees, saying “We have some goals, we’re relentlessly attacking those goals, we want to make a big impact. We’re not going to be satisfied with doing something small.”"

Mother's directions must be followed, even in the earliest stage of embryo development. The maternal genome is read up until a phase called the maternal-to-zygotic transition. At this point, which corresponds to the two-cell stage in mice, the embryonic genome takes over. Using single-cell analyses, Huang et al. examined the function of the maternal factor Stella. Widespread transcription changes result when Stella is eliminated. In particular, endogenous retroviruses such as MuERV-L that are normally active in the early embryo display impaired expression when Stella is knocked down in vivo. Hence, the normal activity of ancient viruses must be properly turned on for transitioning from maternal to zygotic control in development.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to affect 20% of the world's population. NAFLD begins with an abnormal buildup of fat in the liver that is “clinically silent.” In a subset of individuals, NAFLD progresses to liver inflammation, cirrhosis, and cancer. Identifying which individuals will progress is a major goal of current research. Stender et al. take a step toward this goal by studying gene-environment interactions. They find that high BMI (body mass index), a well-known risk factor for NAFLD, amplifies the effects of certain genetic risk factors. Obese individuals carrying a specific allele of the PNPLA3 gene, for example, have nearly a sixfold greater risk of developing cirrhosis than obese individuals carrying a different allele.

The benefits of authentic research experiences for undergraduate students are well documented, but how do research advisors benefit from having undergraduate students in their lab? Hayward et al. interviewed 30 research advisors at various career stages about their motivation for supporting undergraduate research. Responses indicated that a blend of instrumental and intrinsic motivation influenced most advisors, whereas a small group of advisors, all in the early stages of their careers, reported only instrumental motivation. These differences in motivations likely affect the way that advisors work with students and may serve as the starting point for designing new methods for training, and retaining, high-quality research advisors.
