https://openalex.org/W2094136190,"Our research efforts with durum wheat have led to the development of the SDD concept. Its application makes possible crop yield estimates from remotely acquired canopy temperatures and auxiliary air temperature measurements obtained during the period from head emergence to the cessation of head growth. Canopy albedo measurements appear adequate to delineate this critical period, making the technique potentially adaptable to predictions of crop yields by remote-sensing. The trifactor nomograms produced from combinations of the linear regression equations also suggest that the SDD concept may be used for scheduling irrigations by remote-sensing."
https://openalex.org/W1989957679,"Valuable paleoclimatic information can be gained by studying the distribution of melt layers in deep ice cores. A profile representing the percentage of ice in melt layers in a core drilled from the Devon Island ice cap plotted against both time and depth shows that the ice cap has experienced a period of very warm summers since 1925, following a period of colder summers between about 1600 and 1925. The earlier period was coldest between 1680 and 1730. There is a high correlation between the melt-layer ice percentage and the mass balance of the ice cap. The relation between them suggests that the ice cap mass balance was zero (accumulation equaled ablation) during the colder period but is negative in the present warmer one. There is no firm evidence of a present cooling trend in the summer conditions on the ice cap. A comparison with the melt-layer ice percentage in cores from the other major Canadian Arctic ice caps shows that the variation of summer conditions found for the Devon Island ice cap is representative for all the large ice caps for about 90 percent of the time. There is also a good correlation between melt-layer percentage and summer sea-ice conditions in the archipelago. This suggests that the search for the northwest passage was influenced by changing climate, with the 19th-century peak of the often tragic exploration coinciding with a period of very cold summers."

The per capita ratio of the weight of carbon from net wood burned to the weight of carbon from fossil fuel burned in this century has been at least 0.1 and may have approached 1.0."
https://openalex.org/W2071983183,"Historical temperature data suggest that the deep circulation of the eastern Indian Ocean is a system separate from that in the west, with its water being supplied directly from the south. If so, then circulation theory would require that the northward flow take the form of a narrow western boundary current along the Ninetyeast Ridge. Recent observations demonstrate, the existence of this current, and indicate a volume transport for it of about 4 x 10(6) cubic meters per second."

https://openalex.org/W1974426518,"The argument of the values of reprocessing spent reactor fuels versus the risks of plutonium proliferation is detailed. A brief history of reprocessing efforts and a brief description of the purex process is presented. The economic advisability of reprocessing is questioned. It is argued that technology used for reprocessing present spent fuels would not be applicable to reprocessing breeder reactor fuel; therefore, reprocessing present fuels could not be considered valuable experience for reprocessing breeder fuels.
