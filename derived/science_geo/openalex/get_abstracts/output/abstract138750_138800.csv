https://openalex.org/W2111650618,"Ligand-dependent activation of transcription by nuclear receptors (NRs) is mediated by interactions with coactivators. Receptor agonists promote coactivator binding, and antagonists block coactivator binding. Here we report the crystal structure of the human estrogen receptor α (hERα) ligand-binding domain (LBD) bound to both the agonist diethylstilbestrol (DES) and a peptide derived from the NR box II region of the coactivator GRIP1 and the crystal structure of the hERα LBD bound to the selective antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). In the DES-LBD-peptide complex, the peptide binds as a short α helix to a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the LBD. In the OHT-LBD complex, helix 12 occludes the coactivator recognition groove by mimicking the interactions of the NR box peptide with the LBD. These structures reveal the two distinct mechanisms by which structural features of OHT promote this “autoinhibitory” helix 12 conformation."

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) treatment induced a caspase-mediated cleavage of cytosolic, inactive p22 BID at internal Asp sites to yield a major p15 and minor p13 and p11 fragments. p15 BID translocates to mitochondria as an integral membrane protein. p15 BID within cytosol targeted normal mitochondria and released cytochrome c. Immunodepletion of p15 BID prevents cytochrome c release. In vivo, anti-Fas Ab results in the appearance of p15 BID in the cytosol of hepatocytes which translocates to mitochondria where it releases cytochrome c. Addition of activated caspase-8 to normal cytosol generates p15 BID which is also required in this system for release of cytochrome c. In the presence of BCL-XL/BCL-2, TNFα still induced BID cleavage and p15 BID became an integral mitochondrial membrane protein. However, BCL-XL/BCL-2 prevented the release of cytochromec, yet other aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction still transpired and cells died nonetheless. Thus, while BID appears to be required for the release of cytochrome c in the TNF death pathway, the release of cytochrome c may not be required for cell death. “BH3 domain only” members of the BCL-2 family including the pro-apoptotic molecule BID represent candidates to connect with proximal signal transduction.

Programmed cell death or apoptosis is critical for the successful crafting of multiple lineages, the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis and a non-inflammatory response to toxic stimuli (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). A distinct genetic pathway apparently shared by all multicellular organisms governs apoptosis. The BCL-2 family of proteins constitutes a decisional checkpoint within the common portion of this pathway. Full members of the BCL-2 family share homology in four conserved domains designated BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The multidimensional NMR and x-ray crystallographic structure of a BCL-XL monomer indicated that BH1, 2, and 3 domains represent α helices in close proximity which create a hydrophobic pocket presumably involved in interactions with other BCL-2 family members (3Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the BCL-2 family possesses pro-apoptotic (BAX, BAK, and BOK) as well as anti-apoptotic (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1, and A1) molecules (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The ratio of anti- to pro-apoptotic molecules such as BCL-2/BAX determines the response to a death signal (4Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). A striking characteristic of many BCL-2 family members is their propensity to form homo- and heterodimers (5Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl.

The NMR analysis of a BCL-XL/BAK BH3 peptide complex revealed both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the BCL-XL pocket and a BH3 amphipathic α-helical peptide from BAK (7Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) argues that the BH3 domain serves as a minimal “death domain” critical for both dimerization and killing. A divergent subset of the BCL-2 family possesses only sequence homology to the BH3 amphipathic α helical domain. These “BH3 domain only” members include the mammalian BID, BAD, BIK, BIM, BLK, and HRK and EGL-1 of Caenorhabditis elegans. Of note, all of these molecules are pro-apoptotic lending credence to the thesis that BH3 represents a minimal death domain (10Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Where examined these BH3 domain only molecules are capable of heterodimerizing with classic BCL-2 family members. Mutagenesis of the BH3 domain of BID (10Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and BAD (17Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) indicated that BH3 was essential for these interactions as well as the killing activity. Several of these molecules, BID and BAD lack the typical hydrophobic COOH-terminal sequence that is found in most BCL-2 family members, which for BCL-2 has been shown to function as a signal anchor segment required for its targeting mitochondria (18Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this BID and BAD have cytosolic as well as membrane based localizations (10Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 19Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). These characteristics suggested that BID and BAD may represent death ligands, sensors that receive death signals in the cytosol and translocate to membranes where they interact with membrane bound, classic BCL-2 members which serve as “receptors” (10Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). This was supported by the demonstration that cells in response to the survival factor interleukin-3, inactivated BAD by phosphorylation. This has the dual impact of dictating BAD's location as well as its binding partners. Phosphorylated BAD is sequestered in the cytosol bound to 14-3-3; whereas, only the active non-phosphorylated BAD heterodimerized with BCL-XL or BCL-2 at membrane sites to prevent cell death (19Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Moreover, the demonstration that egl-1 regulates all the developmental deaths in C. elegans and maps upstream to ced-9 (16Conradt B. Horvitz R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) argues that BH3 domain only molecules are evolutionarily conserved components of a central death pathway. This constellation suggests that such molecules are candidates to interconnect proximal signal transduction pathways with the distal death effector mechanisms based at intracellular membranes. Recently, BAX despite possessing a hydrophobic COOH terminus has been noted in the soluble fraction of cells as well as mitochondrial membranes (20Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Induced BAX expression (22Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) or the enforced dimerization of BAX (21Gross A. Jockel J. Wei C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) results in a downstream program of mitochondrial dysfunction as well as caspase activation. A physiologic death stimulus, the withdrawal of interleukin-3, results in the translocation of monomeric BAX from the cytosol to the mitochondria where it is a homodimerized, integral membrane protein (21Gross A. Jockel J. Wei C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Perhaps all pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members will prove to have inactive forms which undergo conformational changes as part of their activation. The best characterized signal transduction pathways that mediate apoptosis are the cell surface receptors of the TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CHX, cycloheximide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HM, heavy membrane; LM, light membrane; Ab, antibody; rBID, recombinant BID; DiOC6((3), 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocynine iodide. family, including CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) and CD120a (p55 TNF-R1) (23Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 24Nagata S. Curr.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Engagement of Fas/TNF-R1 receptor leads to formation of a protein complex known as the DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) (26Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 27Boldin M.P. Goncharov M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

This complex consists of Fas/TNF-R1, FADD (MORT1), and pro-caspase-8 (MACH/FLICE/Mch5). Once caspase-8 is recruited, it is processed and released from the complex in active form to activate the downstream “effector” caspases (26Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 29Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The caspase family has been divided into three groups based upon sequence homology and substrate specificity using a positional scanning substrate combinatorial library (31Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstorm P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The specificity of caspases 2, 3, and 7 (DEXD) suggests they function at the effector phase of apoptosis. In contrast, the optimal sequence for caspases 6, 8, and 9 ((I/L/V)EXD) resembles activation sites in the effector caspase proenzymes, arguing they represent “initiator” caspases. Wang and colleagues (32Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar) described a cell-free system of apoptosis, in which S100 extracts of untreated HeLa cells induced the activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation upon addition of dATP. Further purification of the cytosol identified cytochrome c, which was released from the mitochondria during hypotonic lysis of the cells. Apaf-1, a mammalian homolog of CED-4, was a second factor isolated and required for caspase activation (33Zou H. Henzel W.J. Lui X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and caspase-9 form a complex that initiates a downstream caspase cascade (34Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). In addition, it was observed that when Xenopus egg cytosol was incubated with isolated mitochondria, cytochrome c was released, leading to the activation of caspases and nuclear apoptosis (35Kluck R.M. Boss-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). The phenomena of cytochrome c redistribution from mitochondria to cytosol was also reported to occur in intact cells during apoptosis (36Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanism responsible for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol during apoptosis remained unknown. Cells were treated with recombinant mouse TNF-α (1 ng/ml; Sigma) and cycloheximide (1 μg/ml; Sigma), and lysed at the indicated times in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, added at a 1:100 dilution). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride (Bio-Rad) membrane. The membrane was first blocked with 5% milk for 1 h, followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h each, and finally developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). A rabbit anti-mouse BID polyclonal antibody (10Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) was used at 1:1000 dilution, anti-cytochromec monoclonal antibody (PharMingen) was used at 1:500 dilution, and anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Caltag) were used at 1:2000 dilution. Viability was determined at designated time points by propidium iodide dye exclusion. For mitochondrial potential and intracellular ROS production, 5 × 105 cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocynine iodide (DiOC6(3), 40 nm) or hydroethidine (2 μm; Molecular Probes) followed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson) analysis. Murine BID was cloned into pGEX-KG. Glutathione S-transferase-BID fusion protein was induced in BL21DE3 by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol in phosphate-buffered saline) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, added at a 1:100 dilution), and sonicated. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed with buffer and treated with 10 units of thrombin per original liter. Cleaved BID was eluted from beads and the cleavage reaction was terminated by adding 50 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. To remove the glutathione S-transferase protein and incompletely cleaved fusion proteins, the preparation was further purified on a Mono-Q column and the proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient. Recombinant BID (5 μg) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the soluble fraction of FL5.12 cells pretreated with TNF/CHX for 5 h. The proteins were lysed, separated by 16% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride (Bio-Rad) membrane. The membrane was first stained with Coomassie Blue and then destained with 80% methanol. The desired protein bands were cut out and subjected to NH2-terminal Edman degradation (37Tempst P. Geromanos S. Elicone C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Methods: Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 248-261Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). FL5.12 cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in isotonic HIM buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mmEGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, added at a 1:100 dilution), and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) at setting 6.5 for 10 s. Nuclei and unbroken cells were separated at 120 ×g for 5 min as the low speed pellet (P1). This supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect the heavy membrane pellet (HM). This supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to yield the light membrane pellet (LM) and final soluble fraction (S). For subcellular fractionation of mouse hepatocytes, cells were homogenized and separated by differential centrifugation as described below for preparation of mitochondria from mouse liver. For isolation of intact mitochondria, the liver from one mouse was minced and washed in ice-cold HIM buffer (supplemented with 2 mg/ml de-lipidated bovine serum albumin). The minced liver (∼2 g wet weight) was gently homogenized in 6 ml of HIM buffer in a 15-ml Wheaten Dounce glass homogenizer using two complete up and down cycles of a glass “B”-type pestle. The homogenate was diluted 6-fold with HIM buffer and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 600 × g in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant was recovered, centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet resuspended in twice the original homogenate volume in HIM buffer without bovine serum albumin. After centrifuging at 600 × g, mitochondria were recovered from the supernatant by centrifuging at 7,000 ×g for 15 min. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of MRM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm sodium succinate, 0.08 mm ADP, 2 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5) at a concentration of 1 mg of mitochondrial protein per ml, and adjusted to 1 mm dithiothreitol just before use (38McBride H.M. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For a standard import reaction, 60 μl of the soluble fraction of FL5.12 cells or hepatocytes was incubated with 10 μl of mitochondria in MRM buffer (1 mg of protein/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. This import reaction was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. Both the pellet and the supernatant were analyzed by Western blot. For alkali extraction, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in freshly prepared 0.1m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), and incubated for 30 min on ice. The membranes were subsequently pelleted in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 75,000 × g for 10 min and both the pellet and the supernatant were analyzed by Western blot. For the BID depletion experiments, the soluble fraction of FL5.12 cells was incubated with anti-BID Ab for 1.5 h on ice. The Ab complexes were captured with protein A beads for 1 h and removed by centrifugation, and the procedure was repeated. The resulting BID-depleted supernatant was used in the protein import reaction. For the recombinant caspase experiments, the soluble fraction of FL5.12 cells was incubated with recombinant caspase-8 or -3 (1 μg/60 μl; PharMingen) at 37 °C for 1 h and then used in the protein import reaction. 6–8-week-old (20 g) C57Bl6 mice were injected intravenously with 5 μg of purified hamster monoclonal antibody to mouse Fas (JO2; PharMingen) in 100 μl of 0.9% (w/v) saline. Animals were sacrificed at the indicated times. As part of a survey of the effects of death stimuli on the subcellular localization and post-translational modification of BCL-2 family members, we examined the response of the early hematopoietic cell line FL5.12 to TNFα. Most non-transformed cells are resistant to TNF unless treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor (e.g.cycloheximide) which presumably eliminates a short half-life survival molecule (39Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Treatment of FL5.12 with a combination of TNFα/cycloheximide (TNF/CHX) resulted in a rapid reduction in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) as assessed by the cationic, lipophilic dye dihexyloxacarbocynine iodide (DiOC6(3)) (Fig.1 A). The production of ROS such as superoxide as measured by hydroethidine and cell death as determined by propidium iodide dye exclusion, followed closely (Fig.1 A). Both the mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death were blocked by pretreatment with the broad caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates prepared from FL5.12 cells treated with TNF/CHX revealed that the intracellular pro-apoptotic molecule p22 BID was cleaved to yield a major p15 and minor p13 and p11 fragments (Fig. 1 B). The 2B4 T cell hybridoma which is also killed by TNF and displays mitochondrial dysfunction (not shown) also demonstrated the p15 fragment (Fig. 1 B). Pretreatment of cells with 50 μm zVAD-fmk markedly inhibited BID cleavage in FL5.12 cells and to a large extent in 2B4 cells (Fig.1 B). To determine the cleavage sites in BID, recombinant murine BID (rBID) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the S100 fraction of TNF/CHX-treated FL5.12 cells, S100(TNF) (Fig. 2 A). Following the reaction the mixture was size fractionated by PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The S100(TNF) caused complete cleavage of p22 rBID (lane 3) which was inhibited by the inclusion of 50 μm zVAD-fmk in the reaction mixture (lane 4). p22 rBID cleavage generated a major p15 and minor p13 fragment. Incubation of rBID with either recombinant active caspase-8 or caspase-3 also generated the p15 fragment (not shown). NH2-terminal peptide sequence analysis of these fragments revealed that p22 rBID was cleaved between amino acids Asp59 and Gly60 to generate p15 and between amino acids Asp75 and Ser76 to generate the p13 fragment (Fig. 2 B). These fragments comigrated precisely with the upper two fragments detected in TNF-treated cells (Fig.1 B and data not shown), arguing that intracellular BID is also cleaved at these sites. To determine whether the third cleavage site responsible for the less abundant p11 seen in FL5.12 cells (Fig. 1 B) was the predicted Asp98 residue we utilized a D98A mutant.35S-Labeled in vitro translated BID and BID(D98A) were incubated with S100(TNF) from FL5.12 cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cleavage of wild type BID generated the three cleavage products seen in vivo, whereas cleavage of BID(D89A) generated only the p15 and p13 fragments (not shown). Taken together, BID is cleaved after three Asp residues located at positions 59, 75, or 98 generating three fragments (p15, p13, and p11) (Fig.2 B). To assess the location of intracellular BID, we disrupted FL5.12 cells using isotonic lysis conditions which kept mitochondria intact with a retained outer membrane. A substantial portion of p22 BID was consistently in the soluble S100 fraction (S) representing the cytosol as well as the mitochondria-enriched HM fraction as documented by the mitochondrial markers (cytochrome c, intermembrane space; cytochrome c oxidase, inner membrane) (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–4). The low speed pellet (P1) comprised of residual whole cells, nuclei, and some mitochondria, also displays BID. At 5 h following TNF/CHX treatment the p15 BID fragment was often still present in the cytosol but was predominantly in the mitochondrial HM fraction (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–8). By 7 h p15 BID was almost exclusively in the mitochondria. The p13 and p11 minor fragments were associated exclusively with the mitochondrial fraction (not shown). In addition, following the TNF/CHX death stimulus, most of the cytochrome c was released from the mitochondrial HM fraction, found either in the S100 fraction or presumably as part of membrane fragments in the LM fraction (Fig. 3 A, middle panel). To assess the membrane association of p22 BID and its cleavage products, the mitochondria (HM fraction) from TNF/CHX-treated FL5.12 cells were incubated in hypotonic buffer, alkaline buffer, or in high salt. The mitochondrial pellet (P) was separated from the supernatant (S) by high speed centrifugation. p22 BID was sensitive to all three treatments (>50% found in the supernatant (Fig. 3 B)); whereas, p15, p13, and p11 were markedly resistant to these treatments (Fig. 3 B) indicative of an integral membrane position. To assess whether the p15 BID fragment can target mitochondria, the cytosol of FL5.12 cells 5 h after TNF/CHX treatment, S100(TNF) (Fig. 3 C, lane 2) was incubated with purified, intact mitochondria from mouse liver (Fig. 3 C, lane 1) in a standard protein import reaction. At 37 °C >90% of p15 BID but <10% of p22 BID targeted mitochondria (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, the targeted p15 but not p22 was resistant to alkali extraction (lanes 9–12), indicating that p15 BID was now an integral membrane protein. Targeting of p15 BID did not occur at 4 °C (lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, the inclusion of zVAD-fmk in the reaction did not inhibit targeting of pre-existing p15 (lanes 7 and 8) arguing that this event does not require an additional caspase cleavage at the mitochondria. The cleavage of cytosolic BID by TNF-induced caspases and the targeting of p15 BID to the mitochondria represents an attractive correlate with the mitochondrial dysfunction/cytochrome c release. We next wished to determine if the targeting of p15 to mitochondria is in and of itself required for the release of cytochrome c. When the cytosol of TNF/CHX-treated cells, S100(TNF), was incubated with mouse liver mitochondria for 30 min at 37 °C, p15 BID-targeted mitochondria and up to ∼50% of cytochrome c was released into the supernatant (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1and 2). p15 BID was resistant to alkali extraction whereas as expected cytochrome c was not (lanes 3 and4). Strikingly, depletion of p15 BID from the S100(TNF) by an anti-BID Ab which eliminated p15 targeting also prevented the release of cytochrome c (lanes 5–8). Depleting BAX from the activated S100 fraction by using a polyclonal anti-BAX Ab (651) did not inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria (data not shown). We next asked whether BID is also a required substrate that must be cleaved by caspases in order for cytochrome c to be released. In this paradigm, a soluble fraction (S100) from untreated FL5.12 cells was preincubated with recombinant caspase-8 or caspase-3 (rCas-8 and -3) and then added to mouse liver mitochondria. When either the S100 fraction or recombinant caspases were incubated separately with mitochondria there was no release of cytochrome c (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and3, and data not shown). However, addition of active rCas-8 to the S100-generated p15 BID (lanes 6 and 7), while addition of rCas-3 generated both p15 and p11 BID (lanes 10 and 11). In both instances, the BID fragments targeted mitochondria as integral membrane proteins (lanes 8and 9, and data not shown) and ∼50% of cytochromec was released (lower panel, lanes 6, 7, 10, and11). Addition of zVAD-fmk after BID cleavage, prior to exposing mitochondria to S100(rCas-8) did not inhibit the release of cytochrome c (data not shown). Once again, immunodepletion of p15 BID from the S100(rCas-8) prevented the release of cytochromec when this activated cytosol was added to mitochondria (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and 4). To assess the role of BCL-XL, BCL-2 in the TNF death pathway, we asked whether these anti-apoptotic molecules would protect FL5.12 cells from TNF/CHX, whether p15 BID"

By gene-targeted mutation, we show that XRCC4 deficiency in primary murine cells causes growth defects, premature senescence, IR sensitivity, and inability to support V(D)J recombination. In mice, XRCC4 deficiency causes late embryonic lethality accompanied by defective lymphogenesis and defective neurogenesis manifested by extensive apoptotic death of newly generated postmitotic neuronal cells. We find similar neuronal developmental defects in embryos that lack DNA ligase IV, an XRCC4-associated protein. Our findings demonstrate that differentiating lymphocytes and neurons strictly require the XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV end-joining proteins and point to the general stage of neuronal development in which these proteins are necessary."

Here, we report the crystal structure of the heme domain of endothelial NOS in tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B)-free and -bound forms at 1.95 Å and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively. In both structures a zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to pairs of symmetry-related cysteine residues at the dimer interface. The phylogenetically conserved Cys-(X)4-Cys motif and its strategic location establish a structural role for the metal center in maintaining the integrity of the H4B-binding site. The unexpected recognition of the substrate, L-arginine, at the H4B site indicates that this site is poised to stabilize a positively charged pterin ring and suggests a model involving a cationic pterin radical in the catalytic cycle."

Here, we report the generation of an expression library containing a large and diverse repertoire of mouse olfactory receptor sequences in the transmembrane II–VII region. From this library, 80 chimeric receptors were tested against 26 odorants after transfection into HEK-293 cells. Three receptors were identified to respond to micromolecular concentrations of carvone, (−) citronellal, and limonene, respectively. We also found that the mouse I7 receptor, unlike the rat I7 receptor, prefers heptanal instead of octanal, as a result of a single valine-to-isoleucine substitution. This finding represents the beginning of a molecular understanding of odorant recognition. The identification, on a large scale, of cognate receptor–odorant interactions should provide insight into olfactory coding mechanisms."

Upon ligand binding, the GR is activated and translocates into the nucleus where it transmits the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids. Here, we describe the ligand-independent activation of GR by the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) agonists, salbutamol and salmeterol, in primary human lung fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated expression of GR and the β2-AR by fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. Treatment of the cells with the β2-AR agonists, salbutamol or salmeterol, resulted in translocation of GR into the nucleus beginning at 30 min, as shown by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting of cytosolic and nuclear cell extracts. In comparison, activation of GR induced by the corticosteroids dexamethasone and fluticasone occurred at the same time after treatment (30 min) but resulted in a more complete depletion of GR from the cytosolic compartment. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that nuclear GR, activated by both β2-AR agonists and glucocorticoids, actively bound to the GR consensus sequence (GR element). Functional activation of the GR was confirmed by a Luciferase reporter gene assay, using a GR driven promoter fragment from the p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene. The effects of the β2-AR agonists, salbutamol and salmeterol, were dependent upon binding to the β2-AR, because blocking of β2-AR with propranolol abrogated GR activation.

O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). All members of this superfamily share essential structural and functional features, which are an amino-terminal transactivation domain, a central zinc-finger DNA binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain. Unliganded GR is present in the cytosol and is associated with a large multiprotein complex of chaperones, including heat shock proteins Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp56 (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev.

Ligand binding induces a conformational change of the complex leading to dissociation of the chaperones. Activated GR then translocates to the nucleus and binds to its specific target DNA sequences termed the glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) (5Mendel D.B. Bodwell J.E. Gametchu B. Harrison R.W.

The β2-AR is highly expressed in fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells (USMCs), and epithelial cells of the human lung (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 323-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Barnes P.J. Basbaum C.B. Nadel J.A. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1982; 299: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Signal transduction by β2-AR occurs upon ligand binding via activation of adenylate cyclase, which increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 323-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition to the short term effects of β2-AR agonists, such as VSMC relaxation (17Davis C. Kannan M.S. Jones T.R. Daniel E.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 53: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), considerable evidence suggests that β2-AR agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo (11Pauwels R.A. Löfdahl C.-G. Postma D.S. Tattersfield A.E. O'Byrne P. Barnes P.J. Ullman A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 18Whelan C.J. Johnson M. Vardey C.J.

Because activation of GR is essentially responsible for the majority of anti-inflammatory effects, we thus addressed the question of whether β2-agonists could lead to activation of GR in a ligand-independent manner.In the present study, cultures of primary human lung fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells were used to demonstrate that both glucocorticoids and β2-AR agonists activate the human GR. We show that the kinetics of GR activation are similar for both substances, leading to rapid nuclear translocation of functional activated GR after 30 min. Compared with β2-AR agonists, the endogenous ligands for GR, glucocorticoids, led to complete depletion of GR from the cytosolic compartment. Activation of GR by β2-AR agonists was mediated by the interaction of the drugs with the β2-AR because a β2-AR antagonist, propranolol, abolished the observed activation of GR in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly to the effect of the drugs on GR activation, addition of dibutyryl-cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP activated the GR, suggesting that the action of β2-AR on GR activation involves the adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway. Thus, our results suggest that ligand-independent activation of GR by β2-AR agonists may be an essential mechanism contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects evoked by β2-agonists.DISCUSSIONThe mechanism of GR activation in a ligand-independent manner has been the subject of several recent investigations (27Calleja C. Pascussi J.M. Mani J.C. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate ligand-independent activation of GR by two β2-agonists, salmeterol and salbutamol. Both drugs were potent activators of GR in the absence of agonistic ligands as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, EMSA, and reporter gene assays. GR was rapidly depleted from the cytosol of primary human lung fibroblasts and VSMC and translocated into the nucleus. Translocated GR was functional as it bound to its specific DNA recognition sequence, GRE, and also activated a GR-inducible luciferase reporter gene assay, p21(WAF1/CIP1). Finally, GR activation by β2-agonists was dependent upon their binding to β2-AR, reasoning that downstream signaling initiated by β2-AR agonist/β2-AR interaction is responsible for the observed GR activation.Activation of GR results in altered transcription of several cytokine genes involved in the inflammatory process leading to their repression or activation (6Gronemeyer H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2524-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Karin M. Yang-Yen H.-F. Chambard J.-C. Deng T. Saatcioglu F. Eur. J. Clin.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Our findings are especially important to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of drug action in the treatment of asthma. Here, glucocorticoids and β2-AR agonists are the most effective drugs in the treatment of this disease (9Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 10Barnes P.J. Greening A.P. Crompton G.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152 (suppl.): 125-142Crossref Google Scholar). Clinical studies on asthmatic individuals suggested that the administration of salmeterol, in combination with glucocorticoids, resulted in an improved symptom control being more effective than increasing the dose of the glucocorticoid alone (11Pauwels R.A. Löfdahl C.-G. Postma D.S. Tattersfield A.E. O'Byrne P. Barnes P.J. Ullman A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 12Greening A.P. Ind P.W. Northfield M.

Care Med. 1996; 153: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that an interaction between both substances might occur at the level of GR activation, intensifying the anti-inflammatory potency of glucocorticoids. It is known that glucocorticoids induce transcription of the β2-AR gene (29Collins S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9067-9070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8415-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), preventing agonist-induced desensitization of the β2-AR itself and improving the therapeutic efficacy of β2-AR agonists. It is unknown, however, whether β2-agonists are capable of affecting GR activity.An earlier report (31Peters M.J. Adcock I.M. Brown C.R. Barnes P.J. Eur. J. Pharamacol. 1995; 289: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) analyzing the cellular effects of β2-AR agonists in rat lung tissue cubes demonstrated an inhibitory effect of unphysiologically high concentrations (10−6m) of salbutamol on the binding of GR from crude tissue homogenates to their recognition sequence, GRE. This report failed to show direct activation and/or inhibition of GR itself. In our study, we compared GR activation by β2-AR agonists with GR activation by specific ligands, two glucocorticoids, in a definite cell population, either primary human lung fibroblasts or VSMC. The comparison between ligand-dependent (induced by glucocorticoids) and ligand-independent (induced by β2-AR agonists) GR activation demonstrated that both mechanisms occurred in a similar time frame. Ligand-dependent activation of GR was apparently more potent and resulted in total depletion of GR of the cytosolic compartment. In contrast, ligand-independent activation of GR was sustained over a longer period of time. The cellular function of ligand-independent activation of GR was illustrated by a luciferase reporter gene, WWP-Luc (21Roth M. Eickelberg O. Köhler E. Erne P. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5478-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The WWP-Luc construct contains the promoter region (−2.4 kilobases to +1 base pair) of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene. This construct was shown to be activated by glucocorticoids (32Cha H.H. Cran E.J. Wang E.C. Huang A.J. Kasler H.G. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). p21(WAF1/CIP1) is a cell cycle kinase inhibitor and accounts for some of the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids in fibroblasts (33Ramalingam A. Hirai A. Thompson E.A. Mol.

How can activation of GR by β2-AR agonists be explained at the molecular level? In general, signal transduction upon interaction of β2-AR agonists with the β2-AR results in the activation of G-proteins that are coupled to the intracellular domain of the receptor (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 323-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 40McCrea K.E. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although we could not demonstrate the immediate upstream event preceding GR activation in response to β2-AR agonists, we assume an event in the β2-AR agonist signal transduction pathway to be responsible for the observed GR activation. This is evidenced by the fact that the β2-AR antagonist, propranolol, prevented β2-AR agonist-induced GR activation. β2-AR activation leads to an increase of intracellular cAMP (40McCrea K.E.

These findings suggested a possible involvement of the known β2-AR agonist-mediated cAMP pathway, which was further supported by the finding that a PKA inhibiting peptide abolished the salmeterol-induced activation of GR. To the contrary, CaM, a ubiquitous intracellular signaling molecule located to plasma membrane receptors and ion channels (42Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar), directly activated GR in a ligand-independent manner (43Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for GR activation by CaM was suggested to be a phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of GR (43Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Analogously, CaM-dependent phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor, another member of the steroid/vitamin D/retinoic acid superfamily, has been reported to correlate with the activation of the estrogen receptor itself (44Migliaccio A. Rotondi A. Auricchio F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5921-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that β2-AR agonists activate GR involving the action of CaM in a similar way.In conclusion, our study demonstrates, for the first time, ligand-independent activation of GR by two different β2-agonists using primary human cell lines of lung fibroblasts and VSMC. GR activation by β2-agonists explains, at least in part, the as yet unresolved anti-inflammatory potency of β2-agonists seen in vivo andin vitro. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell(s); GRE, glucocorticoid-responsive element; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PKA, protein kinase A; CaM, calmodulin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum. 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell(s); GRE, glucocorticoid-responsive element; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PKA, protein kinase A; CaM, calmodulin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum. belongs to the family of intracellular ligand-inducible transcription factors termed the steroid/vitamin D/retinoic acid superfamily (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). All members of this superfamily share essential structural and functional features, which are an amino-terminal transactivation domain, a central zinc-finger DNA binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain. Unliganded GR is present in the cytosol and is associated with a large multiprotein complex of chaperones, including heat shock proteins Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp56 (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 2Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Gehring U. J. Steroid Biochem.

Ligand binding induces a conformational change of the complex leading to dissociation of the chaperones. Activated GR then translocates to the nucleus and binds to its specific target DNA sequences termed the glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) (5Mendel D.B. Bodwell J.E. Gametchu B. Harrison R.W.

Depending on the structure of the affected gene promoter, glucocorticoids thereby lead to either increased or decreased gene transcription (6Gronemeyer H.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Biological effects of glucocorticoids on most human cell types are generally anti-inflammatory, characterized by decreased expression of inflammatory mediators or increased expression of protective mediators (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 2Truss M. Beato M. Endocr.

A frequent inflammatory disease that requires the administration of glucocorticoids is asthma (9Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J.

In asthma, treatment regimen combining glucocorticoids with β2-agonists results in better symptom control and lesser airway inflammation than simply increasing the dose of glucocorticoids (11Pauwels R.A. Löfdahl C.-G. Postma D.S. Tattersfield A.E. O'Byrne P. Barnes P.J. Ullman A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 12Greening A.P. Ind P.W. Northfield M.

Care Med. 1996; 153: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). These clinical observations strongly suggest an interaction of both classes of drugs at a molecular level. In contrast to GR, a soluble intracellular receptor that resides in the cytosolic compartment when unliganded (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 2Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Gehring U. J. Steroid Biochem.

A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) constitutes a plasma membrane-anchored, G-protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane spanning domains (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 323-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Kobilka B.K. Dixon R.A.F. Frielle T. Dohlman H.G.

The β2-AR is highly expressed in fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells (USMCs), and epithelial cells of the human lung (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 323-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Barnes P.J. Basbaum C.B. Nadel J.A. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1982; 299: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Signal transduction by β2-AR occurs upon ligand binding via activation of adenylate cyclase, which increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 323-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition to the short term effects of β2-AR agonists, such as VSMC relaxation (17Davis C. Kannan M.S. Jones T.R. Daniel E.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 53: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), considerable evidence suggests that β2-AR agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo (11Pauwels R.A. Löfdahl C.-G. Postma D.S. Tattersfield A.E. O'Byrne P. Barnes P.J. Ullman A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 18Whelan C.J. Johnson M. Vardey C.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Erjefalt I. Persson C.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Baluk P. McDonald D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L461-L468PubMed Google Scholar). Because activation of GR is essentially responsible for the majority of anti-inflammatory effects, we thus addressed the question of whether β2-agonists could lead to activation of GR in a ligand-independent manner. In the present study, cultures of primary human lung fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells were used to demonstrate that both glucocorticoids and β2-AR agonists activate the human GR. We show that the kinetics of GR activation are similar for both substances, leading to rapid nuclear translocation of functional activated GR after 30 min. Compared with β2-AR agonists, the endogenous ligands for GR, glucocorticoids, led to complete depletion of GR from the cytosolic compartment. Activation of GR by β2-AR agonists was mediated by the interaction of the drugs with the β2-AR because a β2-AR antagonist, propranolol, abolished the observed activation of GR in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly to the effect of the drugs on GR activation, addition of dibutyryl-cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP activated the GR, suggesting that the action of β2-AR on GR activation involves the adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway. Thus, our results suggest that ligand-independent activation of GR by β2-AR agonists may be an essential mechanism contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects evoked by β2-agonists. DISCUSSIONThe mechanism of GR activation in a ligand-independent manner has been the subject of several recent investigations (27Calleja C. Pascussi J.M. Mani J.C. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate ligand-independent activation of GR by two β2-agonists, salmeterol and salbutamol. Both drugs were potent activators of GR in the absence of agonistic ligands as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, EMSA, and reporter gene assays. GR was rapidly depleted from the cytosol of primary human lung fibroblasts and VSMC and translocated into the nucleus. Translocated GR was functional as it bound to its specific DNA recognition sequence, GRE, and also activated a GR-inducible luciferase reporter gene assay, p21(WAF1/CIP1). Finally, GR activation by β2-agonists was dependent upon their binding to β2-AR, reasoning that downstream signaling initiated by β2-AR agonist/β2-AR interaction is responsible for the observed GR activation.Activation of GR results in altered transcription of several cytokine genes involved in the inflammatory process leading to their repression or activation (6Gronemeyer H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2524-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Karin M. Yang-Yen H.-F. Chambard J.-C. Deng T. Saatcioglu F. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 45 (Suppl. 1): 9-15Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Our findings are especially important to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of drug action in the treatment of asthma. Here, glucocorticoids and β2-AR agonists are the most effective drugs in the treatment of this disease (9Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 10Barnes P.J. Greening A.P. Crompton G.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152 (suppl.): 125-142Crossref Google Scholar). Clinical studies on asthmatic individuals suggested that the administration of salmeterol, in combination with glucocorticoids, resulted in an improved symptom control being more effective than increasing the dose of the glucocorticoid alone (11Pauwels R.A. Löfdahl C.-G. Postma D.S. Tattersfield A.E. O'Byrne P. Barnes P.J. Ullman A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 12Greening A.P. Ind P.W. Northfield M. Shaw G. Lancet. 1994; 344: 219-224Abstract PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 13Woolcock A. Lundback B. Ringdal N. Jacques L.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that an interaction between both substances might occur at the level of GR activation, intensifying the anti-inflammatory potency of glucocorticoids. It is known that glucocorticoids induce transcription of the β2-AR gene (29Collins S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9067-9070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8415-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), preventing agonist-induced desensitization of the β2-AR itself and improving the therapeutic efficacy of β2-AR agonists. It is unknown, however, whether β2-agonists are capable of affecting GR activity.An earlier report (31Peters M.J. Adcock I.M. Brown C.R. Barnes P.J. Eur. J. Pharamacol. 1995; 289: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) analyzing the cellular effects of β2-AR agonists in rat lung tissue cubes demonstrated an inhibitory effect of unphysiologically high concentrations (10−6m) of salbutamol on the binding of GR from crude tissue homogenates to their recognition sequence, GRE. This report failed to show direct activation and/or inhibition of GR itself. In our study, we compared GR activation by β2-AR agonists with GR activation by specific ligands, two glucocorticoids, in a definite cell population, either primary human lung fibroblasts or VSMC. The comparison between ligand-dependent (induced by glucocorticoids) and ligand-independent (induced by β2-AR agonists) GR activation demonstrated that both mechanisms occurred in a similar time frame. Ligand-dependent activation of GR was apparently more potent and resulted in total depletion of GR of the cytosolic compartment. In contrast, ligand-independent activation of GR was sustained over a longer period of time. The cellular function of ligand-independent activation of GR was illustrated by a luciferase reporter gene, WWP-Luc (21Roth M. Eickelberg O. Köhler E. Erne P. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5478-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The WWP-Luc construct contains the promoter region (−2.4 kilobases to +1 base pair) of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene. This construct was shown to be activated by glucocorticoids (32Cha H.H. Cran E.J. Wang E.C. Huang A.J. Kasler H.G. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). p21(WAF1/CIP1) is a cell cycle kinase inhibitor and accounts for some of the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids in fibroblasts (33Ramalingam A. Hirai A. Thompson E.A. Mol.

It is unknown, however, whether β2-agonists are capable of affecting GR activity. An earlier report (31Peters M.J. Adcock I.M. Brown C.R. Barnes P.J. Eur. J. Pharamacol. 1995; 289: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) analyzing the cellular effects of β2-AR agonists in rat lung tissue cubes demonstrated an inhibitory effect of unphysiologically high concentrations (10−6m) of salbutamol on the binding of GR from crude tissue homogenates to their recognition sequence, GRE. This report failed to show direct activation and/or inhibition of GR itself. In our study, we compared GR activation by β2-AR agonists with GR activation by specific ligands, two glucocorticoids, in a definite cell population, either primary human lung fibroblasts or VSMC. The comparison between ligand-dependent (induced by glucocorticoids) and ligand-independent (induced by β2-AR agonists) GR activation demonstrated that both mechanisms occurred in a similar time frame. Ligand-dependent activation of GR was apparently more potent and resulted in total depletion of GR of the cytosolic compartment. In contrast, ligand-independent activation of GR was sustained over a longer period of time. The cellular function of ligand-independent activation of GR was illustrated by a luciferase reporter gene, WWP-Luc (21Roth M. Eickelberg O. Köhler E. Erne P. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5478-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The WWP-Luc construct contains the promoter region (−2.4 kilobases to +1 base pair) of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene. This construct was shown to be activated by glucocorticoids (32Cha H.H. Cran E.J. Wang E.C. Huang A.J. Kasler H.G. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). p21(WAF1/CIP1) is a cell cycle kinase inhibitor and accounts for some of the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids in fibroblasts (33Ramalingam A. Hirai A. Thompson E.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical modulation of GR is suggested to be achieved by phosphorylation (activation) and dephosphorylation (inactivation) at seven different phosphorylation sites (34Hoeck W. Rusconi S.

How can activation of GR by β2-AR agonists be explained at the molecular level? In general, signal transduction upon interaction of β2-AR agonists with the β2-AR results in the activation of G-proteins that are coupled to the intracellular domain of the receptor (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 323-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 40McCrea K.E. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although we could not demonstrate the immediate upstream event preceding GR activation in response to β2-AR agonists, we assume an event in the β2-AR agonist signal transduction pathway to be responsible for the observed GR activation. This is evidenced by the fact that the β2-AR antagonist, propranolol, prevented β2-AR agonist-induced GR activation. β2-AR activation leads to an increase of intracellular cAMP (40McCrea K.E. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), PKA (14Nijkamp F.P. Engels F. Henricks P.A.J. Vanoosterhout A.J.M. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and calmodulin (CaM) (41Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We assessed the effect of two cAMP mimetics, which also activated GR. These findings suggested a possible involvement of the known β2-AR agonist-mediated cAMP pathway, which was further supported by the finding that a PKA inhibiting peptide abolished the salmeterol-induced activation of GR. To the contrary, CaM, a ubiquitous intracellular signaling molecule located to plasma membrane receptors and ion channels (42Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar), directly activated GR in a ligand-independent manner (43Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for GR activation by CaM was suggested to be a phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of GR (43Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Analogously, CaM-dependent phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor, another member of the steroid/vitamin D/retinoic acid superfamily, has been reported to correlate with the activation of the estrogen receptor itself (44Migliaccio A. Rotondi A. Auricchio F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5921-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that β2-AR agonists activate GR involving the action of CaM in a similar way. In conclusion, our study demonstrates, for the first time, ligand-independent activation of GR by two different β2-agonists using primary human cell lines of lung fibroblasts and VSMC. GR activation by β2-agonists explains, at least in part, the as yet unresolved anti-inflammatory potency of β2-agonists seen in vivo andin vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2027598856,"Preferential cleavage sites have been determined for Fe2+/H2O2-mediated oxidations of DNA. In 50 mm H2O2, preferential cleavages occurred at the nucleoside 5′ to each of the dG moieties in the sequence RGGG, a sequence found in a majority of telomere repeats. Within a plasmid containing a (TTAGGG)81human telomere insert, 7-fold more strand breakage occurred in the restriction fragment with the insert than in a similar-sized control fragment. This result implies that telomeric DNA could protect coding DNA from oxidative damage and might also link oxidative damage and iron load to telomere shortening and aging. In micromolar H2O2, preferential cleavage occurred at the thymidine within the sequence RTGR, a sequence frequently found to be required in promoters for normal responses of many procaryotic and eucaryotic genes to iron or oxygen stress. Computer modeling of the interaction of Fe2+ with RTGR in B-DNA suggests that due to steric hindrance with the thymine methyl, Fe2+ associates in a specific manner with the thymine flipped out from the base stack so as to allow an octahedrally-oriented coordination of the Fe2+ with the three purine N7 residues. Fe2+-dependent changes in NMR spectra of duplex oligonucleotides containing ATGA versus those containing AUGA or A5mCGA were consistent with this model."

Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of these factors to the activation of PLD is highly dependent on the cell type and signaling model examined. For example, stimulation of Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor (HIRcB cells) with insulin activates PLD exclusively through the ARF pathway (10Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of PLD by insulin in adipocytes appears to be primarily Rho-mediated (11Karnam P.

However, the downstream consequences of PA generation are not well understood. Although it is clear that the principal effects of PA in some systems may be mediated by its conversion to diacylglycerol (DAG) or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), PA may also be a potent second messenger. Several laboratories have identified putative targets for PA in growth factor signal transduction, including a protein tyrosine phosphatase (17Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), phospholipase C-γ (18Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Ras-GAP (19Tsai M.H. Yu C.L. Wei F.S. Stacy D.W. Science. 1989; 243: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of these interactions has not been established.Recently, Ghosh et al. (20Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) reported that PA interacts directly with the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1, an important component of the MAPK signaling cascade. Here we report that the stimulation of the MAPK pathway by insulin is dependent on PLD activation, and this effect is mediated through the induction of Raf-1 translocation to the plasma membrane by PA. Furthermore, overexpression of a catalytically inactive variant of PLD2, but not PLD1, blocks insulin-induced phosphorylation of MAPK. We also show that PA is required for complete activation of Raf-1 in response to insulin. However, PA alone cannot activate Raf kinase in vivo, does not have any effect on Raf kinase activity in vitro, and has no effects on the MAPK cascade. We also show that PA induces Raf-1 translocation to the plasma membrane and that the generation of PA is essential for the induction of Raf-1 translocation by insulin. PA also induced Raf-1 translocation to the plasma membrane in Ha-Ras(Q61L)-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts, suggesting that PA may act concurrently with activated Ras in stimulating Raf-1 translocation. Raf-1 was found associated with intracellular vesicles containing the insulin receptor and clathrin after stimulation with insulin. Furthermore, Raf-1 association to endocytic vesicles was dependent on the generation of PA, suggesting a model in which Raf-1 migrates along with endocytic vesicles during receptor-mediated endocytosis via its interaction with PA.DISCUSSIONThe activation of Raf-1 kinase activity by growth factors requires its translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it is activated through a complex mechanism which includes the interaction with the GTP-bound form of Ras, and possibly phosphorylation by PKC, and tyrosine kinases (34Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 35Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem.

Whereas the precise nature of the events occurring at the plasma membrane remains unresolved, it is clear that the translocation of Raf-1 is crucial. Targeting Raf-1 to the plasma membrane by attaching a protein prenylation motif to the C terminus of Raf-1 is sufficient for activation of the kinase (37Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), whereas trapping Raf-1 in the cytoplasm with cytosolic Ras prevents activation (22Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, translocation itself does not bring about the full activation of Raf-1. Mineo et al. (38Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) used a mutant Ras protein that is deficient in binding to wild-type Raf-1, but binds Raf-1(257L), to show that the interaction between Ras and Raf-1 stimulates Raf-1 kinase activity 3-fold better than targeting Raf-1 to the membrane alone. Furthermore, Roy et al. (39Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane by Ras was not sufficient for full activation of Raf-1 and that a second interaction between the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) on Raf-1 and the GTP-bound form of Ras was necessary for full activation. They also showed that deletion of the CRD from membrane-targeted Raf-1 abrogated Raf-1 kinase activity, suggesting that plasma membrane localization of Raf-1 by itself is insufficient for activation of Raf-1 but that a second regulatory event affecting the CRD must occur for Raf-1 activation. Thus, Raf-1 translocation and Raf-1 kinase activation are closely related but distinct phenomena.It has been assumed for some time that the interactions of Raf-1 with Ras are the primary mechanism driving the recruitment of Raf-1 to the cell membrane. Recently, other mechanisms that may play an important role in the recruitment of Raf-1 to the membrane have been investigated. For instance, Ghosh et al. (20Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) have explored the interactions of Raf-1 with phosphatidylserine and PA in vitro. Phosphatidylserine appears to bind to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Raf-1, which is analogous to the zinc finger on PKC. Luo et al. (40Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) replaced the Raf-1 CRD with the analogous zinc finger domain found on PKC and found that DAG activated this chimera independently of Ras activation, demonstrating that interaction of an effector with the CRD is critical in the activation of Raf-1. Other effectors, such as ceramide (41Huwiler A. Brunner J. Hummel R. Vervoordeldonk M. Stabel S. van der Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and Rap1A (42Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), interact with Raf-1 at this site and consequently have effects on its activation. The PA-binding site proposed by Ghosh et al. (20Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) does not lie in this crucial lipid binding regulatory domain on Raf-1 but on a second lipid-binding site near the catalytic domain of Raf-1. The influence of effector binding at this site on Raf-1 kinase activity, if any, has not been fully characterized at the present time. It has also been shown that inhibition of PLD-mediated generation of PA with ethanol inhibited phorbol ester-induced Raf-1 translocation to cell membranes (20Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This suggests that the generation of PA by a receptor-sensitive PLD may play an important role in the recruitment and/or activation of Raf-1 kinase.The data reported here strongly support this view. By taking advantage of the fact that insulin-dependent PLD activation in HIRcB cells is mediated by ARF proteins in a BFA-sensitive manner (10Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we have shown that the blockade of PLD-dependent generation of PA disrupts the activation of Raf-1, the translocation of Raf-1 to membranes, and the phosphorylation of MAPK. We also demonstrated that overexpression of a catalytically inactive variant of PLD2 blocks insulin-induced activation of PLD and MAPK phosphorylation. In consistency with the hypothesis that the effects of BFA are a consequence of the blockade of the generation of PA by receptor-sensitive PLD, we have also shown that all the effects of BFA can be reversed by the addition of exogenous PA. However, our data show that PA alone cannot activate MAPK phosphorylation in live cells and that it cannot activate Raf-1 in vitro or in cultured cells. Taking all these data together, we conclude that the generation of PA is required but not sufficient for the activation of Raf-1 by insulin.On the other hand, we show here that PA is sufficient for induction of Raf-1 translocation and reverses the blockade of insulin-induced Raf-1 translocation by BFA to intracellular vesicles. These facts suggest a model in which PA directly facilitates Raf-1 translocation but does not activate the kinase and is insufficient to completely stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity in intact cells. Furthermore, we show that PA induces Raf-1 translocation in Ha-Ras(Q61L)-transformed cells, suggesting that PA and Ras may act concurrently and by parallel pathways in stimulating Raf-1 translocation to the plasma membrane. We therefore conclude that the main role of PA in the activation of the MAPK cascade is the induction of Raf-1 translocation to the cell membrane.Much of the attention on receptor-sensitive PLD has focused on PLD1, primarily because recombinant PLD1 may be activated by ARF, Rho, and PKCα in vitro (43Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In vitro studies on recombinant PLD2, on the other hand, have demonstrated that purified PLD2 has a high basal activity that is largely insensitive to ARF and Rho (44Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11408-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 46Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and thus was thought to be an unlikely candidate for the receptor-sensitive PLD activity. However, our findings suggest that in HIRcB cells PLD2 is the main species involved in insulin-dependent PLD signaling. This conclusion is based on the fact that a catalytically inactive variant of PLD2 functions as a dominant negative and blocks insulin-induced phosphorylation of MAPK, whereas a catalytically inactive PLD1 does not. Interestingly, this further suggests that PLD2 is regulated by ARF in vivo, since the insulin-dependent PLD activity in HIRcB cells requires ARF activation (10Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from the Sung et al. 3T. S. Sung, A. J. Morris, and M. A. Frohman, submitted for publication. agrees with this model. Although immunopurified PLD2 was found to be largely unresponsive to ARF, a preparation of crude membranes containing PLD2 overexpressed in COS-7 cells was activated by ARF preloaded with GTPγS, suggesting that PLD2 may be regulated by ARF in vivo. Furthermore, a PLD2 mutant lacking the N-terminal 308 amino acids displays both reduced in vitro and in vivobasal activity and is stimulated more than 10-fold by ARF. These results are consistent with a model for ARF-mediated PLD2 activation in response to insulin activation.Our data do not rule out the possibility that PA-stimulated Raf-1 translocation is mediated by metabolites of PA, specifically DAG or LPA. However, we do not believe this to be the case. DAG-mediated activation of PKC results in potent activation of Raf-1 (48van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. van der Hoeven P.C.J. de Widt J. Schaap D.

J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and thus a significant conversion of PA to DAG would result in MAPK activation as well as potent activation of Raf-1. Since treatment of cells with PA alone failed to activate either Raf-1 or MAPK, we conclude that the generation of DAG does not play a significant role in the mechanism by which PA modulates the MAPK cascade. Likewise, a significant accumulation of LPA would also elicit a strong activation of the MAPK cascade (49van Dijk M.C.M. Postma F. Hilkmann H. Jalink K. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 386-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, conversion of PA to either LPA or DAG should have dramatic effects on the Raf-1-MAPK signaling cascade. Since these effects were not seen after the addition of PA in our experiments, it is likely that the effects of PA on Raf-1 translocation are due to a direct interaction between PA and Raf-1 and not a consequence of its conversion to other lipid second messengers.Previously, immunocytochemical characterization of Raf-1 translocation has been limited to a few studies in which Raf-1 was microinjected into Ras-transformed cells (37Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 50Traverse S. Cohen P. Paterson H. Marshall C. Rapp U. Grand R.J.A.

However, little work has been done to characterize growth factor-induced Raf-1 translocation. Here, we have studied the dynamics of insulin-induced Raf-1 translocation to the plasma membrane in live cells. Our data demonstrate that Raf-GFP undergoes growth factor-induced kinase activation and translocation, indicating that Raf-GFP is an appropriate model for growth factor-induced Raf-1 dynamics. In order to assess translocation of Raf-GFP to the plasma membrane in live cells, we imaged a confocal section of the plasma membrane adjacent to the cover glass. To select this section, several images along the z axis of the cell were collected. Because Raf-1 does not enter the nucleus, the plasma membrane sections adjacent to the coverslip were identified by choosing a confocal section below the nucleus. These sections were imaged at 37 °C in order to examine the kinetics of Raf translocation in response to insulin or PA stimulation.By using this experimental approach, we show here that the association of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane is transient. However, Raf-1 does not simply dissociate from the plasma membrane. Dual staining immunogold labeling for the insulin receptor and Raf-1 resolved by electron microscopy shows that Raf-1 co-localized with the insulin receptor in intracellular vesicular structures in response to stimulation with both insulin and PA. The structure of these vesicles suggests that they are endosomes. To confirm that Raf-1 binds endocytic vesicles, cells were treated with insulin, and vesicles containing the insulin receptor were isolated using a specific anti-insulin receptor antibody. Both Raf-1 and the heavy chain of clathrin were present in these preparations. Consistent with our model, the association between Raf-1 and the isolated vesicles also appeared to be dependent on the presence of PA. This conclusion is based on the observation that BFA blocked the internalization of the insulin receptor and abolished the localization of Raf-1 in the immunoisolated endocytic vesicles. Therefore, we propose that PA is required for endocytosis of the insulin receptor and that the association between Raf-1 and endosomes is mediated by a direct interaction between PA and Raf-1. This is consistent with current models of vesicle formation mediated by acidic phospholipids (32Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J.

These models suggest that PLD-mediated generation of PA, through participation in a positive feedback loop concurrently with the generation of PIP2, may sufficiently perturb membrane structure and facilitate the formation of a vesicle from a planar membrane. Consequently, the membranes of newly formed vesicles are enriched with the acidic phospholipids PA and PIP2. This acidic surface may serve as a binding matrix for a number of signaling molecules such as Raf-1.Recent work by Daaka et al. (47Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) also supports this model. By using dominant suppressor mutants of β-arrestin or dynamin, they showed that inhibition of G-protein-coupled receptor endocytosis blocked MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, they isolated Raf-1-containing vesicles that co-isolated with clathrin-coated vesicles, suggesting that Raf-1 associates with clathrin-coated vesicles. Our data suggest a very similar model for insulin-mediated activation of MAPK. We suggest that the activation of the MAPK cascade by insulin also requires endocytosis of the insulin receptor. Raf-1 is associated with endocytic vesicles in insulin-treated cells, and PLD activation appears to be necessary for receptor-mediated endocytosis and Raf-1 translocation to membranes.Fig. 8 depicts the proposed role of insulin-induced generation of PA. According to this model, PA has the following two functions: 1) the recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane where it is activated by factors which reside on the plasma membrane, such as activated Ras and PKC, and 2) facilitation of endocytic vesicle formation. These two effects, acting in conjunction, may result in the recruitment of many important components of signal transduction to the plasma membrane and to the membranes of endocytic vesicles. Among these components are receptor tyrosine kinases, Raf-1 through its association with PA, and proteins that associate with PIP2 through pleckstrin homology domains. Our work and that of Daaka et al. (47Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) further suggest that the internalization of these signaling components is necessary for full activation of the MAPK signaling cascade, probably by bringing Raf-1 in contact with downstream targets such as MEK. In this paper, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is mediated by phosphatidic acid.

The relative contribution of these factors to the activation of PLD is highly dependent on the cell type and signaling model examined. For example, stimulation of Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor (HIRcB cells) with insulin activates PLD exclusively through the ARF pathway (10Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G.

Additionally, this signaling pathway also leads to activation-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes that is dependent on FasL transcription and expression. Here we demonstrate that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many cytokine genes expressed in activated lymphocytes, also plays a role in T cell activation-induced FasL expression. Inhibition of NF-κB activity in a T cell hybridoma leads to decreased FasL expression and apoptosis upon T cell receptor stimulation. We identified the NF-κB site in the FasL promoter that contributes to such regulation. Co-expression of p65 (Rel A) with the FasL promoter enhanced its activity, and co-expression of IκB dramatically inhibited the inducible promoter activity. In contrast, the transcription factor AP-1 is not required for activation-induced FasL promoter activity. These results define a role for NF-κB in mediating FasL expression during T cell activation.

AICD occurs in mature T lymphocytes to limit antigen-specific responses. Upon clearing antigens and/or pathogens from the host, activated T cells are deleted via the activation of apoptosis, which we and others have shown to be dependent upon Fas ligand (FasL, CD95 ligand) expression and ligation of its receptor, Fas (CD95) (1Brunner T.

However, despite our understanding of the importance of FasL in controlling homeostasis, little is known about its transcriptional regulation. T cell receptor ligation activates a cascade of signaling events which leads to the activation of several transcription factors that regulate cytokine gene expression including interleukin-2 (IL-2) (6Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Signaling events post-TCR ligation and phospholipase C-γ1 lead to two distinct signals: activation of the protein kinase C pathway and release of intracellular Ca2+ stores, subsequent Ca2+influx, and the activation of the serine phosphatase, calcineurin (7Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). These two signals can be mimicked by treatment of cells with the pharmacological agents phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. Calcineurin-mediated activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and its role in cytokine gene expression is well established (7Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and more recently it was shown that NF-AT sites in the FasL promoter are important for T cell activation-induced FasL expression (10Latinis K. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Like NF-AT, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of the interleukin 2α receptor (11Bohnlein E. Lowenthal J.W. Siekewitz M. Ballard D.W. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and the IL-2 genes (12Shibuya H. Yoneyama M. Taniguchi T. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm as two major precursor forms either as a RelA·p50 complex with the inhibiting IκB or as a heterodimeric RelA·p105 complex (13Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar). Release of the RelA-p50 from its inhibitor, IκB, is dependent on the phosphorylation of IκB (14Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar), and recently, the kinases that phosphorylate IκB have been identified (15Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). NF-κB is then translocated into the nucleus as active heterodimers consisting of Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel, which regulate gene expression. Recently, we identified a role for NF-κB and another transcription factor, AP-1, in the regulation of stress-induced FasL expression (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine whether NF-κB and AP-1 regulate FasL expression in lymphocytes activated through the T cell receptor. Human leukemic Jurkat cells (ATCC) and Jurkat cells stably transfected with SV40 large T antigen were used in this study. The T cell hybridoma A1.1 has been described previously (2Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (complete medium). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma, and ionomycin was purchased from Calbiochem. Mouse anti-human CD3 (OKT3) antibody and hamster anti-mouse CD3ε (145–2C11) were purified from culture supernatants by protein A affinity chromatography. Anti-p65(RelA) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All experiments were performed in 96-well plates and in triplicates samples, with cells resuspended at 0.5–1 × 106/ml in complete medium. For T cell receptor stimulation, 96-well plates were precoated with anti-CD3 antibody (2C11) in 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0. PMA and ionomycin were added at concentrations of 50 ng/ml and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. The expression of Fas-L was determined by RT of total RNA followed by reverse PCR analysis (RT-PCR) as described previously (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs were synthesized by extension of dT primers with 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a mixture containing 1 μg of total RNA digested by RNase-free DNase (2 units/μg of RNA) (Ambion) for 15 min at 37 °C. PCR of the cDNA was performed in a final volume of 50 μl, containing all four dNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 units of AmpliTag (Life Technologies, Inc.), and each primer at 0.2 μm using the geneAmp 2400 PCR system (Perkin-Elmer). Amplification of β-actin served as control for sample loading and integrity. The following primers were designed to discriminate between the amplification of cDNA (low size PCR products) and contaminating genomic cDNA (high size PCR products): hFasL forward: TAAAACCGTTTGCTGGGGC. hFasL reverse: CTCAGCTCCTTTTTTTCAGGGG. β-Actin forward: TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA. β-Actin reverse: CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG. Cloning of the 1.2-kb FasL promoter and generation of the truncated version was described before (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). A 1.2- and a 0.9-kb fragment of the hFasL promoter were subsequently used in the experiments described here. Jurkat T cells containing stably transfected SV40 large T antigen were electroporated as described previously (17Kasibhatla S. Nalefski E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3140-3151PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5–2 × 107 cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, resuspended in 500 μl of the same medium, and transferred to 4-mm gap electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad). 20–60 μg of FasL reporter alone or with Srα p65, IκB, IκBαM, or DN MEKK expression vectors (18DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 1295-1304Crossref Google Scholar, 19Mercurio F. DiDonato J. Rossette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) were added to the cells and mixed well. Electroporation was carried out at 250 V and 960 microfarads in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulse II. Briefly, different hFasL promoter constructs were transfected with or without co-expression vectors. pCMV β-galactosidase was used to normalize the transfection efficiencies in the various co-transfections. Forty h post-transfection, cells were activated with PMA and ionomycin and incubated for another 12–18 h. Cells were harvested, washed three times with PBS, and lysed in 100 μl of the lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used in the luciferase assay using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm spermidine, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 75% glycerol, and 104 counts/min labeled probe. The probes used were double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (Retrogen, San Diego, CA) consisting of the NF-κB site from the human FasL promoter, 5′-AAGCCTGGGCAACATAGAAAGTCCCCATCTGTACAAAAA-3′, and the consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Each strand was labeled separately with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol), and the strands were then slowly allowed to reanneal. The samples were analyzed on a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel in 0.5% Tris-buffered EDTA. In some experiments, nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were made as described (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 5–10 μg of nuclear extract, 32P-labeled probe (25,000 cpm), and 2 μg of poly(dI:dC) in the binding buffer. It has been suggested that NF-κB is required for activation-induced cell death in T cells. Recently, it was shown that antioxidants inhibit activation-induced cell death by blocking NF-κB activation, and thereby blocking FasL expression (20Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8048-8053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have recently shown that NF-κB is required for stress-induced FasL expression and apoptosis in T cells (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In contrast, previous studies by ourselves and others have suggested that NF-κB can act as an inhibitor of apoptosis induced by TNF (21Van Antwerp D. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar, 22Beg A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 23Wang C.-U. Mayo M. Baldwin A. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar, 24Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether inhibition of NF-κB can inhibit activation-induced cell death in T cells. To examine this possibility, we employed a recently described inhibitor of NF-κB composed of a cell-permeable peptide carrying the nuclear localization signal of the NF-κB p50 subunit (25Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Muller J. Fanning E. Baeuerle P. Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This peptide has been shown to specifically inhibit the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complexes (26Lin Y.-Z. Yao S. Veach R. Torgerson T. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of the NF-κB inhibitory peptide or a control peptide in preventing activation-induced cell death in a T cell hybridoma. The T cell hybridoma A1.1 undergoes expression of FasL and apoptosis when cross-linked with anti-T cell receptor antibodies (1Brunner T. Yoo N.J. LaFace D. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Int. Immunol. 1996; 9: 1017-1026Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We observed a significant decrease in apoptosis in the presence of the NF-κB inhibitory peptide and not the control peptide (Fig. 1 A). We then assessed FasL expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in these cells and observed a corresponding inhibition in the level of FasL mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Together, these results suggest that NF-κB may be an important mediator of activation-induced FasL expression and subsequent cell death. Activation-induced cell death is mediated by regulation of Fas/FasL expression. T cell receptor cross-linking and pharmacologic agents mimicking these signals also induce FasL expression (27Brunner T. Yoo N.J. Griffith T.S. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1997; 97: 161-174Google Scholar). There are potential binding sites for several transcription factors in the 1.2-kb promoter region of Fas ligand (Fig.2 A). To understand the results obtained in Fig. 1 and to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying T cell receptor-mediated FasL expression, we used a 1.2-kb FasL promoter (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and examined whether this reporter is activated upon TCR ligation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the 1.2-kb FasL promoter was activated upon cross-linking of the TCR receptor with anti-CD3 antibody as well as upon stimulation with the pharmacologic agents PMA and ionomycin. Similar results were reported in studies using a 486-bp FasL reporter construct (10Latinis K. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To identify the regulatory domains that mediate this inducible transcription of the 1.2-kb FasL promoter, we then tested the effect of a 0.9-kb FasL reporter (Fig. 2 A) that has its 5′ enhancer truncated. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2 C, we observed that when T cells were activated with PMA and ionomycin, FasL reporter activity of the 0.9-kb promoter was significantly reducedversus that of the 1.2-kb promoter. To further examine the possible role of NF-κB in AICD, we studied the activation-dependent characteristics of a NF-κB reporter construct carrying two copies of the consensus κB motif (28Rossette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and found that NF-κB is activated upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 3 A). A mutation in the site abrogated this activity (Fig. 3 A). We have previously shown that the distal NF-κB site binds to NF-κB proteins from nuclear extracts treated with the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). After treatment with PMA and ionomycin, we then examined nuclear extracts for NF-κB binding activity by an electromobility shift assay, using the distal NF-κB site from the FasL promoter (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, T cell activation induced NF-κB binding in an activation-dependent manner. The binding to this site was competed off by the wild type consensus NF-κB motif (GGGGACTTTCCC) (29Lenardo M. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) and by an anti-p65 antibody (30Lin S.-H. Wortis H.W. Stavnezer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but not by control serum (Fig. 3 B). The inhibition of complex formation by anti-p65 antibody also suggests that p65 is part of the complex induced by PMA and ionomycin treatment. Earlier studies using chemical activators of cAMP signaling (31Ivanov V. Lee R. Podack E. Malek T. Oncogene. 1997; 22: 2455-2464Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and reactive oxygen intermediates have suggested that NF-κB could be involved in activation-induced cell death (20Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8048-8053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Williams M. Henkart P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2395-2402PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments in Fig. 1suggested that NF-κB is required for optimal activation-induced cell death and FasL expression. We therefore investigated the possibility that NF-κB directly regulates T cell activation-mediated FasL transcription. Based on the dependence of NF-κB activation on the effective degradation of IκB, we first took the approach of inhibiting NF-κB activation using IκB or a nondegradable mutant IκBαM (21Van Antwerp D. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). We therefore co-transfected Jurkat cells with the FasL reporter construct together with either wild type IκB or the nondegradable mutant IκBαM (21Van Antwerp D. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, either form of IκB effectively blocked the basal activity as well as activation of the FasL promoter with PMA and ionomycin. We have recently identified an NF-κB responsive element in the FasL promoter essential for stress-induced promoter activity (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of this NF-κB site in activation-induced FasL promoter activation, we used a reporter construct in which this site was mutated (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and tested for its ability to be induced upon T cell activation. As shown in Fig. 4 B, mutating the NF-κB site had a profound effect on T cell activation-mediated FasL expression, further supporting the idea that NF-κB is required for optimal activation of the FasL promoter. The ability of the various Rel-related proteins to recognize DNA sequence elements through either homo- or heterodimer formation may be a mechanism whereby selective functional regulation by this family of proteins is achieved. It has been shown that the p65 subunit of NF-κB can act as a transcriptional activator (33Ballard D. Dixon E. Peffer N. Bogerd H. Doerre S. Stein B. Greene W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1875-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Co-expression of p65 (Rel A) with the FasL reporter induced constitutive FasL reporter activity and enhanced the ability of PMA and ionomycin to drive this promoter (Fig.5 A). The NF-κB mutation also abolished the ability of this promoter to be induced by co-expression of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 5 B). Transient overexpression of p65 was sufficient to induce expression of the endogenous Fas ligand gene in Jurkat cells as assessed by semi-quantitative PCR (Fig. 5 C). These data support a role for NF-κB in driving the FasL promoter following T cell activation. Recently, Latinis et al. (10Latinis K. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) showed that NF-AT is an important transcription factor required for activation-induced FasL expression. Similarly, we identified AP-1 and NF-κB sites required for stress-induced FasL expression (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). T cell receptor ligation activates the early genes fos andjun that heterodimerize and bind to the AP-1 site to regulate IL-2 and other cytokine gene transcription (34Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK/SAPK) is required for AP-1-dependent promoter activity (34Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Inhibiting c-Jun phosphorylation by a DN-MEKK (K432M) also down-regulates AP-1-dependent reporter activity (35Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R. Johnson G. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). To study the effects of DN-MEKK on FasL reporter activity, we cotransfected the FasL reporter with a DN-MEKK expression vector and observed that DN-MEKK had no effect on TCR-mediated FasL reporter activity (Fig. 6 A). In contrast and as shown earlier (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), DN-MEKK inhibited stress-induced FasL reporter activity (Fig. 6 A). We then investigated whether the distal AP-1 binding site (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) was required for TCR-mediated FasL transcription. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a mutation in the AP-1 site did not alter FasL reporter activity in response to T cell receptor signaling, thus suggesting the involvement of a different signaling mechanism. We have previously observed that this mutation abolishes the response of the promoter to DNA-damaging agents (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). TCR engagement and activation often leads to growth and differentiation as well as apoptosis in T cells (6Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Some of the proximal signaling events lead to activation of AP-1, NF-κB, as well as the NF-AT family of transcription factors (9Rothenberg E.V. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which are known to activate cytokine gene transcription. A substantial amount of work in the past several years has helped our understanding of this complex cytokine gene regulation. There is also evidence that transcription can play a critical role in mechanisms involved in some forms of apoptosis, such as activation-induced cell death in T cells. Activation-induced cell death is primarily mediated by Fas/FasL in mature T lymphocytes (2Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 3Alderson M.R. Tough T.W. Davis-Smith T. Braddy S. Falk B. Schooley K.A. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. Ramsdell F. Lynch D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Previously, Latinis et al. (10Latinis K. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) showed that NF-AT regulates activation-induced FasL promoter activity. Similarly, we showed recently that the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB regulate DNA damage and other stress-induced FasL expression (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Here, we have provided evidence that NF-κB also plays a role in T cell activation-mediated FasL expression. We found that the regulation of the 1.2-kb FasL reporter was dependent on NF-κB and that inhibiting NF-κB translocation into the nucleus also inhibited FasL expression and apoptosis in T cells. NF-κB was originally identified as a constitutively expressed protein that can form a complex with a 10-bp site in the immunoglobulin κ light chain enhancer (36Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). It was soon found to also take part in T cell activation, regulating IL-2 and IL-2α receptor genes (11Bohnlein E. Lowenthal J.W. Siekewitz M. Ballard D.W. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). There is also indirect evidence suggesting that NF-κB can be involved in activation-induced cell death (20Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8048-8053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 31Ivanov V. Lee R. Podack E. Malek T. Oncogene. 1997; 22: 2455-2464Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AICD has been shown to be inhibited by antioxidants (20Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8048-8053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Williams M. Henkart P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2395-2402PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibitors of proteasome activity such as lactacystin (37Matsui K. Omura S. Cui H. Schauer S. Sonenshein E. Ju S-T,J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Cui H. Matsui K. Omura S. Schauer S. Matulka R. Sonenshein E. Ju S.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7515-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that antioxidants block NF-κB activation and that nondegradable IκB not only blocks NF-κB activation but also cell death in T cells. Thus, agents that induce or inhibit NF-κB activation appear to have an impact on AICD. Inhibition of NF-κB also blocks the ability of reactive oxygen intermediates to induce FasL expression in T cells (20Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8048-8053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because reactive oxygen intermediates may be involved in T cell signaling, we also studied the effect of inhibiting NF-κB in H2O2-induced cell death and found that inhibiting NF-κB blocks this mode of apoptosis (data not shown). NF-κB has also been implicated in signaling events that prevent cell death elicited by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, TNFα (39Finco T. Baldwin A.S.J. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We and others previously showed that inhibition of NF-κB in Jurkat and other cell types sensitizes these cells to TNF-induced apoptosis (21Van Antwerp D. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the inhibition of NF-κB also prevents DNA damage and other related stress-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Taken together with the results described in this paper, NF-κB seems to serve multiple functional roles under different conditions. Apoptosis mediated by Fas often does not involve activation of NF-κB (40Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A. Gentz R. Ebner R. Dixit V. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TRAMP (TNF-related apoptosis-mediating protein)/DR3/WSL-1 and TRAIL receptors (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) induce apoptosis and also activate NF-κB (41Wiley S. Schooley K. Smolak P. Din W. Huang C. Nicoll J. Sutherland G. Smith T. Rauch C. Smith C. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar, 42Chaudhary P. Eby M.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Like FasL, TRAIL is also induced upon lymphocyte activation, and its expression is inhibited by cyclosporin A, suggesting a role for calcineurin and NF-AT (45Mariani S. Krammer P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1492-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whether NF-κB also regulates TRAIL expression is not known. It is possible that in T cells, some of the early signals may define thede novo gene expression. Our present study also raises some interesting questions about the complex regulation of Fas ligand. A 0.9 kb fragment of the FasL reporter had low activity upon stimulation (Fig. 1 C), whereas a 486-bp reporter was shown to be sufficient for reporter activity (10Latinis K. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). One possibility is that there could be repressor elements in the Fas ligand promoter that may act as regulators of this death-promoting gene. A recent study on human FasL promoter has suggested the existence of a repressor element between −453–373 in the promoter (46Holtz-Heppelmann C. Algeciras A. Badley A. Paya C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This study did not, however, characterize the region between −473 and −2365 in the promoter. Our study suggests the possibility of a repressor element between −900 and −486 bp in this promoter, and there could also be another between the 1.2 kb and the 2.3 kb of the enhancer. We are currently analyzing the promoter region for any such repressor elements. It is also interesting that NF-AT alone is sufficient to drive a 486-bp FasL promoter (10Latinis K. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), whereas in the context of a 1.2-kb promoter, a mutation in the NF-AT site did not completely inhibit the promoter activity. 2S. Kasibhatla, unpublished observations. In contrast, a mutation in the NF-κB site had a profound effect on activation-induced Fas ligand promoter activity (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that NF-κB is critical for FasL expression. So far, NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-AT are among the transcription factors shown to be involved in some forms of apoptosis, of which NF-κB seems to possess quite distinct characteristics. Understanding the characteristics of this molecule with regard to how this differential specificity is achieved and how different signaling events converge on the same regulatory factor would also shed light on any “switch mechanism” a cell might have to regulate different cellular functions. We studied the importance of the previously identified AP-1 site (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) in T cell activation-mediated FasL expression and found that AP-1 was dispensable for this form of induction but was required for induction by stress (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that the preference of different transcription factors to regulate gene transcription varies with the mode of cell activation. The transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB are involved in stress-induced FasL expression, whereas NF-AT and NF-κB appear to co-operate in T cell receptor-mediated FasL expression."

The structure reveals four oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide–binding folds, three of which form a deep cleft that binds the ssDNA, and a fourth that forms an unusual protein–protein interaction between the α and β subunits.

https://openalex.org/W1990421089,"One of the mechanisms whereby glucose stimulates insulin gene transcription in pancreatic β-cells involves activation of the homeodomain transcription factor PDX1 (pancreatic/duodenal homeobox-1) via a stress-activated pathway involving stress-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2, also termed RK/p38, CSBP, and Mxi2). In the present study we show, by Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, that in human islets of Langerhans incubated in low glucose (3 mm) PDX1 exists as an inactive 31-kDa protein localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. Transfer of the islets to high (16 mm) glucose results in rapid (within 10 min) conversion of PDX1 to an active 46-kDa form that was present predominantly in the nucleus. Activation of PDX1 appears to involve phosphorylation, as shown by incorporation of32Pi into the 46-kDa form of the protein. These effects of glucose could be mimicked by chemical stress (sodium arsenite), or by overexpression of SAPK2 in the β-cell line MIN6. Overexpression of SAPK2 also stimulated PDX1-dependent transcription of a –50 to –250 region of the human insulin gene promoter linked to a firefly luciferase reporter gene. The effects of glucose were inhibited by the SAPK2 inhibitor SB 203580, and by wortmannin and LY 294002, which inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, although the effects of stress (arsenite) were inhibited only by SB 203580.

Furthermore, glucose metabolism has been shown to stimulate PDX1 DNA binding activity and insulin promoter activity in β-cells via a stress-activated signaling pathway involving stress-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2, also termed RK/p38, CSBP, and Mxi2) (16Macfarlane W.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).SAPK2 is a member of an expanding family of mitogen-activated protein kinase-related kinases that are activated in response to adverse stimuli such as heat, osmotic shock, ultraviolet light, DNA-damaging reagents and by proinflammatory cytokines that are produced under conditions of stress (17Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, glucose metabolism stimulates the SAPK2 pathway by a mechanism that involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IL, interleukin; NF, nuclear factor. 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IL, interleukin; NF, nuclear factor. while stress (e.g. arsenite treatment) stimulates the SAPK2 pathway in β and other cell types by a mechanism independent of PI 3-kinase (16Macfarlane W.M.

It is inactive, insofar as it does not bind to its recognition sequence in the insulin promoter as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, treatment of recombinant PDX1 with SAPK2 in the presence of Mg-ATP and a β-cell extract activates its DNA binding, concomitant with a shift in molecular mass from 31 kDa to 46 kDa (16Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The molecular modifications responsible for this shift in molecular mass are as yet unclear. In the present study we show that PDX1 exists as the inactive 31-kDa form in the cytoplasm of human islets incubated in low (3 mm) glucose. Treatment with 16 mm glucose stimulates conversion to the active 46-kDa form, which is localized predominantly in the nucleus. These events are inhibited by SB 203580 (5 μm) (an inhibitor of SAPK2), wortmannin, and LY 294002 (inhibitors of PI 3-kinase), and mimicked by sodium arsenite and overexpression of SAPK2.RESULTSInitial experiments were undertaken to determine the effect of glucose on the molecular mass and intracellular location of PDX1. Human islets of Langerhans were incubated for 5 h in 3 mmglucose, transferred to 16 mm glucose, and PDX1 analyzed at various time intervals by Western blotting of whole cell extracts. In 3 mm glucose PDX1 was present as a 31-kDa protein (Fig.1 A). Within 10 min in 16 mm glucose, the 31-kDa protein was converted to the 46-kDa form. Conversion was complete within 15 min. To investigate the effect of glucose on the intracellular location of the two forms of PDX1, human islets were incubated in 3 or 20 mm glucose and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions prepared. In 3 mmglucose, the 31-kDa form was present in the cytoplasm; however, in 16 mm glucose, the 46-kDa form was present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with acid phosphatase converted the 46-kDa form to the 31-kDa form. In the presence of excess inorganic pyrophosphate, acid phosphatase had no effect on the 46-kDa form, confirming that conversion to the 31-kDa form was associated with dephosphorylation of the 46-kDa form. The 31-kDa form was inactive as measured by EMSA (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–4), whereas the 46-kDa form present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus was active (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4–8). Identification of the retarded band in Fig.1 C as PDX1 was confirmed by oligonucleotide and antibody competition experiments (data not shown).The role of phosphorylation in the activation of PDX1 was investigated further by labeling of MIN6 cells with inorganic32Pi and subsequent immunoprecipitation of PDX1. At high glucose concentrations, 32Pi was incorporated into the 46-kDa form of PDX1 (Fig.2, lanes 3 and4), but at low glucose concentrations no such incorporation was observed (lanes 1 and 2). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 2 B) confirmed that both forms of the protein were present, but that32P was incorporated only into the 46-kDa form of the protein, which was observed at high glucose concentrations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the biochemical fractionation of the β-cell extracts, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using a specific anti-USF antibody. USF binds to the E2 site of the human insulin gene promoter and has a molecular size of 43 kDa (Fig. 2 C). Blotting confirmed the presence of USF solely in the nuclear fractions, independently of glucose concentrations.Figure 2High glucose promotes incorporation of32Pi into the 46-kDa form of PDX1.

USF has a molecular mass of 43 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since SAPK2 and PI 3-kinase had previously been implicated in the stimulation of PDX1 DNA binding activity, the possible involvement of these enzymes in the glucose-stimulated translocation of PDX1 to the nucleus was next investigated. Fig.3 A shows that glucose-stimulated conversion of PDX1 from the 31-kDa to the 46-kDa form and translocation of the 46-kDa form into the nucleus was inhibited by the SAPK2 inhibitor SB 203580, and by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 (Fig. 3A). SAPK2 is a stress-activated protein kinase, the activity of which can be stimulated by treating cells with the stress-inducing agent sodium arsenite (1 mm). The effects of glucose on PDX1 molecular mass and intracellular location were mimicked by sodium arsenite, further supporting a role for SAPK2 in these events (Fig.3 B). As shown previously (16Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) the effects of arsenite were inhibited by SB 203580 but not by wortmannin and LY 294002 (Fig.3 B). The IC50 for SB 203580 on both glucose and arsenite effects was 3 μm (data not shown).Figure 3High glucose and chemical stress induce modification of PDX1.

Overexpression was confirmed by the appearance of a 38-kDa immunoreactive protein in extracts from transfected cells that was absent in untransfected cells (Fig. 4 A). In untransfected MIN6 cells treated with 3 mm glucose, PDX1 was present as the 31-kDa form in the cytoplasm. Following treatment with 16 mm glucose, PDX1 was converted to the 46-kDa form, which was present in the cytoplasm and nucleus. When cells transfected with SAPK2 were incubated in 3 mm glucose, PDX1 was present as the 46-kDa form in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Fig.4 B). This result suggested that overexpression of SAPK2 resulted in conversion of PDX1 to the 46-kDa form that was localized predominantly in the nucleus. Overexpression of SAPK2 also activated PDX1 DNA binding activity in low glucose-treated MIN6 cells (Fig.4 C). The critical events governing modification and activation of PDX1 appear to occur in the cytoplasm, as Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from MIN6 cells overexpressing SAPK2 clearly shows that the SAPK2 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and is undetectable in the β-cell nucleus (Fig.5 A).Figure 4Overexpression of SAPK2 mimics the effect of high glucose on PDX1.

Overexpression of SAPK2 in MIN6 cells had no effect on the control vector pGL-LUC, which lacked the insulin gene fragment, but gave a 5-fold stimulation of pGL-LUC200 activity, similar to that seen with 16 mm glucose (Fig. 5). The effect of overexpression of SAPK2 on the LUC200 activity was inhibited by SB 203580 (10 μm), confirming that these effects were the direct consequence of the higher SAPK2 activity in the transfected cells.DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that glucose activates PDX1 DNA binding activity and insulin promoter activity in pancreatic β-cells via a pathway involving SAPK2 (RK/p38). We also showed that SAPK2 in vitro activated recombinant PDX1 DNA binding activity, concomitant with a change in the molecular mass of PDX1 from 31 kDa to 46 kDa (16Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B.

In the present study, we show that glucose stimulates the conversion of PDX1 from a 31-kDa unphosphorylated to a 46-kDa phosphorylated form in isolated human islets of Langerhans (Fig. 1) and in MIN6 cells (Fig.4). The activation of PDX1, and translocation to the nucleus, were inhibited by SB 203580 and stimulated by arsenite and overexpression of SAPK2. This strongly supports a role for SAPK2 in these events. That glucose stimulates a rapid translocation of PDX1 to the nucleus is compatible with the results of a recent study showing that glucose stimulates translocation of a c-Myc-tagged PDX1 (IPF-1) from the nuclear periphery to the nucleoplasm (22Rafiq I. Kennedy H.J. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23241-23247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).SAPK2-dependent phosphorylation of PDX1 appears to represent the critical step in glucose-induced translocation to the nucleus and activation of DNA binding activity. However, it is unclear whether phosphorylation alone accounts for the observed change in size. It is possible that phosphorylation allows or promotes a second event, which is yet to be characterized. Phosphorylation may induce a conformational change in PDX1 that affects its mobility in SDS-PAGE, but the change in size could equally result from a further post-translational modification. Many transcription factors contain nuclear localization signals within their amino acid sequences, but others, such as PDX1, do not contain recognizable nuclear localization signals and may require modification at the post-translational level. Common modifications promoting nuclear localization include glycosylation (23Duverger E. Pellerin-Mendes C. Mayer R. Roche A. Monsigny M. J. Clin. Sci. 1995; 108: 1325-1332Google Scholar), and ubiquitination (24Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchiar F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 25Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), which modifies proteins through the addition of ubiquitin-like protein species such as SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-relatedmodifier 1). In the case of RanGAP (Ran-GTPase activating protein) (25Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), phosphorylation allows the addition of SUMO1, which alters the apparent molecular mass of the protein by 20 kDa, and promotes its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Similar events may be occurring with PDX1.Increased binding activity of transcription factors through phosphorylation can occur by several mechanisms. Many transcription factors become phosphorylated in the cytoplasm, stimulating movement into the nucleus (26Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). However, this is not always the case. For example, insulin stimulates the nuclear translocation of several kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (27Chen R. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can then directly phosphorylate nuclear protein substrates, or activate other kinases (28Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). In the present study SAPK2 is shown to be present exclusively in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the events governing PDX1 activation occur exclusively in the cytoplasm, promoting translocation of an active PDX1 into the nucleus.Glucose activation of PDX1 nuclear translocation occurs through a β-cell signaling pathway involving PI 3-kinase, and resulting in the activation of SAPK2. Hence, overexpression of SAPK2 can artificially promote PDX1 translocation to the nucleus even in lower glucose concentrations. In fact, overexpression of SAPK2 stimulated PDX1 binding activity to levels higher than those seen in high glucose (Fig.4). This hyper-stimulation of PDX1 by overexpression of SAPK2 occurred in 0.5 or 20 mm glucose, and appeared to reflect activation of PDX1 at maximum efficiency. In untransfected β-cells endogenous SAPK2 may represent a rate-limiting step in PDX1 activation, with glucose eliciting a controlled stimulation. Overexpression of SAPK2 to artificially high levels may therefore result in a hyperstimulation of the PDX1 activation pathway, resulting in an increased ability to phosphorylate and translocate all available PDX1 protein. This “hyperstimulation” of PDX1 binding activity did not appear to be reflected in the levels of insulin gene transcription relative to those observed in high glucose. This is not surprising, as PDX1 alone does not control transcription of the insulin gene. Several other factors (e.g. E1 and E2 site binding factors) are absolutely required for transcription of the insulin gene. Increased PDX1 binding activity will only exert an effect in the presence of these factors, and a maximum response would require their combined activities.Glucose stimulates PDX1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation through SAPK2. PDX1 is not unique in this respect; CREB, which also binds to the human insulin gene promoter (15Marshak S. Totary H. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15057-15062Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol.

Recent studies in SK-N-MC cells have shown that CREB-dependent transcription is triggered by co-transfection with SAPK2 (29Kim J. Kahn C.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which may act in this case through stimulation of a downstream kinase such as MAPKAPK2 (30Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). However, SAPK2 has been shown to directly phosphorylate several transcription factors, including ELK1, CHOP, and MEF2C (17Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Stress-activated protein kinases have also been implicated in the nuclear localization of other transcription factors. In EL-4 D6/76 cells, IL-1 activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase and of stress-activated protein kinases, promotes translocation of transcription factors NF-κB and IL-1 NF to the nucleus, resulting in the induction of IL-2 mRNA synthesis (30Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation induced nuclear translocation of Rel family proteins like NF-κB is induced by an extraordinary large number of agents (26Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), cellular stress being one example from many.It has been proposed that glucose increases endogenous insulin mRNA levels and insulin promoter activity in HIT T15 cells via exocytosis of insulin leading to autocrine stimulation of the β-cell insulin receptor (31Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moele T. Berggren P.-O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The insulin stimulatory effects on mRNA levels were mediated through PI 3-kinase, p70 S6 kinase, and calmodulin kinase pathways. We have also found that insulin (1–10 ng/ml) stimulates PDX1 DNA binding activity in human islets of Langerhans and the human insulin promoter (pGL-LUC200) activity in MIN-6 cells. 2H. Wu, W. M. Macfarlane, and K. Docherty, unpublished results. However, in our study the effects of insulin were inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (50 nm) and LY 294002 (10 μm) and by the SAPK2 inhibitor SB 203580 (7 μm), but not by the p70 S6 kinase inhibitor rapamycin (50 μm). This suggests that modulation of endogenous insulin mRNA levels by insulin may involve additional pathways to those described for the activation of PDX1.In summary, glucose stimulates translocation of the homeodomain transcription factor PDX1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in pancreatic β-cells via a cell signaling pathway involving SAPK2. This translocation is associated with a 5-fold increase in insulin promoter activity, and may represent a pivotal event in the nutrient regulation of insulin mRNA production. The homeodomain transcription factor PDX1 (pancreatic/duodenal homeobox-1), which has previously been called IPF1 (1Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T.

Amino acid-induced p70s6kactivation was completely inhibited by rapamycin but only partially inhibited by wortmannin. Moreover, amino acid concentration similarly affected the p70s6k activity, which was dependent on a rapamycin-resistant mutant (S2035I) of mTOR. These data indicate that mTOR is required for amino acid-dependent activation of p70s6k. The mechanism by which amino acids regulate p70s6k activity was further explored: 1) amino acid alcohols, which inhibit aminoacylation of tRNA by their competitive binding to tRNA synthetases, suppressed p70s6k activity; 2) suppression of p70s6k by amino acid depletion was blocked by cycloheximide or puromycin, which inhibit utilization of aminoacylated tRNA in cells; and 3) in cells having a temperature-sensitive mutant of histidyl tRNA synthetase, p70s6k was suppressed by a transition of cells to a nonpermissible temperature, which was partially restored by addition of high concentrations of histidine.

This protein kinase phosphorylates 40 S ribosomal S6 protein at five serine residues near the carboxyl terminus in vitro (4Bandi H.R. Ferrari S. Krieg J. Meyer H.E. Thomas G. J. Biol.

S6 phosphorylation has been proposed to be a factor regulating initiation of mRNA translation (see review in Ref. 8Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and the studies described above (5Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) concluded that the role of p70s6k in cell proliferation resides in specific regulation of translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins. Thus, p70s6k activity is considered to be a factor required for up-regulation of ribosomal biogenesis, which facilitates G1 progression during the cell cycle (9.Terada, N., Lucas, J. J., Szepesi, A., Franklin, R. A., Takase, K., and Gelfand, E. W. (1992) 186,1315–1321.Google Scholar). In regards to the activation of p70s6k, it appears there are at least two upstream regulatory pathways; one is through phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and the other is through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also termed FRAP and RAFT). Many growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor, activate PI3K through their binding to specific receptors, and previous studies using chemical inhibitors of PI3K, mutant platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and mutant PI3Ks, all indicated that PI3K is involved in the activation of p70s6kby growth factors (10Cheatham B.

Indeed, it has been demonstrated recently that PDK1, a downstream kinase of PI3K, phosphorylates p70s6k at Thr229 and activates the kinase (14Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar,15Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The involvement of mTOR in the regulation of p70s6k has been initially demonstrated by studies using the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (see reviews in Refs. 16Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar and 17Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Rapamycin associates with a cellular protein FKBP12 in cells, and the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex then binds to mTOR. It has also been demonstrated that mTOR is required for the inhibitory action of rapamycin on p70s6k (18Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Moreover, mTOR has an intrinsic protein serine/threonine kinase activity and regulates the activity and phosphorylation of p70s6k in vivo in a manner that is dependent on the kinase activity of mTOR (18Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Although initial reports concluded that mTOR did not directly phosphorylate p70s6k, it has been demonstrated that mTOR phosphorylates p70s6k at Thr389 in vitro (19Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In addition to p70s6k, mTOR regulates another translation regulatory molecule, eIF-4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (20Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). mTOR is demonstrated to phosphorylate the translation repressor protein 4E-BP1 at its serine and threonine residues (24Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated species of 4E-BP1 binds tightly to eIF-4E (an N7-methylguanosine cap-binding subunit of eIF-4F complex) and prevents eIF-4E from associating with eIF-4G (a scaffolding protein in eIF-4F complex). The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR is thought to release eIF-4E and facilitate translational initiation of capped mRNA (21Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Thus, mTOR regulates 1) ribosomal protein synthesis at the level of mRNA translation through p70s6k activity, and 2) overall protein synthesis by controlling translational initiation of capped mRNA through 4E-BP1. In contrast to the PI3K pathway, which is activated by various growth factors, it was unclear what factor physiologically regulated mTOR. A study on proteolytic responses to amino acid deprivation demonstrated that ribosomal S6 phosphorylation was induced by supplementation of amino acids (25Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), suggesting that amino acid concentration in culture media may be a regulatory factor for p70s6k. Indeed, Foxet al. (26Fox H.L. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Lynch C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C206-C213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that amino acids stimulate phosphorylation of p70s6k in rat adipocytes. More recently, Hara et al. (27Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) have reported that amino acid concentration regulates p70s6k activity and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The study demonstrated that a rapamycin-resistant mutant (p70Δ2–46/ΔCT104) of p70s6kwas resistant to amino acid deprivation, indicating that amino acid sufficiency and mTOR both signal to p70s6k through a common effector, which could be mTOR itself or an mTOR-controlled downstream element. In this study, we further explored the mechanism by which amino acid concentration regulates p70s6k. Human T-lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells were obtained from ATCC. Human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells were established from the bone marrow of a patient with metastatic tumor (28Douglass E.C. Valentine M. Etcubanas E. Parham B.L. Weber P.J. Houghton P.J. Houghton J.A. Green A.A. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1987; 45: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Rh30 cells constitutively expressing wild type mTOR (WT-mTOR) or a rapamycin-resistant mTOR (S2035I) were obtained by transfection of cells with pcDNA3-AU1mTORwt or pcDNA3-AU1mTORSI. BHK21 cells and their temperature-sensitive mutant temperature-sensitive (ts) BN250 were obtained from RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Rapamycin and wortmannin were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and stored in ethanol (1 mg/ml) and dimethyl sulfoxide (10 mm), respectively. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and stored as a 10 mg/ml stock solution. Puromycin (Sigma) was stored in distilled water (2 mg/ml). Amino acid alcohols (Sigma) l-leucinol,l-phenylalaninol, l-alaninol,l-histidinol, l-tyrosinol,l-methioninol, and d-leucinol were stored in distilled water (5 m). Methyl 2-aminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB) and 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid were obtained from Sigma and stored in distilled water at 200 and 100 mm, respectively. Jurkat cells and Rh30 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). For amino acid deprivation, exponentially growing cells were washed twice with amino acid-free RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 select-amine kit, catalog no. 17402, Life Technologies) and resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in the same amino acid-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS (catalog no. 26300, Life Technologies) for the indicated times at 37 °C in a 5%-CO2 incubator. In some experiments, individual amino acids were deprived instead of total amino acid deprivation. For amino acid supplementation, cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated in the amino acid-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS for 3–16 h. The same volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2× concentrations of amino acids +10% dialyzed FCS were added to the culture, and cells were incubated for the indicated times. The concentrations (in μm) of amino acids (1×) in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) were as follows: Gln, 2050; Asn, 380; His, 100; Trp 24; Pro, 170; Cyst, 410; Gly, 130; Val, 170; Leu, 380; Ile, 380; Ser, 290; Thr, 170; Phe, 90; Tyr, 110; Met, 100; Glu, 140; Asp 150; Arg, 1150; and Lys, 220. BHK21 and tsBN250 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS (HyClone) at 33 °C in a 5%-CO2 incubator. For transition of cells to nonpermissible temperature, culture plates were transferred to a 5%-CO2 incubator at 39 °C. Cells (2 × 106) were harvested, and the activities of the kinases were measured as we described previously (3Terada N. Franklin R.A. Lucas J.J. Blenis J. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12062-12068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The protein kinases in 250 μg of total cellular proteins were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies: for p70s6k, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acids of p70s6k (sc-230, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); for Akt, a goat polyclonal antibody against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 461–480 of human Akt1 (sc-1618, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); for p90rsk, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an epitope 682–724 of mouse Rsk1 (06–185, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and for Cdk2, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an epitope 283–298 of human Cdk2 (sc-163, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The kinase activity was measured by incorporation of 32P into specific substrate peptides (for p70s6k and p90rsk, an S6 peptide, RRRLSSLRA; for Akt, a Gsk3 peptide, GRPRTSSFAEG; for Cdk2, a histone H1 peptide, AVAAKKSPKKAKKPA). Cells (5 × 106) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μm leupeptin. Lysates were resolved by SDS 7.5% (for p70s6k) or 15% (for 4E-BP1) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After blocking of the filters with a solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, the filters were incubated with primary antibodies. The antibodies used for p70s6k are the same as described above. For 4E-BP1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant His-tagged rat PHAS1 (4E-BP1) was used (24Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Specific reactive proteins were detected by the ECL method, employing a donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells (2 × 106) were harvested, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of a buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 5 mmd-glucose, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The cell suspension was loaded on 100 μl of a buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mmd-glucose, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 μm nonradioactive His, and 1 μl (1 μCi) of [3H]His (1 mCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with or without 10 mm ofl-histidinol, layered on 300 μl of silicone oil/paraffin oil (92:8) in microcentrifuge tubes (29Kumakura T. Takase T. Terada N. Gelfand E.W. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 75-81Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After the indicated time (30 s, 2 min, 5 min, 30 min, or 60 min), cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm, and water phase was discarded. After washing surface of oil twice with 750 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, oil phases were discarded also. Cell pellets were then lysed in 50 μl of saline with 2% Triton X-100. Radioactivity of the total lysates was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The human T-lymphoblastoid cell line, Jurkat cells, were transferred to an amino acid-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS and incubated for the indicated times (amino acid deprivation). In addition, after culturing cells in the amino acid-free medium with 10% dialyzed FCS for 16 h, cells were transferred to the regular RPMI 1640 medium containing amino acids with 10% dialyzed FCS and incubated at the indicated times (amino acid supplementation). Initially, the activity of p70s6k was measured in the system, as well as the activities of other growth-related serine/threonine kinases, Akt, p90rsk, and Cdk2 (Fig.1). p70s6k activity decreased within 15 min after deprivation of amino acids and became undetectable within 30 min; levels remained undetectable throughout the time course. Additionally, supplementation of amino acids increased p70s6k activity within 15 min, and the activity reached a plateau level within 60 min. In contrast, the activity of Akt, which is a downstream kinase of PI3K (13Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), was not inhibited by amino acid deprivation, nor did it increase following amino acid supplementation. p90rsk is a downstream kinase of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and has the highest homology with p70s6k in the catalytic domains (30Banerjee P. Ahmad M.F. Grove J.R. Kozlosky C. Price D.J. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8550-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast to p70s6k, the activity of p90rsk transiently increased by transferring cells to an amino acid-free medium, and then decreased gradually. However, p90rsk remained partially active throughout the time course of the experiments. Additionally, amino acid supplementation transiently decreased p90rskactivity, but overall it did not dramatically alter kinase activity for 360 min. Cdk2 is active especially at the late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. Cdk2 activity was partially decreased by both amino acid deprivation and by supplementation within 30 min, but the kinase remained partially active throughout the time course. The hyperphosphorylated species of p70s6k, which correspond to the active form of the kinase, is determined as a band(s) with a lower mobility in immunoblots (9.Terada, N., Lucas, J. J., Szepesi, A., Franklin, R. A., Takase, K., and Gelfand, E. W. (1992) 186,1315–1321.Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hypophosphorylated p70s6k, which corresponds to the inactive form of the kinase, is determined as a band with the highest mobility. Cells treated with an amino acid-starved medium demonstrated only the hypophosphorylated species of p70s6k, and supplementation of amino acids increased the hyperphosphorylated species of p70s6k within 5–15 min (Fig. 2). In contrast to p70s6k, amino acid deprivation/supplementation essentially did not alter the phosphorylation status of p90rsk, similarly evaluated by a mobility shift in an immunoblot analysis (data not shown). The phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1, another downstream event of mTOR, was also examined by a gel mobility shift in an immunoblot assay (20Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 22von Manteuffel S.R. Gingras A.-C. Ming X.-F. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.-P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Cells treated with an amino acid-starved medium demonstrated bands with higher mobilities, corresponding to the hypophosphorylated species of 4E-BP1. Amino acid supplementation induced bands with lower mobilities, which correspond to hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP1, within 15 min. These hyperphosphorylated bands became more predominant within 1–3 h. Additionally, hyperphosphorylated species of p70s6kand 4E-BP1 were eliminated by amino acid deprivation within 5–15 min and 30 min, respectively (data not shown). Because amino acid concentrations affected p70s6k without affecting Akt activity, it does not seem that amino acids regulate p70s6k through PI3K. Furthermore, similar effects of amino acids on p70s6k and 4E-BP1 suggested that mTOR, or an unidentified factor that mediates mTOR signals to both p70s6k and 4E-BP1, is involved in amino acid-induced activation of p70s6k. In order to further investigate these observations, the effects of wortmannin and rapamycin on amino acid-induced p70s6k activation were examined. Jurkat cells were treated in an amino acid-free medium for 16 h and then supplemented with total amino acids or none for 1 h in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, wortmannin (100 nm) and rapamycin (10 ng/ml), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, p70s6k activation induced by amino acid addition was inhibited by rapamycin. In contrast, wortmannin at the concentration that is known to inhibit PI3K activity over 95% inhibited p70s6k only by ∼25%. In contrast, Akt, which was already active in the cell culture regardless of amino acid concentrations, was inhibited by wortmannin by about 60%. Similar to the p70s6k activity, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation induced by amino acid addition was inhibited by rapamycin but not by wortmannin (data not shown). Rapid activation of p70s6k (within 15 min) after re-addition of total amino acids suggested that this may be independent of newly synthesized proteins. In order to confirm this, cycloheximide was added to the culture before addition of total amino acids. Cycloheximide (100 μm), which inhibits protein synthesis over 95%, did not inhibit amino acid-induced p70s6kactivation (data not shown). These data indicate that amino acids activate p70s6k independent of newly synthesized proteins. In order to further investigate mechanisms by which amino acids regulate the mTOR pathway, we utilized cells constitutively expressing a rapamycin-resistant mTOR. Human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells constitutively expressing either WT-mTOR or a rapamycin-resistant mutant (S2035I-mTOR) were obtained by co-transfection of the mTOR expression vectors and a neo-resistant gene expression vector, followed by G418 selection as described previously (31Sugiyama H. Papst P. Fujita M. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Parental Rh30 cells, WT-mTOR Rh30 cells, or S2035I-mTOR Rh30 cells were first incubated for 3 h in an amino acid-deprived medium. Rapamycin (10 ng/ml) was then added to the culture. Thirty min after addition of rapamycin, total amino acids were added, and cells were incubated for the indicated times. As shown in Fig.4, amino acid supplementation was not able to induce p70s6k in the presence of rapamycin in parental Rh30 cells or WT-mTOR Rh30 cells, as shown in Jurkat cells above. In contrast, amino acids did induce p70s6k in the presence of rapamycin in S2035I-mTOR Rh30 cells. The mechanism by which amino acids regulate p70s6k activity was further explored. Fox et al. (26Fox H.L. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Lynch C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C206-C213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that supplementation of a set of neutral amino acids, which were preferentially transported by system L transporter, was able to induce p70s6kphosphorylation. In contrast, another set of neutral amino acids preferentially transported by system A or ASC, or a set of charged amino acids, was less effective. A potential explanation for these results is that a specific amino acid transporter, such as system L, is linked to activation of p70s6k. In order to investigate this possibility, we examined the effects of specific inhibitors of various amino acid transporter systems on amino acid-induced p70s6k activation. There are three major amino acid transporter systems known for uptake of neutral amino acids; system A, system L, and system ASC. It is reported that over 90% of neutral amino acids are transported through these three systems in mammalian cells (32Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Each of the three systems has a model substrate that has a high affinity to the system. MeAIB has a high affinity to system A and competitively inhibits transport of other amino acids through the system. In contrast, MeAIB does not significantly affect transport of amino acids through other transporters, including system L and system ASC. Similarly, 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid and cysteine can competitively inhibit amino acids-transport through system L and system ASC, respectively. Jurkat cells were initially incubated with amino acid-deprived medium for 16 h, and then 116 concentrations of total amino acids contained in regular RPMI 1640 medium were added to the culture in the presence or absence of these competitive model substrates (10 mm). This concentration of total amino acids was able to induce approximately one-half the activity of p70s6k when compared with addition of 1× total amino acids of RPMI 1640 medium. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the model substrates partially inhibit p70s6kactivation induced by amino acid supplementation. This is inconsistent with the idea that a specific neutral transporter is linked to p70s6k activation. If amino acid transporters are signaling mediators that sense extracellular amino acid concentration and subsequently transduce signals to p70s6k, then the data suggest that all three systems should link to p70s6kactivation. Alternatively, the data may be explained by altered intracellular amino acid concentration. The mechanism by which the cell recognizes the lack of an amino acid seems reasonably well understood in bacteria and yeast, and basically it is through increased concentration of intracellular deacylated tRNA or, in some cases, through reduced availability of aminoacylated tRNA (see under “Discussion”). In order to investigate the involvement of the tRNA aminoacylation in the regulation of p70s6k in mammalian cells, we initially utilized amino acid alcohols. The alcohol derivatives of amino acids inhibit their corresponding tRNA synthetases and thus prevent aminoacyl-tRNA formation (33Hansen B.S. Vaughan M.H. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3854-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For example,l-histidinol inhibits l-His binding to tRNAHis synthetase and thereby increases deacylated tRNAHis. Various amino acid alcohols were added to exponentially growing Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig.6 A, addition of 2 mm of either leucinol, phenylalaninol, alaninol, histidinol, tyrosinol, o"

Contrarily, withdrawal of medium amino acids from the hepatoma cell line H4IIE does not abolish the ability of insulin to stimulate p70 and 4E-BP1. The addition of 3-methyladenine (3MA) to H4IIE cells deprived of amino acids inhibited the increment in protein degradation caused by amino acid withdrawal nearly completely at 10 mm and also strongly inhibited the ability of insulin to stimulate p70 and 4E-BP1 at 10 mm. Treatment of H4IIE cells with 3MA did not alter the ability of insulin to activate tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, or mitogen-activated protein kinase. In conclusion, the ability of H4IIE cells to maintain the insulin responsiveness of the mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent signaling pathways impinging on p70 and 4E-BP1 without exogenous amino acids reflects the generation of amino acids endogenously through a 3MA-sensitive process, presumably autophagy, a major mechanism of facultative protein degradation in liver.

Considerable progress has been achieved recently in the understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in translational control. In addition to the many eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP1, eIF-4E-binding protein 1; m7GpppN, 7-methylguanosine 5′-triphosphate-containing mRNA “cap”; CHO-IR, Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptors; 3MA, 3-methyladenine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; p70, p70 S6 kinase; PI3-k, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TCA, trichloroacetic acid. that are regulated by phosphorylation, two translational regulatory proteins,i.e. p70 S6 kinase (p70) and PHAS1/eIF-4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), have been extensively studied as targets of growth factor-regulated signaling pathways (for review, see Refs. 1Avruch J.

Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). p70 is activated in response to insulin and mitogens through a multisite phosphorylation and catalyzes the multiple phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal protein S6 in vivo; this kinase plays a critical regulatory role in the translation of a class of transcripts that contain a 5′ oligopyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start site structure (3Jefferies H.B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 exhibits rapid and multiple phosphorylationin vivo in response to insulin and mitogens (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The initiation factor eIF-4E binds to the 5′ cap structure of mRNA (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) and through its binding to the scaffold protein eIF-4G recruits the mRNA to a complex, known as the eIF-4F (4Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 in the dephosphorylated form binds to eIF-4E (5Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) in a manner competitive with eIF-4G, thereby inhibiting translation of a subset of mRNAs (4Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar). The insulin- and mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 inhibits 4E-BP1 binding to eIF-4E, making eIF-4E available for incorporation into the eIF-4F complex via eIF-4G (6Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and restoring translation. At least two distinct signaling pathways underlying activation of p70 and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 have been identified. One input controlling p70 and 4E-BP1 is provided by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-k), which is recruited to the activated receptor tyrosine kinases in response to insulin and mitogens. Thus, treatment of cells with PI3-k inhibitors such as wortmannin inhibits activation of p70 and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in response to insulin and mitogens (7Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 8Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Most importantly, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, phosphorylates p70 in vitro selectively at Thr-252, a PI3-k-stimulated and wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation site in vivo (9Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), with a resultant increase in p70 activity (10Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr.

Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 was first identified as an activator of protein kinase B (also called Akt and RacPK), another downstream effector of PI3-k; protein kinase B activation in vivo activates both p70 and 4E-BP1 indirectly, through an unknown mechanism (12Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 553-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 13Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Another pathway contributing to activation of p70 and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin proteins (named FRAP, RAFT-1, RAPT-1, or mTOR; for review, see Refs. 14Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar and 15Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev.

Rapamycin, in complex with the cytosolic 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), binds to mTOR and inhibits its protein kinase activityin vitro (18Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), and recent studies have established that mTOR is the rapamycin-sensitive upstream regulator of both p70 (18Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and 4E-BP1 (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.-P.

These two targets, however, are regulated by separate mTOR-controlled pathways that bifurcate at or downstream of mTOR (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.-P.

The phosphorylation of ribosomal S6, p70, and 4E-BP1 in vivois governed by the availability of amino acids (22Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Rat hepatocytes incubated in the absence of amino acids exhibit a decrease in the phosphorylation of S6 that is rapidly reversed by addition of amino acids but blocked by rapamycin (22Blommaart E.F.C.

Withdrawal of amino acids from the nutrient medium of CHO-IR or HEK293 cells results in a rapid deactivation of endogenous or recombinant p70 and dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which become unresponsive to various agonists, including insulin and recombinant PI3-k (24Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Amino acid readdition restores p70 activity and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. The effect of amino acid repletion on p70 and 4E-BP1 is blocked by rapamycin; moreover, the p70 mutant Δ2–46/ΔCT104, which is resistant to inhibition by rapamycin, is also resistant to inhibition by amino acids withdrawal, suggesting that the amino acids and mTOR signal to p70 through a common effector mechanism (24Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we proposed that amino acid insufficiency and loss of mTOR activity both act as override switches, which inhibit p70 activation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation irrespective of the receptor tyrosine kinase and PI3-k signals. Cells regulate amino acid pools in part by the degradation of endogenous proteins; this becomes the only source of amino acids when exogenous amino acids are unavailable. A major mechanism for degrading intracellular proteins in response to amino acid deprivation is autophagy or macroautophagy (for review, see Refs. 25Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and 26Hirsimaki P. Arstila A.U. Trump B.F. Marzella L. Arstila A.U. Trump B.F. Pathobiology of Cell Membranes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1983: 201-235Google Scholar). Autophagy is a major source of endogenous amino acids for gluconeogenesis and other critical pathways early in starvation, and extracellular amino acids have been shown to be the primary regulators of autophagy in hepatocytes of perfused liver (27Schworer C.M. Shiffer K.A. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7652-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mortimore G.E. Schworer C.M. Nature. 1977; 270: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and isolated hepatocytes (29Sommercorn J.M. Swick R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4816-4821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagic proteolysis is enhanced in the absence of amino acids, and it is suppressed by amino acids at concentrations equivalent to the upper physiological limit (27Schworer C.M. Shiffer K.A. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7652-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Kadowaki M. Wert Jr., J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16322-16327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the control of autophagy by amino acids are largely unknown. In yeast, autophagy is activated in response to nutrient insufficiency and appears to be regulated by TOR, the yeast homolog of mTOR (31Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). In view of the prominent role of autophagy in hepatic proteolysis, and the evidence for TOR regulation of autophagy in yeast, we reasoned that cultured hepatocytes might provide an attractive system in which to study the role of amino acids and mTOR signaling pathways in the regulation of translation and autophagy. H4IIE cells, a cultured hepatoma cell line, have been used to study the molecular mechanism of p70 activation by various agonists, including insulin (32Nemenoff R.A. Gunsalus J.R. Avruch J. Arch. Biochem. Biophs. 1986; 245: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In H4IIE cells, in contrast to our previous finding in CHO-IR cells or HEK293 cells, withdrawal of amino acids from the nutrient medium did not eradicate the ability of insulin to stimulate p70 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The addition of 3-methyladenine (3MA), an inhibitor of autophagy (33Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 34Blommaart E.F. Krause U. Schellens J.P. Vreeling-Sindelarova H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), strongly and selectively inhibited the insulin activation of p70 in amino acid-deprived H4IIE cells but inhibited p70 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation only slightly in amino acid-replete cells. Thus, in cultured hepatoma cells deprived of exogenous amino acids, autophagy serves to supply amino acids from endogenous proteins in amounts sufficient to enable a full response of the p70 and 4E-BP1 to insulin.

The anti-eIF-4E antibody and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The phospho-specific (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and the non-phospho-specific antibodies against p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were from New England Biolabs. Rat hepatoma H4IIE cells were grown in minimal essential medium α with 10% fetal calf serum on 6-cm culture dishes. Cells were first incubated in minimal essential medium α without fetal calf serum for 24 h, washed once with DMEM lacking amino acids, and incubated in the same medium for the times indicated for up to 2 h. Readdition of amino acids restored the concentration of amino acids to the level found in complete DMEM. Treatments of cells were terminated by removal of the medium followed by freezing down with liquid nitrogen; then cells were stored at −80 °C until lysis. Cells were extracted into ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mmNaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mmEGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and the extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C before analysis. p70 activity was determined by immunocomplex assay using 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrates. Immunoprecipitation of p70 and the kinase assay conditions were as described (9Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Assay samples containing 32P-S6 were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel, and radioactivity was quantified with a BAS-2000 Bioimaging analyzer (Fuji). Aliquots of the supernatants of cell extracts were heated for 7 min at 90 °C, cooled on ice, and recentrifuged. The heat-soluble proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoblotted with the polyclonal antibody against 4E-BP1 (1:500 dilution), and visualized using the ABC kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Vectastain). Cell extracts were incubated with m7GTP-Sepharose, and bound proteins were eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, mixed with SDS-sample buffer, and heated for 7 min at 90 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with the polyclonal antibody against 4E-BP1 (1:500 dilution) or the anti-eIF-4E antibody (1:2000 dilution). Autophagic activity was determined by measurement of the degradation of long-lived proteins as described previously (35Ogier Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. H4IIE cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with serum-free minimal essential medium α and labeled in the same medium containing 0.2 μCi/ml [14C]valine for 18 h at 37 °C. After three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to remove unincorporated radioisotope, the cells were incubated in DMEM lacking amino acids, complete DMEM, or DMEM lacking amino acids with 10 mm 3MA, containing 0.1% of bovine serum albumin and 10 mmunlabeled valine for 1 h, at which time short-lived proteins were being degraded. Then incubation to measure the degradation of long-lived proteins was initiated by replacing the medium with the same fresh medium and continued for up to 2 h. At the indicated times, the cells and media were collected separately. The cells were then frozen and scraped into 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Radiolabeled proteins in the cells and media were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated from the soluble radioactivity by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and then dissolved in 1 ml of Soluene 350 (Packard). The radioactivities in the fractions soluble and insoluble in TCA recovered from the cells and media were measured by scintillation counting. The rate of protein degradation attributable to autophagic activity was calculated as a percentage of the radioactivities in the fractions soluble in TCA recovered from the cells and media to total radioactivity recovered from the cells and media. Aliquots of cell extracts lysed in ice-cold buffer A containing 1 mm vanadate were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. PI3-k activity in the immunoprecipitates was determined as described previously (36Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously using CHO-IR and HEK293 cells (24Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), we observed in H4IIE cells that brief (2-h) withdrawal of amino acids from serum-deprived culture medium diminished substantially the activity of endogenous p70, and readdition of amino acids activated p70 activity (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 6). In the previous study in CHO-IR and HEK293 cells, withdrawal of amino acids from the culture medium inhibited almost completely the ability of insulin to stimulate p70 activity (24Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). By contrast, insulin activation of p70 in H4IIE cells was robust despite the withdrawal of exogenous amino acids (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). The ability of insulin to stimulate p70 activity in amino acid-deprived H4IIE cells was still maintained when the duration of amino acid withdrawal was increased from 2 to 6 h (data not shown). This pattern is similar to that exhibited when amino acid-deprived CHO-IR cells are treated with very low levels of exogenous amino acids. Readdition of amino acids to CHO-IR cells at 10–12% the level usually found in DMEM does not increase basal p70 activity but largely restores the responsiveness of p70 to insulin (24Hara K.

The effect of amino acid deprivation on 4E-BP1 and its association with eIF-4E in H4IIE cells was therefore examined. 4E-BP1 binds to eIF-4E; previous work has established that the insulin- and mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 inhibits its binding to eIF-4E (5Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), whereas rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 enhances its binding to eIF-4E. Phosphorylation states of 4E-BP1 in H4IIE cell extracts were monitored indirectly by shifts in the migration of 4E-BP1 polypeptides on SDS-PAGE and by estimation of the amount of 4E-BP1 complexed with eIF-4E, the latter isolated using m7GTP-Sepharose. H4IIE cells deprived of amino acids for 2 h exhibited a predominance of rapidly migrating bands (Fig.2 A, lane 1) and considerable binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF-4E (Fig. 2 B,lane 1). Readdition of amino acids diminished the abundance of the more rapidly migrating bands, increased the abundance of the slowest migrating, hyperphosphorylated bands (Fig. 2 A, compare lane 5 with lane 1), and decreased the amount of 4E-BP1 recovered in association with eIF-4E (Fig.2 B, compare lane 5 with lane 1). Addition of insulin in the absence of amino acids also caused an upshift in the mobility of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) and the decrease of 4E-BP1 complexed with eIF-4E (Fig.2 B, lane 2). Thus, in H4IIE cells, withdrawal of exogenous amino acids promotes 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation but does not abolish insulin stimulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The ability of insulin to maintain p70 activity in amino acid-deprived H4IIE cells enabled us to examine whether the upstream inputs required for the insulin-induced increase in p70 activity are also necessary for the increase in p70 activity caused by amino acid repletion. H4IIE cells were subjected to amino acid withdrawal for 2 h, and they were pretreated with wortmannin, rapamycin (each for 30 min), or PD98059 (for 1 h) before stimulation with insulin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–5) or during readdition of amino acids (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–9). As expected, insulin activation of p70 was strongly inhibited by wortmannin and rapamycin but minimally altered by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 inhibitor PD98059. The increase in p70 activity induced by amino acid readdition exhibited a sensitivity to inhibition by rapamycin indistinguishable from that shown by p70 activated in response to insulin (Fig. 1, A, compare lane 8with lane 4, and C); however, the activation of p70 by amino acids was considerably more resistant to inhibition by wortmannin than was the activation induced by insulin (Fig. 1,A, compare lane 7 with lane 3, andB). Inhibition of the insulin-activated p70 by wortmannin was complete and maximal at 30 nm (Fig. 1 B), whereas much higher concentrations of wortmannin failed to inhibit amino acid-induced p70 activation to the extent achieved by much lower concentrations of wortmannin acting on insulin-stimulated cells (Fig.1 B). With regard to 4E-BP1, pretreatment of H4IIE cells with 100 ng/ml rapamycin inhibited the ability of both insulin and amino acids to cause the upshift of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and7) and the decrease of 4E-BP1 binding to eIF-4E (Fig.2 B, lanes 4 and 7). Pretreatment with 100 nm wortmannin before insulin stimulation resulted in a maximal downshift of 4E-BP1 mobility and increment in eIF-4E binding (Fig. 2, A, lane 3, and B, lane 3). However, as with p70, the ability of amino acids to promote the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was much less sensitive to inhibition by wortmannin than was the insulin-stimulated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig.2, A, lane 6, and B, lane 6). Taken together, these data show that in H4IIE cells after amino acid withdrawal, as in amino acid-replete cells, both rapamycin- and wortmannin-sensitive signaling pathways are required for the insulin stimulation of p70 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Because mTOR is the rapamycin-sensitive molecule in both circumstances, a conclusion supported by the observation is that inhibition of mTOR in vivo by rapamycin abolishes the response to amino acids and insulin with a parallel sensitivity and to a comparable extent. By contrast, the much lower potency of wortmannin in inhibiting the response of p70 and 4E-BP1 to amino acids compared with insulin could reflect the requirement for a lesser input from PI3-k in the response to amino acids compared with insulin. Alternatively, the ability of wortmannin to inhibit the response to amino acids may not reflect wortmannin inhibition of PI3-k but the ability of the higher concentrations of wortmannin to inhibit mTOR (8Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The sustained responsiveness of p70 and 4E-BP1 to insulin in H4IIE cells after amino acid withdrawal, mimicking the behavior of CHO-IR cells incubated in the presence of the low concentrations of exogenous amino acids (24Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), suggested that H4IIE cells might be better able than are CHO-IR cells to generate amino acids from endogenous sources during the amino acid deprivation. Autophagy is a ubiquitous mechanism for the degradation of endogenous proteins and is especially active in liver and isolated hepatocytes (28Mortimore G.E. Schworer C.M. Nature. 1977; 270: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 29Sommercorn J.M. Swick R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4816-4821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Kadowaki M. Wert Jr., J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16322-16327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid deprivation is known to enhance and probably initiate this process. We assessed the effects of amino acid sufficiency on the degradation of endogenous H4IIE proteins by labeling cells with [14C]valine for 16 h. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline to remove the bulk of unincorporated [14C]valine, the cells were transferred to the medium containing or lacking amino acids, and the degradation of long-lived proteins was determined by the release of TCA-soluble [14C]valine. Approximately 3–4% of total [14C]valine was released per hour during 2 h of incubation in the presence of exogenous amino acids; [14C]valine release was ∼50% higher when H4IIE cells were incubated in medium lacking amino acids (Fig.3, A and B, comparelane 1 with lane 2). Moreover, 3MA, a widely used inhibitor of autophagy (33Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 34Blommaart E.F. Krause U. Schellens J.P. Vreeling-Sindelarova H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) inhibited [14C]valine release from amino acid-deprived H4IIE cells to an extent similar to that achieved by amino acid readdition (Fig. 3 B, comparelane 3 with lane 2). Addition of 3MA in the presence of exogenous amino acids did not decrease the rate of [14C]valine release beyond the lower rate induced by the readdition of amino acids per se (data not shown). These findings are consistent with earlier reports and support the conclusion that autophagy is the major mechanism for the facultative increase in endogenous protein degradation in H4IIE cells in response to amino acid withdrawal and can be inhibited by amino acid readdition or 3MA. Reasoning that any effects of 3MA that are abrogated by amino acid repletion can be attributed to the ability of 3MA to inhibit autophagy, we next examined the effect of 3MA on insulin activation of p70 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in both the presence and absence of exogenous amino acids. H4IIE cells were serum-deprived for 24 h, followed by incubation for an additional 2 h in DMEM or DMEM lacking amino acids, in the absence or presence of 10 mm 3MA. 100 nm insulin was then added to some incubations, and the cells were harvested 10 min thereafter. In H4IIE cells incubated in the absence of exogenous amino acids, the ability of insulin to activate p70 was inhibited ∼90% by 3MA (Fig.4 A, compare lane 3with lane 4). By contrast, the insulin activation of p70 in amino acid-replete cells was inhibited only modestly (∼30% inhibition) by the same concentration of 3MA (Fig. 4 A, compare lane 5 with lane 6). We also examined dose-dependent effects of 3MA on insulin- and amino acid-induced activation of p70 during incubation in the culture medium lacking exogenous amino acids. The inhibition of insulin activation of p70 by 3MA was observed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 B). By contrast, 3MA barely inhibited activation of p70 by amino acids (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of 3MA on insulin activation of p70 in amino acid-deprived cells is not attributable to the direct inhibition of p70 activity by 3MA in situ. With regard to 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, the ability of insulin to upshift the mobility of 4E-BP1 (Fig.5 A, lane 3) and decrease the amount of 4E-BP1 complexed with eIF-4E (Fig.5 B, lane 3) in amino acid-deprived cells was completely inhibited by 10 mm 3MA (Fig. 5, A,lane 4, and B, lane 4), whereas the inhibitory effect of 3MA on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in amino acid-replete H4IIE cells was greatly attenuated; in amino acid-replete cells, considerable 4E-BP1 persisted in the most slowly migrating band, and the amount of 4E-BP1 complexed with eIF-4E greatly diminished despite the presence of 10 mm 3MA (Fig. 5, A andB, compare lanes 4 and 6). Thus, 3MA inhibits insulin-induced p70 activation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation to a much greater extent in amino acid-deprived cells than in amino acid-replete cells, consistent with the conclusion that in H4IIE cells incubated without exogenous amino acids, amino acids derived from autophagic proteolysis are critical to maintain the responsiveness of p70 and 4E-BP1 to insulin. We examined effects of 3MA on several steps of insulin signaling upstream of p70 and 4E-BP1. Treatment of H4IIE cells with 3MA had no significant inhibitory effects on insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous insulin receptor substrate proteins (Fig.6 A, lanes 3, 4,7,and 8) or on the insulin-stimulated increase in PI3-k immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.6 B, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), either in the presence or absence of exogenous amino acids. The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation at activating sites (TEY) on the endogenous p44/42 MAPK, monitored by immunoblotting with the phosphopeptide antibody against p44/42 MAPK, was not significantly altered by 3MA (Fig. 6 C, lanes 3, 4,7, and 8). Thus, the inhibitory effects of 3MA on insulin stimulation of p70 and 4E-BP1 in amino acid-deprived H4IIE cells reflect the inhibition of a signal transduction response clearly distinguished from those controlled directly by insulin. Nevertheless, the provision of endogenous amino acids through autophagy is indispensable to the ability of insulin to effectively increase the phosphorylation of p70 and 4E-BP1 in amino acid-deprived cells. When amino acids are supplied exogenously, however, autophagy is largely dispensable for insulin signaling to p70 and 4E-BP1. Previous work in several cell lines had shown that removal of amino acids from the nutrient medium blocked selectively the ability of insulin to regulate the phosphorylation of p70 and 4E-BP1 (24Hara K.

The present study was undertaken to explore the mechanism that enabled H4IIE hepatoma cells deprived of amino acids to maintain the responsiveness of p70 and 4E-BP1 to insulin. The resistance of hepatoma cells to amino acid withdrawal was also observed by Pattiet al. (38Patti M.E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that insulin was able to activate p70 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in FAO hepatoma cells after the complete omission of amino acids from the nutrient medium. The similarity in the responses to insulin shown by H4IIE cells deprived completely of exogenous amino acids and CHO-IR cells replete with low concentrations of amino acids (<0.25 of concentrations usually present in DMEM) led us to inquire as to whether H4IIE cells had a means to generate amino acids from endogenous sources."

The α-1 repeat encompasses portions of TMS2 and TMS3 in the amino-terminal domain, and the α-2 repeat encompasses portions of TMS8 and TMS9 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig. 1 A). The α-1 and α-2 repeats have been proposed to have similar roles in the exchange mechanism since they have similar sequences and are both modeled to be near the extracellular surface, and parallel mutations have similar effects on exchange activity (20Nicoll D.A.

The importance of cysteine residues in the exchanger has been examined previously. The activity of wild-type NCX1 expressed inXenopus oocytes is not inhibited by application of several sulfhydryl-modifying reagents (16Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, accessible cysteines of NCX1 in the oocyte membrane are not critical for ion translocation. However, Pierce et al. (22Pierce G.N. Ward R. Philipson K.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) found that the exchanger, in sarcolemmal membrane vesicles, was sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. Also, disulfide bonds are present in the exchanger as determined by gel mobility differences under reducing and nonreducing conditions in mutant (23Santacruz-Toloza L.K. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A197Google Scholar) and wild-type (24Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that redox modification of the exchanger stimulated activity and suggested that the stimulation was due to a rearrangement of disulfide bonds. We have further examined the topology of NCX1.1. Mutants with introduced cysteines were constructed and examined for sensitivity to membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagents. We have also examined the role of cysteine residues in the exchanger by replacing all of the cysteines and characterizing the cysteineless exchanger. The modified canine NCX1.1 cDNA (20Nicoll D.A.

Mutations were generated in 300–500-base pair cassettes using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by sequencing. In S875C, an additional mutation (A873T) was inadvertently generated. All other mutants contained only the intended mutation. Full-length exchangers were constructed by subcloning the mutagenized cassettes into the wild-type exchanger. The cysteineless exchanger (clone H) was constructed by a series of subcloning and mutagenic steps. The entire clone H was verified by sequencing. In some instances, cysteines were introduced into the cysteineless background. The names of these mutants are preceded by H: (e.g. H:A792C). All mutants without the H: indication are in the wild-type background (e.g. V168C). cRNA was synthesized using mMessage mMachine (Ambion Inc.) and injected into Xenopus oocytes. Na+-Ca2+exchange activity was measured as Na+gradient-dependent uptake of 45Ca2+into oocytes as described (16Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals) on exchange activity, the oocytes were preincubated for 10 min with the reagent in the bathing medium or injected with MTS reagents at a final concentration of ∼10 mm as described previously (16Doering A.E.

Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity was also examined as outward exchange current using the inside-out giant patch technique (26Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled, fire-polished to a final inner diameter of ∼20–30 μm, and coated with a mixture of Parafilm and mineral oil. To excise a membrane patch, the oocyte vitelline membrane was first removed manually in an isotonic solution identical to the solution for seal formation (110 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7). After membrane excision, solutions were rapidly changed using a computer-controlled 20-channel solution switcher. Recordings of the exchange current were obtained using the following solutions: pipette solution (100 mm N-methylglucamine, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 8 mmCa(OH)2, 0.1 mm niflumic acid, and 0.15 mm ouabain, pH 7 (using methanesulfonic acid)) and bath solution (100 mm CsOH or NaOH, 20 mmtetraethylammonium hydroxide, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 0 or 5.75 mm Ca(OH)2(0 or 1 μm free Ca2+), pH 7 (using methanesulfonic acid)). Solutions with higher free Ca2+concentration were prepared by adding 10 μmCa(OH)2 in the absence of EGTA. Calcium concentrations were calculated according to the Chelator program (27Schoenmaker T.J. Visser G.J. Flick G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). PClamp software was used for data acquisition and analysis. Data were acquired on line at 4 ms/point and filtered at 50 Hz using an 8-pole Bessel filter. Experiments were performed at 35 °C and a holding potential of 0 mV. The strategy for examining the topology of the exchanger consisted of introducing cysteine residues at sites modeled to be near the membrane surface. These residues might be accessible to sulfhydryl reagents, and modification of the residues might have functional consequences. Mutant exchangers were expressed in Xenopusoocytes, and the effects of MTS sulfhydryl-modifying reagents on activity were examined. The reagents MTSET (positively charged), MTSES (negatively charged), and MTSEA (neutral and positively charged species in equilibrium) were used. Oocytes were either incubated in or injected with the MTS reagent to determine if the introduced cysteine was reactive with extracellular or intracellular reagent, respectively. This strategy was previously used to map loop b of the exchanger to the intracellular surface (16Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the wild-type exchanger contains 15 native cysteines, this approach was possible because the wild-type exchanger, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, is not inhibited by application of any of the sulfhydryl reagents used in this study (16Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is demonstrated in Fig.2 A for MTSET, MTSES, and MTSEA. However, as noted previously (16Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the wild-type exchanger expressed in oocytes is sometimes stimulated by intracellular application of MTSET (Fig. 2 A). The extent of stimulation is a function of the level of exchange activity expressed in the oocyte (Fig.2 B). When the activity is low (<20 pmol/oocyte/10 min), stimulation is inversely related to the level of activity. At high levels of activity, stimulation is low or nonexistent. Stimulation is at least partially reversible by treating cells with dithiothreitol (Fig. 2 C) and requires expression of a functional exchanger since oocytes injected with nonfunctional mutant exchangers do not display exchange activity following injections of MTSET (data not shown). Stimulation is not restricted to intracellular MTSET. Both MTSES and MTSEA also sometimes stimulate the exchanger. Stimulation by these reagents has most often been observed with mutants when low levels of activity were expressed. For example, mutant Y184C is stimulated by intracellular MTSEA (see Fig. 6). The extent of stimulation by MTSEA appears to follow the same relationship as seen for the extent of stimulation of the wild-type exchanger by MTSET (Fig. 2 B,closed circles). Although the wild-type exchanger is not inhibited by sulfhydryl-modifying reagents when expressed in oocytes, it is still possible that mutants with introduced cysteine residues have altered conformations that result in increased accessibility of native cysteines. Thus, to further aid in topological analysis and also to determine the importance of native cysteine residues, a cysteineless exchanger was constructed. Initially, each individual cysteine residue (except Cys-383 and Cys-387, which were mutated together) was mutated to an alanine to determine if any single cysteine was crucial to exchange activity. In all cases, except for Cys-730, the cysteine-to-alanine mutation resulted in a functional exchanger (Fig. 3). Although mutant C730A was inactive, the exchanger did tolerate a serine residue at this position. Two of the cysteine mutants (C20A and C792A) expressed <50% of wild-type activity. These two residues have been shown to form a disulfide bond (23Santacruz-Toloza L.K. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A197Google Scholar). Two other mutants (C383A,C387A and C933A) expressed ∼150% of wild-type activity. Different levels of activity may reflect the levels of expression at the cell surface or altered turnover rates. Thus, the cysteineless exchanger contained a serine at position 730 and an alanine at all other cysteine positions. This construct is designated HH, and the names of any mutants in the cysteineless background are preceded by H: (e.g. H:G837C). The cysteineless exchanger exhibits near wild-type levels of exchange activity (Fig. 4) as measured by45Ca2+ uptake. Like the wild-type exchanger, it was sometimes stimulated by intracellular MTSET application (Fig.2 D). The amount of stimulation of the cysteineless exchanger by intracellular MTSET was also related to the level of exchanger activity (data not shown). To further compare the cysteineless and wild-type exchangers, electrophysiological properties were studied using the giant patch technique (26Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the cysteineless Na+-Ca2+ exchange current were similar to those of the wild-type current measured under the same conditions (Fig.5). Application of cytoplasmic Na+, when Ca2+ (8 mm) was present in the pipette, elicited an outward current as the applied Na+ exchanged with pipette Ca2+. The exchange current peaked and then decayed with time (left traces). The decay process is known as Na+-dependent inactivation (28Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 (right traces) demonstrates that the wild-type and cysteineless exchangers display normal regulation by nontransported cytoplasmic Ca2+ (29Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). For both exchangers, the peak currents increased when the cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration was raised to 15 μm; the currents declined to zero when the regulatory Ca2+ was removed from the bath solution; and Na+-dependent inactivation was attenuated by the high internal Ca2+ concentrations. When the regulatory Ca2+ concentration was increased from 1 to 15 μm, inactivation was virtually eliminated. The small level of inactivation seen in the trace for the cysteineless exchanger was seen occasionally with both the wild-type and cysteineless exchangers. These effects of regulatory Ca2+ on the exchange activity and inactivation process are characteristic of NCX1 (29Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These findings have been verified in another laboratory. 2D. W. Hilgemann, personal communication. Thus, the primary biophysical characteristics of the exchanger were maintained in the cysteineless mutant. Cysteines that were introduced at five different sites were useful in determining the topology of the amino-terminal portion of the exchanger. These were cysteines introduced at positions 135, 138, 168, 184, and 188 (H:T135C, G138C, V168C, Y184C, and S188C, respectively). Position 135 is modeled to be in extracellular loop c between TMS2 and TMS3, and position 138 is modeled to be near the interface of loop c and TMS3. Position 168 is modeled to be at the intracellular interface of loop d and TMS4, and positions 184 and 188 are modeled to be near the extracellular interface of TMS4 and loop e (Fig. 1 A). Exchange activity was present in mutants with cysteine introduced in loop c, d, or e, although mutations in loop c significantly reduced activity. As determined by Na+gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake, the activity of mutant H:T135C was reduced to about half of the level expressed by the wild-type or cysteineless exchanger, and the activity of mutant G138C was even lower (Fig. 4). Mutation of another residue in loop c (H:T127C; data not shown) also resulted in significant reduction of exchanger activity. Mutants V168C and S188C expressed slightly reduced activity, and mutant Y184C expressed about half as much activity as the wild-type exchanger. Mutation of Ser-191, also in loop e, resulted in a nonfunctional exchanger (data not shown). In contrast, mutation of another residue in loop e (D157C) resulted in wild-type levels of activity. To examine the topological distribution of the introduced cysteine residues, the effects of membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents on the activity of mutants H:T135C, G138C, V168C, Y184C, and S188C were examined. Mutants H:T135C, G138C, and S188C were inhibited by extracellular applications of the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (Fig.6). A modest inhibition of the activity of mutants H:T135C and G138C by intracellular application of MTSET was observed. When cysteine was added to the bathing medium during injection to scavenge leaked MTSET, the inhibition was relieved (data not shown; see “Discussion”). Y184C was inhibited only by extracellular MTSEA. In contrast, mutant V168C was inhibited by intracellular (but not extracellular) application of MTSET or MTSES. Hence, loop c appears to be extracellular and loop d intracellular, as previously modeled. Y184C and S188C were stimulated by intracellular MTS reagents in addition to being inhibited by extracellular reagents. Nevertheless, we conclude that loop e is extracellular, as previously modeled (see “Discussion”). Ser-875 is modeled to be in TMS10 near intracellular loop j, and Gly-870 is modeled to be in loop j (Fig. 1). Mutants containing cysteines at these positions displayed near wild-type levels of exchange activity (Fig. 4). S875C was inhibited by intracellular (but not extracellular) application of MTSEA (Fig. 6). Likewise, G870C was sensitive to intracellular (but not extracellular) MTSES. These data support the model of the exchanger that places loop j at the intracellular surface. In support of an intracellular disposition of the carboxyl terminus, mutation of the carboxyl-terminal amino acid Phe-938 to cysteine resulted in an exchanger that was inhibited to ∼50% activity by intracellular application of MTSEA. Ser-788 is modeled to be in loop h near the intracellular interface of TMS7. However, when a cysteine residue was introduced at position 788 in either the cysteineless (H:S788C) or wild-type (S788C) background, the mutant exchanger was inhibited by external application of MTSET (Fig. 6), although the extent of inhibition was less for the mutation in the wild-type background than in the cysteineless background. This indicates that this residue is extracellular, not intracellular, as originally modeled. Also, there must be an odd number of transmembrane segments, rather than two as modeled, between loop f (which is known to be intracellular) and residue 788. A way to test if a hydrophobic region is likely to be a transmembrane segment is by alanine insertion mutagenesis. It has been observed that inserting single amino acids near the central core of transmembrane helices in lactose permease disrupts protein function (30Braun P. Persson B. Kaback H.R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Three mutants were constructed with an alanine inserted in different hydrophobic sections between loop f and Ser-788. Mutant 701iA had an alanine inserted after residue 701 in a short hydrophobic region of loop f. Mutants 749iA and 774iA had alanines inserted into the middle of putative TMS6 and TMS7, respectively. Both mutants 701iA and 749iA expressed Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity (n = 2), whereas no activity was observed in oocytes injected with RNA for mutant 774iA (n = 6; data not shown). This suggests that TMS7, but not putative TMS6, is a transmembrane segment. Gly-837 is modeled to be at the interface of extracellular loop i and TMS9 of the α-2 repeat (Fig. 1). To examine the topology of loop i, mutant G837C was constructed and analyzed by sulfhydryl modification. This mutant displayed a decreased level of expression relative to the wild-type exchanger (Fig. 4). Mutant G837C was inhibited by intracellular application of either MTSET or MTSES (Fig. 6). Thus, it appears that Gly-837 is located at the intracellular rather than the extracellular surface, as modeled. To verify that sulfhydryl modification occurred at the cysteine introduced at position 837, and not at a wild-type cysteine that may have become accessible following mutagenesis, the G837C mutation was also introduced into the cysteineless background (H:G837C). Mutant H:G837C expressed low exchange activity (∼10–20% of wild-type activity), but was still inhibited by intracellular (and not extracellular) application of MTSES (n = 2). In this study, 66 amino acid residues were mutated to cysteine. Most mutants, 47, were uninformative in preliminary experiments with MTS reagents, and 9 of the mutants did not express exchange activity. 3Additional residues mutated to cysteine (or reintroduced into the cysteineless background) were as follows: Ala-43, Ser-58, Asp-62, Ala-106, Ser-117, Glu-120, Cys-122, Asp-157, Thr-172,Ser-190, Glu-196, Asp-218, Asp-740, Tyr-741, His-744, Lys-751, Pro-758, Tyr-762, Trp-763, Asn-764,Gly-765, Trp-766, Asp-785, Leu-786, His-789,Phe-790, Gly-791, Cys-792, Thr-793, Ile-794, Gly-795, Val-804, Gly-809, Thr-815, Lys-819, Ala-821, Ala-822, Thr-823, Asp-825, Tyr-827, Asp-829, Ser-831, Val-835, Thr-836, Asn-839, Ala-854, Ala-855, Tyr-857, His-858, Thr-871, Tyr-892,Arg-893, Lys-909, Tyr-923, Phe-926, and Ser-927 (boldface indicates mutants with no activity). These mutants were not studied further. Only 10 mutations proved useful for determining the topology of the exchanger. The probability of successfully choosing a residue to mutate to cysteine may correlate with how well the exchanger was initially modeled. In the N-terminal half, where the data support the initial model, 5 of 20 mutants were useful. In the C-terminal half, only 5 of 49 mutants were useful. This technique relies on the permeability characteristics of the sulfhydryl reagents. We assume that MTSET, MTSES, and MTSEA, which are predominantly present as charged forms at physiologic pH, are impermeable. However, it has been reported that the reagent MTSEA is membrane-permeable (31Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that if MTSEA permeates the oocyte membrane, it does so at a low rate. Mutants S875C and H:F938C were sensitive to MTSEA only when injected into the oocyte. Incubating the oocytes in a solution containing MTSEA had no effect (Fig. 6). If the oocyte membrane was highly permeable to MTSEA, then preincubation would also inhibit exchange activity. Three extracellular loops (c, e, and h) and four intracellular loops (d, i, j, and l) were localized in this study. Each of the exchangers with a mutation in an intracellular loop was sensitive to intracellular applications of MTS reagents, but extracellular applications had very little effect. Each of the exchangers with a mutation in an extracellular loop was sensitive to extracellular applications of MTS reagents. Mutants in extracellular loop c were also mildly inhibited by intracellular application of MTS reagents (Fig. 6). The inhibition by intracellular MTS reagents appears to be due to leakage of the reagent during injection since including extracellular cysteine during injection removed the sensitivity (data not shown). Loop e mutants Y184C and S188C were stimulated by intracellular application of MTS reagents. The stimulation appears to be similar to the stimulation of the wild-type exchanger (see below) since the extent of stimulation correlates with the level of expressed activity (Fig. 2 B,closed circles). However, we cannot rule out other possible explanations for this stimulation such as accessibility of the resid"

However, in competition against 125I-labeled growth-related oncogene (GRO)-α, the ORF-74 receptor was highly selective for GRO peptides, with IL-8 being 10,000-fold less potent. The constitutive stimulating activity of ORF-74 on phosphatidylinositol turnover was not influenced by, for example, IL-8 binding. In contrast, GRO peptides acted as potent agonists in stimulating ORF-74 signaling, whereas IP-10 and stromal cell-derived factor-1α surprisingly acted as inverse agonists. These peptides had similar pharmacological properties with regard to enhancing or inhibiting, respectively, the stimulatory effect of ORF-74 on NIH-3T3 cell proliferation. Construction of a high affinity zinc switch through introduction of two His residues at the extracellular end of transmembrane segment V enabled Zn2+ to act as a prototype non-peptide inverse agonist, which eliminated the constitutive signaling. It is concluded that ORF-74, which is believed to be causally involved in the formation of highly vascularized tumors, has been optimized for agonist and inverse agonist modulation by the endogenous angiogenic GRO peptides and angiostatic IP-10 and stromal cell-derived factor-1α, respectively.

Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that ensure that leukocytes migrate to the right tissue or compartment at the right time. During inflammation, chemokines are also involved, for example, in the extravasation process and recruitment of the appropriate type of leukocytes to the infected tissue. Furthermore, chemokines are involved in cellular communication controlling processes such as angiogenesis (1Horuk R. Nature. 1998; 393: 524-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Tachibana K. Hirota S. Iizasa H. Yoshida H. Kawabata K. Kataoka Y. Kitamura Y. Matsushima K. Yoshida N. Hishikawa S. Kishimoto T. Nagasawa T. Nature. 1998; 393: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In a number of herpesviruses and poxviruses, genes coding for homologs of chemokines as well as chemokine receptors have been found (3Wells T.N.C. Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechol. 1997; 8: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Dairaghi D.J. Greaves D.R. Schall T.J. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 377-385Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Conceivably, these molecules have been obtained by the virus through an ancient act of molecular piracy and subsequently are structurally optimized for a particular pharmacological phenotype of benefit to the virus. In the case of several of the virally encoded chemokine ligands, their purpose appears to be rather obvious since they act as broad spectrum chemokine antagonists, which could be used by the virus to prevent the local recruitment of leukocytes (5Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Coulin F. Simmons G. Johnsen A.H. Alouani S. Power C.A. Luttichau H.R. Gerstoft J. Clapham P.R. Clark L.I. Wells T.C. Schwartz T.W.

In general, these receptors are not required for virus replication in vitro (7Field B.N. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Hagerstown, MD1995Google Scholar). Yet, gene deletion experiments in both mouse and rat cytomegaloviruses have shown that, for example, the UL33 receptor, which is homologous to the U12 receptor encoded by human herpesvirus 6 and 7, is essential for targeting and/or replication of the virus in salivary glands (8Davis-Poynter N.J.

More important, the viral strains in which the UL33 receptor was specifically knocked out were less virulent than wild-type cytomegalovirus as judged from survival of infected animals (9Beisser P.S. Vink C. Van Dam J.G. Grauls G. Vanherle S.J. Bruggeman C.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2352-2363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ORF-74 is a CXC chemokine receptor encoded by many γ-herpesviruses, including the recently discovered human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) 1The abbreviations used are: HHV8, human herpesvirus 8; CXCR, CXC receptor; IL-8, interleukin-8; vMIP-II, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II; GRO, growth-related oncogene; IP-10, interferon γ-inducible protein; SDF-1α, stromal cell-derived factor-1α; ENA-78, epithelial cell-derived activating peptide-78; NAP-2, neutrophil-activating peptide-2; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein. 1The abbreviations used are: HHV8, human herpesvirus 8; CXCR, CXC receptor; IL-8, interleukin-8; vMIP-II, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II; GRO, growth-related oncogene; IP-10, interferon γ-inducible protein; SDF-1α, stromal cell-derived factor-1α; ENA-78, epithelial cell-derived activating peptide-78; NAP-2, neutrophil-activating peptide-2; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein. or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (see Fig. 1) (10Simas J.P.

Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Initially, the ORF-74 gene product from Herpesvirus saimiri, ECRF3, was shown to bind interleukin-8 (IL-8) with high affinity even though it structurally is only distantly related to the mammalian IL-8 receptors, CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 (12Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ORF-74 receptor from HHV8 was found to be highly constitutively active (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although IL-8 binds with high affinity to ORF-74 from HHV8, it does not affect the signaling of the receptor (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In contrast to other mammalian chemokine receptors, which preferentially signal through the Gi pathway, ORF-74 activates the phospholipase C pathway, leading to constitutively high turnover of phosphatidylinositol, as well as signals through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading to the production and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (14Geras-Raaka E. Arvanitakis L. Bais C. Cesarman E. Mesri E.A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As a result of these activities, ORF-74 functions as an oncogene, leading to cellular transformation and development of highly vascularized tumors in nude and SCID mice (15Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gerhengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been proposed that ORF-74 could be causally involved in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions and lymphomas associated with HHV8 infection (14Geras-Raaka E. Arvanitakis L. Bais C. Cesarman E. Mesri E.A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gerhengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Since ORF-74 belongs to the class of rhodopsin-like seven-transmembrane receptors, which classically are good drug targets, it appears that it should be possible to develop antagonists or rather inverse agonists for ORF-74 to be used in the treatment of HHV8-associated malignancies. In this study, we have tested a number of mammalian chemokines as well as the viral chemokine antagonist vMIP-II to probe their ability to affect the constitutive activity of ORF-74 from HHV8. We find that in contrast to IL-8, other CXC chemokines such as GROα are in fact potent agonists on ORF-74; and, surprisingly we find that the endogenous chemokines IP-10 and SDF-1α function as efficient inverse agonists, which can block signaling of the viral oncogene. More important, the susceptibility of ORF-74 to non-peptide antagonists is probed by blockage of the constitutive signaling by Zn2+after construction of a silent metal ion site in the viral receptor. The human chemokines were purchased from Peprotech (IL-8, GROα, and SDF-1α) or R&D Systems (GROβ, GROγ, ENA-78 and IP-10) or were kindly provided by Timothy N. C. Wells (Serono, Geneva, Switzerland; NAP-2 and vMIP-II) or Michael A. Luther (Glaxo Wellcome; Met-SDF-1α). ORF-74 (GenBankTM accession number U24275) was cloned from a biopsy taken from a Kaposi's sarcoma skin lesion from an human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patient (5Kledal T.N.

COS-7 cells were grown at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Rosenkilde M.M. Cahir M. Gether U. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28160-28164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells (ATCC CRL 1658) were grown at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose, 4 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum. COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates 1 day after transfection. The number of cells seeded per well was determined by the apparent expression efficiency of the individual clones; the goal was to obtain 5–10% specific binding of the added radioactive ligand. Two days after transfection, cells were assayed by competition binding performed on whole cells for 3 h at 4 °C using 12 pm125I-IL-8 or125I-GROα plus variable amounts of unlabeled ligand in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation, cells were washed quickly four times in 4 °C binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 0.1 μm unlabeled chemokine. Determinations were made in duplicate. One day after transfection, COS-7 cells (0.5 × 106/well) were incubated for 24 h with 5 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol in 1 ml/well inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin.

Cells were extracted with 10% ice-cold perchloric acid, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was neutralized with KOH in Hepes buffer, and the generated [3H]inositol phosphates were purified on AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (18Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvin R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Determinations were made in duplicate. Receptor selection and amplification technology assays (R-SATTM, Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA) were performed as described previously (19Bräuner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 295: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells (7.5 × 105) were plated 1 day before transfection into 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected with 0.3 μg of receptor DNA (ORF-74 in the pTEJ8 vector) and 4 μg of pSI-β-galactosidase DNA (Promega). One day after transfection, the cells were split into 96-well plates, and ligands were added the following day. After 24 h of exposure to ligand, cell proliferation was quantified using a standard colorimetric assay for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (19Bräuner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 295: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Lim K. Chae C.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). IC50 and EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression, andB max values were calculated using Inplot Version 4.0 software (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego). ORF-74 was cloned from a Kaposi's sarcoma skin lesion. Only a single silent G-to-T nucleotide mutation was identified at position 907 in the coding region of ORF-74 as compared with the sequence deposited in GenBankTM (accession number U24275). This represents a very high degree of conservation in comparison with, for example, the US28 receptor from human cytomegalovirus, which is widely divergent in nucleotide and amino acid sequences among different viral strains (21Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Using 125I-IL-8 as tracer in competition binding experiments in COS-7 cells transiently expressing ORF-74, we could confirm that this virally encoded receptor binds a number of human CXC chemokines with high and rather similar affinity (Table I and Fig. 2,A–C). Even the structurally rather distantly related chemokines IP-10 and SDF-1α (Fig. 1) could displace 125I-IL-8 with single-digit nanomolar affinity. In contrast, the CC chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) bound to the receptor with affinities (IC50) <10,000 nm (n = 3), whereas MCP-3 and aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES had measurable affinities around 200 nm (n = 3) when tested against IL-8 as radioactive ligand (data not shown).Table IBinding constants of selected CXC chemokines and the CC chemokine vMIP-II for the HHV8-encoded ORF-74 receptor using different radioactive ligands compared with biological activity measured by phosphatidylinositol turnoverChemokineCompetition bindingPIaPI, phosphatidylinositol. turnover, basal activity125I-IL-8 IC50125I-GROα IC50-Fold differenceEC50EffectnmnmGROα0.23 ± 0.1 (5)0.10 ± 0.02 (11)0.41.1 ± 0.2 (9)SGROβ0.34 ± 0.1 (5)0.22 ± 0.05 (5)0.73.1 ± 1.1 (5)SGROγ0.37 ± 0.1 (5)0.06 ± 0.01 (5)0.22.8 ± 0.8 (4)SNAP-23.6 ± 0.6 (4)82 ± 12 (5)23604 ± 309 (6)SIL-81.5 ± 0.4 (5)1330 ± 800 (5)890>1000 (6)ENA-7811 ± 2.9 (2)173 ± 31 (3)16>1000 (2)IP-104.2 ± 1.1 (3)2.3 ± 0.6 (3)0.63.3 ± 0.3 (3)ISDF-1α6.7 ± 1.5 (5)13 ± 1.4 (4)211 ± 3.8 (5)IMet-SDF-1α68 ± 21 (3)30 ± 3.6 (6)0.428 ± 6.1 (5)IvMIP-II38 ± 7.6 (7)72 ± 8.7 (7)1.984 ± 20 (6)IThe ORF-74 receptor was transiently transfected in COS-7 cells, and competition binding and phosphatidylinositol turnover experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IC50 values determined in competition either against125I-IL-8 (B max = 42 ± 12 fmol/105 cell) or against 125I-GROα (B max = 44 ± 10 fmol/105 cell) are shown as means ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments (n).

Previously, only IL-8 has been employed as a radioactive ligand in binding experiments with ORF-74 (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). However, since GROα displaced125I-IL-8 with even higher affinity (IC50 = 0.23 nm) than unlabeled IL-8 itself (IC50 = 1.5 nm), we decided to probe ORF-74 with125I-GROα as well. As shown in Fig.2 (D–F), the ligand binding profiles displayed by 125I-GROα were different from those displayed by 125I-IL-8, in particular for the ligands ENA-78, NAP-2, and IL-8 (Fig. 2, B versus E). The competition binding curves for these three ligands were shifted 16-, 23-, and 890-fold to the right, respectively, as compared with the binding curves observed in competition with125I-IL-8. In contrast, the competition binding curves for GROα, -β, and -γ were shifted 2–5-fold to the left in competition with 125I-GROα as compared with125I-IL-8 (Fig. 2, A versus D). The binding curves for IP-10, SDF-1α, and vMIP-II were rather similar in both assays (Fig. 2, C and F). In conclusion, with 125I-GROα as tracer, ORF-74 appears to have >20 times higher affinity for the three GRO peptides than for IP-10 and 100 to >1000 times higher affinity than for any other chemokine ligand, with SDF-1α being the closest one. Thus, the affinity of ORF-74 for the GRO peptides is ∼10,000-fold higher than the affinity for IL-8 in competition with radioactive GROα (TableI). The reported ability of ORF-74 to stimulate phosphatidylinositol turnover in a ligand-independent manner was confirmed by gene dosage experiments in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3) (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The inability of IL-8 to affect this constitutive signaling was also confirmed (Fig. 4 B) (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, it was found that in contrast to IL-8, GROα and GROγ were able to stimulate ORF-74 signaling >2-fold and with EC50 values of 1.1 and 2.8 nm, respectively (Fig. 4 A). GROβ also acted as an agonist, yet only with a partial response as compared with GROα, but with a similar EC50 value of 3.1 nm. Like IL-8, NAP-2 and ENA-78 were unable to affect signaling through ORF-74 except at micromolar concentrations, where NAP-2 stimulated the phosphatidylinositol turnover to ∼50% of the maximal response observed with GROα (Fig. 4 B). Most surprisingly IP-10, SDF-1α, and Met-SDF-1α functioned as efficient inverse agonists on ORF-74 with potencies very similar to their binding affinities measured against GROα as radioligand: EC50 = 3.3, 11, and 28 nm, respectively (Fig. 4 C), versusaffinity = 2.3, 13, and 30 nm, respectively (Table I). vMIP-II, which like ORF-74 is encoded by HHV8 and which acts as an antagonist on multiple human chemokine receptors (5Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Coulin F. Simmons G. Johnsen A.H. Alouani S. Power C.A. Luttichau H.R. Gerstoft J. Clapham P.R. Clark L.I. Wells T.C. Schwartz T.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), could also block the constitutive signaling of ORF-74, albeit only with an EC50 of 84 nm; however, this potency was similar to the affinity (IC50 = 72 nm) for vMIP-II measured against GROα as radioligand. When ORF-74 signaling was stimulated with 10 nm GROα, the four inverse agonists (IP-10, SDF-1α, Met-SDF-1α, and vMIP-II) acted as antagonists (Fig.4 F). Neither of the other chemokines had any effect on the stimulated activity (Fig. 4, D and E).Figure 4Effect of selected chemokines on basal (A–C) and GROα (10−8m)-stimulated (D–F) phosphatidylinositol turnover induced by ORF-74.

Brann M.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 295: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In agreement with previously published data showing an effect on foci formation (13Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), ORF-74 was found to strongly stimulate cell proliferation in a ligand-independent manner as determined by β-galactosidase activity in the transfected cells. The constitutive activity of ORF-74 resulted in a β-galactosidase activity (corresponding to degree of cell transformation) that was stronger than observed with, for example, the muscarinic m1 receptor after maximal ligand stimulation (data not shown). GROα, IL-8, IP-10, and Met-SDF-1α were selected for testing in the cell proliferation assay. As shown in Fig. 5, GROα stimulated the transforming activity of ORF-74 with a potency of 3.0 nm, but under the chosen assay conditions, only to ∼25% above basal activity as compared with the 100% stimulation observed in phosphatidylinositol turnover (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, both IP-10 and Met-SDF-1α acted as inverse agonists also in the cell proliferation assay, as they inhibited the basal activity to 30% under the chosen assay conditions, with IC50 values of 36 and 350 nm, respectively (Fig. 5). Through the introduction of His residues, we have previously both structurally and functionally exchanged a non-peptide antagonist-binding site in the tachykinin NK1 receptor with metal ion sites (22Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Nielsen S.M. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Fold. Design. 1997; 2: S76-S80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast to binding sites for peptides and non-peptide ligands, these metal ion sites can be transferred even to distantly related seven-transmembrane receptors (24Thirstrup K. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7875-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To probe the susceptibility of ORF-74 to inhibition by non-peptide inverse agonists, two His residues were introduced at positions V:01 (Arg208) and V:05 (Arg212), corresponding to two of the positions previously tested in both the NK1 and κ-opioid receptors (Fig. 1). Binding of 125I-IL-8 was eliminated in the R208H,R212H ORF-74 mutant receptor. This is in accordance with the fact that the two Arg residues, which were substituted with His residues, are conserved between the ORF-74 and endogenous CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 receptors, in which these two residues previously have been shown to be involved in IL-8 binding (25Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hébert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the mutant receptor did not bind IL-8, it was nevertheless expressed well and still displayed a high degree of constitutive signaling (Fig.3). In the R208H,R212H ORF-74 mutant receptor, Zn2+ acted as a potent inverse agonist in blocking the constitutive signaling, with an EC50 of ∼1 μm (Fig.6). Thus, the effect of this “prototype” non-peptide antagonist (Zn2+; used here in a zinc switch on the mutant receptor) indicates that it should be possible to develop non-peptide inverse agonists targeted toward the extracellular part of ORF-74. This study indicates that the ORF-74 receptor encoded by HHV8 has been optimized by the virus to recognize GRO peptides from its host as agonistic modulators of its high constitutive activity. Inhibition of this constitutive activity in wild-type ORF-74 by the chemokines IP-10 and SDF-1α and especially in the zinc site-engineered mutant receptor by Zn2+ indicates that this viral oncogene is susceptible to drug intervention by non-peptide inverse agonists. Although ORF-74 can be shown to bind other CXC chemokines such as IL-8, NAP-2, and ENA-78 with nanomolar affinity in binding assays employing125I-IL-8, these “non-GRO” chemokines are in fact at physiological concentrations not able to interfere with either GROα binding or ORF-74 signaling. The only exceptions are IP-10 and SDF-1α, which, at nanomolar concentrations, function as efficient inverse agonists in ORF-74 signaling. It is interesting to note that the affinities measured in competition against 125I-GROα for all the chemokines appear to closely reflect their potency upon receptor signaling (Table I; compare Fig. 2 (C–F) with Fig.4 (A–C)). For the agonists, the EC50 values were shifted ∼10-fold to the right as compared with their “GROα affinity.” Thus, the GRO peptides show affinities around 0.1 nm in competition with GROα, and they stimulate signaling with an EC50 of ∼1 nm. NAP-2 has an affinity against GROα binding of 82 nm and stimulates signaling with an EC50 close to 1 μm. The potency of the inverse agonists is almost identical to their GROα affinity (Table I). This would indicate that the 125I-GROα binding in fact displays an active or activable conformation of the receptor. In contrast, there is no functional correlate to the single-digit nanomolar affinity for IL-8, NAP-2, and ENA-78 as measured in competition with 125I-IL-8. Apparently, at physiological concentrations, these peptides merely function as neutral ligands on the ORF-74 receptor. The ORF-74 gene product from Herpesvirus saimiri was originally described as a viral IL-8 receptor (12Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in fact, ECRF3 also binds GROα preferentially as described here for ORF-74 from HHV8. There is a 50-fold difference in favor of GROαversus IL-8 with respect to potency for stimulating calcium mobilization through ECRF3. In contrast, on human CXCR-2, there is 300-fold difference in favor of IL-8 versus GROα (12Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20691-20694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that ORF-74 receptors from γ-herpesvirus in general have been optimized to recognize GRO peptides. The phenomenon that ligands (exemplified here by IL-8) can bind to a seven-transmembrane receptor with high affinity without being able to compete for binding against other ligands has been extensively studied, especially in the tachykinin and opioid receptor systems (17Rosenkilde M.M. Cahir M. Gether U. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28160-28164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hjorth S.A. Thirstrup K. Schwartz T.W. Mol.

Sci. 1997; 18: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the chemokine system, this phenomenon has previously been reported in CXCR-2, where, for example, the affinity for NAP-2 can vary up to 2000-fold depending upon whether it is measured against125I-ENA-78 (0.5 nm) or against125I-IL-8 (∼1 μm) (30Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The molecular or cell biological correlate to this general phenomenon is, however, not yet clear (29Maggi C.A. Schwartz T.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The most simple explanation would be that the ligands bind to two (or more) different sites on the receptor. This is, however, hard to imagine with the relatively large chemokine ligands of this study, although it is not impossible. Another explanation could be that ligands can bind to two (or more) distinct conformations of the receptor that do not interchange readily (29Maggi C.A. Schwartz T.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These conformations of states could represent, for example, complexes with different G-protein subtypes and/or monomeric versus dimeric forms of the receptor. Whatever the molecular basis is, it is nevertheless a phenomenon that has been exploited by viruses not only in the ORF-74 system, but also in other virally encoded chemokine receptors such as US28 from human cytomegalovirus, possibly to obtain selective recognition in systems where multiple ligands are available. 2Kledal, T. N., Rosenkilde, M. M., and Schwartz, T. W. (1999) FEBS Lett., in press. The observation that ORF-74 is stimulated by GRO peptides and inhibited by IP-10 and SDF-1α is interesting since these peptides are generally considered to be angiogenic and angiostatic factors, respectively (31Moore B.B. Arenberg D.A. Strieter R.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Sci. 1998; 8: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition to its cell transforming properties, ORF-74 has, through its induction of expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, been strongly implicated in the angiogenesis involved in the formation of Kaposi's sarcoma (15Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gerhengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The angiogenic activity of GROα and the angiostatic activity of IP-10 have been demonstrated in several systems, both in vitro (endothelial chemotaxis) and in vivo (corneal neovascularization and tumor formation) (31Moore B.B. Arenberg D.A. Strieter R.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Sci. 1998; 8: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Strieter R.M. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Arenberg D.A. Burdick M.D. Kasper J. Dzuiba J.

Commun. 1995; 210: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). SDF-1α or rather its endogenous receptor (CXCR-4) was recently, through gene knockout experiments, shown to be important for the remodeling part of the neovascularization process, i.e.the reorganization of small immature vessels into larger mature vessels (2Tachibana K. Hirota S. Iizasa H. Yoshida H. Kawabata K. Kataoka Y. Kitamura Y. Matsushima K. Yoshida N. Hishikawa S. Kishimoto T. Nagasawa T. Nature. 1998; 393: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Thus, according to the present data, the virally encoded ORF-74 receptor apparently exploits endogenous ligands, which normally are involved in angiogenesis or neovascularization in the host organism, for both positive and negative modulation of its high constitutive activity. Due to its oncogenic properties and its effect on neovascularization, ORF-74 appears to be an interesting drug target for the treatment of HHV8-associated malignancies. Seven-transmembrane receptors are in general excellent drug targets, and non-peptide antagonists have accordingly been developed for a number of neuropeptide and peptide hormone receptors (35Schwartz T.W. Gether U. Schambye H.T. Hjorth S.A. Curr. Pharm. Design. 1995; 1: 325-342Google Scholar, 36Betancur C. Azzi M. Rostene W. Trends Pharmacol.

However, since we do not yet know the structural reason for the high constitutive activity of the ORF-74 receptor, it is far from evident that it should be possible to stop its signaling by binding of a small non-peptide ligand to its extracellular surface. Although there is general agreement that the binding sites for non-peptide ligands usually are significantly different from those for the endogenous peptide ligands (35Schwartz T.W. Gether U.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of action of non-peptide ligands is the subject of debate. One opinion is that the non-peptide antagonists act by blocking the binding of the agonist through a space-filling process, although their binding sites may not overlap directly (42Fong T.M. Huang R.C. Yu H. Swain C.J. Underwood D. Cascieri M.A. Strader C.D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another view is that the antagonist and agonist bind to sites presented by different conformations and that the ligands compete for the whole receptor in an allosteric system (35Schwartz T.W. Gether U. Schambye H.T. Hjorth S.A. Curr. Pharm. Design. 1995; 1: 325-342Google Scholar). Thus, in the original report on zinc site engineering, we suggested that Zn2+ acted as an allosteric antagonist that stabilized an inactive conformation, which thereby prevented the receptor from going into the active conformation (which would bind the agonist) rather than actually directly interfering with the binding of the ligand (22Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This suggestion fits with the observations of the present study that the metal ion binding at this location inhibits theligand-independent signaling. From a drug development point of view, the inhibition of ORF-74 signaling by Zn2+ in the mutant receptor can be considered as proof of the concept that non-peptide compounds that can block the constitutive signaling of this viral oncogene can be developed, even though they target the extracellular part of the receptor.

Here we show that LR1, a B cell-specific, duplex DNA binding factor, binds tightly and specifically to synthetic oligonucleotides containing G-G base pairs (K D ≤ 0.25 nm). LR1 also binds to single-stranded G-rich sequences (K D≈ 10 nm). The two subunits of LR1, nucleolin and hnRNP D, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA (K D = 0.4 and 0.5 nm, respectively). LR1 therefore contains two independent G4 DNA binding domains. We propose that LR1 binds with G-G-paired structures that form during the transcription of the S regions that is prerequisite to recombination in vivo. Interactions of donor and acceptor S regions with subunits of the LR1 could then juxtapose the switch regions for recombination.

Immunoglobulin class switch recombination is a regulated recombination event that joins a rearranged and expressed heavy chain variable region (VDJ) to a new downstream constant (C) 1The abbreviations used are: C, constant; hnRNP, human ribonucleoprotein; RBD, RNA binding domain. 1The abbreviations used are: C, constant; hnRNP, human ribonucleoprotein; RBD, RNA binding domain. region, deleting the DNA between. Each immunoglobulin class removes antigen from the body in a distinct way, so switch recombination alters the pathway of antigen clearance without affecting antigen specificity. Switch recombination is region-specific: junction sites are found throughout the upstream (donor) and downstream (acceptor) S regions. Comparison of switch junction sequences shows that switch recombination does not depend on either sequence-specific or homologous recombination mechanisms (1Dunnick W. Hertz G.Z. Scappino L. Gritzmacher C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Circular molecules containing the deleted C region and flanking sequences are produced during switching (2von Schwedler U. Jack H.-M. Wabl M. Nature. 1990; 345: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), suggesting that switching involves a synapsis event in which distant switch regions are brought together into a recombination complex, which undergoes cleavage and religation to produce an excised switch circle and a chromosomal switch junction (see Fig. 1). Switch recombination depends on G-rich DNA regions called switch or S regions. The S regions are 2–10 kilobases in length and located in the intron upstream of each C region that undergoes switching: Cμ, Cγ, Cε, and Cα (Fig. 1). The organization of the S regions in the heavy chain locus reflects their functional importance in switch recombination: there is an S region upstream of each C region except Cδ, and use of the Cδ region is governed by RNA processing, not DNA recombination. Simultaneous transcription of both activated switch regions is essential for subsequent recombination (reviewed in Ref. 3Snapper C.M. Marcu K.B. Zelazowski P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 217-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). During S-region transcription, the G-rich strand is the “top” or nontemplate strand. G-rich DNA has unusual properties because of the unique pairing potential of guanine. Guanine can interact with cytosine in standard Watson-Crick G-C base pairs, and guanine can also interact with guanine in structures stabilized by G-G Hoogsteen bonding (Fig.2). One stable structure formed by G-G bonding is the G quartet, in which four guanines associate in a planar ring in which each G interacts with two other Gs (Fig. 2 A). G quartets can, in turn, stabilize interactions between runs of Gs, thus allowing nucleic acids to form four-stranded structures called G4 DNA (Fig. 2 B; Refs. 4Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 5Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 6Sen D. Gilbert W.

Biol. 1993; 3: 893-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides derived from the Sμ and Sγ2b switch regions were among the first sequences shown to form G4 DNA in vitro (4Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Since that time, G4 DNA formation has been characterized extensively in experiments which show that a run of three Gs is sufficient to drive G4 DNA formation and that G-G interactions are essentially independent of sequence context in which the runs of Gs occur (reviewed in Ref.9Williamson J.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 703-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, G-rich DNAs are found in three distinct genomic microenvironments: the heavy chain switch regions, the rDNA, and the telomeres. The fact that G-rich DNA occurs at very specific regions of the genome suggests that G-G pairing may be important to specific cellular functions. Consistent with this hypothesis, a number of proteins have been described that bind to, cleave, or promote formation of G-G-paired DNAs (10Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2411-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that G4 DNA is the preferred substrate of one critical mammalian helicase, the BLM helicase (22Sun H. Karow J. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27587-27592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The BLM helicase is deficient in Bloom's syndrome, a human genetic disease characterized by extreme genomic instability, tendency to development malignancies, and immunodeficiency (23German J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1993; 2: 393-406Crossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 24Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J.

LR1 is a B cell-specific, sequence-specific DNA binding factor that binds to duplex sites in the S regions (26Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Williams M. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13731-13737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LR1 DNA binding activity is present in pre-B and B cell lines, and it is absent from resting B cells but induced in primary B cells activated to carry out switch recombination. This spectrum of LR1 activity correlates with the ability of a cell type to support recombination of extrachromosomal switch substrates (28Li M.-J. Chung W. Maizels N. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LR1 binds with very high affinity (K D = 1.8 nm) to duplex DNA sites conforming to the consensus, GGNCNAG(G/C)CTG(G/A) (29Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). LR1 is a heterodimer of nucleolin and a specific isoform of hnRNP D (29Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both nucleolin and hnRNP D are members of the large family of eukaryotic nuclear proteins that contain RNA binding domains (RBDs, also called RNA recognition motifs, or RRMs) and Arg-Gly-Gly repeats (RGGs). These structural motifs are commonly found in proteins that interact with RNA or single-stranded DNA (reviewed in Refs. 31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 32Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Piñol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite the high affinity and sequence specificity of LR1 duplex DNA binding, neither of its subunits contains domains that commonly mediate duplex DNA interactions. The unusual subunit composition of LR1 suggested that duplex DNA might not be its only binding target. Here we report that LR1 specifically binds G4 DNA with K D = 0.25 nm, 7-fold lower than its K D for duplex DNA binding. We further show that both recombinant nucleolin and hnRNP D also bind G4 DNA (K D = 0.4 nm and 0.5 nm, respectively). As nucleolin and hnRNP D, the two components of LR1, can both independently bind G4 DNA, a single LR1 heterodimer can bind to two separate G-rich regions of DNA. We suggest that LR1 binds to G-G-paired structures that form during S region transcription, to juxtapose donor and acceptor switch regions for recombination. G-G pairing has the further potential to stabilize intermediates in the recombination process. LR1 was purified 12,000-fold from nuclear extract of the murine pre-B cell line, PD31, by four chromatographic steps (29Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recombinant nucleolin was produced as a maltose-binding protein fusion protein containing amino acids 284–709 of human nucleolin, expressed in Escherichia colifrom the pMalNuc plasmid, and purified as described previously (30Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The fusion protein contains the four RBDs of nucleolin and the C-terminal RGG motifs; deletion of the acidic N terminus of nucleolin was essential to permit bacterial expression. Recombinant His6-tagged hnRNP D M20 was produced from a fusion construct in the pET30A(+) (Novagen) bacterial expression vector using an engineered murine cDNA clone in which an N-terminal His6 tag is fused to hnRNP D amino acid 31 (29Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The M20 isoform of hnRNP D contains sequences encoded by alternative codon exon 2 but not exon 7 (34Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. DePace A. Bray-Ward P. Maizels N. Genomics. 1998; 49: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). His6-tagged hnRNP D M20 was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant human nucleolin and a synthetic peptide bearing a C-terminal sequence of hnRNP D and purified as described previously (29Dempsey L.A.

G4 DNAs were formed and end-labeled as previously described (22Sun H. Karow J. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol.

In all cases, the characteristic G-G pairing was verified by methylation footprinting using dimethylsulfate (35Maxam A.M. Gilbert W.

Binding to duplex DNA was carried out in 15-μl reactions containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% glycerol, 2% polyvinyl alcohol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 fmol of32P-labeled duplex DNA for 15 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 90 mm Tris-borate, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.3. Binding to G4 DNA and single-stranded DNA was carried out in 15-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA for 30 min at 37 °C, and the complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide, 45 mm Tris-borate-EDTA gels at 4 °C. When antibodies were included, they were preincubated with protein in a 10-μl volume on ice for 10 min before the addition of 10 μl of binding buffer containing labeled DNA. Affinities were estimated by gel mobility shift assays in which binding to a fixed amount of G4 DNA was assayed in the presence of increasing amounts of protein. Concentrations of purified LR1 and recombinant proteins were determined by Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad). Protein-DNA complex formation was quantitated by phosphoimager analysis of the dried gels, and K D values were calculated by plotting the fraction of bound DNA at each protein concentration. Reported K D values are averages from at least three separate experiments. To verify the very low K Dvalues for G4 DNA interactions, assays were performed at three DNA concentrations, 330 fm, 3.3 pm, and 33 pm; the apparent K D was the same at all concentrations. Each of the immunoglobulin switch regions contains reiterations of a consensus repeat characterized by at least one run of three or more of Gs (Table I). To test the possibility that LR1 might recognize G4 DNA formed by S region sequences, we carried out gel mobility shift experiments to assay binding of highly purified protein to 5′ end-labeled G4 DNA formed from the P oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide is a synthetic 49-mer derived from the Sγ2b switch region (4Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). G4 DNA, formed from four separate G-rich strands, provides an excellent model for G-G-paired structures, as it is readily formed at high yield and is very stable in solution. Formation of G4 DNA was in all cases verified by methylation footprinting (Refs. 4Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 6Sen D. Gilbert W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, and 22Sun H. Karow J. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) bound to G4 DNA formed from the P oligonucleotide with K D = 0.25 nm (Fig.3 A). This is a very low binding constant for interaction between a eukaryotic protein and DNA. LR1 also bound to single-stranded P oligonucleotide (Fig.3 A); the dissociation constant for this interaction isK D = 11 nm. LR1 bound other G-rich single-stranded DNA with similar K D values (data not shown). The complexes of LR1 with G4 DNA or single-stranded DNA were sensitive to proteinase K/SDS treatment, and protein binding therefore does not permanently alter DNA structure or conformation (data not shown). In assays of LR1 binding to Watson-Crick duplex DNA formed from the P oligonucleotide, a very small fraction of labeled DNA interacted with protein. In the assay of LR1 binding to single-stranded P oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 3 A, two bands are apparent in the lane that contains no protein. The faster-migrating band is single-stranded oligonucleotide, and the other is G4 DNA that has formed spontaneously. This illustrates the propensity of guanines to interact in solution. Similarly, concentrated solutions of GMP have been shown to form a viscous gel (36Gellert M. Lipsett M.N. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 2014-2018Crossref Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Binding of the G4 DNA by LR1 probably accounts for the highly retarded species. We used rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant fusion protein carrying amino acids 284–709 of nucleolin (Hanakahi (30Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or a C-terminal peptide of hnRNP D (see “Experimental Procedures”) to verify that LR1 interacts with G4 DNA. As shown in Fig. 3 B, neither preimmune nor immune serum antibodies affected the mobility of G4 DNA in the absence of protein. Anti-nucleolin antibodies dramatically inhibited DNA binding. Antibodies raised against the hnRNP D C-terminal peptide supershifted the protein-DNA complex. The LR1 heterodimer is therefore responsible for the observed G4 DNA binding activity. At increasing concentrations of LR1, multiple complexes were evident in assays of LR1 binding to G4 DNA (Fig. 3 A). This may reflect protein interaction with more than one G4 DNA molecule, as would occur if the LR1 heterodimer contained multiple G4 DNA binding domains. To investigate this possibility, we asked if recombinant nucleolin or hnRNP D could bind G4 DNA. Recombinant nucleolin was expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and assayed for binding to G4 DNA in gel mobility shift experiments. Recombinant nucleolin bound P oligonucleotide G4 DNA, with an estimatedK D = 0.4 nm. It did not bind single-stranded DNA or Watson-Crick duplexes formed from the same oligonucleotide, even at very high protein concentrations (K D > 200 nm; Fig.4 A). The nucleolin-G4 DNA complex was competed by G4 DNA but not by single-stranded P oligonucleotide, as was expected from the direct binding assays (Fig.4 B). Switch recombination in vivo frequently joins Sμ and Sγ switch regions. In the Sγ switch regions, the characteristic repeat is about 50 base pairs in length and consists of one or more runs of G. In contrast, the Sμ switch region (like Sα and Sε) is composed of variations of pentameric motifs like GGGGT, GAGCT, and GGGCT (see TableI). We tested the ability of recombinant nucleolin to bind to G4 DNA formed from an oligonucleotide, RX1, that derives from the murine Sμ region. RX1 carries one GGGGT repeat and two GAGCT repeats (Table I). As shown in Fig. 4 C, recombinant nucleolin bound to RX1-G4 DNA with K D = 0.4 nm, comparable with binding to P oligonucleotide G4 DNA. Recombinant nucleolin also bound to G4 DNAs formed from G-rich sequences not derived from the switch regions (data not shown). G4 DNA binding by nucleolin therefore appears to be specific for the G4 DNA structure, independent of surrounding sequence. hnRNP D is a highly conserved protein that is expressed as three isoforms related by alternative splicing (34Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. DePace A. Bray-Ward P. Maizels N. Genomics. 1998; 49: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recombinant hnRNP D bound to G4 DNA (K D = 0.5 nm) but not to single-stranded DNA or Watson-Crick duplexes formed from the same oligonucleotide (K D > 200 nm: Fig.5 A). Formation of the complex between hnRNP D and P oligonucleotide G4 DNA was competed by G4 DNA formed from the P oligonucleotide but not by single-stranded P oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 B). Recombinant hnRNP D also bound to G4 DNA formed from the Sμ region RX1 oligonucleotide (Fig.5 C) and to G4 DNAs formed from other G-rich sequences (data not shown). We verified binding of recombinant nucleolin and hnRNP D to G4 DNA by assaying sensitivity to anti-nucleolin and anti-hnRNP D antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, anti-nucleolin antibodies inhibited the interaction of nucleolin with G4 DNA but had no effect on the mobility of G4 DNA in the absence of added nucleolin. Anti-hnRNP D antibodies supershifted the complex of hnRNP D with G4 DNA but did not affect the mobility of free G4 DNA. The observation that the anti-C terminal hnRNP D antibodies supershifted the binding complex suggests that the epitopes recognized by this anti-peptide antibody preparation are in an exposed region of the hnRNP D polypeptide. In contrast, the dominant epitopes recognized by the polyclonal anti-nucleolin antibodies appear to be within the region of nucleolin that makes contact with DNA. We previously studied recognition of LR1 duplex DNA binding activity by these anti-nucleolin and anti-hnRNP D antibodies (29Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Analogous to the observations shown in Fig. 6, in those experiments we found that the anti-nucleolin antibodies removed nucleolin from the LR1 (nucleolin/hnRNP D) heterodimer (30Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.-J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas anti-hnRNP D antibodies supershifted the LR1-DNA complex (29Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have shown that the B cell-specific factor, LR1, binds to G-rich S region sequences as Watson-Crick duplexes and as G-G-paired structures stabilized by Hoogsteen pairing. The dissociation constant of the interaction of LR1 with G4 DNA is 0.25 nm. This is a very high affinity interaction for a eukaryotic nucleic acid-binding protein. Moreover, both subunits of the LR1 heterodimer, nucleolin and hnRNP D, can independently bind G4 DNA with comparably high affinity. Simultaneous transcription of both activated S regions is prerequisite to switch recombination (reviewed in Ref. 3Snapper C.M. Marcu K.B. Zelazowski P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 217-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). During switch region transcription, the G-rich nontemplate strand is unwound from the C-rich template strand, which is transcribed by RNA polymerase. The mechanistic basis for the dependence of switch recombination on transcription has not been understood. We hypothesize that transcription may allow the G-rich strand to transiently form structures stabilized by G-G pairing and that proteins involved in recombination recognize this DNA structure. Such structures are likely to be transient, as they can be unwound by the BLM helicase (22Sun H. Karow J. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27587-27592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and possibly other mammalian helicases. S regions are long: in the mouse and human, S regions are from 2 to 10 kilobases in length. If G-G pairing occurs during S-region transcription, then the potential for G-G pairing should be roughly proportional to the length of an S region and the number of runs of three or more Gs it contains. Long S regions will therefore increase the opportunity for recombination by providing additional sites at which G-G pairing can occur. Other laboratories have shown that during in vitrotranscription of the G-rich S regions, stable RNA:DNA hybrids form between the newly synthesized transcript and the C-rich template strand (37Reaban M.E. Griffin J.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 38Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Formation of such hybrids would increase the opportunity for G-G pairing, by increasing the time during which the G-rich top strand is freed from the Watson-Crick duplex. LR1 can bind duplex DNA, single-stranded G-rich DNA, and G4 DNA. Recognition of each of these substrates might contribute to LR1 function in switch recombination. The LR1 heterodimer contains six RBD domains: four in nucleolin, and two in hnRNP D. These domains are found in many proteins that interact with single-stranded nucleic acids (reviewed in Refs. 31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 32Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Piñol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Structurally, an RBD forms a platform upon which a single strand of nucleic acid is bound in an open conformation (40Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.-H. Nagai K.

Biol. 1997; 4: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As others have pointed out (4Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 7Sundquist W.L. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), G-rich DNA has an unusual potential to function in recombination because G-rich but nonhomologous regions can interact via G-G Hoogsteen pairing. RBDs have been shown to function in nucleic acid annealing (42Pontius B.W. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 43Munroe S.H.

It is an interesting possibility that, by binding to a single-stranded region, LR1 may render the DNA available to interactions with other G-rich nucleic acids. LR1 binds to duplex sites in the S regions that conform loosely to the consensus GGNCNAG(G/C)CTG(G/A), and LR1 duplex DNA binding activity is found only in B cells, where it correlates with switch recombination (26Williams M. Maizels N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Williams M. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol.

LR1 binds to one of its sites in the Sγ1 switch region withK D = 1.8 nm, and binding is relatively insensitive to mutations at most positions in this consensus (26Williams M. Maizels N.

A. 1995; 92: 8293-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The S regions are dense with sites that are very similar to the LR1 binding consensus, and LR1 is likely to occupy some fraction of these sites in B cells that have been activated for switch recombination. LR1 bound to either single-stranded or duplex regions would be poised to capture G4 DNA that formed even transiently. Because the affinity of the LR1/G4 DNA interaction is so very high, LR1 bound to duplex sites would comprise a reservoir of protein that would be poised to capture G-G-paired DNA as it formed. Moreover, as both components of the LR1 heterodimer, nucleolin and hnRNP D, can bind G4 DNA, LR1 has two independent G4 DNA binding domains. The presence of these two domains would enable a single LR1 heterodimer to interact with two G-G-paired regions. If these regions are located on donor and acceptor switch regions, then interaction with LR1 could juxtapose these two switch regions for recombination. We are grateful to our colleagues and friends for many interesting and useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2038127989,"To learn more about the regulation of contraction of collagen matrices by fibroblasts, we compared the ability of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to stimulate contraction of floating and stressed collagen matrices. In floating collagen matrices, PDGF and LPA stimulated contraction with similar kinetics, but appeared to utilize complementary signaling pathways since contraction obtained by the combination of growth factors exceeded that observed with saturating concentrations of either alone. The PDGF-simulated pathway was selectively inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor KT5926. In stressed collagen matrices, PDGF and LPA stimulated contraction with different kinetics, with LPA acting rapidly and PDGF acting only after an ∼1-h lag period.

Closure of cutaneous wounds involves three processes: epithelialization, connective tissue deposition, and contraction. Wound contraction, which brings the margins of open wounds together (1Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 3-50Google Scholar, 2Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3780) Google Scholar), is believed to be mediated by specialized fibroblasts called myofibroblasts because of their content of actin stress fibers and α-smooth muscle actin (3Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar). The myofibroblast phenotype can occur early or late during the wound contraction process depending on the mechanical resistance of surrounding tissue (4Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Myofibroblasts have also been implicated in the pathology of wound contractures and fibrotic disease (5Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Rønnov-Jessen L. Petersen O.W. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 696-707PubMed Google Scholar). Using several different culture models, we and others have studied the ability of fibroblasts to reorganize and contract collagen matricesin vitro. In the “floating” model (7Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar), a freshly polymerized collagen matrix containing fibroblasts is released from the culture dish and allowed to float in culture medium, and contraction occurs in the absence of external mechanical load and without appearance of actin stress fibers in the cells (8Ehrlich H.P. Rajaratnam J.B. Tissue Cell. 1990; 22: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the “attached” model, a polymerized collagen matrix containing fibroblasts remains attached to the culture dish during contraction. In this case, mechanical load (i.e. isometric tension) develops during contraction, and cellular stress fibers assemble (9Bellows C.G. Melcher A.H. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1982; 58: 125-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stopak D. Harris A.K. Dev. Biol. 1982; 90: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 11Grinnell F. Lamke C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1984; 66: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the two-step “stressed” model combines an initial period of attached matrix contraction leading to mechanical loading, followed by release of the matrices, resulting in mechanical unloading and further contraction as mechanical stress dissipates (i.e.stress-relaxation) (12Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Contraction of collagen matrices depends on cell binding to collagen through α2β1 integrins (13Gullberg D. Tingström A. Thuresson A.C. Olsson L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J.

Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat.

Otherwise, the signal transduction mechanisms that regulate contraction are poorly understood. Moreover, previous studies have assumed for the most part interchangeability between different growth factors used to stimulate contraction and different model systems used to measure contraction. Platelet-derived growth factor was identified as the putative factor in serum that stimulates contraction of floating matrices (13Gullberg D. Tingström A. Thuresson A.C. Olsson L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Clark R.A. Folkvord J.M. Hart C.E. Murray M.J. McPherson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In a previous study (20Lin Y.-C. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we found that PDGF 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PTx, pertussis toxin; C3, C3 exotransferase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MLC, myosin light chain. attenuated the ability of sodium vanadate to inhibit serum-dependent contraction of floating matrices, but enhanced the ability of vanadate to inhibit contraction of mechanically stressed matrices. These opposing responses to PDGF raised the possibility that different signaling pathways regulate contraction in floating and stressed matrices. In this study, we examined the above possibility by comparing floating and stressed matrix contraction stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor and lysophosphatidic acid (21Kolodney M.S. Elson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23850-23855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rayan G.M. Parizi M. Tomasek J.J. J. Hand Surg. 1996; 21: 1065-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results of our studies suggest that collagen matrix contraction is determined by complex interrelationships between different growth factors, signal transduction mechanisms, and the mechanical state of the cells,i.e. mechanically loaded or unloaded. Details are reported herein. PDGF (BB isotype) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), collagenase type I, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and lysophosphatidic acid were obtained from Sigma. Pertussis toxin was obtained from Calbiochem. C3 exotransferase was obtained from List Biological Laboratories Inc. (Campbell, CA). KT5926 was obtained from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), trypsin/EDTA solution, and Lipofectin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Intergen Co. (Purchase, NY). Vitrogen 100 collagen was obtained from Collagen Corp. (Palo Alto, CA). Fibroblasts from human foreskin specimens (<10 passages) were maintained in Falcon 75-cm2tissue culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were harvested from monolayer culture with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA. Trypsin was neutralized with soybean trypsin inhibitor (3.3 mg/ml) or 10% serum-containing medium. To harvest fibroblasts from collagen matrices (see below), the matrices were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA (200 μl/matrix), followed by treatment in a shaking incubator for 20 min with 5 mg/ml collagenase (250 μl/matrix) and then 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μl). The procedure for studying contraction of floating and stressed collagen matrices has been described previously (20Lin Y.-C. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Lin Y.-C. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is outlined in Fig. 1. Hydrated collagen matrices were prepared from Vitrogen 100 collagen. Neutralized collagen solutions (1.5 mg/ml) contained fibroblasts in DMEM without serum. Aliquots (0.2 ml, 2 × 105 cells) of the cell/collagen mixtures were prewarmed to 37 °C for 3–4 min and then placed in Corning 24-well culture plates. Each aliquot occupied an area outlined by an 11-mm diameter circular score within a well. Polymerization of collagen matrices required 60 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the polymerized matrices were used immediately or cultured with 1.0 ml of DMEM and 10% FBS and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for 1–2 days to allow the cells to develop mechanical stress. To initiate matrix contraction, freshly polymerized or mechanically stressed matrices were gently released from the underlying culture dish with a spatula into ∼0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and growth factors as indicated, after which the matrices were incubated at 37 °C. For convenience in carrying out the experimental protocols, growth factors usually were added to floating collagen matrices immediately after release and to stressed collagen matrices immediately before release. Reversing the procedure did not change the results, however. To determine the extent of floating or stressed matrix contraction, samples were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, and 6 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2) for 10 min at 22 °C. The matrices were washed, placed on a flat surface, and measured with a ruler. For quantitative purposes, contraction data are presented as the change in diameter (starting − final) measured in millimeters. All experiments were carried out in duplicate, and every experiment was repeated two or more times. Data points and error bars in the figures represent averages and S.D. Where error bars cannot be seen, the data points overlapped. To load fibroblasts in monolayer culture or mechanically stressed collagen matrices with pertussis toxin, the cells were incubated overnight in DMEM and 10% FBS containing PTx at the concentrations indicated. To load fibroblasts in monolayer cultures with C3 exotransferase (C3), Lipofectin was used as a delivery system (24Kreisberg J.I. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Radnik R.A. Schwartz M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F283-F288PubMed Google Scholar). Lipofectin/C3 was prepared in 120 μl of antibiotic/antimycotic-free DMEM and diluted with additional antibiotic/antimycotic-free DMEM after 1 h at 22 °C to give a final concentration of 10 μg/ml Lipofectin and C3 as indicated. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the Lipofectin/C3 mixture or Lipofectin prepared identically except without C3 for 30 min at 37 °C. Following treatment with Lipofectin/C3 or Lipofectin alone, the cells were rinsed and further incubated with DMEM and 10% FBS for 60 min at 37 °C before harvesting. To load fibroblasts in collagen matrices with C3 exotransferase, cells in stressed matrices were rinsed and incubated with DMEM containing C3 as indicated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the matrices were released, allowing C3 exotransferase to enter through ∼4-nm plasma membrane passages that open for <5 s during basal contraction (23Lin Y.-C. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Afterward, the cells were incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. An analogous method was used for loading C3 into cells during embryonic wounding (25Brock J. Midwinter K. Lewis J. Martin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1097-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the typical appearance of floating collagen matrices after contraction for 4 h (FMC). The diameter of the matrices was 10.5 mm at the time contraction was initiated. In DMEM alone, little contraction of the matrix occurred, but the matrix diameter decreased markedly when contraction was carried out in the presence of 100 ng/ml PDGF or 10 μm LPA. Fig. 3 shows a typical time course of matrix contraction in the presence of LPA or PDGF. The rates of contraction were relatively linear over 4 h, although there was some variation from experiment to experiment whether PDGF or LPA was the better stimulator of contraction.Figure 3Time course of contraction of floating matrices. Contraction of floating matrices was carried out for the time periods shown with PDGF (100 ng/ml) or LPA (10 μm) added as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mixing experiments with LPA and PDGF were carried out, and typical results are shown in Fig. 4. We consistently observed faster contraction with LPA and PDGF combined than with saturating concentrations of either growth factor alone, suggesting that complementary signaling mechanisms could activate contraction. One way to distinguish these mechanisms was with the protein kinase inhibitor KT5926. As shown in Fig.5, KT5926 completely blocked PDGF-stimulated contraction of floating matrices, but had little effect on LPA-stimulated contraction. Another protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, also selectively blocked PDGF-stimulated contraction, but appeared to do so by interfering with PDGF receptor phosphorylation (26Secrist J.P. Sehgal I. Powis G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20394-20400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KT5926, on the other hand, had no effect on PDGF receptor phosphorylation (data not shown).Figure 5Effect of KT5926 on contraction of floating matrices stimulated by PDGF and LPA. Contraction of floating matrices was carried out for 4 h in the presence of PDGF (100 ng/ml) or LPA (10 μm) with KT5926 added at the concentrations indicated 10 min prior to adding the growth factors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 also shows the typical appearance of stressed collagen matrices undergoing contraction (SMC). In this case, a substantial decrease in matrix diameter occurred even in DMEM without serum or growth factors (i.e. basal contraction). During the first hour, the extent of contraction was stimulated further by the addition of LPA, but not by PDGF. Fig. 6 shows the time course for contraction of stressed matrices. The basal component of contraction (no growth factor) was complete within 5 min. LPA-stimulated contraction increased rapidly up to 1 h. On the other hand, stimulation of contraction by PDGF was undetectable until after an ∼1-h lag period. The lag period in PDGF stimulation of stressed matrices was observed at PDGF concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 200 ng/ml, whereas PDGF at 50 ng/ml was sufficient to maximally stimulate contraction of floating matrices (data not shown). The faster rate of LPA-stimulated contraction of stressed collagen matrices compared with floating matrices might have occurred because cells in stressed matrices have actin stress fibers (12Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, the matrices were released in DMEM alone, allowing stress fibers to disassemble in the absence of growth factor-stimulated contraction (23Lin Y.-C. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and then LPA was added. LPA stimulated rapid contraction of stressed matrices even if added 2 h after release (data not shown), suggesting that the presence of the stress fibers at the time of LPA addition was unnecessary for rapid contraction. Besides the differences in rate of contraction, floating and stressed collagen matrices were observed to respond to markedly different concentrations of LPA. The typical dose-response curve in Fig. 7 shows that 100 nm LPA was sufficient to maximally stimulate contraction of floating collagen matrices, but had little effect on stressed matrices. The latter required 10–100 μm LPA for maximal contraction. The difference in the LPA concentration dependence and rate of contraction of floating versus stressed collagen matrices raised the possibility that different LPA receptors or receptor-linked signaling pathways were involved. LPA interacts with receptors linked to pertussis toxin-sensitive (Gi) and -insensitive (Gq and G12/13) heterotrimeric G-proteins (27Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Therefore, experiments were carried out to determine the effects of pertussis toxin on fibroblast contraction of collagen matrices. Fig. 8 shows that preloading fibroblasts with pertussis toxin almost completely blocked the ability of LPA to stimulate contraction of floating matrices. Under the same conditions, PDGF-stimulated contraction was only slightly inhibited. In marked contrast, as shown by the example in Fig.9, preloading cells with pertussis toxin did not inhibit LPA-stimulated contraction of stressed matrices (SMC). Even when the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml PTx, there was little effect on contraction of stressed matrices (data not shown). Fig. 9 also shows that when fibroblasts were harvested from stressed collagen matrices and retested for contraction in floating matrices (FMC), contraction of PTx-treated cells was inhibited ∼50% compared with controls. These results suggest that LPA-stimulated contraction of floating matrices depends on LPA receptors linked to pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G-proteins, whereas LPA-stimulated contraction of stressed matrices depends on receptors linked to pertussis toxin-insensitive heterotrimeric G-proteins.Figure 9Effect of pertussis toxin on LPA-stimulated contraction of stressed and floating matrices. Fibroblasts in stressed matrices were incubated overnight with 25 ng/ml PTx (PT) as indicated. Subsequently, contraction of stressed matrices (SMC) was tested with LPA (10 μm) added as indicated for 1 h. Alternatively, cells were harvested from the stressed matrices and then tested for contraction of floating matrices (FMC) for 4 h with LPA (10 μm) added as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LPA has been identified as the principal factor in serum that promotes assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions (28Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar) through a contractile process that depends on the small G-protein Rho (29Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K.

This effect of LPA is pertussis toxin-insensitive (31Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar) and probably involves LPA receptors linked to the heterotrimeric G-protein G13 (32Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Experiments were therefore carried out to test whether collagen matrix contraction was affected by the toxin C3 exotransferase, a specific inhibitor of Rho activity (33Narumiya S. Sekine A. Fujiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 10 shows that releasing stressed matrices in the presence of 20 μg/ml C3 exotransferase blocked subsequent LPA stimulation of contraction. As would be predicted (23Lin Y.-C. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), C3 had no effect if it was added after the matrices were released (data not shown). In control experiments, C3-loaded cells were harvested from collagen matrices and tested for cell spreading on fibronectin-coated substrata after 2 and 24 h. After 2 h, C3-loaded cells spread in an arborized morphology on fibronectin-coated substrata (31Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar, 34Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), but the cells attained normal morphology within 24 h (data not shown). To study the effect of C3 exotransferase on contraction of floating collagen matrices, C3 was loaded into fibroblasts in monolayer culture using Lipofectin. Fibroblasts treated with Lipofectin/C3, but not Lipofectin or C3 alone, showed arborized spreading morphology on fibronectin-coated substrata (data not shown). Fig.11 presents a typical experiment showing that cells treated with Lipofectin/C3 were unable to contract floating collagen matrices regardless of whether LPA or PDGF was used to stimulate contraction, whereas cells treated with Lipofectin or C3 alone were unaffected. Therefore, the small G-protein Rho appeared to be required not only for contraction of stressed collagen matrices, but also for contraction of floating collagen matrices. The signal transduction pathways that regulate contraction of collagen matrices by fibroblasts are poorly understood. To learn more about these pathways, we compared the ability of LPA and PDGF to stimulate contraction of floating and stressed collagen matrices. The results suggest that contraction of floating and stressed collagen matrices depends on different signaling mechanisms. PDGF and LPA appeared to stimulate contraction of floating collagen matrices by complementary signaling pathways since contraction obtained by the combination of growth factors exceeded that observed with saturating concentrations of either alone. One way to distinguish these pathways was with the protein kinase inhibitor KT5926. Staurosporine also selectively blocked PDGF-stimulated contraction, but appeared to do so by interfering with PDGF receptor phosphorylation (26Secrist J.P. Sehgal I. Powis G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20394-20400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that serum-stimulated contraction could be blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (35Guidry C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J.

Silverman M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), phospholipase C (39Langholz O. Roeckel D. Petersohn D. Broermann E. Eckes B. Krieg T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (38Zent R. Ailenberg M. Silverman M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). None of the other inhibitors used previously, however, was found to preferentially inhibit PDGF- versus LPA-stimulated contraction. Although we have not determined the precise site at which KT5926 inhibits PDGF-stimulated contraction, it is worth noting other studies suggesting that KT5926 selectively inhibits myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (40Nakanishi S. Yamada K. Iwahashi K. Kuroda K. Kase H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 482-488PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of MLC has been implicated in matrix contraction, albeit indirectly (21Kolodney M.S. Elson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23850-23855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ehrlich H.P. Rockwell W.B. Cornwell T.L. Rajaratnam J.B.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, preferential inhibition of PDGF-stimulated contraction by KT5926 may reflect a requirement for MLC kinase in MLC phosphorylation during PDGF- but not LPA-stimulated contraction. Consistent with this possibility, LPA can cause MLC phosphorylation without MLC kinase through the activity of Rho kinase (42Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar, 43Kureishi Y. Kobayashi S. Amano M. Kimura K. Kanaide H. Nakano T. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12257-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that preferential inhibition of PDGF-stimulated contraction by KT5926 occurs at the level of some other protein kinase, and future studies will be required to analyze this point. Surprisingly, LPA-stimulated contraction of floating matrices was pertussis toxin-sensitive, whereas LPA-stimulated contraction of stressed matrices was pertussis toxin-insensitive. One interpretation of this result is that LPA stimulates contraction of fibroblasts in floating matrices through receptors coupled to Gi and stimulates contraction of cells in stressed matrices through receptors coupled to G13 (although Gq cannot be ruled out at present). LPA receptors coupled to different heterotrimeric G-proteins have been implicated in different aspects of cell motility. LPA stimulation of fibroblast migration and chemotaxis was shown to depend on LPA receptors coupled to Gi (44Lummen G. Virchow S. Rumenapp U. Schmidt M. Wieland T. Otto T. Rubben H. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 45Pietruck F. Busch S. Virchow S. Brockmeyer N. Siffert W. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, LPA stimulation of stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly requires activation of the small G-protein Rho (29Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 30Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), a pertussis toxin-insensitive process (31Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar) in which LPA receptors are coupled to G13 (32Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The latter pathway has also been implicated in neurite rounding and retraction (46Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Contraction of floating and stressed collagen matrices may also reflect different aspects of cell motility. Fibroblasts in floating collagen matrices are round to begin with and spread during contraction (Ref. 8Ehrlich H.P. Rajaratnam J.B. Tissue Cell. 1990; 22: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 11Grinnell F. Lamke C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1984; 66: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cells in stressed matrices begin in a spread morphology with prominent stress fibers and withdraw their extensions during contraction (12Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 47Lee T.L. Lin Y.-C. Mochitate K. Grinnell F. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 167-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the former case, contraction probably depends on tractional forces that accompany the protrusion of cell extensions (48Harris A.K. Stopak D. Wild P. Nature. 1981; 290: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the stress fibers themselves can contract once there is no longer a rigid substratum to maintain isometric tension (49Burridge K. Nature. 1981; 294: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Given this interpretation, it is not surprising that the Rho inhibitor C3 exotransferase blocks contraction of both floating and stressed collagen matrices since inhibition of Rho with C3 exotransferase can prevent normal spreading of freshly plated cells (34Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) as well as actin filament assembly and focal adhesion formation in already spread cells (50Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The observation of different regulatory mechanisms for contraction of stressed and floating collagen matrices opens the possibility for future studies to characterize in more detail the signaling mechanisms involved and the interrelationships between different growth factors, signal transduction mechanisms, and the mechanical state of the cells,i.e. mechanically loaded or unloaded. In addition, our results have potentially important clinical implications. In the absence of complications, the process of wound contraction leads to wound closure with little scarring or loss of function. In large wounds and some pathological situations such as hypertrophic scars, however, the consequences of contraction can result in loss of joint motion or major body deformations referred to as contractures (51Hunt T.K. Dunphy J.E. Fundamentals of Wound Management. Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York1979: 116-118Google Scholar, 52Rudolph R. Berg J.V. Ehrlich H.P. Cohen I.K. Diegelmann R.F. Lindblad W.J.

The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1988: 373-402Google Scholar). Contraction of floating collagen matrices resembles more closely the initial phase of wound contraction dependent on cell motility (8Ehrlich H.P. Rajaratnam J.B. Tissue Cell. 1990; 22: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 54Gross J. Farinelli W. Sadow P. Anderson R. Bruns R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas the myofibroblast-like cells in mechanically stressed matrices are more typical of the late phase of wound contraction and contractures (3Desmoulière A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 391-423Google Scholar, 4Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Consequently, wound contraction and wound contracture may be under the control of different growth factors and signal transduction regulatory mechanisms in vivo and therefore subject to different pharmacological means of clinical intervention. We are indebted to David Lee and Drs. Joseph Albanesi, Kristine Kamm, and William Snell for helpful comments and suggestions."

IgE-mediated allergic reactions may develop to a variety of environmental compounds, but the initiation of a response requires the binding of IgE to its high-affinity receptor. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the antibody-binding domains of the human IgE receptor at 2.4 A resolution. The structure reveals a highly bent arrangement of immunoglobulin domains that form an extended convex surface of interaction with IgE. A prominent loop that confers specificity for IgE molecules extends from the receptor surface near an unusual arrangement of four exposed tryptophans. The crystal structure of the IgE receptor provides a foundation for the development of new therapeutic approaches to allergy treatment."

In several cases, skin fibroblast tropoelastin production is markedly reduced yet reversed in vitro by transforming growth factor-β treatment. We previously showed that this reversal was due to elastin mRNA stabilization in one cell strain, and here this behavior was confirmed in skin fibroblasts from two generations of a second family. cDNA sequencing and heteroduplex analysis of elastin gene transcripts from three fibroblast strains in two kindreds now identify two frameshift mutations (2012ΔG and 2039ΔC) in elastin gene exon 30, thus leading to missense C termini. No other mutations were present in theELN cDNA sequences of all three affected individuals. Transcripts from both alleles in each kindred were unstable and responsive to transforming growth factor-β. Exons 22, 23, 26A, and 32 were always absent. Since exon 30 underwent alternative splicing in fibroblasts, we speculate that a differential splicing pattern could conceivably lead to phenotypic rescue.

These two dominant-acting, apparently de novo mutations in the elastin gene appear to be responsible for qualitative and quantitative defects in elastin, resulting in the cutis laxa phenotype. Elastic fibers are the extracellular matrix structures responsible for the properties of resilience and elastic recoil in all elastic tissues (1Parks W.C. Pierce R.A. Lee K.A. Mecham R.P. Kleinman H.K. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. 6. J AI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1993: 133-182Google Scholar, 2Rosenbloom J. Abrams W. Mecham R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). There are two morphological elements in elastic fibers: the microfibrillar component and the amorphous component. The microfibrillar component is made up of 10–12-nm microfibrils that are composed of at least seven different glycoproteins, including the two genetically distinct fibrillins, whose genes are the loci for Marfan's syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (3Lee B.

Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders : Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 436-468Google Scholar). Elastin is also present in the amorphous component as a cross-linked complex of hydrophobic proteins synthesized from the single copy, multi-exon elastin gene (ELN) by extensive alternate usage of several exons (1Parks W.C.

Abnormal elastic fibers are seen in Menkes' syndrome due to altered copper transport resulting in decreased activity of lysyl oxidase (8Pasquali-Ronchetti I. Baccarini-Contri M. Young R. Vogel A. Steinmann B. Royce P. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1994; 61: 36-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas elastic fibers are prematurely degraded due to unregulated elastase activity in patients with α1-antitrypsin deficiency (9Martorana P. Brand T. Gardi C. van Even P. de Santi M. Calzoni P. Marcolongo P. Lungarella G. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 233-241PubMed Google Scholar) and some forms of atrophoderma (10Giro M. Oikarinen A.I.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum and Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome are examples of heritable skin diseases in which increased deposition of cutaneous or vascular elastin has been demonstrated (11Neldner K.H.

In contrast, decreased or aberrant deposition of elastic fibers in certain tissues is characteristic of Marfan's syndrome (13Hollister D.W. Godfrey M. Sakai L.Y. Pyeritz R.E. N. Engl. J.

Most patients with Williams syndrome that have SVAS are heterozygous for deletions of ELN and presumably other contiguous genes on chromosome 7q (21Keating M.T. Circulation. 1995; 92: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Lowery M. Morris C. Ewart A. Brothman L. Zhu X. Leonard C. Carey J. Keating M. Am. J. Hum.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The connective tissue features of SVAS and Williams syndrome are consistent with, but not yet shown to be due to, functional hemizygosity at ELN. We have previously shown in one cutis laxa cell strain that transcript instability was the basis of a defect in ELN mRNA accumulation and tropoelastin production (24Zhang M.-C. Giro M. Quaglino Jr., D. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TGF-β was able to increase mRNA stability markedly and to stimulate production of immunoreactive tropoelastin protein in this cell strain. Since the metabolic and ultrastructural defect was confined to elastin, we hypothesized that a structural defect in the ELN transcript could be responsible for decreased mRNA stability. In this report, we describe heterozygosity for a frameshift mutation (2012ΔG) inELN in this cutis laxa patient and a similar mutation in two generations of a second cutis laxa family (2039ΔC), which we propose to be responsible for defects in tropoelastin production. Patient K.T. was the 3.8-kg full-term male product of an uncomplicated pregnancy, labor, and delivery to a 23-year old G2P1 Caucasian mother. The parents denied consanguinity. Loose skin, stridor, and feeding difficulties were apparent from birth. Additional clinical findings ascertained during infancy included moderate subglottic stenosis with floppy airway structures, redundant mitral and tricuspid valves, mild dilatation of the proximal aorta and great vessels, and umbilical and inguinal hernias. He underwent inguinal herniorrhaphies at ages 7 months, 3 years, and 14 years. At age 17 years, his height and weight are at the 75th percentile. His physical exam is significant for an aged appearance: smooth, loose skin lacking elastic recoil; tortuous, pulsatile external carotid arteries; and a hoarse voice. He complains of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath. His echocardiogram is relatively unremarkable except for minimal aortic root dilatation; an electrocardiogram reveals mild right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary function testing shows reduced expiratory flow, suggestive of fixed or collapsible upper airway obstruction. Histologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical analyses of skin and cultured fibroblasts from the patient have been reported previously (17Sephel G. Byers P. Holbrook K. Davidson J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang M.-C. Giro M. Quaglino Jr., D. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, dermal collagen fibers appear normal, but elastic fibers appear fragmented with a paucity of amorphous elastin in the matrix. Tropoelastin production in cultured fibroblasts from this patient was the lowest of six cutis laxa patients studied (17Sephel G. Byers P. Holbrook K. Davidson J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an apparent nonspecific increase in type VI collagen production was also noted (25Crawford S.W. Featherstone J.A. Holbrook K. Yong S.L. Bornstein P. Sage H. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Limited clinical information is available on the second family at this time. The female proband (WM) was ascertained in 1965 with classical cutaneous features of cutis laxa at 2 years. This individual gave birth to an affected son (WS) in 1991, and skin biopsies were cultured from both individuals in 1993 by Drs. J. Uitto and E. Tan (Jefferson Medical College). The father and maternal parents were reportedly unaffected, and the patients have been lost to follow-up. Skin fibroblasts were grown from skin biopsies obtained after appropriate consent. Normal human skin fibroblasts (GM4390) were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc., Norcross, GA). Confluent cultured cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2 ml of 4 mguanidine isothiocyanate containing 0.1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. DNA was sheared by three passages through a 22-gauge needle, and RNA was isolated by extraction in acid phenol/chloroform (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar). Isolated RNA was stored at −70 °C. cDNA was synthesized using 1–3 μg of total cellular RNA with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and 0.75 mm gene-specific oligonucleotide primers in a total volume of 20 μl for 60 min at 37 °C. Eleven pairs of overlapping primers were designed to amplify the complete coding and untranslated regions of ELNmRNA. Primers were constructed according to the cDNA sequences for the ELN coding region (GenBankTM accession number M36860) (27Fazio M. Olsen D. Kauh E. Baldwin C. Indik Z. Ornstein-Goldstein N. Yeh H. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermtol. 1988; 91: 458-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and 3′-UTR (accession number M17282) (28Indik Z. Yoon K. Morrow S.D. Cicila G. Rosenbloom J. Ornstein-Goldstein N. Connect. Tissue Res. 1987; 16: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Primers designated F are based on the sense strand sequence, and primers designated R are based on the complementary strand sequence. The primers for the elastin coding region were as follows (numbering from the transcription start site): 96F, 5′-ATCGATCCTGCTGTCCATCCTCCA-3′; 419R, 5′-ACACTCCTAAGCCACCAACT-3′; 397F, 5′-AGGAGTTGGTGGCTTAGGAG-3′; 728R, 5′-GCAGTTTCCCTGTGGTGTAG-3′; 709F, 5′-CTGCACCACAGGGAAACTGC-3′; 1064R, 5′-CTCCTGGGACACCAACTACT-3′; 992F, 5′-AAGTATGGAGCTGCTGCAGG-3′; 1410R, 5′-ACTCCGTACTTGGCAGCCTT-3′; 1271F, 5′-GGTGTCGGAGTCGGAGGTAT-3′; 1798R, 5′-AACACCAGCACCAACTCCAA-3′; 1761F, 5′-GTGCTGGTGTTCCTGGACTT-3′; and 2292R, 5′-AGCAGTAGCACCAACGTTGA-3′. The primers for the elastin 3′-UTR were as follows (numbering from the 3′-UTR): He3′UTR15F, 5′-CTGACTCACGACCTCATCAA-3′; He3′UTR328R, 5′-CAGGAAGATAAGAGCACCAG-3′; He3′UTR302F, 5′-CTACACGCTGGTGCTCTTAT-3′; He3′UTR741R, 5′-GACAGGTCAACCAGGTTGAT-3′; He3′UTR721F, 5′-CATCAACCTGGTTGACCTGT-3′; He3′UTR1092R, 5′-TTCTACTGGGGATACAGCTC-3′; He3′UTR1029F, 5′-TTGTGTCTCGCTGTGATAGA-3′; and He3′UTR1255R, 5′-CCAACAGTTGAAGGCAGATT-3′. The primers for the elastin 5′-UTR were as follows (numbering from the transcription start site): −243F He-promoter, 5′-GTGTGTGCGTGTGTTGTGTC-3′; and +155R He-intron I, 5′-CTTGAGCGTCTAGTCACCTG-3′. The primers for introns 29 and 30 were as follows: 212F in intron 29, 5′-GGAGTCTAATGCTCAGCTGT-3′; and 489R in intron 30, 5′-CACCTTGGCCTACTAGAGTG-3′. PCRs were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer minicycler in 50-μl volumes using 1–2 μl of reverse transcription products, a 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, a 0.4 mmconcentration of each dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The reaction cycles consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min per cycle for 30 cycles. PCR products amplified by different F and R primer combinations from both cutis laxa and control cell strains were separated by ethidium bromide-1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplimers of the expected sizes were excised and purified using Prep-A-Gene DNA purification systems (Bio-Rad). Sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISMTM 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) or manual sequencing using the double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing system (Life Technologies, Inc.). For mutation confirmation, three different RT-PCR products were independently sequenced. RT-PCR products of ∼3 kilobases synthesized with primers 96F and He3′UTR741R were separated by electrophoresis, purified, and cloned into the pNoTA vector using the PRIME PCR CLONERTM cloning system (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) according to manufacturer's instructions. A total of 31 white colonies was picked from overnight cultures and propagated in LB medium for plasmid minipreps. The plasmid DNAs were digested withBamHI, and positive clones with correctly sized inserts (2854 bp) were identified by gel electrophoresis. The 2012ΔG deletion in exon 30 of K.T. created a novel Alw26I restriction site. RT-PCR products amplified by primers 11 and 12 (476 bp) from K.T. fibroblasts, a control cell strain, and genomic PCR products amplified by primers 23 and 24 (277 bp) from the proband, his parents, and 65 unaffected individuals were digested with Alw26I at 37 °C for 60 min. The 2039ΔC deletion abolished a PflMI site in the same PCR product of the mutant allele in WM and WS. DNAs from an additional 48 individuals were also screened for the same mutation. The digests were electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ethidium bromide/UV fluorescence. PCR was performed with primers 1761F and 2292R in the presence of 0.3 μCi of [32P]dCTP for 30 cycles. Equal amounts of PCR products from normal and cutis laxa fibroblasts were mixed, incubated at 95 °C for 2 min, and gradually (20–30 min) cooled to 37 °C. After adding 1 μl of loading buffer to 5 μl of sample, the samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.5× Mutation Detection Enhancement gel (FMC Corp. BioProducts, Rockland, ME). Elastin production and mRNA stability studies were carried out as described previously (17Sephel G. Byers P. Holbrook K. Davidson J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang M.-C. Giro M. Quaglino Jr., D. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated and purified using the QIAshredderTM and the RNeasyTM mini kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A single base deletion (2012ΔG) in exon 30 of ELN was initially identified by direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products from patient fibroblasts (Fig. 1). This mutation created a novel Alw26I recognition site (![N]5GAGAC); heterozygosity for the deletion was confirmed in the RT-PCR product by the presence of diagnostic 244- and 132-bp bands after digestion of the 476-bp PCR product withAlw26I (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, heterozygosity for the mutation was confirmed at the genomic DNA level in the patient, but the polymorphism was absent in DNA from both parents (Fig. 2 B) and 65 unrelated control samples (data not shown).Figure 2Confirmation of heterozygosity for theELNmutation in strain K.T. A, RT-PCR products from patient (K.T.) and control (GM4390) fibroblast mRNAs were digested with Alw26I and separated by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mutation creates a novelAlw26I site (*), thus further cleaving the normal 376-bp fragment into 244 and 132 bp. B, genomic DNAs from the patient and his unaffected parents were amplified by PCR with primers 212F and 489R (see “Experimental Procedures”), digested withAlw26I, and separated by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mutation creates a novel Alw26I site (*), thus further cleaving the normal 120-bp fragment into 97 and 23 bp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon sequencing the entire ELN coding region as well as 240 bp of the 5′-UTR and 1.2 kilobases of the 3′-UTR, no other sequence variations could be found between the two cloned patient alleles and controls. Both alleles contained A at position 1313, the site of an A/G (Ser422/Gly) polymorphism (29Tromp G. Christiano A. Goldstein N. Indik Z. Rosenbloom J. Boyd C. Deak S. Prockop D. Kuivaniemi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several other presumably less significant base changes were found in the 1.2-kilobaseELN 3′-UTR of both patient and control strains that differed from or complemented GenBankTM entry M17282 (28Indik Z. Yoon K. Morrow S.D. Cicila G. Rosenbloom J. Ornstein-Goldstein N. Connect. Tissue Res. 1987; 16: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These included seven base changes (T174 to A, T196 to C, C737 to G, A1195 to C, C1216 to A, T1245 to A, and T1258 to A), four insertions (C233, C776, C788, and C861), three deletions (A335, A724, and A1137), and 15 newly identified residues (G857, C861, C863, C876, C924, T925, C926, G939, C946, C962, C963, C1018, A1227, A1228, and C1231). Although these ELN 3′-UTR sequences differ from the original GenBankTM data, they were identical in our patient and control fibroblast mRNAs. Further sequencing of elastin cDNA revealed that exons 22, 23, 26A, and 32 were spliced out of transcripts from both control and K.T. fibroblasts (Fig. 3), a feature that has been reported previously in normal cells (30Bashir M. Indik Z. Yeh H. Abrams W. Ornstein-Goldstein N. Rosenbloom J. Fazio M. Uitto J. Mecham R. Rosenbloom J. Tamburro A. Davidson J. Elastin, Chemical and Biological Aspects. Congedo Editore, Galatina, Italy1990: 45-70Google Scholar). A second set of fibroblast strains from a kindred with an affected mother (WM) and son (WS) showed characteristic low tropoelastin production with high induction of the protein by TGF-β (Fig. 4). Elastin mRNA only accumulated in these strains in the presence of TGF-β, and it rapidly degraded as soon as TGF-β was withdrawn (Fig. 4 B). Heteroduplex analysis revealed a novel band mobility in WM and WS using primer pairs that spanned the exon 30 region (data not shown). Eight full-length cDNA clones were derived from WS mRNA and completely sequenced. Three of the cDNA clones lacked exon 30 (Fig.5 A). Of the five cDNA clones containing this exon, four showed a deletion of C2039 (Fig. 5 A), which predicts a frameshift mutation with consequences similar to those of strain K.T.Figure 5Detection of a point deletion in cutis laxa strains from WM and WS. A, the left panelshows a segment of the normal sequence within exon 30; the middle panel (2039ΔC) illustrates the point deletion (GCCTTA>GCTTA); and the right panel shows the splice junction between exons 29 and 31. B, genomic DNAs from the two affected strains and GM4390 were amplified by PCR to yield a 277-bp product. Digestion withPflMI produced quantitative cleavage of the product of control cells, whereas only 50% of WM and WS products were cleaved.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Heterozygosity of the mutation in WM and her son (WS) was established by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. To confirm the heterozygosity and to rule out a polymorphism, restriction digests were performed withPf1MI (Fig. 5 B). 50% of WS and WM DNAs were resistant to enzyme digestion, whereas DNAs from 50 other unrelated individuals were fully susceptible to Pf1MI enzyme digestion at the exon 30 locus. As shown previously for K.T. (24Zhang M.-C. Giro M. Quaglino Jr., D. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and above for WM and WS, TGF-β could in part restore tropoelastin expression in these cutis laxa fibroblasts by stabilizing ELN mRNA. To examine whether partial restoration of ELN mRNA stability was functioning through selective expression ofELN mRNA from the normal allele, RT-PCR products amplifying the region spanning nucleotides 1671–2292 from TGF-β-treated and untreated K.T. fibroblasts were analyzed under semi-quantitative conditions. Amplified products were digested withAlw26I. The intensity of the 244-bp mutant allele fragment relative to the normal 376-bp fragment did not change after TGF-β exposure (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained with RNAs from WS and WM (data not shown). Transcripts of both alleles had equivalent instability. The two single base deletions in exon 30 each predict a frameshift in the coding region for the elastin carboxyl terminus. The predicted, truncated protein product would consist of 667 amino acids (Fig. 7). Since exon 32 was usually absent, the predicted open reading frame (ORF) of the mutant transcript would more frequently continue into the 3′-UTR to be translated as a missense structure of 713 amino acids lacking the distinctive carboxyl terminus of tropoelastin (Fig. 7). In the less likely event of inclusion of exon 32, the mutation would create a premature termination codon in exon 32, predicting a truncated, missense C terminus and a translation product of 667 amino acid residues. Among the 3′-UTR sequence corrections/additions that were noted, only the T174 to A substitution would have functional significance in the translation of the mutant allele since it would create a novel stop codon (TAA174) in the shifted ORF. This new stop codon would be 25 amino acids downstream of the normal translation termination site. Cutis laxa is a relatively rare connective tissue disease characterized by genetic heterogeneity and clinical variability (6Uitto J. Fazio M. Olson D. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1989; 21: 614-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,31Damkier A. Brandrup F. Starklint H. Clin.

In all cases, the primary diagnostic feature is loose, hyperextensible skin with decreased resilience and elasticity, leading to a premature aged appearance. The skin changes are often accompanied by extracutaneous manifestations, including pulmonary emphysema, bladder diverticula, pulmonary artery stenosis, and pyloric stenosis. Histological examination of the skin in cutis laxa often reveals marked fragmentation or diminution of elastic fibers (6Uitto J. Fazio M. Olson D. J. Am. Acad.

This is a considerably different phenotype than that found in SVAS, a pathology arising from elastin mutations that lead to functional hemizygosity (15Curran M.E. Atkinson D.L. Ewart A.K. Morris C.A.

Skin fibroblast cultures from many cutis laxa patients exhibit reduced ELN mRNA levels or tropoelastin production, but fibroblasts from other affected individuals exhibit normal levels of elastin production with abnormal elastic fiber morphology (17Sephel G. Byers P. Holbrook K. Davidson J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Tassabehji M. Metcalfe K. Hurst J. Ashcroft G.S. Kielty C. Wilmot C. Donnai D. Read A.P. Jones C.J.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At the time of submission of this manuscript, the molecular basis for cutis laxa had not been described. However, another group has recently reported autosomal dominant cutis laxa associated with a point deletion in exon 32 (37Olsen D. Fazio M. Shamban A. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6465-6467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This exon was absent from the cDNAs examined in this study. Unlike the biochemical phenotype reported here, elastin mRNA is expressed and apparently stable in this strain, and the data from that report are consistent with a dominant-negative effect at the level of elastic fiber formation. The fibroblasts in this study produced insignificant amounts of elastin mRNA and protein in the absence of TGF-β stimulation. We identified two single base deletions (2012ΔG and 2039ΔC) in the coding region of ELN cDNA from two cutis laxa lineages. Analysis of the parental DNA indicated a de novo mutation in proband K.T., and limited familial information suggests that a de novo mutation in WM was passed to her son, WS. Both of the deletions would result in translation of missense protein sequence 3′ to the mutation, and they predict subsequent loss of the functional carboxyl terminus in the tropoelastin molecule by missense and/or premature termination, depending on the more frequent splicing out or less frequent inclusion of exon 32 (Fig. 7). Thus, different tissues could produce defective elastin molecules with slightly different carboxyl termini, depending on the tissue-specific mRNA splicing pattern. Regardless of the status of exon 32 splicing, each of these point deletions dictates the loss of two conserved cysteine residues that create an intramolecular disulfide bridge and that are thought to be important, together with a basic tetrapeptide tail, for interaction of tropoelastin with other proteins present in the elastic fibers of microfibrils (38Mecham R. Davis E. Yurchenko P. Birk D. Mecham R. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar, 39Brown P. Mecham L. Tisdale C. Mecham R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although little or no normal or mutant protein is expressed in fibroblast cultures, tissues in vivo(particularly under the influence of TGF-β) might express significant levels of either defective gene product and lead to a dominant-negative effect at the level of protein assembly. We may be able to resolve this issue with C terminus-specific antibodies when tissue becomes available. Analysis of the mutation in WM and WS confirmed ELN as the cutis laxa locus. Both the similar location in exon 30 and the predicted translational consequences of 2012ΔG and 2039ΔC mutations are intriguing, and they may indicate a susceptible site for production of dominant-negative, viable ELN mutations. Exon 30 has recently been identified, at least in the rat, as a site for acis-acting mRNA stability element. 2M.-C. Zhang and W. C. Parks, submitted for publication. More important, our finding that exon 30 is alternatively spliced may be indicative of a phenotypic rescue mechanism (40Morisaki H. Morisaki T. Newby L.K. Holmes E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) whereby cells or tissues could escape the effects of the mutations. The same possibility would apply for the recent mutation described in exon 32 (37Olsen D. Fazio M. Shamban A. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6465-6467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that all three affected individuals are not severely incapacitated suggests that pulmonary and cardiovascular elastic tissues must be relatively spared. In contrast to the predominant effect of SVAS in the aortic root, both of the cutis laxa mutations appear to have a largely cutaneous phenotype. This could be due to tissue-specific or developmentally regulated differential expression of the two alleles, increased frequency of alternative splicing of exon 30 (or 32) in non-cutaneous tissues, or differential consequences of mutant RNA and protein in different cell types. The low frequency of polymorphisms in ELN makes analysis of allelic usage problematic. Transcripts from both normal and mutant alleles were equally unstable, and both transcripts were equally stabilized by TGF-β2. Both alleles were otherwise identical throughout the coding region, 223 bp of the 5′-UTR, and 1.2 kilobases of the 3′-UTR (data not shown). A comparable increase in the amount of both normal and mutant transcripts by TGF-β stimulation suggests that at least the proximal regulatory regions of both alleles are intact, including the response sites for TGF-β (41Marigo V. Volpin D. Vitale G. Bressan G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (42Wolfe B.L. Rich C.B. Goud H.D. Terpstra A.J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Sonenshein G.E. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12418-12426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the elastin promoter. We have previously shown thatELN transcription rates are normal in K.T. (24Zhang M.-C. Giro M. Quaglino Jr., D. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, since the point deletion was passed from WM to WS, compound heterozygosity could only have persisted in WS by donation of an independent mutation from his paternal ELN allele. These findings, together with the absence of the deletions in DNAs from both parents of K.T. and unrelated controls, argue that K.T. and probably WM are the origins of new dominant mutations that account for the cutis laxa phenotype. The molecular data predict that if mutant tropoelastin were synthesized, at least in skin, it would contain defective carboxyl termini. The quantitative and qualitative defects in tropoelastin production could readily account for the patients' abnormal (cutaneous) phenotype. We have not determined the mechanism whereby the heterozygous mutation appears to exert a dominant effect onELN mRNA stability. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is a protective cellular mechanism described for several genes; however, it acts in cis as a rule (43Belgrader P. Cheng J. Zhou X. Stephenson L. Maquat L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8219-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, this mechanism appears to be operative in some forms of SVAS (16Li D.Y. Toland A.E. Boak B.B. Atkinson D.L. Ensing G.J. Morris C.A. Keating M.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A dominant,trans-acting effect might arise if mutant transcripts altered the availability of a rate-limiting factor for elastin mRNA stability. Elastin mRNA levels drop if secretion is perturbed (44Frisch S. Davidson J. Werb Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and translational or packaging defects may have a feedback effect on mRNA stability (45Pachter J. Yen T. Cleveland D. Cell. 1987; 51: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To test these possibilities, current studies are directed at examining the effects of introducing a mutantELN cDNA into elastin-expressing cells. In conclusion, we have found two point deletions in ELN from individuals with the classical cutaneous phenotype of congenital cutis laxa. These mutations result in frameshifts that disrupt the sequence of the conserved carboxyl terminus of tropoelastin and lead to marked transcript instability. We speculate that variable splicing of the mutated exon may account for reduced severity and selective tissue effects. The elastin mutations in SVAS appear to involve functional hemizygosity that affects the elastin-rich aortic root (14Ewart A.K. Morris C.A. Atkinson D. Jin W. Sternes K. Spallone P. Stock A.D. Leppert M. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 15Curran M.E. Atkinson D.L. Ewart A.K. Morris C.A. Leppert M.F. Keating M.T.

Complementing these findings, autosomal dominant cutis laxa appears to arise from dominant-negative effects at the level of both RNA stability and protein assembly, with the prospect of a novel mechanism for variable tissue consequences. Identification of additional elastin mutations in both dominant and recessive forms of cutis laxa will enable us to understand better the structural biology and regulation of this important extracellular matrix component.

https://openalex.org/W2067672885,"The balance required to maintain appropriate cellular and tissue iron levels has led to the evolution of multiple mechanisms to precisely regulate iron uptake from transferrin and low molecular weight iron chelates. A role for ceruloplasmin (Cp) in vertebrate iron metabolism is suggested by its potent ferroxidase activity catalyzing conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+, by identification of yeast copper oxidases homologous to Cp that facilitate high affinity iron uptake, and by studies of “aceruloplasminemic” patients who have extensive iron deposits in multiple tissues. We have recently shown that Cp increases iron uptake by cultured HepG2 cells. In this report, we investigated the mechanism by which Cp stimulates cellular iron uptake. Cp stimulated the rate of non-transferrin 55Fe uptake by iron-deficient K562 cells by 2–3-fold, using a transferrin receptor-independent pathway. Induction of Cp-stimulated iron uptake by iron deficiency was blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, consistent with a transcriptionally induced or regulated transporter. Cp-stimulated iron uptake was completely blocked by unlabeled Fe3+ and by other trivalent cations including Al3+, Ga3+, and Cr3+, but not by divalent cations. These results indicate that Cp utilizes a trivalent cation-specific transporter. Cp ferroxidase activity was required for iron uptake as shown by the ineffectiveness of two ferroxidase-deficient Cp preparations, copper-deficient Cp and thiomolybdate-treated Cp. We propose a model in which iron reduction and subsequent re-oxidation by Cp are essential for an iron uptake pathway with high ion specificity.

Cp-stimulated iron uptake was completely blocked by unlabeled Fe3+ and by other trivalent cations including Al3+, Ga3+, and Cr3+, but not by divalent cations. These results indicate that Cp utilizes a trivalent cation-specific transporter. Cp ferroxidase activity was required for iron uptake as shown by the ineffectiveness of two ferroxidase-deficient Cp preparations, copper-deficient Cp and thiomolybdate-treated Cp. We propose a model in which iron reduction and subsequent re-oxidation by Cp are essential for an iron uptake pathway with high ion specificity. Iron is important in many biological processes because it is an ideal O2 carrier and because it can function as a protein-bound redox element. Iron deficiency is common worldwide and in infants can cause severe neurological deficit (1DeMaeyer E. Adiels-Tegman M. World Health Stat. Quart. 1985; 38: 302-316PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, iron in excess of cellular needs is toxic and dietary overload or hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) 1The abbreviations used are: HH, hereditary hemochromatosis; Cp, ceruloplasmin; GSH, reduced glutathione; Nramp, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamdie gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. leads to tissue iron deposition and injury (2Britton R.S.

Alterations of iron pools have been implicated in diverse human diseases, including neurodegenerative disease, aging, atherosclerosis, cancer, and microbial infection (4Brock J.H. Brock J.H. Halliday J.W. Pippard M.J. Powell L.W. Iron Metabolism in Health & Disease. W. B. Saunders, London1994: 353-389Google Scholar). The precise balance required to maintain appropriate intracellular and tissue iron levels has led to the evolution of several independent cellular iron transport pathways. The transferrin-mediated iron uptake pathway has been extensively studied and is an important model for understanding the recycling, receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. In this pathway, diferric transferrin is endocytosed by a cell surface transferrin receptor and iron is delivered to the cell by an endosomal pathway accompanied by recycling of transferrin and its receptor (5De Jong G. Van Dijk J.P. Van Eijk H.G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 190: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the transferrin receptor is suggested by its presence in virtually all cultured cells and by the fact that hypotransferrinemic animals develop severe hemochromatosis (6Craven C.M. Alexander J. Eldridge M. Kushner J.P. Bernstein S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The central importance of the transferrin pathway is shown by recent studies of HH, the most common inherited disease in people of northern European descent. Positional cloning studies of Feder et al.(7Feder J.N. Gnirke A. Thomas W. Tsuchihashi Z. Ruddy D.A. Basava A. Dormishian F. Domingo Jr., R. Ellis M.C. Fullan A. Hinton L.M. Jones N.L. Kimmel B.E. Kronmal G.S. Lauer P. Lee V.K. Loeb D.B. Mapa F.A. McClelland E. Meyer N.C. Mintier G.A. Moeller N. Moore T. Morikang E. Prass C.E. Quintana L. Starnes S.M. Schatzman R.C. Brunke K.J. Drayna D.T. Risch N.J. Bacon B.R. Wolff R.K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar) identified HFE as a candidate gene for HH, and two HFE mutations account for about 80–85% of all HH. The normal HFE gene product, by binding to the transferrin receptor and lowering its affinity for transferrin, down-regulates intestinal iron absorption (8Feder J.N. Penny D.M. Irrinki A. Lee V.K. Lebrón J.A. Watson N. Tsuchihashi Z. Sigal E. Bjorkman P.J. Schatzman R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Mutant HFE does not bind the transferrin receptor and lacks this suppressor activity. Transferrin-independent cellular iron uptake has been described in many cultured cells including HepG2 (9Randell E.W. Parkes J.G. Olivieri N.F. Templeton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16046-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and K562 (10Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells. The function of the transferrin-independent system is unknown, but Kaplan et al. (11Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that it clears potentially toxic, low molecular weight iron chelates (e.g. non-transferrin bound iron). Such chelates accumulate to a very large extent in HH patient plasma (12Grootveld M. Bell J.D. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. Bomford A. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4417-4422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transferrin-independent uptake mechanisms are not well understood; however, two putative transporters, DCT1 and SFT, have been recently identified in mammalian cells (13Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). A cell surface ferrireductase is also active and may be required for transferrin-independent iron uptake (15Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Jordan I. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Important insights into eukaryotic non-transferrin iron metabolism have come from recent yeast genetic studies. Two iron transporters (or “permeases”), Ftr1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and the homologous Fip1p from Schizosaccharomyces pombe(18Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), facilitate high affinity iron uptake by iron-deficient yeast. A surface ferrireductase, Fre1p (or its homologue Fre2p), is also necessary for yeast iron uptake (19Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A requirement for copper in iron uptake has led to the cloning of genes encoding copper-containing proteins, Fet3p in S. cerevisiae (20Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 21De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and its homologue Fio1p in S. pombe (18Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), that are required for iron uptake. These proteins are membrane-spanning, multicopper oxidases which interact at the cell membrane with the transporters (17Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Fet3p (and Fio1p) has limited sequence homology to human ceruloplasmin (Cp), and like Cp is a copper protein with a ferroxidase activity that catalyzes conversion of ferrous to ferric ion. The similarities between Fet3p and Cp suggest a possible role for the latter in vertebrate cell iron uptake. We have shown recently that Cp increases 55Fe uptake by iron-deficient HepG2 cells by a transferrin receptor-independent pathway (23Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, iron deprivation transcriptionally induces Cp synthesis by HepG2 cells (23Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and Fet3p synthesis in yeast (20Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 21De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus maintenance of iron homeostasis in liver (and possibly other tissues) during periods of iron deficiency may be an important physiological function of Cp. The recent observation that “aceruloplasminemia” patients with Cp gene defects have massive iron deposits in liver, pancreas, brain, retina, and other tissues indicates an important role for Cp in iron homeostasis in vivo (22Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 24Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V.

In this report we investigate the molecular mechanism by which Cp increases iron uptake by erythroleukemic K562 cells. Our results show that Cp-stimulated iron uptake requires Cp ferroxidase activity and utilizes a novel, trivalent cation-specific transport pathway. Purified human Cp was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cp homogeneity was verified by an absorbance ratio (610 nm/280 nm) higher than 0.045, and by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Densitometric analysis showed that about 80–85% was present as the intact, 132-kDa form of Cp. 55FeCl3 (20 mCi/mg), 59FeCl3 (19.22 mCi/mg), and51CrCl3 (789 mCi/mg) were from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Rabbit anti-human apotransferrin antibody was from Accurate (Westbury, NY), anti-human transferrin receptor mouse monoclonal antibody (H68.4) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and rabbit anti-human ferritin IgG was from Boehringer-Mannheim. Nitrocellulose filters were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate was from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI), and human apotransferrin, horse spleen apoferritin, reduced glutathione (GSH), cycloheximide, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid, and other assay reagents were from Sigma. Human erythroleukemic K562 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MA) were grown in iron-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were made iron-deficient by resuspension in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing bathophenanthroline disulfonate (100 μm) for 4–8 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with RPMI 1640 medium, and then resuspended in the same medium. A solution of 55Fe-NTA was prepared by mixing 55FeCl3 (15–20 μm) with a 4-fold molar excess of NTA in colorless RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mm ascorbate (26Teichmann R. Stremmel W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 2145-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To measure iron uptake, 5 × 106 K562 cells were incubated with55Fe-NTA (1.4 μm) in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium for 20–30 min at 25 °C. An aliquot (0.1 ml) was removed and applied to a nitrocellulose filter subjected to vacuum. The filter was washed twice with 3 ml of 150 mm NaCl containing 10 μm EDTA (to remove surface-bound iron) and cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of 55Fe bound after a “zero time” incubation (less than 15 s) was subtracted from experimental measurements to correct for nonspecific binding. K562 cells, made iron-sufficient and iron-deficient as above, were incubated with 59Fe-NTA (1.4 μm) in the presence or absence of Cp (30 μg/ml) for 20 min at 25 °C. The cells were washed two times by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, and then lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% aprotinin, and 200 μg/ml leupeptin by repeated passage through a 27-gauge needle at 0 °C. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. Membrane fragments were separated from the cytosol-containing fraction by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity in the intact cells, and membrane and cytosol fractions was measured by γ-counting. To determine incorporation of59Fe into individual proteins, aliquots (20 μg of protein) of membrane and cytosolic fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6.5%) under nonreducing conditions and autoradiography (Hyperfilm, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). To evaluate total protein in these fractions, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. In a control experiment, ferritin in the cytosolic fraction was immunodepleted by incubation for 18 h with rabbit anti-human ferritin IgG (1:1000) or with a nonspecific antibody (rabbit anti-human Gqα IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), then with protein A-Sepharose, and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g. Apoceruloplasmin (apoCp) was prepared by removal of Cp copper by complexing with cyanide under reducing conditions as described by Musci et al. (27Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cp was dialyzed at 4 °C against 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.9) containing 10 mm ascorbate under anaerobic conditions achieved by continuous bubbling with N2 gas. Dialysis was continued until the “blue” coppers were reduced as shown by complete decolorization of the sample. Potassium cyanide (50 mm) was added and the dialysis continued for 5 h. The copper-cyanide complex and excess cyanide were removed by dialysis against 100 mm sodium acetate containing 1 mmcysteine, and then by an overnight dialysis against buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, 150 mm potassium chloride (pH 7.0). Inactivation was verified by an “in-gel” ferroxidase assay (see below). Holoceruloplasmin was reconstituted from apoCp as described by Musciet al. (27Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A Cu1+-glutathione complex was prepared immediately before use (28Ciriolo M.R. Desideri A. Paci M. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11030-11034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by addition of copper sulfate (0.1 mm) to GSH (0.3 mm) in 0.1 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.0). A 7-fold molar excess of the Cu1+-GSH complex was added to apoCp in 50 mmMOPS, 150 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride (pH 7.0) for 4 h. Unbound copper was removed by overnight dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Cp (7.61 μm) was incubated for 20 min with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1.52 mm) in acetate buffer (320 mm, pH 6.0) as described by Chidambaram et al.(29Chidambaram M.V. Barnes G. Frieden E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 22: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Excess thiomolybdate was removed by dialysis overnight against the same buffer, then against phosphate-buffered saline. Removal of unreacted thiomolybdate was monitored by monitoring optical density at 470 nm. Cp ferroxidase activity was measured by a modification of the method of Schen and Rabinovitz (30Schen R.J. Rabinovitz M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1966; 13: 537-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, Cp or modified Cp was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (Seakem Gold, FMC, Rockland, ME) under nondenaturing conditions. After transfer to an Immobilon-P membrane, the blot was incubated with 0.08% ferrous sulfate in acetate buffer (pH 5.7), for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 1% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 n HCl. Ferric ion (formed by Cp-catalyzed oxidation of ferrous ion) was detected by the rapid formation of a “Prussian blue” band which was stable for at least 24 h. We have previously shown that Cp stimulates high affinity iron uptake by iron-deficient HepG2 cells (23Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For a more detailed analysis of the mechanism of Cp-stimulated iron uptake, we used human erythroleukemic K562 cells since the transferrin-dependent and -independent uptake pathways are well characterized (10Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike HepG2 cells which secrete Cp in an amount sufficient to promote iron uptake (23Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), K562 cells do not secrete Cp (or transferrin, Ref. 31Stein B.S. Sussman H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10319-10331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) thereby permitting more precise control of conditions. Cp stimulated55Fe-NTA uptake by iron-deficient K562 cells by about 2–3-fold (Fig. 1 A). Half-maximal stimulation was at about 10 μg/ml Cp and maximal uptake was at about 30 μg/ml, a level much lower than the unevoked human plasma concentration of 300 μg/ml. The stimulation of iron uptake by Cp was observed in iron-deficient cells but not in iron-sufficient cells (Fig. 1 B), a finding consistent with studies of HepG2 cells (23Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cp stimulated iron uptake by decreasing the apparentK m of 55Fe-NTA uptake from about 2 μm to about 0.5 μm iron, without changing the maximum uptake rate (Fig. 1 B). This result indicated that the number of active transporters was not altered by Cp, but rather that the affinity of the transporter for iron was increased or that the amount of substrate was increased by Cp. Several control experiments were done to show that Cp stimulated iron entry into the cell, and thus exclude the possibility that Cp increased extracellular binding of iron to the cell surface (e.g. by ferroxidase-dependent conversion of soluble Fe2+ to insoluble Fe3+). First, we measured iron uptake using a procedure specifically designed to remove complexes of surface-bound iron (32Glahn R.P. Gangloff M.B. Van Campen D.R. Miller D.D. Wien E.M. Norvell W.A. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). According to this method, cells are rinsed with a solution containing 5 μm sodium dithionite to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and with 5 μmbathophenanthroline disulfonate to specifically chelate Fe2+. This procedure gave results essentially identical to those obtained with the normal rinse solution containing 10 μm EDTA; Cp increased iron uptake by 2–3-fold in iron-deficient K562 cells when measured using either the “reducing” wash or the normal wash (data not shown). To verify iron internalization, intracellular and membrane-bound iron was measured. K562 cells were incubated with 59Fe-NTA, the cells were lysed, and membrane and cytosol fractions isolated by centrifugation. In this experiment Cp stimulated about a 2-fold increase in radioactivity measured in intact (and iron-deficient) cells, and nearly all of this increase was accounted for by 59Fe in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1 C); 10% or less of the total cell radioactivity was bound to membranes under any condition. To verify the intracellular localization of 59Fe, incorporation into protein was determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Radiolabeled protein was not detected in the membrane fraction of any samples (Fig.1, D and E). However, the cytosolic fraction exhibited a single major 59Fe-labeled band that co-migrated with ferritin (Fig. 1 F). Identification of the59Fe-labeled band as ferritin was confirmed by immunodepletion with anti-ferritin IgG, but not by a nonspecific antibody (Fig. 1 F). Cp increased incorporation of59Fe into ferritin in lysates made from iron-deficient cells by about 90%; equal protein loading of the gel lanes was shown by Coomassie Blue stain (Fig. 1 G). These results demonstrate that the increase in iron associated with cells in the presence of Cp is due to cellular uptake and entry into a metabolically active intracellular iron pool. The finding that Cp did not stimulate iron uptake by iron-sufficient cells (Fig. 1 B) suggested that a factor required for uptake,e.g. the transporter itself, was induced or activated by iron deficiency. To test whether this factor must be synthesizedde novo, K562 cells were treated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide prior to iron depletion. Cp-stimulated iron uptake was completely blocked by both inhibitors suggesting transcriptional up-regulation of an iron transporter (or a regulatory protein) by iron deficiency (Fig. 1 H). To determine whether Cp stimulates iron efflux as well as influx, K562 cells were preloaded with55Fe-NTA, and Cp-stimulated iron release was measured. Under these conditions, Cp did not enhance iron release (Fig.1 I). The addition of apo-transferrin or NTA to the medium as Fe3+ acceptors did not alter this result. This result was consistent with our previous findings in HepG2 cells (23Mukhopadhyay C.K. Attieh Z.K. Fox P.L. Science. 1998; 279: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), but not with results of Young et al. (33Young S.P. Fahmy M. Golding S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) who reported a small Cp-stimulated increase in iron efflux from HepG2 cells. The difference may be due to experimental conditions, e.g. our methods measure the effects of Cp on initial rates whereas the 18-h efflux intervals of Young et al. (33Young S.P. Fahmy M. Golding S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) may reflect equilibrium processes shifted by Cp. The conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by Cp ferroxidase activity is thought to facilitate the binding of iron to apotransferrin (34Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus possible that Cp stimulates cellular iron uptake by stimulating the formation of Fe2-transferrin which delivers Fe3+ by transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis. Although K562 cells are not known to secrete transferrin (31Stein B.S. Sussman H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10319-10331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this pathway was tested by addition of a rabbit polyclonal anti-human transferrin antibody to the incubation medium. The antibody only slightly inhibited Cp-stimulated iron uptake but completely blocked 55Fe uptake mediated by transferrin (Fig.2 A). Essentially identical results were obtained using a monoclonal anti-human transferrin receptor antibody (not shown). These results show that Cp-stimulated iron uptake was transferrin receptor-independent, but did not exclude the possibility that other receptor-mediated endocytic processes were involved, e.g. endocytosis of the putative Cp receptors (35Percival S.S. Harris E.D. J. Trace Elem. Exp. Med. 1988; 1: 63-70Google Scholar,36Kataoka M. Tavassoli M. Exp. Hematol. 1985; 13: 806-810PubMed Google Scholar) or other iron-protein receptors. The lysosomatropic inhibitor, amantadine, was used to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis (37Schlegel R. Dickson R.B. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2291-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Amantadine had essentially no effect on Cp-stimulated55Fe-NTA uptake, but was a very effective inhibitor of transferrin-mediated iron uptake (Fig. 2 B). Comparable results were obtained using ammonium chloride (38Klausner R.D. Van Renswoude J. Ashwell G. Kempf C. Schechter A.N. Dean A. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4715-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis (data not shown). The cation specificity of Cp-stimulated cell transport was investigated. Multiple divalent cations, including Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+ (and Mn2+ and Co2+, not shown), added at a 70-fold molar excess did not substantially compete for Cp-stimulated 55Fe uptake (Fig.3). In the same experiment Fe2+ (FeCl3 plus ascorbic acid) in the presence of Cp completely suppressed uptake. This result suggests that Cp stimulates a transporter with absolute specificity for Fe2+or a trivalent cation transporter; the latter is consistent with a requirement for ferroxidase activity of Cp. The role of Cp ferroxidase activity was examined using ferroxidase-defective Cp. We took advantage of the ability of thiomolybdate to bind copper and irreversibly inhibit Cp ferroxidase activity (29Chidambaram M.V. Barnes G. Frieden E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 22: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cp with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate completely blocked its iron uptake activity (Fig.4 A). Thiomolybdate did not inhibit iron uptake by inactivation of the cellular transport pathway since the addition of untreated Cp to cells incubated with thiomolybdate-treated Cp fully restored iron uptake. The inactivation by thiomolybdate treatment was confirmed by an in-gel assay for ferroxidase activity (Fig. 4 B). The integrity of apoCp was tested by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Blue staining which revealed a 132-kDa undegraded protein (Fig. 4 C). To verify the role of Cp ferroxidase activity in iron transport, ferroxidase-defective apoCp was prepared by removal of copper by complexing with cyanide under reducing conditions (27Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ApoCp did not stimulate55Fe influx into iron-deficient K562 cells (Fig.4 D). The absence of apoCp ferroxidase activity was confirmed by an in-gel assay (Fig. 4 E), and the structural integrity of the protein was shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.4 F). To further demonstrate the integrity of apoCp, it was reconstituted to holoCp by incubation with copper in the presence of GSH as a reducing agent. The reconstituted Cp regained about 80% of its ferroxidase activity and about 70% of its iron uptake enhancing activity (Fig. 4, D and E). The complete inactivity of two ferroxidase-defective forms of Cp is persuasive evidence that ferroxidase activity is necessary for Cp-stimulated iron uptake, and suggests that the Fe3+ product is transported into the cell by a trivalent cation transporter. The results also suggest that Cp increases iron uptake by increasing available substrate (by formation of Fe3+), not by activation of the transporter itself. To test whether the transporter is Fe3+-specific or if it transports multiple trivalent cations, we examined the ability of Al3+, Cr3+, and Ga3+ to compete for iron uptake. All three trivalent cations inhibited Cp-stimul"
https://openalex.org/W1966044040,"A calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion (CAI) from the Allende meteorite was analyzed and found to contain melilite crystals with extreme oxygen-isotope compositions ( approximately 5 percent oxygen-16 enrichment relative to terrestrial oxygen-16). Some of the melilite is also anomalously enriched in oxygen-16 compared with oxygen isotopes measured in other CAIs. The oxygen isotopic variation measured among the minerals (melilite, spinel, and fassaite) indicates that crystallization of the CAI started from oxygen-16-rich materials that were probably liquid droplets in the solar nebula, and oxygen isotope exchange with the surrounding oxygen-16-poor nebular gas progressed through the crystallization of the CAI. Additional oxygen isotope exchange also occurred during subsequent reheating events in the solar nebula."

However, excess NO produced from neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) or inducible NOS (iNOS) during inflammation of the central nervous system can be neurotoxic, disrupting neurotransmitter and hormone production and killing neurons. A screen of a hippocampal cDNA library showed that a unique region of the iNOS protein interacts with Kalirin, previously identified as an interactor with a secretory granule peptide biosynthetic enzyme. Kalirin associates with iNOS in vitroand in vivo and inhibits iNOS activity by preventing the formation of iNOS homodimers. Expression of exogenous Kalirin in pituitary cells dramatically reduces iNOS inhibition of ACTH secretion.

In neurons that express nNOS, excitatory amino acids can activate NMDA-type glutamate receptors, temporarily elevating intracellular calcium concentrations, resulting in transient synthesis of NO by nNOS. NO then acts as a neurotransmitter, diffusing into adjacent neurons. However, excessive NO production is neurotoxic and may be involved in diseases of the central nervous system. Various experimental systems demonstrate the neurotoxicity of NO. For example, NO derived from nNOS or NO donors can kill neurons in vitro(6Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.B. Snyder S.H.

Large amounts of excitatory amino acids generated during strokes can trigger neurons that contain nNOS to produce high concentrations of NO (8Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Snyder S.H. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Conversely, studies with nNOS null mice show that NMDA excitotoxicity is reduced, and cerebral infarct size is smaller in the absence of NO generated from NOS (9Ayata C. Ayata G. Hara H.

In humans, NO derived from nNOS may play a neurotoxic role in strokes and in diverse neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuronal NOS is also found in a significant fraction of peripheral neurons, where it is thought to function as a neurotransmitter (12Zhou Y. Ling E.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 394: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another source of high concentrations of NO in the central nervous system is the iNOS isoform, which can be induced in neurons or microglia during inflammation (13Wong M.L. Rettori V. al-Shekhlee A.

In contrast to nNOS, iNOS synthesizes large amounts of NO continuously, which can also be neurotoxic to neurons in vitro (17Mitrovic B. Ignarro L.J. Vinters H.V. Akers M.A. Schmid I. Uittenbogaart C. Merrill J.E. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cerebral infarct size is also reduced in iNOS null mice (18Iadecola C. Zhang F. Casey R. Nagayama M. Ross M.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9157-9164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The iNOS isoform is also expressed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and NOS inhibition reduces the severity of the disease (19Brenner T. Brocke S. Szafer F. Sobel R.A. Parkinson J.F.

NO may also play a more subtle role during brain inflammation, interfering with physiological functions such as hormone secretion. Experimental evidence from neuronal cultures and animal models shows that NO can also inhibit specific secretory responses of neurons. For example, some but not all modes of stimulating hormone secretion from the pituitary are enhanced in the presence of NOS inhibitors (27Rivier C.

Because iNOS expression may lead to neurotoxicity in the brain, disrupting hormone secretion or killing neurons, we tested the hypothesis that proteins are expressed in the central nervous system which regulate iNOS activity, minimizing its neurotoxic effects. A yeast two-hybrid screen for hippocampal proteins that may bind to iNOS revealed that Kalirin interacts with iNOS. Kalirin is a cytosolic protein with nine spectrin-like repeats, a Dbl-homology domain that acts as a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Rac1, and pleckstrin homology and SH3 domains (see Fig. 1) (37Alam M.R.

Kalirin is closely related to two other proteins, Trio and UNC-73, which also possess spectrin-like motifs, Dbl homology domains, and pleckstrin homology domains (39Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K.

Hogue C.W.V. Pawson T. Culotti J. Cell. 1998; 92: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Kalirin was initially identified by its ability to interact with the cytosolic domain of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme located in thetrans-Golgi network and large dense core vesicles. PAM is a bifunctional type I integral membrane protein with both functional domains in the lumen of the secretory pathway; PAM is responsible for the α-amidation of neuropeptides and hormones, a modification essential for the biological potency of more than half of all the known bioactive peptides (41Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Kalirin is expressed with PAM at high levels in cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Although the precise role of Kalirin is unknown, it may serve to transduce signals between large dense-core vesicles and the actin cytoskeleton. Our data suggest a novel role for Kalirin in the regulation of hormone secretion by its effects upon iNOS. For immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, the following antibodies were used: a monoclonal antibody raised against c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or prepared from hybridoma 9E10 cells (42Evan G. Lewis G. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar); a polyclonal antibody raised against a murine iNOS peptide generated by us (43Lowenstein C.J. Hill S.L. Lafond-Walker A. Wu J.

Standard cloning methods were used to join the Kalirin cDNA fragment identified using the yeast two-hybrid screen (encoding Kalirin amino acids 447–1124) in reading frame 3′ to the sequence of the c-Myc epitope and a Gly5 linker (MEQKLISEEDLNGGGGG-Kalirin-(447–1124)). This cDNA was cloned 3′ to the CMV promoter in the mammalian expression vector pSCEP to create pSCEP.myc.Kalirin-(447–1124) (37Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 176: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and expressed in bacteria and then purified over a nickel resin (according to manufacturer instructions). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was obtained from Sigma. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was a generous gift from the American Cancer Society. The interaction of Kalirin and iNOS was examined in non-transfected AtT-20/d-16v cells, and in AtT-20 cells stably expressing Kalirin-(447–1124). The vector pSCEP.myc.Kalirin-(447–1124) was transfected into AtT-20 cells by lipofection. AtT-20 cells stably expressing myc-Kalirin-(447–1124) were first selected for hygromycin resistance (200 units/ml) and were then screened for expression of the Kalirin transcript by Northern blot analysis. Cells were maintained as described (37Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% of Triton X-100, 0.5% Brij-50, 1 mm PMSF, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF). Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000–1:5000 in blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and after washing were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000–1:10,000. Labeled bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For determination of iNOS apparent molecular mass, cell lysates were loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (0.75 cm, inner diameter × 50 cm, length) in lysis buffer without detergents, and fractions were collected, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as above. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and 500 μl of supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of normal rabbit serum for 30 min and then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B for 30 min. Following centrifugation, 500 μl of supernatant was incubated for 3 h with primary antibodies and then with 40 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B (or goat anti-mouse agarose) for 4 h at 4 °C and then was washed three times with 1 ml of cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF. Samples were boiled with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with antibodies to c-Myc, or iNOS (1:5,000), washed, incubated for 1–2 h with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and visualized with an ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the detection of iNOS and Kalirin complexesin vivo, (C57Bl6, 129)F2 wild-type and iNOS null mice from Jackson Laboratories were injected intraperitoneally with 500 μg of LPS, and after 24 h, their brains were homogenized and analyzed by immunoprecipitation as above. The NOS assay was performed as described previously (48Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm tetrahydrobiopterin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, aprotinin (25 μg/ml), leupeptin (25 μg/ml), 100 μm PMSF, 10 μm FMN, and 10 μm FAD. A reaction mix was made of cell lysate containing 50 μg of protein, 50 μl of [U-14C]arginine (50,000 cpm), 5 μl of 5 mmFAD, 5 μl of 100 μm H4B, 1 μl of 30 μm calmodulin, and the volume was brought up to 250 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μl of 10 mm NADPH, and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, applied to a Dowex 50-W resin (H+ form) column, and the flow-through was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. We employed a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for potential binding partners of iNOS (49Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). The pPC86 library contained cDNA prepared from rat hippocampus (generous gift of Dr. A. Lanahan) (50Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). To prepare bait plasmids, murine iNOS cDNA sequences 1–546 base pairs or 1–210 base pairs) were prepared by the polymerase chain reaction and inserted 3′ to the cDNA for the Gal4 binding domain of plasmid pPC97. The resultant pPC97-iNOS bait plasmids encoded a fusion protein comprised of the Gal4 binding domain and an amino-terminal fragment of iNOS (amino acid residues 1–182 or 1–70). YRG-2 yeast cells were co-transformed with pPC97-iNOS and the pPC86-based library and grown on a selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, or combinations thereof. Colonies that contain cDNA encoding target library proteins interacting with the bait fusion protein were identified by transcription of the HIS3- and lacZ-genes. A total of 2.6 × 106 yeast transformants were placed under selection. Plasmid preparations from β-galactosidase positive yeast colonies were isolated and retransformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells. For quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assay, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain SFY526) were co-transformed by the lithium acetate method with various combinations of bait plasmid (pPC97 expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4-BD (binding domain) and portions of iNOS) and target plasmids (pPC86 expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4-AD (activation domain) and portions of Kalirin). Transformants were plated for 3 days at 30 °C on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. After 3 days, cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using ONPG as a substrate (nmol ONPG cleaved/min/mg protein measured atA 420). Lysates of cells were loaded onto a Superdex 200 chromatography column, equilibrated, and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF buffer, and 1 ml fractions were collected. Molecular weight markers were analyzed separately to determine approximate molecular weights of substances in the eluted fractions. For secretion experiments using LPS and IFN-γ, identical wells of cells were treated for 12 h with control medium or medium containing 50 ng/ml LPS and 10 units/ml IFN-γ; for treated cultures, LPS and IFN-γ were added fresh throughout the secretion experiment. Cells were transferred to basal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-air with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 μg/ml transferrin) for the secretion experiments and equilibrated in release medium for sequential 30-min periods. Supernatants were harvested from cells exposed to basal media, 100 nm corticotrophin releasing hormone (Sigma), or to 1 mm BaCl2 (51Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

The amino-terminal region of iNOS was selected as a potential target of interacting proteins because it is not homologous to the other NOS isoforms. Screening of 2.6 × 106 yeast transformants isolated a cDNA encoding the protein Kalirin (Table I). Our yeast two-hybrid screen also showed that K i nuclear autoantigen, nel-related protein, and homologues to a serine/threonine kinase, and bicaudal D may also interact with the amino terminus of iNOS. These interactions have not been confirmed by in vivo testing, yet.Table ISpecific interaction between iNOS and Kalirin in the yeast two-hybrid assayBaitTargetHis+β-galactosidaseiNOS-(1–182)Kalirin (570–753)+35 ± 4.3iNOS-(1–70)Kalirin (570–753)+32 ± 3.9iNOS-(70–220)Kalirin (570–753)−6.7 ± 1.2iNOS-(1–182)−4.3 ± 0.8iNOS-(1–70)−5.4 ± 1.5Kalirin (570–753)−3.6 ± 0.7FosJun+85 ± 6.8iNOS-(1–182)Jun−6.2 ± 1.6FosKalirin (570–753)−4.8 ± 1.1iNOS-(1–70)Jun−3.9 ± 0.9S. cerevisiae (strain SFY526) were co-transformed by the lithium acetate method with various combinations of bait plasmid (pPC97 expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4 binding domain and portions of iNOS) and target plasmids (pPC86 expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4 activation domain and portions of Kalirin). Transformants were plated for 3 days at 30 °C on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. After 3 days, cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by liquid culture assay method using ONPG as a substrate (nmol ONPG cleaved/min/mg of protein measured atA 420) (5Bredt D.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 41-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate. Open table in a new tab S. cerevisiae (strain SFY526) were co-transformed by the lithium acetate method with various combinations of bait plasmid (pPC97 expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4 binding domain and portions of iNOS) and target plasmids (pPC86 expressing a fusion protein of the Gal4 activation domain and portions of Kalirin).

To define more precisely the regions of iNOS and Kalirin that interact, yeast expressing a Kalirin fusion protein (consisting of amino acid residues 570–753 of Kalirin fused to the Gal4-AD) were transformed with various plasmids representing different domains of iNOS. Analysis of transfected yeast revealed that the first 70 amino acid residues of iNOS are capable of interacting with Kalirin in yeast (Table I, Fig.1). The region of iNOS between 70–220 amino acids does not interact with Kalirin in yeast. We next examined the ability of iNOS and Kalirin to interact in vitro. Bacterial expression vectors were constructed which express a (His)6-iNOS fusion protein (45Ghosh S. Lowenstein J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 176: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or a glutathioneS-transferase-Kalirin-(amino acid residues 447–1124) fusion protein. Purified (His)6-iNOS fusion protein interacts with purified glutathione S-transferase-Kalirin-(447–1124) fusion protein in vitro (Fig.2). This interaction was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of GST-Kalirin with an iNOS antibody and by the binding of iNOS to GST-Kalirin immobilized on glutathione-agarose resin. We next examined the ability of iNOS and Kalirin to interact in mammalian cells. The mouse pituitary tumor cell line AtT-20 (in which Kalirin is not normally expressed) was stably transfected with a plasmid expressing a fragment of Kalirin (amino acids 447–1124); this fragment of Kalirin contains spectrin motif repeat domains, the region of Kalirin interacting with iNOS. Cells were then treated with LPS and IFN-γ to induce expression of iNOS. Kalirin is expressed only in AtT-20 cells that are transfected, and iNOS is expressed only in cells that are treated with LPS and IFN-γ, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). Kalirin and iNOS also associate in these cells, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.3 B). Most of the Kalirin-(447–1124) and most of the iNOS appear to be associated with each other. We then examined the interaction of iNOS and Kalirin in mice. The availability of mice lacking iNOS provides a control for the specificity of this interaction. Kalirin is expressed in the brains of wild-type mice and iNOS null mice (Fig.4 A). (Native Kalirin-(1–1899) has a molecular mass of approximately 210 kDa when expressed in mouse brains or in AtT-20 cells. The recombinant Kalirin-(447–1124) fragment expressed in AtT-20 cells and used in the other figures has a molecular mass of approximately 73 kDa.) As expected, LPS injected intraperitoneally into wild-type and iNOS null mice induces iNOS expression only in wild-type mice (Fig. 4 A). Complexes of endogenous Kalirin and endogenous iNOS are detected by immunoprecipitation in brain extracts of LPS-treated wild-type mice, but not in brain extracts of LPS-treated mice lacking iNOS (Fig.4 B) (55MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Traumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Thus iNOS and Kalirin interact in a variety of experimental systems. To test the specificity of the Kalirin interaction with NOS isoforms, we analyzed mouse brain extracts for the interaction of Kalirin and nNOS or eNOS. Lysates from brains of wild-type and iNOS null mice treated with LPS as above were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody to nNOS, showing that nNOS is expressed in mouse brain (Fig.4 C). Lysates from these brains were then immunoprecipitated with antibody to Kalirin, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and probed with antibody to nNOS. No nNOS was co-immunoprecipitated with Kalirin (Fig.4 C). We then repeated this experiment with antibody to eNOS. No eNOS was co-immunoprecipitated with Kalirin (Fig. 4 D). Thus, Kalirin interacts only with iNOS and not with the other NOS isoforms. We then measured the effect of Kalirin on iNOS enzymatic activity. NOS activity was measured in AtT-20 cells and in AtT-20 cells expressing Kalirin-(447–1124); cells were either resting or treated with IFN-γ and LPS. As expected, treatment of AtT-20 cells with LPS and IFN-γ induces iNOS activity (Fig.5 A). Expression of Kalirin-(447–1124) reduces iNOS activity by more than 90% (Fig.5 A). Because expression of Kalirin-(447–1124) does not reduce the amount of iNOS protein expressed in response to IFN-γ/LPS tr"

This element has been shown to mediate repression of neuronal gene transcription in nonneuronal cells. A palindromic NRSE (NRSEBDNF) is present in the proximal region of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoter II.

To delineate the in vivorole of NRSE in the regulation of rat BDNF gene, promoter constructs with intact and mutated NRSEBDNF were introduced into transgenic mice. Our data show that NRSEBDNF is controlling the activity of BDNF promoters I and II in the brain, thymus, and lung,i.e. in the tissues in which the intact reporter gene and endogenous BDNF mRNAs are expressed. Mutation of NRSEBDNF did not lead to the ectopic activation of the reporter gene in any other nonneural tissues. In the brain, NRSEBDNF is involved in the repression of basal and kainic acid-induced expression from BDNF promoters I and II in neurons.

We have previously shown that four promoters direct tissue-specific expression of the rat BDNF gene (8Timmusk T. Palm K. Metsis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Promoter IV is active in nonneural tissues (lung, heart, and muscle), whereas promoters I, II, and III are predominantly used in the brain and regulated by glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems (8Timmusk T.

An inverted repeat within the first intron of rat BDNF gene shows substantial similarity to the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE). NRSE, also known as repressor element-1 (RE1), has been defined as a negative-acting DNA regulatory element to prevent the expression of neuronal genes in nonneuronal cell types or in inappropriate neuronal subtypes (20Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsai H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J.

The first evidence that NRSE is able to mediate repression of transcription came from the analysis of the promoters of rat SCG10 (21Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and rat type II sodium channel (NaChII) (20Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsai H.J. Mandel G.

To date, several studies have proposed that NRSE-like sequences, present in the regulatory regions of multiple neuronal genes, are important for their neuron-specific expression (23Bai G. Norton D.D.

Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), also known as RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) (30Chong J.A. Tapia R.J. Kim S. Toledo A.J. Zheng Y.

Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), is a novel member of the Krüppel family of zinc-finger transcription factors. The same factor, called as X2-box repressor, was identified to bind to the X2-box of the immune system-specific major histocompatibility complex class II gene, DPA, and repress its activity in the terminally differentiated B-cell lineage (31Scholl T. Stevens M.B. Mahanta S. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1448-1457PubMed Google Scholar). REST/NRSF/XBR mRNA is expressed at high levels in most nonneural tissues throughout development (22Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar,30Chong J.A. Tapia R.J. Kim S. Toledo A.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

In the nervous system, REST/NRSF/XBR mRNA levels are high in the undifferentiated neuronal progenitors (22Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J.

Our previous data revealed that REST/NSRF/XBR mRNA expression proceeds at varying levels also in the neurons of adult brain (32Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 15: 1280-1296Crossref Google Scholar). The present study explores molecular mechanisms underlying BDNF gene expression, focusing on the function of the palindromic NRSE (NRSEBDNF) in the proximal region of promoter II. We have previously shown that BDNF promoter-reporter gene construct, covering promoter I, promoter II, and flanking regions, recapitulates endogenous BDNF expression in transgenic mice (33Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Currently, we have generated transgenic mice carrying the BDNF promoter construct with mutations in the NRSEBDNF sequence, and our results strongly suggest that the transcriptional regulation of BDNF gene in vivo is under the control of NRSEBDNF. RNA isolation, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay, RNase protection assay (RPA), andin situ hybridization were performed as described (8Timmusk T. Palm K. Metsis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 33Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J.

A 0.3-kb XbaI/HindIII fragment encompassing BDNF exon II and its flanking regions was cloned into pBSSK vector (Stratagene), and a single-stranded uracil-rich template was prepared using Escherichia coli strain CJ 236. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Kunkel method (35Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Mutation of NRSE in the 0.3-kb XbaI/HindIII fragment was carried out in three steps using the following synthetic oligonucleotides. Mutated nucleotides are shown in lowercase letters.

Finally, the 0.3-kb XbaI/HindIII fragment carrying the mutated NRSE (NRSEmut) sequence was used to generate BDNFI+IImutCAT construct applying the same cloning strategy as earlier for constructing BDNFI+IICAT (33Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated and analyzed for transgene integration as described previously (33Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transgenic founders were analyzed using dot blot analysis with a CAT-specific probe (33Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Transgene copy number was estimated using BDNF exon I-specific probe (8Timmusk T. Palm K.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) by comparing the intensity of BDNF exon I-specific signal in the wild-type animals to that in the transgenic animals. Quantification was performed with PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Adult male and female transgenic animals (body weight, 20–30 g) were used in all experiments. KA (20 mg/kg in saline buffer) was injected intraperitoneally, and the animals were sacrificed at 3, 6, or 24 h after the injections. All animal experiments were approved by the local ethical committee. Cellular extracts of thymus and hippocampus were prepared as described (36Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Mobility shift assays were performed as described (37Chiaramello A. Neuman K. Palm K. Metsis M. Neuman T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6036-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP1 (Promega, Madison, WI) and cAMP response element (Promega) sequences, and to the NRSE derived of rat type II sodium channel gene (20Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsai H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and rat SCG10 gene (21Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) were used as positive controls. In competition studies, the amount of added unlabeled oligo-competitor is presented as molar excess. In the supershift assay, c-Fos supershifting antibody was used (sc-447; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The inverted repeat (NRSEBDNF) in the proximal region of BDNF promoter II is composed of two NRSEs. The 5′ element has 89% identity with the NRSE consensus sequence (29Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), whereas the 3′ element shows only 57% identity, suggesting it to be an atypical NRSE. The results of previous deletion and mutation analyses have established that not all 21 residues of the NRSE consensus are critical for NRSE-mediated negative regulatory effects on transcription (29Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Mutations introduced to certain positions of the consensus sequence have been suggested to be important for the silencing activity of NRSE (20Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsai H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In the upper element of NRSEBDNF, the nucleotides in the critical positions are identical with the consensus sequence, and in the lower element, they show 80% identity, suggesting that both elements in NRSEBDNF have the potential to mediate repression. To determine whether this inverted repeat-like element participates in the regulation of BDNF gene, mutations at potentially relevant residues were made (mut-NRSEBDNF) (Fig.1) and analyzed in transgenic mice. Our previous studies established that a 9.5-kb genomic fragment including BDNF promoters I and II (BDNFI+IICAT) confers the appropriate tissue-specific pattern of the reporter gene expression (33Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study, we replaced the intact NRSEBDNF in the BDNFI+IICAT construct with the mut-NRSEBDNF and introduced the mutant construct (BDNF I+IImutCAT) (Fig. 1) into mice. Altogether, nine founders were obtained, and six of them were bred to obtain F1 transgenic lines for further analyses. In all six lines, transgene activity was the highest in the brain, whereas outside the central nervous system, high levels of CAT activity were observed in thymus and lung (Fig. 2). Analysis of CAT activity in different brain regions revealed slight variations in the pattern of expression from one founder line to another; however, the highest levels of CAT activity were always detected in the hippocampus, midbrain, and thalamus. As the spatial expression pattern of the reporter gene in BDNFI+IImutCAT mice was indistinguishable from the transgene expression pattern in BDNFI+IICAT animals, we concluded that mutation of NRSEBDNF is not sufficient to allow ectopic expression from BDNF promoters I and II in tissues that do not express the intact promoter construct and also endogenous BDNF mRNA. However, quantitative differences in the levels of reporter gene expression were seen in transgenic mice with the mutated promoter construct as compared with the animals carrying the intact promoter construct. In the brain, thymus, and lung, total CAT activity and relative CAT activity per transgene copy number was significantly higher in all six transgenic lines carrying mutated transgene as compared with CAT levels in any of the nine founder lines possessing intact reporter construct (Fig. 2). The levels of CAT activity in the thymus and lung of individual BDNFI+IImutCAT lines were on average about 50-fold higher as compared with the levels of CAT activity in thymus and lung of mice carrying BDNFI+IICAT transgene (Fig. 2). In the brain, all the brain regions showed elevated levels of CAT activity in transgenic animals with BDNFI+IImutCAT as compared with CAT activity levels in mice expressing BDNFI+IICAT (Fig.2). In the hippocampus, which exhibited the highest levels of the reporter gene expression in the brain, CAT activity was on average 15-fold higher in transgenic animals with BDNFI+IImutCAT than in animals with BDNFI+IICAT (Fig. 2). The differences in CAT activity in the hippocampus ranged to more than 100-fold between the individual transgenic founder lines with BDNFI+IImutCAT as compared with the individual lines carrying BDNFI+IICAT. These data indicate that NRSEBDNF is controlling the activity of BDNF promoters I and II in the brain, thymus, and lung. Quantitative RPAs were performed to establish whether NRSEBDNF located 0.7 kb downstream of BDNF exon I and 120 bp upstream of BDNF exon II could affect the activity of BDNF promoter I, promoter II, or both. The analysis revealed that in the hippocampus, CAT mRNAs with BDNF exon I (exon I-CAT) were on average about 15-fold higher, and CAT mRNAs with BDNF exon II (exon II-CAT) about 12-fold higher as compared with the levels in the animals with intact promoter construct (Fig. 3). Upon mutation of NRSEBDNF, the levels of exon I-CAT mRNA in thymus and lung were on average about 40-fold higher, and the levels of exon II-CAT mRNA were on average about 50-fold higher as compared with the levels in mice carrying BDNFI+IICAT transgene (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that disruption of NRSEBDNF affects the activity of both BDNF promoter I and promoter II and leads to the enhanced expression from both promoters. Earlier studies suggested that NRSE is required to prevent expression of neuronal genes in nonneural tissues and cell populations (38Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Next we examined whether high levels of CAT mRNA expression and CAT activity detected in the brain of BDNFI+IImutCAT animals resulted from the ectopic activation of the transgene in nonneuronal cells. Using in situhybridization, CAT mRNA expression was seen in only three of nine founder lines with the intact promoter construct. In contrast to this, the expression of CAT mRNA was detected in all six founder lines with mutant promoter construct (Fig. 4). In all transgenic lines with BDNFI+IImutCAT, CAT mRNA expression was the highest in the neurons of the hilar region and CA3 pyramidal layer of hippocampus. As CAT mRNA was expressed in the same neuronal subpopulations in mice carrying the intact or the mutated promoter construct, we concluded that NRSEBDNF is not restricting the transgene expression to specific subsets of neurons (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Mutation of NRSEBDNF did not lead to the ectopic expression of transgene in nonneuronal cell populations of brain. Our previous data revealed that the neurons of hippocampus exhibit altered levels of BDNF expression from promoters I and II following KA-induced seizures. BDNF transcripts with exon I were induced more than 50-fold, whereas transcripts with exon II were increased about 5-fold, at 3 h following KA treatment (9Metsis M. Timmusk T. Arenas E. Persson H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8802-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have also shown that BDNFI+IICAT recapitulates the KA-induced expression from promoters I and II (33Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These data suggested that kainate responsivecis-acting elements are present in the 9.5-kb BDNF genomic region of BDNFI+IICAT. To determine whether NRSEBDNF may be involved in the KA-induced regulation of BDNF gene, we studied the expression levels of CAT mRNA in the hippocampus of transgenic mice with the intact or mutated promoter constructs at different time points following KA administration. Using in situ hybridization, a marked increase in transgene expression was detected in the pyramidal neurons of CA3 and in the neurons of hilar region in three out of nine founder lines with BDNFI+IICAT and in all six analyzed lines with BDNFI+IImutCAT at 3 h following KA treatment (Figs. 4and 5). In the dentate gyrus, no alterations in transgene expression levels were detected in any of BDNFI+IICAT animals; however, significantly increased levels of CAT mRNA were seen in scattered neurons in three of six founder lines with BDNFI+IImutCAT, at 3 h after KA administration (Fig. 5). Quantitative RPA analysis revealed that in the hippocampus of mice with the intact promoter construct transgene expression levels increased on average 4-fold, whereas in the mutant animals the levels increased on average 15-fold following 3 and 6 h of KA treatment (Fig. 6 and data not shown). As established by in situ hybridization, these higher induction levels resulted from the increased CAT mRNA expression per neuron and also from the increased number of neurons expressing CAT mRNA. At 24 h after drug injection, CAT mRNA levels had returned back to control levels in the hippocampus of both, BDNFI+IICAT and BDNFI+IImutCAT mice, as measured by RPA (data not shown). These data suggest that in the neurons of hippocampus, the induction level of BDNF mRNA transcribed from promoters I and II following KA treatment is under the control of NRSEBDNF.Figure 6NRSEBDNF mediates repression of the KA-induced transgene expression in the neurons of hippocampus.Expression of CAT mRNA and endogenous BDNF mRNA in the founder lines carrying BDNFI+IICAT (Q4 and P4) and BDNFI+IImutCAT (m1 and m26).

EMSA analysis revealed several unique NRSEBDNF-protein complexes that exhibited tissue-specific pattern of migration (Fig.7). Competition experiments showed that the thymus-specific complex could be disrupted with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the upper element (NRSEBDNF11) (Fig. 7, left). The lower element (NRSEBDNF21) appeared to be a less effective competitor. The same amount of unlabeled NRSEBDNF21 oligos was not sufficient to disrupt this complex (Fig. 7, left) and a 250-fold excess of unlabeled NRSEBDNF21 was needed to abolish the thymus-specific complex (data not shown). These data reveal that thymus-specific factors discriminate between the two elements and suggest that the upper element of NRSEBDNF is critical for its activity in thymus. Previous studies have shown that the NRSE-binding transcription factor REST/NRSF/XBR is predominately expressed in nonneural tissues (22Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 30Chong J.A. Tapia R.J. Kim S. Toledo A.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 15: 1280-1296Crossref Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether REST/NRSF/XBR-like activity is present in the large complex detected from thymus extracts. A 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the NRSE sequences of NaChII (NRSENaChII) (Fig.7, left) and SCG10 genes (data not shown) resulted in the disappearance of the thymus-specific complex formed on NRSEBDNF, suggesting that these NRSEs compete for the same factor as does the upper element of NRSEBDNF. Several other studies have shown that NRSEBDNF11, NRSENaChII, and NRSESCG10 bind REST/NRSF/XBR protein and form a complex with slow migration in EMSA analysis (22Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 29Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accordingly, we suggest that the NRSEBDNF-specific complex detected from thymus extracts contains REST/NRSF/XBR. The mutant NRSEBDNF(mut-NRSEBDNF) oligonucleotide, as expected, did not form any specific DNA-protein complexes with thymus extracts because excess of any of the specific unlabeled competitors failed to affect the weak unspecific complexes detected (Fig. 7, left). Using cell extracts of hippocampus, EMSA analysis detected two NRSEBDNF-specific complexes. Complex 1 is fast migrating, whereas complex 2 migrates similarly to the complex from the thymus extracts (Fig. 7). Competition studies of complex 1 revealed that this complex could be disrupted with the addition of 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligos containing the 3′ element of NRSEBDNF and not with the similar excess of unlabeled NRSEBDNF11, NRSENaChII, and NRSESCG10 oligos. A 250-fold excess of unlabeled NRSEBDNF11 oligos was needed to disrupt this complex (Fig. 7, middle, and data not shown). Complex 1 was also detected using protein extracts from other regions of brain (cerebral cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, thalamus, and brainstem) (data not shown). These data suggest that complex 1 is a brain-specific complex that"

To determine the role of ligand valency in M6P/IGF-II receptor-mediated endocytosis, we measured the internalization rates of two ligands, β-glucuronidase (a homotetramer bearing multiple Man-6-P moieties) and IGF-II.

Unlabeled β-glucuronidase stimulated the rate of internalization of125I-IGF-II to equal that of125I-β-glucuronidase, but a bivalent synthetic tripeptide capable of occupying both Man-6-P-binding sites on the M6P/IGF-II receptor simultaneously did not.

In the Golgi, the receptor binds newly synthesized acid hydrolases modified with mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues on their asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and transports them to endosomes via clathrin-coated vesicles (3Kyle J.W.

The acid hydrolases are released in the acidified endosome and then packaged into lysosomes while the receptor either returns to the Golgi to bind another ligand or moves to the plasma membrane (6Duncan J.R.

Man-6-P residues do not inhibit binding of IGF-II to the receptor, verifying that the two ligand-binding sites are distinct. However, proteins containing Man-6-P residues do compete with IGF-II for receptor binding, and IGF-II can inhibit binding of lysosomal enzymes to the receptor (8Kiess W. Blickenstaff G.D. Sklar M.M.

In neither case is the competition complete, and the most plausible explanation is that the inhibition is due to steric hindrance. Although the M6P/IGF-II receptor has been shown to be constitutively internalized from the cell surface, it is not clear whether ligand binding influences the trafficking of the receptor. It has been reported that in the absence of ligand, the M6P/IGF-II receptor accumulates in the Golgi, whereas the addition of lysosomotropic agents that prevent the release of ligand from the receptor in endosomes results in an accumulation of the receptor in these organelles (18Brown W.J. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Brown W.J. Constantinescu E. Farquhar M.G. J.

Other investigators have found that constitutive trafficking of the M6P/IGF-II receptor continues under these conditions (21Braulke T. Gartung C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Together, these data are consistent with the concept that ligand binding modulates the rate of receptor trafficking. Thus, the absence or presence of bound ligand may regulate the trafficking from specific compartments, resulting in a shift in the steady-state distribution of the receptor. However, none of these studies have actually determined the kinetics of receptor trafficking. In this study, we have compared the internalization of β-glucuronidase, a homotetramer with multiple phosphorylated oligosaccharides, with that of IGF-II. We found that the initial rate of internalization of β-glucuronidase is much more rapid than that of IGF-II, providing direct evidence that a multivalent ligand enhances the rate of movement of the receptor. Furthermore, we present data that the mechanism of this effect is due to dimerization of the receptor.

The transfection of the M6P/IGF-II receptor-negative mouse L cell line (L(Rec−)) with constructs encoding the wild-type receptor and a mutant receptor with a 29-amino acid cytoplasmic tail to give the Cc2 and 344 cell lines, respectively, has been previously described (5Lobel P.

Human β-glucuronidase was purified from the secretions of 13.2.1 mouse L cells as described previously (24Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11069-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line, which has been engineered to secrete large amounts of β-glucuronidase, was kindly provided by Dr. William Sly (St. Louis University). For iodination, 30 μg of human β-glucuronidase was brought to 500 μl in PBS (pH 7.4); 2.5 μl of 1.86 μm lactoperoxidase, 1 mCi of Na125I, and 2 μl of 0.5 nm hydrogen peroxide were added to start the reaction. After 3 min at room temperature, another 2 μl of 0.5 nm hydrogen peroxide was added, and after an additional 3 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of quench solution (1 m NaCl, 100 mm NaI, 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 1 mmNaN3, 2 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mg/ml protamine sulfate). The quenched reaction mixture was loaded onto a 1-ml M6P/IGF-II receptor affinity column (26Hoflack B. Fujimoto K. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated in PBS and 0.1% BSA. After extensive washing, the β-glucuronidase was eluted with PBS and 0.1% BSA containing 10 mm Man-6-P. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS to remove the Man-6-P, and the125I-β-glucuronidase was stored at 4 °C. The typical specific activity assuming complete protein recovery was 106 to 107 cpm/μg of protein. 10 μg of IGF-II was iodinated using the lactoperoxidase method described for β-glucuronidase. After quenching, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated in PBS and 0.1% BSA. Three peaks of radioactivity were observed and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The second peak was found to be 98% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable and contained monomeric IGF-II. The iodinated ligand was stored at 4 °C. The typical specific activity assuming complete protein recovery was 107 cpm/μg of protein. IGF-II-(del 1–6) was iodinated by coating an Eppendorf tube with 50 μg of IODO-GEN (Pierce) and adding 5 μg of IGF-II-(del 1–6) and 1 mCi of Na125I. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 min and then loaded onto a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in PBS plus 1% BSA. Fractions containing the first peak were pooled and stored at 4 °C. The typical activity assuming complete protein recovery was 108 cpm/μg of protein. Cells were grown to confluence in 12-well plates. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and 1% BSA, and ligand was added in cold α-minimal Eagle's medium and 2% BSA (0.5 ml/well). 125I-IGF-II was added to a 2 nm final concentration, and125I-β-glucuronidase was typically added to a final concentration of 0.12 nm. The plates were then floated on an ice water bath for 30 min. Unbound ligand was removed, and the wells were rapidly washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and 1% BSA. To the three wells used for the 0 time point was added 1 ml of ice-cold stop/strip solution (SSS; 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 3.5) and 0.5 m NaCl). The plate was then floated in a 37 °C water bath, and 0.5 ml of α-minimal Eagle's medium prewarmed to 37 °C was quickly added to the remaining wells to initiate internalization. At each stopping point, the α-minimal Eagle's medium in the well was removed to a tube for counting, and 1 ml of cold SSS was added. At the end of the experiment (usually 3 min), the plate was removed from the water bath, and the surface-bound ligand was stripped from each well by incubation for a total of 10 min in ice-cold SSS (1 ml for 5 min, twice) and counted. The cells were then solubilized in 0.1n NaOH (1 ml, twice) and counted. The M6P/IGF-II receptor-negative cell line was used as a control for non-receptor binding of 125I-IGF-II and125I-β-glucuronidase. The sum of the labeled ligand remaining on the cell surface at the end of the internalization experiment (receptor-bound ligand) and the internalized ligand was used as a measure of the maximum potential internalization. The fraction of this value internalized at each time point was calculated and plotted. This calculation method was used to exclude the contributions of a specific, non-M6P/IGF-II receptor binding site for IGF-II observed in all the cell lines, including the receptor-negative cells. This site has a lower affinity for IGF-II than the M6P/IGF-II receptor, and with incubation at 37 °C, the ligand is released into the medium rather than internalized. This calculation method was used for both IGF-II and β-glucuronidase binding studies. 110 g of fresh bovine liver was minced and blended in a Waring blender in 200 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm imidazole (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for ∼10 s, four times. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was poured through cheesecloth. A ∼15-ml packed volume of phosphopentamannose-agarose beads (27Distler J.J. Guo J. Jourdian G.W. Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21687-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was washed with extraction buffer without protease inhibitors and added to the supernatant. Receptor binding was allowed to occur for 30 min at 4 °C while rocking. The beads were collected by filtering over a coarse Buchner funnel, and the agarose beads were washed with 1 liter of extraction buffer followed by 500 ml of wash buffer (50 mm imidazole (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 0.05% Triton X-100). The washed agarose was poured into a column, and the M6P/IGF-II receptor was eluted with wash buffer containing 10 mmMan-6-P. Fractions containing the receptor were pooled, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). The recovery of the receptor was 660 μg. A Superose 6 FPLC column was equilibrated in filtered and degassed wash buffer. Protein standards were run and detected by absorbance at 280 nm. TheK d, defined as (V e −V o)/(V t −V o), was determined, and theErf −1 (1 − K d) was plotted versus the known Stokes radius of the protein standards (28Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3237-3238Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The V e of the membrane form of the M6P/IGF-II receptor was determined by collecting 1-ml fractions and analyzing the contents by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining of the gel. The V e of complexes containing β-glucuronidase was determined by β-glucuronidase assays. Continuous 6–21% sucrose gradients (4.8 ml) were prepared in wash buffer and allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were loaded onto the gradients, and the gradients were centrifuged for 4 h at 237,000 × g av in an SW 55Ti rotor. Fractions (240 or 120 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient. Refractive indices of each fraction were measured to determine linearity of the gradients. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following chloroform/methanol precipitation or by β-glucuronidase assays as described below. The sedimentation coefficients of the proteins and complexes were determined using protein standards as markers (29Sadler J.E. Rearick J.I. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4434-4443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sample of each fraction to be tested (2–10 μl) was incubated with 100 μl of 10 mm4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide (Sigma) suspended in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) at 37 °C for 10–60 min. Following incubation, 3 ml of 0.25 m glycine (pH 10.3) was added to stop the reaction, and the fluorescence was determined in a Turner fluorometer. The internalization rates of IGF-II and β-glucuronidase were compared using 125I-IGF-II and125I-β-glucuronidase in an adaptation of the endocytosis assay developed by Jadot et al. (24Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11069-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following an initial lag of 15–20 s, 125I-IGF-II was internalized in a nearly linear fashion, with a t12 of 2–3 min (Fig.1 B). No plateau was observed during the 5-min incubation because very little of the IGF-II was released from the M6P/IGF-II receptor during the course of this assay. The internalization of IGF-II occurred exclusively via the M6P/IGF-II receptor since the untransfected parent cell line did not take up any IGF-II under these conditions (data not shown). By contrast, β-glucuronidase was internalized ∼3–4-fold more rapidly, with a t12 of 30–45 s (Fig.1 A). A plateau was reached when essentially all of the ligand originally present on the cell had been either internalized or released from the receptor into the medium, where it was greatly diluted. Together, these data show that β-glucuronidase binding stimulates the rate of receptor internalization over that observed upon IGF-II binding. To test whether the increased rate of internalization of the receptor with bound β-glucuronidase was a result of ligand occupation of the two Man-6-P-binding sites, the effect of 10 mm Man-6-P on the rate of 125I-IGF-II uptake was determined. This concentration of Man-6-P saturated the Man-6-P-binding sites on the receptor. Although Man-6-P caused a small increase in total125I-IGF-II binding, it had no effect on the rate of125I-IGF-II internalization (data not shown), indicating that the increase in internalization rate was not solely due to Man-6-P binding. The effect of β-glucuronidase on the internalization of125I-IGF-II was next determined. In this experiment, the simultaneous binding of 125I-IGF-II and β-glucuronidase was maximized by first incubating cells on ice with125I-IGF-II for 5 min to allow maximum binding of this ligand. Excess unlabeled β-glucuronidase (10 nm) was then added to each well for an additional 25 min on ice. The cells were washed, and the uptake of 125I-IGF-II was determined. The presence of β-glucuronidase stimulated the rate of endocytosis of125I-IGF-II to that observed with125I-β-glucuronidase alone (Fig.2). This indicates that the unlabeled β-glucuronidase bound to a significant fraction of the receptors that had already bound 125I-IGF-II, resulting in an increase in internalization rate that cannot be merely due to the receptor binding to Man-6-P residues. β-Glucuronidase could enhance the rate of internalization of the M6P/IGF-II receptor by promoting either intramolecular or intermolecular cross-linking. Since each monomer of the receptor contains two Man-6-P-binding sites, simultaneous binding to two Man-6-P residues on a phosphorylated oligosaccharide could induce a conformational change in the extracellular domain of the receptor that is transmitted to the cytosolic domain, where the internalization signal is located. This could result in a more favorable presentation of the internalization signal. Alternatively, the ligand could cross-link two receptor molecules, resulting in an increased density of the internalization signals. This could enhance the likelihood of the receptors being retained in a forming clathrin-coated pit, thus increasing the probability of internalization and consequently the rate. To distinguish between these possibilities, two approaches were used. First, the effect of a small bivalent Man-6-P-containing peptide on the rate of IGF-II uptake was determined. The peptide, a Thr-Lys-Thr tripeptide with a Man-6-P(α1–2)Man disaccharide attached to each threonine, has an affinity for the M6P/IGF-II receptor that is similar to that of an oligosaccharide with two Man-6-P residues and over 1000-fold higher than that of Man-6-P (23Franzyk H. Christensen M.K. Jorgensen R.M. Meldal M. Cordes H. Mouritsen S. Bock K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Christensen M.K. Meldal M. Bock K. Cordes H. Mouritsen S. Elsner H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1994; 1: 1299-1310Crossref Google Scholar). This high binding affinity indicates that the ligand is interacting with two binding sites on the M6P/IGF-II receptor. As shown below, this peptide does not mediate intermolecular cross-linking of the receptor. In control experiments, the peptide competed with β-glucuronidase for the Man-6-P-binding site on the receptor, but did not interfere with binding of IGF-II to the receptor (data not shown). A saturating concentration of the peptide (5 μm) did not significantly alter the rate of 125I-IGF-II internalization, whereas unlabeled β-glucuronidase accelerated the rate of125I-IGF-II uptake considerably (Fig.3). These results suggest that intramolecular cross-linking of extracellular domains 3 and 9 of the M6P/IGF-II receptor does not alter the rate of internalization. The second approach to distinguish intra- from intermolecular cross-linking utilized cells expressing a mutant receptor that has only a single functional Man-6-P-binding site. The Man-6-P binding of domain 3 was abolished by substituting an alanine for Arg-435 (14Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The full-length receptor containing this mutation was transfected into L(Rec−) cells, creating the Dom3ala cell line (25Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The M6P/IGF-II receptors in this cell line are incapable of intramolecular cross-linking due to the presence of only a single functional Man-6-P-binding site per receptor, but could potentially undergo intermolecular cross-linking. The ability of Dom3ala cells to internalize β-glucuronidase and IGF-II was determined (Fig.4). In preliminary experiments, internalization of 125I-IGF-II by Dom3ala cells was partially obscured by a high background resulting from IGF-II binding to other proteins (32Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This technical problem was resolved by using IGF-II-(del 1–6), which contains a deletion that prevents binding to the IGF-II-binding proteins while maintaining internalization by the M6P/IGF-II receptor (32Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). IGF-II-(del 1–6) was internalized by the wild-type M6P/IGF-II receptor at a rate similar to that observed with native IGF-II (Fig. 4 A), and the addition of unlabeled β-glucuronidase increased the rate of receptor internalization to that seen earlier (Fig. 2 A). The rate of125I-IGF-II-(del 1–6) uptake by the mutant receptor in the Dom3ala cells was similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4 B). This was expected since neither the IGF-II-binding site nor the internalization signal in the cytoplasmic domain is different. As with wild-type receptors, the addition of unlabeled β-glucuronidase increased the rate of internalization of the mutant receptor in Dom3ala cells, as measured by125I-IGF-II-(del 1–6) uptake (Fig. 4 B). This strengthens the conclusion that intramolecular cross-linking is not responsible for the increased rate of internalization and suggests that intermolecular cross-linking mediates the enhanced internalization. The internalization rate of 125I-IGF-II-(del 1–6) by the Dom3ala cells in the presence of β-glucuronidase was not as rapid as that seen with cells expressing the wild-type receptors. This may be because the single Man-6-P-binding site on the mutant receptor results in lower binding affinity for β-glucuronidase and consequently less efficient cross-linking of receptor molecules. We next determined the state of oligomerization of purified M6P/IGF-II receptor in both the presence and absence of β-glucuronidase. Perdueet al. (33Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the M6P/IGF-II receptor is a monomer when solubilized, whereas Stein et al. (34Stein M. Braulke T. Krentler C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggested that it may exist as a dimer in the plasma membrane, as determined by cross-linking studies. The M6P/IGF-II receptor was solubilized and purified from fresh bovine liver. The purified receptor was analyzed by FPLC gel filtration to determine its Stokes radius (Fig. 5, A and C) and by sedimentation in a continuous 6–21% sucrose gradient to determine its sedimentation coefficient (Fig.6). The Stokes radius of the receptor was calculated to be 79 Å, which is somewhat greater than the previously reported value of 72 Å (33Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient was determined to be 10.1 × 1013 s, in close accordance with the previously published value (33Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J.

The partial specific volume was calculated to be 0.73, based on the amino acid composition and expected carbohydrate additions. N"

THP-1wt adherence to ICAM-1 was LPS dose-related, time-dependent, and inhibited by antibodies to either CD14 or leukocyte function associated antigen (LFA)-1, but was independent of any change in the number of surface expressed LFA-1 molecules. A potential role for phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in LPS-induced adherence was examined using the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin. Both inhibitors selectively attenuated LPS-induced, but not phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced adherence. Inhibition by these agents was unrelated to any changes in either LPS binding to or LFA-1 expression by THP-1wt cells. LPS-induced adherence was also abrogated in U937 cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of of PI 3-kinase. Toxin B from Clostridium difficile, an inhibitor of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins, abrogated both PI-3 kinase activation and adherence induced by LPS. Cytohesin-1, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate-regulated adaptor molecule for LFA-1 activation, was found to be expressed in THP-1wt cells. In addition, treatment of THP-1wt with cytohesin-1 antisense attenuated LPS-induced adherence. These findings suggest a model in which LPS induces adherence through a process of “inside-out” signaling involving CD14, Rho, and PI 3-kinase. This converts low avidity LFA-1 into an active form capable of increased binding to ICAM-1. This change in LFA-1 appears to be cytohesin-1-dependent.

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (CD54) has been identified as a high affinity counter-receptor for LFA-1 (8Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Interactions of ICAM-1 with LFA-1 mediate several important functions in the immune system in addition to adherence (6Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar). The basal affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 or its other ligands is low and LFA-1 must be activated to mediate stable adhesion (4Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 5Van Kooyk Y. van de Wiel-van Kemenade P. Weder P. Kuijpers T.W. Figdor C.G. Nature. 1989; 342: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Indeed, in its activated form, the affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 increases 200-fold in comparison with its affinity in the resting state (9Lollo B.A. Chan K.W.H. Hanson E.M. Moy V.T. Brian A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21693-21700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with a process of “inside-out” signaling that converts LFA-1 into an activated form capable of mediating increased adhesion. It is important to note that conditions which give rise to increased adherence do not necessarily lead to increased cell surface expression of LFA-1 (5Van Kooyk Y. van de Wiel-van Kemenade P. Weder P. Kuijpers T.W. Figdor C.G. Nature. 1989; 342: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar,10Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The signaling events that link cell stimulation to the activation of LFA-1 are incompletely understood. Recently, a regulatory protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of CD18 has been cloned (11Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This protein, cytohesin-1, contains a pleckstrin homology domain that binds the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) metabolite, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3), leading to changes in properties of the protein (12Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential role for PI 3-kinase in regulating the activity of LFA-1. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to enhance the accumulation of leukocytes at inflammatory foci (13Haslett C. Worthen G.S. Giclas P.C. Morrison D.C. Henson J.E. Henson P.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1997; 136: 9-18Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and the adherence of leukocytes to endothelial cells in vitro (14Pohlman T.H. Stanness K.A. Beatty P.G. Ochs H.D. Harlan J.M. J.

Invest. 1986; 77: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Although it has also been shown that LPS-induced adherence is mediated at least in part by LFA-1 (16Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. Stockley R.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 51: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the pathway linking LPS to LFA-1 has not been characterized. A dominant LPS signaling pathway involves the membrane receptor CD14 (17Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J.

Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3391) Google Scholar). Binding of LPS to CD14 results in the activation of multiple Src family protein tyrosine kinases, and this appears to involve the physical association of p53/p56lyn with the receptor (19Stefanová I.

It has also been shown that LPS induces the CD14-dependent association of an activated form of PI 3-kinase with p53/p56lyn (20Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of monocyte PI 3-kinase by LPS results in the generation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (21Herrera-Velit P. Knutson K.L. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16445-16452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which as discussed above is known to regulate various effector functions including cell adhesion (22Ward S.G.

Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility that LPS-induced adhesion may be mediated through a pathway involving PI 3-kinase leading to changes in LFA-1 activity. The results of the present study show that LPS binding to CD14 induces monocyte adherence dependent upon LFA-1, ICAM-1, and cytohesin-1, via a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway regulated by the small GTP-binding protein Rho. RPMI 1640, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and penicillin/streptomycin were from Stem Cell Technologies (Vancouver, British Columbia). Human AB+ serum was provided by The Canadian Red Cross (Vancouver, British Columbia). LPS from Escherichia coli O127:B8 was from Difco. LPS was labeled with FITC as described (24Hmama Z. Mey A.

Woska, Jr. (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, CT). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), wortmannin,l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine),l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), andl-α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate were purchased from Sigma. LY294002 was from Calbiochem. Toxin B purified fromClostridium difficile was generously provided by Dr. G. Armstrong (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta). Protein A-agarose, and electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham International (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The following mAbs were used: 3C10 (IgG2b, anti-CD14 mAb, a gift from Dr. W. C. Van Voorhis, University of Washington, Seattle, WA), W6/32 (IgG2a, anti-HLA-class I, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), TS1/18 (IgG1, anti-CD18), and TS1/22 (IgG1, anti-CD11a) were from the Hybridoma Bank of the University of Iowa, Iowa city, IA. Anti-PI 3-kinase mAb was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The monocytic cell lines THP-1wt (THP-1 cells stably expressing glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD14) and THP-1rsv (THP-1 cells transfected with vector alone) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Ulevitch (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Transfection of the promonocytic cell line U937 with cDNA encoding the entire coding region of either wild-type bovine PI 3-kinase subunit p85α (Wp85α) or mutant bovine p85α (Δp85α) was as described (21Herrera-Velit P. Knutson K.L. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16445-16452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mutant has a deletion of 35 amino acids from residues 479–513 of bovine p85α and the insertion of two other amino acids (Ser-Arg) in the deleted position. This alteration prevents the association of mutant p85α with the p110 catalytic subunit. Mutant p85α competes with native p85 for binding to essential signaling proteins, thereby acting as a dominant negative mutant (21Herrera-Velit P. Knutson K.L. Reiner N.E. J. Biol.

These transfected cell lines are referred to as Wp85-U937 and Δp85-U937. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Flat-bottomed, polystyrene, cell culture-treated, microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were loaded with purified sICAM or BSA (coating control) diluted in 0.1 m carbonate buffer (pH 9) for 1 h at 37 °C and then transferred to 4 °C overnight. Wells were then washed with HBSS and blocked with 1% BSA in RPMI 1640 for 1 h at 37 °C. Blocking solution was discarded and 100-μl aliquots of cells (1 × 105) were dispensed into duplicate wells. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow cell sedimentation prior to treatment with stimuli or inhibitors. Cells were then assayed for adherence at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by carefully washing three times with 200 μl of warm (37 °C) incubation medium. Adherent cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/HBSS. Fixed cells were washed once with HBSS and stained for 10 min with 0.05% crystal violet in 20% methanol. Crystal violet was rinsed out of the wells with water, and the plates were allowed to dry. The dye was then eluted from cells by addition of 100 μl of 100% methanol, and absorbance at 570 nm was immediately recorded in a microtiter plate reader. Adherent cells were quantitated by using a standard curve generated with a range of input cell numbers incubated with PMA (20 ng/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C and fixed without prior washing. To measure the expression of cell surface molecules, cells were incubated with specific mouse mAb (10 μg/ml) for 30 min, then washed twice and labeled with FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in staining buffer. All staining and washing procedures were performed at 4 °C in HBSS containing 0.1% NaN3 and 1% FCS. Cell fluorescence was analyzed using a Coulter Elite flow cytometer (Hialeah, FL). Relative fluorescence intensities of 5000 cells were recorded as single-parameter histograms (log scale, 1024 channels, 4 log decades), and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated for each histogram. Results are expressed as specific MFI index, which corresponds to the ratio: MFI of cells + specific antibody/MFI of cells + irrelevant isotype-matched IgG. Aliquots of cell lysates adjusted for protein content (300–500 μg of protein) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with mAb to PI 3-kinase, and immune complexes were adsorbed onto protein A-agarose for 1 h. The complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4). PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described (20Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 10 μg of sonicated (3 × 20 s in a ultrasonic cell disrupter, Branson Sonic Power Co., Danbury, CT) PtdIns in 10 μl of 30 mm Hepes to which was added 40 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, 30 mm MgCl2, 200 μm adenosine, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v). Lipids were separated on oxalate-treated silica TLC plates using a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:water:28% ammonia (45:35:7.5:2.5, v/v/v/v). Plates were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Incorporation of radioactivity into lipids was quantitated by excising the corresponding portions of the TLC plate followed by liquid scintillation counting. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and PCR conditions were as described previously (27Nandan D. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1095-1101PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in PCR amplifications were as follows: cytohesin-1 sense, CGC GGG GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG GAG GAG GAC GAC AGC TAC GTT CCC; cytohesin-1 antisense, CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT TTA GTG TCG CTT CGT GGA GGA GAC CTT (11Kolanus W.

Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1095-1101PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate negative controls (no DNA and RNA without RT) were included in the RT-PCR experiments. Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides (S-oligos) to cytohesin-1 were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Twenty one-mer sequences spanning the presumed translation initiation site of human cytohesin-1 cDNA (28Liu L. Pohajdak B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were made in both sense and antisense orientations as follows: sense, 5′-ATG GAG GAG GAC GAC AGC TAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GTA GCT GTC GTC CTC CTC CAT-3′. The sequences were selected by screening for uniqueness using Blast 227 and were also tested for lack of secondary structure and oligonucleotide pairing by using Primer Software (version 2.0, Scientific and Educational Software). THP-1wt cells (106) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 250 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 2.5% LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and various concentrations of S-oligos. After incubation, the medium was adjusted to 1 ml and supplemented with 10% FCS, and cells were cultured for an additional 18 h. Cells were then washed and tested in adhesion assay as described above. Surface expression of CD14 and LFA-1 molecules was analyzed by immunofluorescence and FACS analysis. The representative record shown in Fig. 1demonstrates that cells transfected with CD14 (THP-1wt) and control cells transfected with vector alone (THP-1rsv) expressed similar levels of both LFA-1 α- and β-chains (CD11a and CD18, respectively). However, THP-1wt cells expressed about 80-fold more CD14 than did THP-1rsv cells. Initial experiments were carried out to standardize the model system of LPS-induced adherence of THP-1 cells to sICAM-1. CD14-transfected THP-1wt cells and control THP-1rsv cells were incubated in microtiter wells coated with sICAM-1 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 40 μg/ml and treated with LPS in the presence of 0.5% normal AB+ serum. THP-1wt cells adhered to sICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum of 48 ± 8.7% cells binding to wells coated with 20 μg/ml of sICAM-1 (Fig.2 A). In contrast, control THP-1rsv cells adhered at maximum rate of 8.3 ± 2%. In the absence of sICAM-1, only 4–5% of the THP-1wt cell adhered nonspecifically to the plate (data not shown). Binding specificity for ICAM-1 was also demonstrated by control experiments in which only 4.8 ± 3.2% of THP-1wt cells adhered to wells coated with BSA at 20 μg/ml (n = 4, data not shown). THP-1wt and THP-1rsv cells were also examined for adherence in the presence of a range (0.1–10 μg/ml) of concentrations of LPS (Fig.2 B). Treatment of THP-1wt cells with LPS resulted in a dose-dependent increase in adherence that was maximal (52.1 ± 6.1%, mean ± S.E., n = 2) at 1 μg/ml. Maximal adherence observed with THP-1rsv was only 10.7 ± 1.8% (mean ± S.E., n = 2), and this was not affected by LPS, indicating that LPS-induced adherence in this system was largely CD14-dependent. In other experiments, cells were incubated with LPS (1 μg/ml in 0.5% AB+ serum) for up to 2 h to determine the time course of THP-1 adherence to sICAM-1 (Fig. 2 C). LPS-stimulated adherence was maximal by 60 min and remained stable for the second hour. The importance of serum was also addressed. The results showed that exposure of cells to LPS in the absence of serum resulted in markedly reduced adherence (12.1 ± 0.8%, mean ± S.E., n = 2). Conversely, treatment with serum alone did not induce cell adherence (data not shown). As shown above, only cells transfected with CD14 displayed enhanced adherence in response to LPS. The role of CD14 in cell adherence was investigated further by competitive inhibition with a neutralizing anti-CD14 mAb 3C10 (18Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3391) Google Scholar, 29Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows that preincubation of THP-1wt cells with mAb 3C10 prior exposure to LPS led to approximately 80% inhibition of adherence. Competitive inhibition with mAb was also used to examine the extent of involvement of LFA-1 in this model. The results obtained (Fig. 3 A) show significant inhibition with either neutralizing anti-CD11a mAb (TS1/18) or anti-CD18 mAb (TS1/22) (30Sanchez-Madrid F. Krensky A.M. Ware C.F. Robbins E.

Rudloff H.E. Schmalstieg F.C. Anderson D.C. Speros P. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). When a range of concentrations of anti-CD14 and anti-LFA-1 mAbs were tested, a concentration of 10 μg/ml was observed to result in maximal inhibition of LPS-induced adherence (data not shown). Furthermore, when compared with blockade of either CD11a or CD18 alone, inhibition (85%) was enhanced when anti-CD18 and anti-CD11a were used in combination. Specificity of inhibition by anti-CD14 and anti-LFA-1 mAbs was validated using anti-MHC class I mAb, W6/32. Despite its binding to constitutively expressed cell surface molecules, W6/32 did not affect LPS-induced adherence. Certain agonists are known to induce increased adherence by either up-regulating integrin expression, by increasing integrin affinity for substrate or by a combination of these effects (32Philips M.R. Buyon J.P. Winchester R. Weissmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To address whether the difference observed between THP-1wt and THP-1rsv could be related to altered integrin expression induced by LPS, cell surface expression of CD11a and CD18 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3 B, LPS treatment did not affect the expression of these proteins by THP-1wt cells. In contrast, incubation of cells with fMet-Leu-Phe, an agonist known to up-regulate integrin expression (33Capodici C. Hanft S. Feoktistov M. Pillinger M.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar), induced significant increases in expression of both CD11a and CD18. Taken together, these findings suggest that LPS does not modify the number of surface expressed LFA-1 molecules, but rather initiates a signaling sequence through CD14 leading to increased avidity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1. Recent evidence has suggested a role for PI 3-kinase in signaling pathways activated by LPS (20Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar, 21Herrera-Velit P. Knutson K.L. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16445-16452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To examine the potential involvement of PI 3-kinase in LPS-induced adherence, cells were incubated with various concentration of the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 for 20 min prior to the addition of LPS. Preincubation with wortmannin inhibited LPS-induced adherence in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4A, maximum inhibition 92.9 ± 6.7%, mean ± S.E., n = 3) with an IC50 of approximately 1 nm. This value is 10 times lower than the IC50 for wortmannin as determined for inhibition of fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated neutrophil homotypic aggregation (33Capodici C. Hanft S. Feoktistov M. Pillinger M.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). LY294002, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase that acts via a distinct mechanism, when used at concentrations known to be relatively selective for inhibition of PI 3-kinase, also attenuated LPS-induced adherence (Fig. 4 B, maximum inhibition 89.5 ± 2.1%, mean ± S.E., IC50 ∼0.45 μm, n = 3). In contrast to abrogation of LPS-induced adherence, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 had significant effects on PMA-induced adherence, except at high concentrations. These results show that inhibition of LPS-induced adherence by wortmannin or LY294002 is not due to nonspecific toxicity. Moreover, they suggest that the pathways regulating adherence in response to PMA and LPS are distinct. PI 3-kinase inhibitors have been shown to affect the expression of some cell surface receptors (34Kundra R. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3848-3853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Experiments were done, therefore, to examine the effects of wortmannin and LY294002 on the expression of CD11a and CD18. The data shown in Fig. 4 C indicate that high concentration of inhibitors (100 nm wortmannin and 16 μm LY294002) resulted in only small changes (20–30% reductions) in surface expression of CD18 and CD11a. These modest changes appear insufficient to explain the marked attenuation of LFA-1-mediated adherence to sICAM-1. Binding of LPS to cells was also examined using FITC-LPS and FACS analysis. LPS binding was not altered in THP-1wt cells pretreated with either wortmannin or LY294002 (data not shown). The requirement for PI 3-kinase in LPS-induced adherence was also examined in cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of p85 (Δp85). Stable transfection with Δp85 resulted in a significant reduction in LPS-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.5 A), and this correlated with marked attenuation of cell adherence to sICAM-1 (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, cells transfected with wild-type p85 showed both LPS-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and adherence. Taken together, these findings suggest that PI 3-kinase activation plays a central role in LPS-induced adherence. Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family participate in various important signaling pathways, including those regulating cellular adhesion (35Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D.

In contrast, induction of adherence in response to PMA was toxin-resistant. To analyze further the inhibitory effect of toxin B, a dose response analysis was performed. Three separate exp"

The N-terminal oxygenase domain (amino acids 1–498; iNOSox) in each subunit binds heme,l-Arg, and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), is the site of NO synthesis, and is responsible for the dimeric interaction, which must occur to synthesize NO. In both cells and purified systems, iNOS dimer assembly is promoted by H4B, l-Arg, and l-Arg analogs. We examined the ability of imidazole andN-substituted imidazoles to promote or inhibit dimerization of heme-containing iNOSox monomers, or to affect iNOS dimerization in cells. Imidazole, 1-phenylimidazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole all bound to the iNOSox monomer heme iron. Imidazole and 1-phenylimidazole promoted iNOSox dimerization, whereas clotrimazole (30 μm) and miconazole (15 μm) did not, and instead inhibited dimerization normally promoted byl-Arg and H4B. Clotrimazole also bound to iNOSox dimers in the absence of l-Arg and H4B and caused their dissociation. When added to cells expressing iNOS, clotrimazole (50 μm) had no effect on iNOS protein expression but almost completely inhibited its dimerization and consequent NO synthesis over an 8-h culture period, without affecting calmodulin interaction with iNOS. Thus, imidazoles can promote or inhibit dimerization of iNOS both in vitro and in cells, depending on their structure. Bulky imidazoles like clotrimazole block NO synthesis by inhibiting assembly of the iNOS dimer, revealing a new means to control cellular NO synthesis.

Although the NOS isoforms differ regarding their primary sequence and mode of expression, they all are bi-domain enzymes comprised of a C-terminal reductase domain that contains binding sites for NADPH, FAD, FMN, and CaM, and an N-terminal oxygenase domain that contains binding sites for heme, tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), andl-Arg (5Masters B.S.S.

Thus, as with the cytochromes P-450, the NOS heme represents a potential target for enzyme inhibition. In fact, compounds that bind directly to the NOS heme iron such as CO, NO, CN, imidazole, and N-phenyl imidazoles all inhibit NO synthesis (22Wolff D.J. Datto G.A. Samatovicz R.A. Tempsick R.A. J.

Both the oxygenase and reductase domain of each NOS isoform can fold and function independent of one another (45McMillan K. Masters B.S.S.

For example, the iNOS oxygenase domain (iNOSox, amino acids 1–498) is expressed inEscherichia coli as a dimer, exhibits normal affinity towardl-Arg and H4B, and catalyzes NO synthesis from the reaction intermediate N-hydroxy-l-Arg either in a H2O2-supported reaction or when supplied with NADPH and its reductase domain (48Gachhui R.

Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Full-length NOS monomers isolated from mammalian cells are devoid of H4B and heme, but contain bound FAD and FMN, functional NADPH and CaM binding sites, and can catalyze electron transfer to artificial acceptors such as cytochrome c at rates that match their respective dimeric forms (41Baek K.J.

Work with full-length iNOS and nNOS monomers indicates that their dimerization minimally requires that heme be inserted into the protein during the dimerization reaction (41Baek K.J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The heme-containing NOS monomer may be an intermediate on the path toward forming a stable dimer (52Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and although it does not accumulate in mammalian cells containing H4B and l-Arg (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can be generatedin vitro by dissociating purified iNOS dimers with urea (47Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J.

Dimerization of iNOS monomers is also stimulated by H4B and l-Arg (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5414-5421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Dimerization activates iNOS in part by enabling electron transfer between enzyme flavin and heme prosthetic groups (55Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and by facilitating productive binding of substrate and H4B (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,49Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because dimer assembly is critical for NO synthesis, it is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. A study of iNOS dimerization as promoted by l-Arg showed that its effect was stereospecific but not unique, because several l-Arg and guanidine analogs that bind to the iNOS dimer also promoted dimer assembly (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Sennequier N. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5883-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two substrate analogs that exhibit greater affinity toward the iNOS dimer than l-Arg,N ω-amino-l-Arg andl-thiocitrulline (21Narayanan K. Spack L. McMillan K. Kilbourn R.G. Hayward M.A. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11103-11110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Wolff D.J. Lubeski A. Umansky S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), did not promote dimer assembly, suggesting they might function as antagonists. However, they were incapable of blocking dimer assembly in the presence of excessl-Arg (56Sennequier N. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5883-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), consistent with their sharing a common binding site but being generally unable to bind to iNOS monomers (32Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar,48Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This suggests that substrate analogs have little inherent capacity to block iNOS dimerization. On the basis of these considerations, we tested if imidazoles might positively or negatively influence iNOS dimer assembly. Because imidazoles bind to the NOS heme iron, their binding should not depend on NOS dimeric structure, but simply on whether heme is incorporated into the protein. In fact, the crystal structure of a heme-containing iNOSox monomer shows that two molecules of imidazole can bind within the monomer's distal heme pocket (57Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), one coordinating to the heme iron and the other binding to the carboxylate of Glu-371, which also binds the guanidino nitrogens of l-Arg (32Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 48Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of imidazole andN 1-substituted imidazoles to promote or antagonize the dimerization of full-length iNOS and iNOSox monomers, and compared results to those obtained with l-Arg, H4B, or 7-nitroindazole, which are all known to stabilize the NOS dimer or promote its assembly without binding to the heme iron (56Sennequier N. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5883-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 58Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We found that imidazoles can promote or inhibit iNOS dimerization depending on their structure, and act through a mechanism that involves binding to the heme iron. On this basis, we characterize an antifungal imidazole as a potent inhibitor of iNOS dimer assembly both in a purified system and in cultured cells. Interferon-γ was a gift from Genentech, South San Francisco, CA. Antibodies against iNOS and CaM were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit for immunodetection was from Amersham International PLC (Little Chalfon, United Kingdom). Bacterial culture materials were purchased from Difco Labs (Detroit, MI) and Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems (Cockeysville, MD). Clotrimazole and miconazole were purchased from Sigma, while 7-nitroindazole, 1-phenylimidazole, and 2-phenylimidazole were purchased from Aldrich. Mammalian cell culture materials were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD), ampicillin was from Apothecon (Princeton, NJ). Pefabloc and lysozyme were from Boehringer-Mannheim GmBH (Germany). Ni2+-nitriloacetate resin was from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). Gel filtration protein standards were from Bio-Rad. Clotrimazole and miconazole stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO, while all other imidazoles were dissolved in buffer. RAW 264.7 macrophage cell cultures (500 ml) were grown in spinner flasks and induced to express iNOS by adding 10 units/ml interferon-γ and 1 μg/mlE. coli lipopolysaccharide as previously detailed (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clotrimazole was added as a 2-ml Me2SO solution to each culture as described below. In some cases, iNOS monomers and dimers were purified from the soluble RAW 264.7 cell fraction by sequential chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose and Mono-Q anion exchange columns using fast protein liquid chromatography (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygenase domain of iNOS (amino acids 1–498, iNOSox) containing a 6-hisitidine C terminus was expressed in E. coli and purified in the absence of l-Arg and H4B essentially as detailed in Siddhanta et al. (60Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7309-7312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), while full-length iNOS containing a 6-histidine tag at its N terminus was expressed in E. coli and purified in the absence ofl-Arg and H4B as described in Wu et al. (61Wu C. Zhang J. Abu-Soud H. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The purified iNOSox and full-length iNOS proteins were 70–80% dimeric as isolated and were dissociated into monomers with urea according to previous methods (47Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 60Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, iNOSox was diluted to 3 μm in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 3 mm DTT, and 5 murea at 4 °C. After 1 h, this solution (∼1 ml) was sequentially dialyzed at 4 °C against 200 ml of the same buffer containing 5 m urea for 90 min, against 200 ml of the same buffer containing 2 m urea for 4 h, and against 200 ml the same buffer containing 0.1 m urea overnight. The same procedure was used for full-length iNOS except 2.5 m urea was used to dissociate the dimer and intermediate dialysis with 2m urea was omitted. These procedures resulted in preparations that contained 60–80% monomer and 20–40% dimer (percentages reflect distribution of iNOS protein mass) as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The urea-generated iNOS monomers contained heme but no H4B (47Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 53Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and were used within 1 day of their preparation. The NO synthesis activity of activated cell cultures or of soluble cell supernatants was estimated using the colorimetric Griess assay for nitrite as described previously (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Culture fluid was analyzed directly for nitrite. NO synthesis activity of cell supernatants or column fractions was determined in 100-μl incubations containing aliquots of cell supernatants or column fractions and 40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, 1 mmNADPH, 2 mml-Arg, 3 mm DTT, protease inhibitors, and 4 μm each of FAD, FMN, and H4B as described previously (41Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were run for 60 min at 37 °C prior to analyzing for nitrite. NO synthesis activity of purified full-length iNOS was determined using the spectrophotometric oxyhemoglobin assay. Cuvette samples (350 μl) contained iNOS, 5 μm oxyhemoglobin, 0.3 mmDTT, 1 mml-Arg, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1300 units/ml catalase, and 150 units/ml superoxide dismutase in 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6. Reactions were initiated by adding 100 μm NADPH and the rate of NO synthesis was measured at 401 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 38 mm−1 cm−1. Optical spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Hitachi U-2110 spectrophotometer as detailed in Sennequier and Stuehr (56Sennequier N. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5883-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Spectra were collected and processed using SpectraCalc software (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH). Titrations of N-substituted imidazoles were performed by adding 3-μl aliquots of concentrated stock solutions (giving a final concentration range of 1–50 μm and 1–20 μm,respectively, for clotrimazole and miconazole) to cuvettes containing 1 ml of Bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, iNOSox, andl-Arg, or H4B as stated in the text. Spectra were collected after each addition. Binding constants were derived from double-reciprocal plots of the absorbance difference (peak to trough in the difference spectra) versus the additive concentration. iNOS dimer and monomer in supernatants of lysed cells or purified iNOSox samples were estimated by fractionating 100 μl of sample on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column at 4 °C. The column was run at 0.5 ml/min with 40 mm Bis-Tris propane buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 200 mm NaCl. Under these conditions, dimer does not dissociate into monomer nor do monomers form dimers. 2N. Sennequier, D. K. Ghosh, and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results. For samples containing iNOSox, eluted protein was monitored at 280 nm and the peaks were assigned to be dimer or monomer based on the elution volumes of protein standards and authentic iNOSox monomer and dimer (47Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The dimer-monomer distribution in iNOSox samples was estimated based on relative peak heights. For cell supernatants, aliquots of each column fraction were subject to SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a Nytran membrane, and iNOS was detected using an anti-iNOS polyclonal antibody as detailed in Albakri and Stuehr (54Albakri Q.A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5414-5421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE used a gradient of 5–20% acrylamide which allowed us to probe the membrane for CaM (17 kDa) as well as for iNOS (130 kDa). After iNOS bands were visualized and quantitated by scanning densitometry, the membrane was stripped of the antibody directed against iNOS and reprobed using a mouse antibody directed against bovine CaM by a standard procedure (12Cho H.J.

https://openalex.org/W2080914889,"The IκB inhibitors regulate the activity of the potent transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Following signal-induced IκB proteolysis, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes, including IκBα itself, initiating the “NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop.” Upon IκBα resynthesis, NF-κB is subsequently inactivated and redistributed back into the cytoplasm. We have previously reported a robust NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop in HepG2 hepatocytes. Sixty minutes after tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) stimulation, IκBα is resynthesized to ∼2-fold greater level than in control cells and completely inhibits NF-κB binding. Here we investigate the mechanism for IκBα resynthesis comparing the effect of stimulation of TNF-α with that of interleukin-1 (IL-1α). Although either TNF-α or IL-1α stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-down-regulated cells equivalently induces NF-κB translocation, the kinetics of IκBα resynthesis is slowed. Moreover, pretreatment with selective calcium-dependent PKC inhibitors selectively slowed the kinetics of the IL-1α-induced overshoot without affecting that produced by TNF-α. Down-regulation of PKCα by antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and expression vectors selectively blocked the IL-1α-induced IκBα overshoot. In the absence of PKCα, although IL-1α induced similar amounts of IκBα transcription and changes in steady-state mRNA, a greater component of IκBα mRNA was retained in the nucleus. These data indicate a selective role for PKCα in IL-1α-induced IκBα resynthesis, which is mediated, at least in part, by post-transcriptional control of mRNA export.

Multicellular organisms have evolved hormone-inducible signal transduction pathways for expression of homeostatic genes under conditions of stress. One prominent example, which is highly conserved in vertebrates, is the hepatic acute-phase response (APR), 1The abbreviations used are: APR, acute-phase response; aPKC, atypical PKC isoform; APRE, acute-phase response element; cPKC, calcium-regulated PKC isoform; DAG, diacylglycerol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; IL-1α, interleukin-1α; NF-κB1, nuclear factor-κB 50-kDa subunit; nPKC, novel PKC isoform; PKC, protein kinase C; Rel A, NF-κB 65-kDa subunit; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WT, wild type; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotides. where infectious processes activate mononuclear cells to secrete the cytokines interleukin-1α (IL-1α) or tumor necrosis factor-α (1Akira S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). After these cytokines enter the circulation, they bind to high affinity receptors on the hepatocyte plasma membrane, activating expression of genes required for blood pressure regulation (angiotensinogen (3Brasier A.R. Li J. J. Hypertens. 1996; 27: 465-475Crossref Google Scholar)) and immune activation (interleukins-6 and -8 (1Akira S. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 4Birch H.E. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8077-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). A prominent mechanism for inducible gene expression during the APR is at the level of transcriptional initiation. The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an important signal transduction mediator of the APR. NF-κB is a family of related proteins that includes potent transactivator subunits (Rel A and c-Rel) and DNA-binding subunits (NF-κB1). In unstimulated hepatocytes, NF-κB is inactivated in the cytoplasm through reversible association with the inhibitory proteins, IκBα, -β, and -γ (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Following cytokine stimulation, IκBα and -β are inducibly phosphorylated by a ubiquitous multisubunit IκB kinase and selectively degraded (Refs.5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 6Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar and references therein). The release of previously inactivated cytoplasmic NF-κB allows it to enter the nucleus where it binds to high affinity sites in the promoters of inducible genes and initiates transcription (3Brasier A.R. Li J. J. Hypertens. 1996; 27: 465-475Crossref Google Scholar, 7Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol.

NF-κB target genes include acute-phase responsive genes and, curiously, one of the NF-κB inhibitors, IκBα. IκBα resynthesis is directly activated by NF-κB through a mechanism that, at least in part, involves increased transcription (9Chiao P. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 10Le Bail O. Schmidt Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 11Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Following its nuclear translocation, NF-κB remains only transiently in the nuclear compartment, redistributing back into the cytoplasm in its inactivated (non-DNA binding) form (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast to its initial translocation, NF-κB inactivation requires protein synthesis (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), indicating termination of NF-κB is an active event. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the timing of NF-κB inactivation coincides temporally with IκBα resynthesis (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells cytoplasmic NF-κB is complexed to many IκB isoforms. In contrast, immediately following TNF-α stimulation, NF-κB is primarily associated only with IκBα (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because IκBα can dissociate DNA-bound NF-κB, and capture it from the nucleus, IκBα apparently plays a role as an initial terminator of NF-κB activity (12Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The role of IκBα in terminating nuclear NF-κB activity has been underscored in studies on iκbα-deficient mice. Following TNF-α stimulation, NF-κB binding is sustained indefinitely in iκbα −/− fibroblasts (13Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt H. Chen C.-H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data implicate the NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop as one mechanism for terminating NF-κB activity. In our previous studies on the mechanism for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in HepG2 hepatocytes, we observed the presence of a robust NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sixty minutes following TNF-α administration, nuclear NF-κB binding activity is completely but only transiently terminated due to IκBα resynthesis and reassociation with Rel A. Termination of NF-κB binding is dependent on new protein synthesis and occurs temporally when IκBα levels peak at 2-fold greater than that observed in control cells. Moreover, termination occurs concomitantly with reassociation of IκBα with Rel A, before detectable resynthesis of any other IκB isoform has occurred (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the resynthesized IκBα continues to be proteolyzed, NF-κB reappears in the nucleus (at a lower level) and persists until other IκB isoforms are resynthesized (14Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In this report, we focus on understanding the detailed mechanism for the NF-κB-IκBα feedback loop because this inhibitory pathway could potentially be modulated by anti-inflammatory therapeutics. We observe that the exaggerated NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop also occurs with the cytokine IL-1α and PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Surprisingly, we found that down-regulation of DAG-sensitive PKC isoforms blocked the rapid kinetics of IL-1α-induced IκBα overshoot resynthesis, implicating a requirement for the phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms PKCα, -βII, or -δ. We further demonstrate that IL-1α requires PKCα to induce IκBα overshoot resynthesis as follows: 1) IL-1α induces translocation and degradation of PKCα; 2) the specific inhibitor of calcium-activated PKC (cPKC) isoforms, Gö 6976, blocks IL-1α-induced but not TNF-α-induced overshoot; and finally, 3) selective inhibition of PKCα expression by antisense oligonucleotide treatment blocks IL-1α-induced but not TNF-α-induced overshoot. The role of PKCα is independent of IκBα transcription, as IL-1 induces equivalent IκBα mRNA levels in the presence of PKC inhibitors. These observations indicate a role for activated PKCα in modulating IL-1α-induced NF-κB-IκB autoregulatory feedback loop and identifies PKCα as a target for manipulating the inflammatory response in hepatocytes. The human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Recombinant human TNF-α (30 ng/ml), IL-1α (4 ng/ml), or PMA (1 μm) were added in serum-free culture medium, and cells were incubated for the indicated periods at 37 °C. For pretreatments, 3 μm bisindolylmaleimide I (Gö6850), 3 μm Gö 6976, or 0.2 μmcalphostin C were added in medium for 30 min, 30 min, or 6 h, respectively, prior to stimulation. The calcium-activated PKC (cPKC) and novel PKC (nPKC) isoforms in HepG2 cells were down-regulated by treatment with 0.5 μm PMA for 20 h at 37 °C, followed by a standard recovery period of 3 h in the normal growth medium for TNF receptor expression (15Young S.

All above chemicals were obtained commercially (Calbiochem). −346/+ 18 base pairs of the human IκBα promoter driving luciferase reporter was constructed. IκBα-specific primers, 5′-TCAGGATCCGACGACCCCAATTCAAATCG-3′ and 5′-CGGAAGCTTGTGGGCTCTGCAGCGCCG-3′ were used in the polymerase chain reaction with HepG2 genomic DNA as a template under standard conditions (17Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Following purification of the 364-base pair product, the fragment was restricted with unique BamHI andHindIII sites (underlined) and ligated into the same sites in the promoterless luciferase reporter pOLUC (18Brasier A.R. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 9.6.10-9.6.13Google Scholar). The sequence was confirmed by automated sequencing and purified using ion exchange chromatography prior to transfection. Rel A expression plasmid was constructed by ligating the BamHI/HindIII fragment of the human Rel A cDNA into the expression plasmid pEGFP-C1. Expression vectors for the full-length cDNAs encoding human PKCα and -βII were cloned into the appropriate episomal expression vectors in the antisense orientation (19Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense PKCα was generated by excision of the full-length PKCα cDNA from pGEM4 with KpnI (5′) and HindIII (3′) and subsequent directional cloning into the KpnI and HindIII sites of pREP10. Antisense PKCβII was generated by excision of the full-length PKCβII cDNA in pBlueBac with BamHI andKpnI and cloned into the BamHI andKpnI sites of pMEP4 in the antisense orientation. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) into triplicate 60-mm plates with 3 μg of IκBα/Luc reporter, 1 μg of SV40 driven alkaline phosphatase internal control, and 4 μg of either antisense PKCα plasmid or pREP4 vector according to manufacturer's recommended protocol. After 48 h, cells were stimulated with ligand for 3 h and harvested for the measurement of luciferase and alkaline phosphatase activities. Luciferase activity was determined by subtracting machine background and normalizing each plate to alkaline phosphatase activity. Fold induction was calculated by dividing treatment values by control. For the transient expression of Rel A, antisense PKCα or -βII in HepG2 cells, a mixture of 2.5 μg of DNA and 20 μl of Lipofectin was added to each 60-mm plate. Cells were harvested at 48 h for immunoblot analysis. Antisense PKCβII stable transfection was performed using 25 μg of DNA and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE for each 100-mm plate. After 42 h, cells were cultured in 200 μg/ml hygromycin-containing growth medium for 2 months with medium change twice each week. The pMEP4 vector was taken as control. For the antisense down-regulation of PKCα, phosphorothioate-modified PKCα antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN, sequence 5′-GTTCTCGCTGGTGAGTTTCA -3′) and scrambled version (5′-GGTTTTACCATCGGTTCTGG-3′ obtained from Genemed Biotechnologies, South San Francisco, CA) were introduced into HepG2 cells as described (20Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, transiently transfected cells were isolated following cotransfection with 5 μg of plasmid CMV.IL2R encoding the IL-2 receptor. Transient transfectants in 100-mm plates (108 cells) were purified by adding anti-human CD25 (Caltag) and captured on magnetic beads conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dynabeads, Dynal Inc.) as described (21Padmanabhan R. Howard T. Gottesman M. Howard B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol.

For cytosol and particulate fractionation, HepG2 cells were incubated in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate) for 5 min on ice. Lysis was completed in a Dounce homogenizer and verified by microscopic examination. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by low speed centrifugation, and supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 55Ti rotor. The resultant supernatants were taken as cytosolic extract, and pellets were resuspended with the equal volume of 1% Nonidet P-40-containing hypotonic buffer as particulate extract. All extracts were normalized for protein amounts determined by Coomassie G-250 staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad). For the purification of nuclei, HepG2 cells were resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After 10 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. After discarding the supernatant, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (Buffer A with 1.7 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The purified nuclear pellet was then incubated in Buffer C (10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 400 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) with frequent vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant is saved for nuclear extract. Both of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were normalized for protein amounts determined by Coomassie G-250 staining. EMSAs were performed as described previously with minor modifications (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 40,000 cpm of32P-labeled APRE WT duplex oligonucleotide probe and 2 μg of poly(dA-dT) in a buffer containing 8% glycerol, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a final volume of 20 μl, for 15 min at room temperature. The complexes were fractionated on 6% native polyacrylamide gels run in 1× TBE Buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2.0 mm EDTA), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C. Competition was performed by the addition of 100-fold molar excess nonradioactive double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor at the time of addition of radioactive probe. The sequences of the APRE double-stranded oligonucleotides are shown in Oligonucleotide APRE WT, M2, and M6.

Membranes were blocked in 8% milk and immunoblotted with the affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for either IκBα (reactive with amino acids 297–317), Rel A (reactive with amino acids 3–19), NF-κB1 (reactive with amino acids 350–363), PKCα (reactive with amino acids 651–672), PKCβII (reactive with amino acids 657–673), PKCδ (reactive with amino acids 554–673), PKCε (reactive with amino acids 723–737), or PKCζ (reactive with amino acids 557–592). Anti-PKCδ and -ζ antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., and all others were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immune complexes were detected by binding donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) followed by reaction in the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 50 μg of total cellular RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells using acid guanidinium/phenol extraction (RNazol B, Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX), fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, capillary-transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom), and prehybridized for 4 h in hybridization buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin) at 65 °C. The membrane was hybridized with 1 × 106 cpm 32P-IκBα cDNA probe per ml overnight in the same buffer, washed three times (20 min each) with 1% SDS-containing phosphate buffer at 65 °C, and exposed to X-AR film for 24–48 h. For the 18 S RNA hybridization, the same membrane was reprobed with 32P-labeled human 18 S cDNA and briefly exposed. Bands in the autoradiogram were quantitated by exposure to Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager cassette. A time course of nuclear NF-κB binding activity following TNF-α (30 ng/ml) stimulation in HepG2 cells is displayed in Fig.1 A to demonstrate salient features of the NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop. Three major complexes that bind to the angiotensinogen APRE are seen by EMSA. Of relevance here, the TNF-α-inducible C2 complex is rapidly induced within 15 min of stimulation; we previously reported that C2 binds with NF-κB binding specificity and is supershifted by the addition of Rel A or NF-κB1 antibodies, indicating C2 is a Rel A·NF-κB1 heterodimer (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thirty minutes after TNF-α stimulation, C2 binding begins to diminish, and by 60 min, it is completely abolished (at subsequent times C2 binding reappears at a lower level as a result of ongoing IκBα proteolysis before the resynthesis of IκBβ). Also in Fig. 1 A (bottom), cytoplasmic IκBα abundance is determined by Western immunoblot under conditions where we have shown that the IκBα signal is linear to input protein (23Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Han Y. Elliott T. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4849-4857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκBα, present in unstimulated cell cytoplasm, completely disappears 15 min following TNF-α administration. At 30 min following TNF-α stimulation, IκBα begins to be resynthesized, and resynthesis peaks after 60 min to levels ∼2-fold greater than that observed in control cells. In previous studies, at 60 min, all of the resynthesized IκBα is associated with Rel A as determined by nondenaturing coimmunoprecipitation assay, and inhibition of its resynthesis blocks the 60 min termination of C2 binding (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In comparison to that produced by TNF-α, we next determined whether the phenomenon of IκBα overshoot resynthesis occurs following treatment with IL-1α (4 ng/ml, Fig. 1 B). IL-1α is a more potent inducer of C2 complex; however, the 60-min nadir in the Rel A·NF-κB1 binding is produced concomitantly with IκBα overshoot resynthesis. The same phenomenon occurs with the PKC activator, PMA (1.0 μm, Fig. 1 C), where a nadir in Rel A·NF-κB1 binding is also seen concomitantly with the IκBα overshoot resynthesis at 60 min. Together, these data indicate that the overshoot in IκBα resynthesis is ligand-independent. The mechanism underlying the overshoot in IκBα resynthesis was investigated by measurement of relative changes in steady-state IκBα mRNA abundance by Northern blot analysis (Fig.2). In control cells, IκBα mRNA is detectable as a 1.8-kilobase pair transcript. For each treatment condition, TNF-α (Fig. 2 A) and IL-1α (Fig.2 B), or PMA (Fig. 2 C), IκBα mRNA was detectable in control cells and rapidly depleted at 15 min, perhaps indicating the presence of translation-coupled degradation (24Lofquist A.K. Mondal K. Morris J.S. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, IκBα mRNA was robustly increased at 60 min, a time point when the peak in IκBα resynthesis occurs, and gradually decays over the next 5 h. These data indicate that the IκBα overshoot resynthesis is dependent on the enhanced expression of IκBα mRNA. Other studies have shown that cytokines are potent activators of IκBα expression through a mechanism dependent on NF-κB translocation (9Chiao P. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 11Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13551-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm this effect in HepG2 cells, the effect of transactivator subunit (Rel A) expression on IκBα abundance was determined in transient overexpression assays. We observed that Rel A expression strongly induced IκBα protein abundance (Fig. 2 D), indicating that NF-κB is sufficient for activation of the autoregulatory feedback loop. Because both TNF-α and IL-1α cytokines have been shown to activate PKC activity (16Meichle A. Schutze S. Hensel G. Brunsing D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8339-8343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the PKC dependence for IκBα overshoot resynthesis. For this, DAG-sensitive PKC isoforms were down-regulated by chronic exposure to PMA prior to cytokine stimulation (Fig.3). Following 15 min stimulation with either TNF-α or IL-1α, Rel A·NF-κB1 binding was strongly induced and IκBα proteolyzed, indicating signals necessary for initial Rel A·NF-κB1 translocation are PKC-independent (16Meichle A. Schutze S. Hensel G. Brunsing D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8339-8343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, we observed the 60-min nadir in Rel A·NF-κB1 was eliminated by PKC down-regulation for either cytokine. Moreover, in PKC down-regulated cells, although IκBα resynthesized, its reaccumulation was gradual, without exceeding control levels at the 60-min time point. As expected, acute exposure of PKC down-regulated cells to PMA produced no induction of Rel A·NF-κB1 binding activity or IκBα proteolysis (Fig. 3 C). These data indicate a requirement for PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms for the rapid kinetics of TNF-α and IL-1α-induced IκBα resynthesis. Following PKC activation, cytosol-particulate (membrane) redistribution and degradation occurs. To tentatively identify PKC isoforms involved in IκBα resynthesis, the effect of cytokines on subcellular distribution of various PKC isoforms was determined. At various times following cytokine stimulation, HepG2 cells were fractionated into cytosolic and particulate fractions by ultracentrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”), and PKC isoform abundance was determined by Western immunoblot (Fig.4 A). Unstimulated HepG2 cells express cPKC isoforms, PKCα and PKCβII, the nPKC isoforms, PKCδ and PKCε, and the atypical PKC (aPKC) isoform PKCζ (Fig.4 A) (26Ducher L. Croquet F. Gil S. Davy J. Feger J. Brehier A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All of these isoforms were distributed in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions, except PKCβII (which was primarily distributed in the particulate fraction). Cytokine-induced changes were observed for PKC isoforms α, δ, and ζ. Although TNF-α had no consistent effect on cytosolic PKCα, IL-1α induced rapid cytosolic PKCα degradation, initially detectable after 15 min stimulation. Treatment with either TNF-α or IL-1α induced translocation of PKCα to the particulate fraction within 5 min after stimulation. In contrast to TNF-α, IL-1α also induced particulate PKCα degradation after 15 min of stimulation. Taken together, these data indirectly indicate that IL-1α is a potent activator of PKCα. No significant effect by either cytokine was seen on particulate PKC"
https://openalex.org/W2006090557,"Abstract The relationship between glucokinase (GK) and glucose-stimulated metabolism, and the potential for metabolic coupling between β cells, was examined in isolated mouse islets by using a recombinant adenovirus that expresses Cre recombinase (AdenoCre) to inactivate a conditional GK gene allele (gk lox). Analysis of AdenoCre-treated islets indicated that the gk lox allele in ∼30% of islet cells was converted to a nonexpressing variant (gk del). This resulted in a heterogeneous population of β cells where GK was absent in some cells. Quantitative two-photon excitation imaging of NAD(P)H autofluorescence was then used to measure glucose-stimulated metabolic responses of individual islet β cells fromgk lox/lox mice. In AdenoCre-infected islets, approximately one-third of the β cells showed markedly lower NAD(P)H responses. These cells also exhibited glucose dose responses consistent with the loss of GK. Glucose dose responses of the low-responding cells were not sigmoidal and reached a maximum at ∼5 mmglucose. In contrast, the normal response cells showed a sigmoidal response with an K catS0.5 of ∼8 mm. These data provide direct evidence that GK is essential for glucose-stimulated metabolic responses in β cells within intact islets and that intercellular coupling within the islet plays little or no role in glucose-stimulated metabolic responses."

https://openalex.org/W2073579223,"Previously, we reported that in papilloma-producing 308 mouse keratinocytes, the tumor promoter okadaic acid, a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, increased binding of activator protein 1 (AP-1) to a consensus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (Rosenberger, S. F., and Bowden, G. T. (1996) Oncogene12, 2301–2308). In this study, we investigated the correlation between AP-1 DNA binding and transactivation and examined molecular mechanisms involved in this process. Using a luciferase reporter driven by region −74 to +63 of the human collagenase gene, we demonstrated induction of AP-1-mediated transcription following okadaic acid treatment. By performing in vitro kinase assays, we found elevated activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The ERK-1/2-specific inhibitor PD 98059 completely abrogated okadaic acid-induced AP-1 transactivation without altering AP-1 expression, DNA binding, or complex composition. Phosphorylation analyses indicated that inhibition of ERK-1/2 decreased okadaic acid-elevated phosphorylation of JunD and FosB. To further examine the role of JunD and FosB in okadaic acid-induced AP-1 transactivation, we generated fusion proteins of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and the transactivation domain of either JunD or FosB.

Okadaic acid is a polyether compound of a C38 fatty acid and is produced by certain dinoflagellates that concentrate in marine sponges and shellfish. It is the major toxic component responsible for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (1Tachibana K. Scheuer P.J. Tsukitani Y. J. Am. Chem.

Okadaic acid is also a potent tumor promoter in mouse skin initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (7Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Yoshizawa S. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K.

Tumor promoters lead to alterations in gene expression modulating biological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, which are involved in expansion of “initiated” cells and tumor development. Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors that bind to specific cis-elements in the promoter region of genes, and these factors either induce or repress their transcription. Several lines of evidence indicate the transcription factor complex AP-1 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein 1; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ATF-2, activating transcription factor 2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEM, minimal essential medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein 1; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ATF-2, activating transcription factor 2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEM, minimal essential medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol. as a critical component in epidermal tumor development in mouse skin. In this system, elevated AP-1 activity has been correlated with increased neoplastic transformation. In mouse epidermal JB6 cells, AP-1 activity increases with progression from a tumor promotion-resistant to a tumor promotion-sensitive phenotype (8Dong Z. Watts R.G. Sun Y. Zhan S.N Colburn N.H. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 359-364PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor promoters stimulate AP-1 expression and modulate AP-1-regulated gene expression in cultured mouse keratinocytes and in mouse skin (9Holladay K. Fujiki H. Bowden G.T. Mol. Carcinog. 1992; 5: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). More direct evidence for a causative role of AP-1 activation in tumor promotion comes from the finding that acquisition of a tumor promotion-resistant phenotype is consistent with a loss of responsiveness to tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activation (10Bernstein L.R. Bravo R. Colburn N.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1992; 6: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, down-regulation of AP-1 by “anti-tumor promoters” such as aspirin and aspirin-like salicylates (11Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or retinoic acid (12Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) correlates with inhibition of tumor promoter-induced transformation and tumor development. The same effects are observed when AP-1 activity is blocked by the dominant-negative c-Jun mutant TAM67 (13Dong Z. Crawford H.C. Lavrovsky V. Taub D. Watts R. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of c-Jun leads to increased neoplastic transformation (14Watts R.G. Ben-Ari E.T. Bernstein L.R. Birrer M.J. Winterstein D. Wendel E. Colburn N.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1995; 13: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transcription factor AP-1 (15Karin M. Liu Z.G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar) is a dimeric complex formed by Jun or Jun and Fos proteins and binds to a promoter element that is referred to as the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (TRE). There are three different Jun proteins, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD, and four different Fos proteins, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2. AP-1 activity is regulated at various levels, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to increased AP-1 expression and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and oxidation/reduction, altering DNA binding affinity and transactivation potential. Since DNA binding affinity and transactivation potential are different for the various AP-1 proteins, AP-1 activity is also determined by its composition. AP-1 composition, on the other hand, is dependent not only on the sequence of the actual TRE, but also on the sequence of adjacent bases (16Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we presented experimental evidence that in the papilloma-producing mouse keratinocyte cell line 308, the principal mechanism of okadaic acid-stimulated AP-1 DNA binding activity is increased AP-1 expression (17Rosenberger S.F. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2301-2308PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we were able to show that this increased AP-1 expression is at least partly due to increased AP-1 transcription. This increased AP-1 transcription could be the result of post-translational modifications of transcription factors regulating AP-1 gene expression. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been discussed as important mediators of signal transduction regulating gene expression, and activation of these enzymes has been implicated in altered phosphorylation of several transcription factors, including Elk-1 (18Marais R.

MAPKs are serine-threonine kinases that are activated in response to extracellular stimuli by a phosphorylation cascade involving multiple kinases. To date, there are three distinct groups of MAPKs: ERK-1/2, JNKs/stress-activated protein kinases, and p38 MAP kinases. ERK-1/2 is predominantly stimulated by mitogens and hormones, inducing either proliferation and cell growth or differentiation (21Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). JNKs/stress-activated protein kinases and p38 MAP kinases are considered part of stress response pathways mediating inhibition of proliferation or cell death (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to test whether okadaic acid-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity correlated with increased AP-1 transactivation and to determine the role of MAPKs in this process. Such studies might advance our understanding of the complex process of tumor development and could help to develop molecular and pharmacological tools to manipulate neoplastic cell growth. The papilloma-producing 308 mouse keratinocytes were kindly provided by Dr. Stuart H. Yuspa (23Strickland J.E. Greenhalgh D.A. Koceva-Chyla A. Hennings H. Restrepo C. Balaschak M. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 2.5% calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 7.5% CO2. For experiments, cells were grown to 75–90% confluency. Before treatment, cells were washed once with serum-free MEM. Cells were treated with okadaic acid (sodium salt, LC Laboratories) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide added to serum-free MEM to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml; controls were treated with equivalent amounts of Me2SO (0.01%, v/v). In the indicated experiments, prior to the addition of okadaic acid/Me2SO, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 50 μm PD 98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone, Alexis Corp.), a specific inhibitor of the ERK-1/2 activators MEK-1/2, dissolved as 50 mm stock in Me2SO; controls were treated with Me2SO (0.1%, v/v). To study TRE-dependent transactivation, a luciferase reporter construct driven by region −74 to +63 of the human collagenase gene containing a TRE was used. This construct was kindly provided by P. Brown and L. M. Yang. To determine the role of JunD and FosB in okadaic acid-mediated TRE-dependent transactivation and to analyze the involvement of ERK-1/2-mediated phosphorylation in this process, we generated the fusion protein constructs pBindJunD and pBindFosB. pBindJunD was generated by PCR using 30 ng of upstream sense primer 5′-CGAACGCGTCGGGGGAGGTGGGGATGGAAAC-3′ (mismatches shown in boldface; base pairs 9–39; GenBankTMX15358), creating a MluI site, and 150 ng of downstream antisense primer 5′-GCACTGGTACCGCGGCGAAAGCCACGGTGG-3′ (base pairs 633–662), creating an Acc65I site. PCR was carried out in 50 μl of UlTma buffer with 50 μmdNTPs, 2 mm Mg2+, 15 ng of junD-KSBluescript (XHJ-12.4, American Type Culture Collection 63024), and 6 units of UlTma polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) (35 cycles for 1 min at 98 °C and 2 min at 73 °C). The PCR product was digested with MluI andAcc65I, gel-purified, and ligated into theMluI/Acc65I-linearized pBind plasmid (Promega), creating a fusion product of the Gal4-binding domain and the JunD transactivation domain. pBindFosB was generated by PCR using 30 ng of upstream sense primer 5′-GGCTGCAAGAACGCGTACGAAGAGGGG-3′ (base pairs 1862–1888; GenBankTMX14897), creating aMluI site, and 30 ng of downstream antisense primer 5′-CCCTCGCGGCCGCATCTTCCTCCTCC-3′ (base pairs 2260–2285), creating a NotI site. PCR was carried out in 60 μl of UlTma buffer with 50 μm dNTPs, 1.6 mm Mg2+, 15 ng of fosB-pGem1 (kindly provided by R. Bravo), and 6 units of UlTma polymerase (35 cycles for 1 min at 97 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The PCR product was digested with MluI and NotI, gel-purified, and ligated into theMluI/NotI-linearized pBind plasmid, creating a fusion product of the Gal4-binding domain and the FosB transactivation domain. 308 cells were transiently transfected usingN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate liposomal transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). Cells (1–1.5 × 105) were seeded in a six-well plate and transfected after 24 h under serum-free conditions with 5 μg of the human collagenase TRE-luciferase construct or 5 μg of the various pBind constructs together with 5 μg of the pG5luc luciferase reporter containing five Gal4-binding sites upstream of a minimal TATA box fused to the luciferase gene (Promega). After 12 h, cells were transferred to serum-containing MEM. After another 12 h, the cells were treated. At various times, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT, and protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad DC reagent. 180 μl of assay buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm K3PO4, 15 mmMgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm ATP) were added to 40 μg of protein, and the luminescence reaction was initiated in a Monolight 2010 luminometer with the injection of 100 μl of 0.2 mmd-luciferin (in 25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 2 mm DTT). After 2 s, emission was integrated over a 10-s interval and expressed as relative light units. Cells were lysed in 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 100 μg of protein were incubated with phospho-specific ERK-1/2 antibody, phospho-specific JNK antibody, or phospho-specific p38 MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 3 h and washed twice in the lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2). Beads were suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer with 100 μm ATP and 0.5 μg of substrate (ERK-1/2: Elk-1, New England Biolabs Inc.; JNK: c-Jun, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and p38 MAPK: ATF-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) and resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies for the different substrates (New England Biolabs Inc.). Cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and once with buffer A (10 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, and 0.5 mm DTT). Cells were scraped, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C, and lysed in buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at 4 °C. Crude nuclear protein extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C; resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT; and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted 1:6 with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT. The protein concentrations of the extracts were determined with Bio-Rad reagent. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled by incorporation of [32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) into the 5′-overhangs of the annealed human collagenase TRE oligonucleotide 5′-gcttcaTGAGTCAgacacc-3′ with Klenow DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide binding assay was performed by mixing 1 × 105 cpm probe with 5 μg of nuclear protein extract in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gel shift buffer (10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 4% glycerol) at room temperature for 30 min. In antibody clearing experiments, various amounts of antibodies specific for the various Jun and Fos proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were preincubated with nuclear extracts at room temperature for 2 h prior to the binding assay. An antibody specific for Nm23-H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a control; volumes were adjusted with antibody buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.2% gelatin) containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. DNA-binding complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide and 1× Tris borate electrophoresis buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) gels. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −80 °C for 2–96 h using an intensifying screen. 20 μg of crude nuclear extract were boiled in SDS sample buffer and resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membrane (Millipore Immobilon P) by electroblotting at 50 V at 4 °C for 12–16 h using a transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody was diluted 1:1000 (c-Fos, Fra-1, and Fra-2) or 1:3000 (JunB, JunD, and FosB) in dry milk/TBST and added. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times with TBST. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chains; New England Biolabs Inc.) was added at a dilution of 1:2000 in 5% dry milk/TBST. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times with TBST. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the Phototope®-HRP Western blot Detection kit (New England Biolabs Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (7 × 105) were seeded in a 10-cm plate. After 48 h, cells were treated and, during the last hour of the treatment following incubation in phosphate-free MEM for 1 h, labeled with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate). The lysates were precleared with 50% protein A-Sepharose beads in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal counts (1 × 108 cpm) or equal amounts (250 μg) of protein were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of AP-1 antibodies with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h and washed three times in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% sucrose and twice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Previously, we reported that in papilloma-producing 308 mouse keratinocytes, okadaic acid increases AP-1 binding to a consensus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (17Rosenberger S.F. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2301-2308PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze whether this okadaic acid-induced increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity results in increased AP-1 transactivation, we transiently transfected 308 cells with a luciferase reporter construct driven by region −74 to +63 of the human collagenase gene containing a TRE. We treated the transfected cells for various times with 100 ng/ml okadaic acid or with the solvent Me2SO. Crude cellular extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. The results are shown in Fig. 1. 308 cells showed a basal luciferase activity that was significantly increased by okadaic acid. The okadaic acid-induced increase in luciferase activity was already detectable at 4 h and gradually increased further at 6 and 12 h. The level of induction was 1.6 ± 0.3-fold at 4 h, 3.1 ± 1.1-fold at 6 h, and 11.2 ± 3.0-fold at 12 h. Through their ability to phosphorylate transcription factors and modulate their activity, MAPKs have established themselves as key regulators of gene expression. To test whether okadaic acid-increased AP-1-mediated gene expression correlates with increased MAPK activity, we isolated cellular protein from exponentially growing 308 cells that had been treated with 100 ng/ml okadaic acid or with the solvent Me2SO. Using phospho-specific antibodies for the three groups of MAPKs (ERK-1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK), the activated forms of these kinases were immunoprecipitated. We then performed in vitro kinase assays with recombinant proteins using their major substrates: Elk-1 for ERK-1/2, c-Jun for JNK, and ATF-2 for p38 MAPK. The phosphorylated forms of these substrates were detected by Western blot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig.2, all three MAPKs were efficiently activated by okadaic acid. Okadaic acid stimulated ERK-1/2 activity starting at 1 h and progressively increasing up to 12 h (Fig.2 A). For JNK, a high basal activity was observed. Treatment with okadaic acid led to a further increase in JNK activity. This increase was detectable at 1 h and did not change significantly throughout the time course (Fig. 2 B). Okadaic acid-mediated stimulation of p38 MAP kinase was detectable within 2 h, reached a maximum at 4 h, and remained constant up to 12 h (Fig.2 C). To further investigate the role of MAPKs in okadaic acid-mediated AP-1 activation, we tested whether the observed increases in AP-1-dependent transcription are a direct result of MAPK activation. To achieve this goal, we transiently transfected 308 cells with the human collagenase TRE-luciferase construct and inhibited ERK-1/2 activity with PD 98059, which has been described as a specific inhibitor of the ERK-1/2-activating kinases MEK-1/2 (25Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The transfectants were treated with this inhibitor for 1 h prior to the addition of 100 ng/ml okadaic acid. At various times, crude cellular extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined. To assure that, under the experimental conditions used, PD 98059 inhibited ERK-1/2 in our system, cellular protein was isolated from control cells and analyzed for ERK-1/2 activity. Activated ERK-1/2 was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates, and in vitrokinase assays with recombinant Elk-1 as exogenous substrate were performed. As shown in Fig.3 A, PD 98059 inhibited basal ERK-1/2 activity totally. Okadaic acid-induced ERK-1/2 activity was completely inhibited at 4 h, whereas at 6 and 12 h, a low amount of ERK-1/2 activity was still detectable. As a result of this inhibition, the effect of okadaic acid on AP-1-mediated transcription was almost completely abrogated. Induction levels of okadaic acid-treated cells over Me2SO-treated controls dropped from 3.1 ± 1.1-fold to 1.5 ± 0.5-fold at 6 h and from 11.2 ± 3.0-fold to 1.6 ± 0.4-fold at 12 h (Fig.3 B). Increased AP-1 expression not only has been found to be a prerequisite for okadaic acid-increased AP-1 DNA binding in 308 cells (17Rosenberger S.F. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2301-2308PubMed Google Scholar), but is also the predominant mechanism of ERK-1/2-mediated AP-1 activation (26Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). For this reason, we examined whether okadaic acid-induced increases in AP-1 expression are dependent on ERK-1/2 activity. To address this question, we inhibited ERK-1/2 activity with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD 98059; treated the cells with 100 ng/ml okadaic acid or Me2SO for 6 h; isolated crude nuclear extracts; and performed Western blot analyses for c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2. As shown in Fig.4, inhibition of ERK-1/2 did not lead to any significant changes in the steady-state levels of the various AP-1 proteins. Since okadaic acid-induced accumulation of AP-1 proteins occurs through an ERK-1/2-independent pathway, we then considered the possibility that ERK-1/2 activity is responsible for post-translational modifications of AP-1 proteins, increasing their DNA binding activity. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays of crude nuclear extracts from exponentially growing 308 cells that had been pretreated for 1 h with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD 98059 prior to the addition of 100 ng/ml okadaic acid or Me2SO. At 4, 6, and 12 h, TRE binding activity was analyzed using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide of the human collagenase promoter including the TRE. The results are presented in Fig.5. Basal and okadaic acid-increased TRE DNA binding activities were not compromised by inhibition of ERK-1/2. In contrast, at 4 h, inhibition of these MAPKs induced an increase in DNA binding activity. Since we could not demonstrate a causative relationship between ERK-1/2 activation and increased AP-1 DNA binding, we then hypothesized that ERK-1/2 may increase AP-1-dependent transactivation by modifying interactions between AP-1 proteins and/or between AP-1 proteins and AP-1 inhibitors such as IP-1 (27Auwerx J. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 983-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and Jif-1 (28Monteclaro F.S. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6726-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Those altered interactions could then lead to changes in the composition of AP-1 complexes and allow, without altering their DNA binding affinity, for the formation of complexes with higher transactivation potential. To address this idea, we used antibody clearing experiments to analyze the composition of AP-1 complexes bound to the human collagenase TRE oligonucleotide. Nuclear extracts of cells treated for 6 h with okadaic acid with (Fig. 6 B) or without (Fig. 6 A) prior inhibition of ERK-1/2 by the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD 98059 were incubated for 2 h with varying amounts of antibodies for the different Jun and Fos proteins and then analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. An Nm23-H1-specific antibody was used as a control, and protein amounts added to the different samples were adjusted with bovine serum albumin since unspecific inhibition increased with increasing amounts of antibody. The presence of the various AP-1 proteins was evaluated by the ability of the antibodies to form with the AP-1 complexes a more slowly migrating form or a supershift and/or to reduce TRE binding activity. As shown in Fig. 6, JunD and FosB were identified as major components of the AP-1 complexes binding to the human collagenase TRE at 6 h. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 did not alter this composition. Since increased AP-1 expression, increased DNA binding, and formation of more potent AP-1 complexes were excluded as mechanisms of ERK-1/2-mediated AP-1 transactivation, we then tested the possibility of ERK-1/2-induced increases in AP-1 transactivation potential through altered phosphorylation of the major components, JunD and FosB. Cells (pretreated with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD 98059 and treated with okadaic acid or Me2SO for 6 h) were labeled with orthophosphate, and phosphorylation of JunD and FosB was examined by immunoprecipitation analyses. Similar results were obtained when equal counts or equal amounts of protein (data not shown) were immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 7, okadaic acid increased phosphorylation of JunD and FosB. Pretreatment with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor significantly reduced okadaic acid-mediated phosphorylation. To examine the role of JunD and FosB in okadaic acid-induced AP-1 transactivation more closely, we generated fusion proteins of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and the transactivation domain of JunD (pBindJunD) or FosB (pBindFosB) and tested directly the ability of okadaic acid to increase the transactivation potential of these AP-1 proteins. Cells were cotransfected with pBindJunD, pBindFosB, or pBindJunD and pBindFosB and a luciferase reporter construct containing five Gal4-binding sites. As shown in Fig. 8 A, okadaic acid affected JunD- or FosB-mediated transcription only slightly, but substantially increased transcription mediated by a combination of JunD and FosB. Treatment with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD 98059 had no effect on JunD- or FosB-mediated transcription, but resulted in a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction of JunD/FosB-dependent transcription (Fig. 8 B). In this study, we were able to show that in papilloma-producing 308 mouse keratinocytes, the previously reported okadaic acid-increased AP-1 DNA binding to a consensus TRE (17) correlates with increased AP-1 transactivation. Okadaic acid was able to induce transcription of a luciferase reporter construct driven by region −74 to +63 of the human collagenase gene containing a TRE. This result further supports the idea that increased AP-1 activity plays a critical role in epidermal tumor development in mouse skin. Increased AP-1 activity has been suggested as a prerequisite for tumor promoter sensitivity, and further tumor promoter-induced elevation of AP-1 activity as a requirement for benign tumor development (8Dong Z. Watts R.G. Sun Y. Zhan S.N Colburn N.H. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 359-364PubMed Google Scholar). A constitutive increase in AP-1 activity might be necessary for development and maintenance of malignant squamous cell carcinomas (29Domann F.E. Levy J.P. Birrer M.J. Bowden G.T. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar). Although we could show that okadaic acid activates all three families of MAPKs (ERK-1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK), specific inhibition of ERK-1/2 with PD 98059 was sufficient to abrogate okadaic acid-increased AP-1 transactivation. This finding indicates that ERK-1/2 is a critical component in okadaic acid-mediated AP-1 regulation. A similar observation has been made by Frost et al. (30Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), who demonstrated a requirement for ERK-1/2 in AP-1 activation by Ha-Ras, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and serum. ERK-1/2-mediated AP-1 activation appears to occur predominantly at a transcriptional level. c-fos transcription is induced by phosphorylation of Elk-1, which forms, with the dimeric serum response factor, a prebound complex at the serum response element (31Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 18Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could be postulated for induction of other AP-1 genes, e.g. junD and fosB, where Ets-binding sites and serum response elements have been identified and implicated in transcriptional regulation (32Coffer P. de Jonge M. Mettouchi A. Binétruy B. Ghysdael J. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 911-921PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lazo P.S. Dorfman K. Noguchi T. Mattei M.G. Bravo R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports, our data suggest that ERK-1/2 acts through a post-translational mechanism, stimulating the transactivation potential of pre-existing AP-1 complexes by alterations in their phosphorylation pattern. We found that inhibition of ERK-1/2 had only slight effects on overall levels of AP-1 proteins. These minor decreases in AP-1 expression were not sufficient to decrease AP-1 DNA binding activity. Using antibody clearing experiments, we demonstrated that the composition of the AP-1 complexes constituting this DNA binding activity was the same in ERK-1/2 inhibitor-treated and untreated cells. Surprisingly and in contrast to our previous study (17Rosenberger S.F. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2301-2308PubMed Google Scholar), where JunB was identified as major component of the AP-1 complex, JunB did not appear to bind to the human collagenase TRE. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be the use of a different TRE oligonucleotide. In the present study, we used an oligonucleotide for which the sequence was taken from the human collagenase gene to correspond to the sequence in the luciferase reporter construct used for transactivation studies as opposed to the TRE oligonucleotide described by Angel et al. (34Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). As reported by Ryseck and Bravo (16), the various AP-1 proteins bind with different affinities to different oligonucleotides that contain identical AP-1-binding sites, implying that adjacent sequences influence the composition of AP-1 complexes. Our experiments using fusion proteins of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and the transactivation domain of either JunD or FosB demonstrated the ability of okadaic acid to increase the transactivation potential of these AP-1 proteins and directly implicated them in okadaic acid-mediated TRE-dependent transactivation. Although JunD and FosB each by itself acted as transcriptional activators, only a combination of both was effectively inducible by okadaic acid and mediated okadaic acid effects on transcription. These findings indicate that okadaic acid-induced activation of JunD and FosB may require interactions between their transactivation domains. In the Gal4-luciferase reporter, the five Gal4-binding sites are in close proximity, thus very likely allowing for interactions between monomeric bound Gal4-AP-1 fusion proteins that normally occur through heterodimerization. These interactions may be necessary to introduce activating phosphorylations by recruiting okadaic acid-responsive kinases to their respective phosphorylation sites. A similar observation has been made by Kallunkiet al. (35Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), who reported that JunD becomes a substrate for JNK by heterodimerization with c-Jun or JunB that possesses a JNK-docking site. Treatment with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD 98059 significantly reduced okadaic acid-mediated JunD/FosB-dependent transcription. These data, together with our phosphorylation analyses demonstrating that okadaic acid-increased phosphorylation of JunD and FosB was significantly reduced by inhibition of ERK-1/2, suggest a potential role of increased JunD and FosB phosphorylation in okadaic acid-induced AP-1 transactivation and indicate ERK-1/2 as the responsible kinase. In contrast to c-Jun, whose regulation by phosphorylation is well documented, less is known about phosphorylation changes modulating the activity of JunD and FosB. Nikolakaki et al. (36Nikolakaki E. Coffer P.J. Hemelsoet R. Woodgett J.R. Defize L.H.K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar) reported that glycogen-synthase kinase 3 phosphorylates JunD in a region proximal to its DNA-binding domain and attenuates its DNA binding capacity. In contrast, the finding that serum-induced phosphorylation of JunD does not affect its ability to bind DNA provides evidence that phosphorylation may also regulate the transactivation potential of this factor (37Wang H. Xie Z. Scott R.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2639-2647PubMed Google Scholar). Serine 100, homologous to serine 73, one of two serines whose phosphorylation increases the transactivation potential of c-Jun, has been found to be phosphorylated in response to activation of JNKs. In a similar fashion, phosphorylation of several serine residues in the C-terminal transactivation domain of FosB has been shown to increase its transcriptional activity (38Skinner M. Qu S. Moore C. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2372-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In conclusion, these results, together with our previous observations, indicate that in papilloma-producing 308 mouse keratinocytes, okadaic acid stimulates AP-1 activity by two different mechanisms that appear to be mediated by independent signal transduction pathways. Okadaic acid increases TRE DNA binding activity by stimulating expression of AP-1 proteins. This increased TRE DNA binding activity does not necessarily result in increased TRE-dependent transactivation. Further modifications of the pre-existing AP-1 proteins are necessary. In contrast to okadaic acid-increased AP-1 DNA binding activity, which occurs independently of okadaic acid-mediated ERK-1/2 activation, ERK-1/2 activity is required for increased transactivation. We thank Dr. Stuart H. Yuspa for providing the cell line 308, Drs. Powel Brown and Li Min Yang for the TRE-luciferase construct, and Dr. Rodrigo Bravo for the fosB-pGem1 plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W1995564543,"E. coli responds to DNA damage by derepressing the transcription of about 20 genes that make up the SOS pathway. Genetic analyses have shown that SOS induction in response to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks requires LexA repressor, and the RecA and RecBCD enzymes--proteins best known for their role as initiators of dsDNA break repair and homologous recombination. Here we demonstrate that purified RecA protein, RecBCD enzyme, single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein, and LexA repressor respond to dsDNA breaks in vitro by derepressing transcription from an SOS promoter. Interestingly, derepression is more rapid if the DNA containing the dsDNA break has a chi recombination hot spot (5'-GCTGGTGG-3'), suggesting a novel regulatory role for one of the most overrepresented octamers in the E. coli genome."
https://openalex.org/W2000998194,"Transcription of the liver type pyruvate kinase and lipogenesis enzyme genes is induced by high carbohydrate in liver. We have found a novel protein factor in rat liver nuclei that binds to the glucose response element (CACGTG motifs) of the pyruvate kinase gene (Liu, Z., Thompson, K. S., and Towle, H. C. (1993)J. Biol. Chem. 268,12787–12795) and the “insulin response element” of fatty acid synthase gene. The amounts of this DNA-binding protein, termed “glucose response element binding protein” (GRBP) in the nuclear extract, were increased in liver by a high carbohydrate diet and decreased by starvation, high fat, and high protein diet. GRBP also occurs in cytosols of liver and is dependent on carbohydrate. Both the nuclear and the cytosolic GRBP showed similar properties, except the former was more resistant to thermal inactivation than the latter. Kinetics of glucose activation of the cytosolic GRBP in a primary culture of hepatocytes indicated that a half-maximum activation was achieved after 6 h, and glucose concentration required for the maximum activation of the GRBP was approximately 12 mm. Dibutyryl-cAMP, okadaic acid, and forskolin inhibited glucose activation of both GRBP and liver pyruvate kinase transcription. These results suggested that GRBP may be a factor that recognizes the glucose response motif site and may be involved in mediating carbohydrate response of the pyruvate kinase gene. Transcription of the liver type pyruvate kinase and lipogenesis enzyme genes is induced by high carbohydrate in liver.

The liver, the principal site of lipogenesis, is responsible for conversion of excess dietary carbohydrate to triglycerides. A high carbohydrate diet induces the synthesis of several key enzymes involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis, including pyruvate kinase, ATP citrate lyase (ACL), 1The abbreviations used are: ACL, ATP citrate lyase; GRBP, glucose response element binding protein; LPK, liver pyruvate kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; GRE, glucose response element; FAS, fatty-acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; PP2A, protein phosphatase; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Xu-5-P, xylulose-5-P; IRS, insulin-responsive sequence. 1The abbreviations used are: ACL, ATP citrate lyase; GRBP, glucose response element binding protein; LPK, liver pyruvate kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; GRE, glucose response element; FAS, fatty-acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; PP2A, protein phosphatase; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Xu-5-P, xylulose-5-P; IRS, insulin-responsive sequence.

This increased enzyme synthesis is correlated to increased mRNA, resulting from glucose-induced expression of the corresponding genes. Glucose-stimulated liver type pyruvate kinase (LPK) gene expression in liver is mediated through the glucose response element (GRE) that is located within the region −183 to −96 base pairs upstream from the cap site of the LPK gene (Fig. 1) (3Thompson K.S.

Among these factors, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) is the predominant factor of hepatic nuclear extracts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that USF does bind to the carbohydrate or GRE of LPK which is “supershifted” by antibodies against USF (12Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence rule out USF being the GRE-binding protein as follows: (a) the USF-binding site from adenovirus major late promoter was unable to replace the carbohydrate-responsive element of LPK (15Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) when dominant negative forms of USF, which are able to form a heterodimer with endogenous USF, but are unable to bind to DNA, are expressed in hepatocytes, they do not block LPK induction by glucose (16Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); (c) mutant GRE constructs are able to retain glucose responsiveness of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcription yet lose ability to bind USF (16Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, these results rule out USF as the specific carbohydrate-responsive factor that activates LPK gene expression, and thus far such a factor has not been found. Little is known about the nature of the signal transduction pathway for the glucose stimulation of transcription of any of these genes. The possible role of various glucose metabolites, including glucose-6-P (17Prip-Buus C. Perdereau D. Foufelle F. Maury J. Ferre P. Girard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), 3-P-glycerate (18Kang R. Yamada K. Tanaka T. Lu T. Noguchi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and P-enolpyruvate (18Kang R. Yamada K. Tanaka T. Lu T. Noguchi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) etc., has been suggested but not proved. More recently, Doiron et al. (19Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Chen R. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5321-5324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showed that incubation of hepatocyte-derived transformed cells (At3F) with xylitol results in induction of LPK, and they suggest that xylitol is converted to xylulose-5-P (Xu-5-P) inside the cells, which in turn activates LPK transcription. This idea for xylitol feeding is based on the earlier demonstration that Xu-5-P activates specific protein phosphatase (PP2A), which in turn activates the synthesis of hepatic Fru-2,6-P2, the most potent activator of phosphofructokinase, in response to increased glucose (20Nishimura M. Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26100-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nishimura M. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26341-26346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, this Xu-5-P activation of PP2A by glucose happens rapidly, within a few minutes, whereas glucose activation of gene transcription is considerably slower, taking hours. Thus, it is questionable whether the same mechanism of the glucose signaling applies to both short and long term regulation. More recently Mourrieras et al. (22Mourrieras F. Foufelle F. Foretz M. Morin J. Bouche S. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the effect of xylitol (on FAS and S14genes) could be explained by increased glucose-6-P by conversion of Xu-5-P to glucose-6-P. Attempts to identify a signaling metabolite in whole cells where numerous metabolic intermediates are formed from a major substrate such as glucose are futile without knowing the individual steps involved in glucose activation of LPK gene expression. A possibility that Xu-5-P-activated PP2A might be involved in glucose-dependent activation of the LPK transcription prompted us to search for a transcription factor responsible for the glucose signaling. In the present study we report that we found a factor binding to the GRE of LPK in rat liver which is induced by high carbohydrate diet. We examined its DNA binding characteristics and regulation of its activity using cultured hepatocytes. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and poly(dI-dC) from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Okadaic acid was purchased from Calbiochem, and dibutyryl-cAMP and forskolin were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The Muta-Gene M13in vitro mutagenesis kit was from Bio-Rad. Antibody against USF1, USF2, Sp1, c-Myc, and HNF4 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were reagent grade and were obtained from commercial sources. The promoter region between positions −206 and −7 of the LPK gene (3Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8679-8682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using rat kidney genomic DNA as a template with outside primers containing engineeredXhoI and HindIII sites.

Primary hepatocytes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) using collagenase (Life Technologies Inc.) perfusion method (26Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar) and plated in collagen-coated six-well tissue culture plates (Primaria Falcon/Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a density of 1.2 × 106cells/well in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.1 unit/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.; glucose 1.4 mg/dl), and 5.5 mm glucose. After a 6-h attachment period, transfection was performed using synthetic liposome (Lipofectin from Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (27Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4354) Google Scholar). After 12–14 h the media containing the liposome-DNA complex was removed and replaced with glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above and containing either 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose. Cells were then cultured further for 48 h and harvested for luciferase assay (luciferase assay system from Promega/Madison, WI). For preparation of cytosolic extract of hepatocytes, the cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (sodium phosphate, 12 mm, pH 7.4, and 15 mm NaCl) and suspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) (DTT), supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were broken by passing 15 times through a 23-gauge needle. After centrifugation (27,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant solution was immediately assayed. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Hattori et al. (28Hattori M. Tugores A. Veloz L. Karin M. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Livers (∼10 g) were homogenized with three strokes in a Potter homogenizer in 15 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.74 mm spermidine, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmPMSF) containing 0.3 m sucrose. The homogenate was mixed with 2 volumes of cushion buffer (2.2 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.74 m spermidine, 1 mmDTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF), was layered on top of a cushion buffer, and was centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitated nuclei were suspended in 5 volumes of nuclear lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin) and homogenized with 10 strokes of a hand-held Dounce homogenizer. After standing on ice for 30 min and centrifuging at 27,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, polyethylene glycol (PEG; M r 8,000) was added to the supernatant solution to bring PEG to 25% to precipitate proteins in the extract. In some experiments it was necessary to remove USF in the extracts, and for this purpose USF was precipitated with 10% PEG and removed by centrifugation. The remaining protein in the supernatant solution was precipitated with the addition of PEG (25%). The pellet was dissolved in a buffer mixture (20% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mmDTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble materials. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assay was performed as described by Liu et al. (13Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by mixing equal amounts of the complementary single-stranded DNAs in 50 mm NaCl, heating to 70 °C for 15 min, and then cooling to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were labeled with 32P in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were carried out in a reaction mixture in a final volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). A typical reaction mixture contained 40,000 cpm (0.5–1 nm) of the labeled DNA and 5–10 μg of nuclear or cytosolic extracts. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and loaded onto a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresis was run at 200 V at 4 °C in a Tris glycine buffer system for 1–2 h. The gel was dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C. To quantitate the DNA binding the exposed film was scanned using an Alpha-Imager scanner/densitometer (San Leandro, CA). “Supershift” assays were carried out by preincubating the nuclear and cytosolic extracts (7.5 μg) with 2 μg each of anti-USF1, anti-USF2, anti-Sp1, anti-c-Myc antibody, or anti-HNF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature before the binding probes and the gel mobility shift assay. All experiments were performed at least three times. Following 48 h starvation, rats were re-fed NIH lab chow, high sucrose, high fat, or high protein diet for 12 and 24 h. The livers were quickly removed, nuclear and cytosolic extracts prepared, and GRE-binding proteins in the extracts analyzed by gel shift assay. The results showed that a specific binding factor (“band 1”) was present in the nuclear extract in low concentration and was difficult to detect, especially since an intense band later identified as USF was present in these extracts which migrated more slowly than band 1 protein. After precipitation of USF with PEG and subsequent concentration of the remaining extract enabled band 1 was detected more clearly. The results demonstrated that the nuclear extract contained two GRE-binding proteins (bands 1 and 2; Fig.2, Liver), and only the band 1 protein changed with diet, i.e. the protein was extremely low upon starvation, induced by high sucrose diet in 12 and 24 h, and decreased with high fat or high protein diet. On the other hand, band 2 protein was unchanged with starvation or high sucrose diet and appeared to decrease with high protein diet (lane 6). To confirm that the identified GRE-binding protein (band 1) was contained in hepatocytes and not unique to nonparenchymal cells, isolated hepatocytes were examined. Nuclear extract of hepatocytes isolated from livers of rats fed high carbohydrate diet contained a highly intense band corresponding to band 1 and a trace amount of USF (Fig. 2, Hepatocytes). Extracts of hepatocytes isolated from livers of rats fed other diets or starved contained reduced amounts of band 1. These results indicated that band 1 is a hepatocyte-specific nuclear factor responsive to high carbohydrate, but the majority of the band 2 and USF observed in whole liver extracts appeared to be derived from nonparenchymal cells. band 2 protein was, however, absent or too low to be detected in these extracts. A similar DNA-binding protein was present in the cytosol of rat liver (Fig. 2,Liver) and hepatocytes (Fig. 2, Hepatocytes) and showed the same electrophoretic mobility as that of band 1. The cytosolic factor was also induced by high carbohydrate and decreased by starvation, high fat, or protein diet. The functional relevance of band 1 protein for the GRE site of LPK gene was examined by testing the effects of mutating the GRE region on both DNA binding and transcriptional activities. We prepared two mutant oligonucleotides in which one of the E boxes in the palindromic sequences CACGGG (E box 1) or CCCGTG (E box 2) was completely altered (TableI). The mutation of the E box 1 and 2 individually reduced the DNA binding activities of the nuclear GRBP by 53 and 72%, respectively, and those of the cytosolic factor by 62 and 52%, respectively (data not shown). These results indicated that both palindromic sequences are required for the maximum binding. We also prepared mutant oligonucleotides in which the palindromic sequences were systematically altered one base at a time (Table I), and the spacing between these sequence motifs also was altered by one base. Constructs of mutant oligonucleotides were the same as those used previously by Kaytor et al. (16Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to examine the GRE-binding sites in the expression of S14and LPK. The results (Fig.3 A) showed that band 1 binding to most of the mutants was decreased, compared with the wild type DNA, except for M5, M3/5, and Ml. Competitive binding assays also were performed in which unlabeled oligonucleotide DNAs were incubated with the labeled, wild type oligonucleotide in order to test the ability of mutant oligonucleotides to compete for the DNA-binding site. The results were similar to those of the binding experiments in that M5, M3/5, and Ml were the most effective in competing for the binding site (data not shown). In order to test the biological activities of the mutants, the 5′-flanking region containing the LPK promoter (−197 to +12; Fig. 1) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using rat genomic DNA as a template with oligonucleotide primers based on the rat LPK gene sequence (30Cognet M. Lone Y.C. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Marie J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Noguchi T. Yamada K. Inoue H. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14366-14371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A HindIII site at −7 and XhoI site at −206 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using a synthetic oligonucleotide. The LPK promoter was then subcloned into the polylinker of a luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). LPK promoters containing the wild type and various mutant GREs were constructed using oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis, confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the activity of each was determined in primary cultured hepatocytes. The results, as depicted in Fig. 3 B, demonstrated that all the mutant promoters except M5 and M3/5 showed significant loss of ability to activate LPK transcription by high concentration of glucose. M5, containing the perfect consensus CACGTG sequence, showed the highest activity. These results were generally in agreement with the previously published results of Kaytor et al. (16Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) for LPK transcription using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcription system in which only the MLTF site sequence (from −170 to −145) of the LPK promoter DNA was linked to −96 of the rest of the promoter DNA, thus lacking the HNF4 and NF1 sites (Fig. 1). One significant difference was the result of M6 in which they (16Kaytor E.N. Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) showed that this mutant responds to glucose, whereas our result indicated no response. This discrepancy could be due to the lack of the accessory sites such as HNF4 and/or NF1 sites in the promoter they employed, which may influence the glucose response, since these accessory proteins may regulate the transcriptional activity. Thus, the above results demonstrated that bases 1–4 and 6, as well as the spacing between the consensus GRE sequences, were critical for the glucose response, but base 5 may not be. These transcriptional activities were, in general, similar to those of the DNA binding characteristics of band 1 protein, although the effect on the latter was not as striking as the former activities. Important differences were exhibited by M6 and Ml in which the glucose-activated transcription was completely inhibited by the mutation, but the DNA binding activity was unaffected. This discrepancy suggested that an additional factor(s) may be required to confer a higher degree of specificity of LPK transcription induced by glucose. We have termed the band 1 protein as glucose response element binding protein (GRBP) throughout the paper. In order to further examine the specificity of GRBP, DNA binding activities of GRBP for the carbohydrate response elements of S14, FAS, ACC, and ACL genes were determined. All these enzyme promoters contain the consensus CACGTG motifs (Table II). Both the nuclear and cytosolic GRBP showed similar binding characteristics (Fig. 4); GRBP bound FAS/IRS nearly as well as the LPK GRE elements but S14 less strongly. It did not bind to the GREs of ACC, ACL, or FAS. The binding differences were not due only to the consensus sequence (CACGTG), since the DNAs of S14, FAS, and ACC contain the perfect sequence, whereas FAS/IRS contains a sequence CATGTG in which the important third base (for the transcription) is different, yet the DNA was bound. Moreover, none of these GRE elements of the genes are palindromic, unlike the LPK promoter. A possibility that GRBP may bind to the neighboring HNF4 site of LPK gene was examined using a probe LII (32Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (−147 to −124; Fig. 1), which contains the HNF4 site (−145 to −122; Fig. 1) and an additional four bases (GATC) extending into the MLTF site. The results (data not shown) demonstrated that GRBP bound weakly to LII but not at all to the HNF4 site, indicating that GRBP bound only to the MLTF site (−146 at the 3′ end) and not the 5′ region of the HNF4. In addition, immunoreactivity of GRBP toward HNF4 antibodies was determined by gel shift assay. The results (Fig. 5) showed that a heavy band of HNF4 was present in the nuclear extract (Fig. 5,lane 3) which was supershifted after addition of the HNF4 antibodies (lane 4). The remaining band in the antibody-tre"

Unlike p90RSK, p70RSK contains only one kinase domain, which is about 51% identical to N-terminal kinase domain of p90RSK.

Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The scope of these interactions indicate the complexity of the regulation and function of p90RSKs. Although both p70RSK and p90RSK respond to growth factor-related stimuli, quite different mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of these kinases. The p70RSK is rapamycin-sensitive and relies on multisite phosphorylation to be activated (31Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Thomas G. Biochem. Soc.

Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As for p90RSKs, ERK1 and ERK2 were believed to be responsible, at least in part, for their activation (4Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Chung J. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Zhao Y.

Despite the progress in this field, regulation mechanisms and biological functions of these two RSK protein kinase families are still largely unknown.In this study, we reported cloning and characterization of RLPK, a novel protein kinase with two kinase domains. The overall sequence identity of this kinase to p90RSKs is about 37%, which is much lower than that within the p90RSK family (79–82%), suggesting that while it is homologous to p90RSKs, it is not an isoform of p90RSK family. Despite the distinct amino acid sequence of RLPK, we have found similarities in its substrate specificity and activation profile to that of both p90RSKand p70RSK. We demonstrated that the intrinsic activity of recombinant RLPK is not dependent on phosphorylation and cannot be regulated by MAP kinases in vitro. Therefore, RLPK may represent another class of kinase with two kinase domains, and its regulation mechanism and function may differ from that of p90RSK and p70RSK.DISCUSSIONWe have identified and cloned a novel RSK-like protein kinase, RLPK. This protein shows 37% overall identity to p70RSKand p90RSK and has been demonstrated to share similarin vitro substrates to these two families of kinases. Structurally like p90RSKs, RLPK contains two kinase domains. The N-terminal kinase domain of RLPK is homologous to p70RSK and the C-terminal kinase domain shows homology to a group of known MAP kinase-regulated protein kinases. In addition to this two-kinase domain structure, the activation profile of RLPK is also more similar to p90RSK than to p70RSK in that RLPK is insensitive to rapamycin inhibition. However, by contrast, several structural features of RLPK distinguish it from the p90RSK family. First, the overall similarity of RLPK to the p90RSKgroup as a whole is much lower than that within the p90RSKfamily (37% versus 79–82%). Second, RLPK contains an additional 49-amino acid C-terminal serine and threonine-rich tail, which is missing in all isoforms of p90RSKs. Third, although the Thr-581 residue of RLPK falls in the conserved LXTP motif in the T-loop of the C-terminal kinase domain, the residue in the X position is a positively charged lysine. This is unique to all of known MAP kinase-regulated protein kinase, including all members of p90RSKs that have a neutral (methionine) residue instead (Fig. 1 A). These features indicate that RLPK represents a new class of protein kinase rather than being an isoform of p90RSK.RLPK activity was found to be tightly controlled in vivo(Fig. 3 A). However, kinase activity associated with recombinant RLPK was not influenced by phosphorylation with MAP kinase or dephosphorylation with phosphatase. These data argue against our original prediction that RLPK is a MAP kinase-regulated protein kinase. However, if the following assumptions are true, RLPK may still be considered a MAP kinase-regulated protein kinase: 1) pre-existing post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or protease cleavage is required for RLPK to be regulated by MAP kinases; 2) other co-factors are involved in RLPK regulation by MAP kinases. It has been proposed that the two kinase domains in p90RSK comprise different substrate specificities and that the N-terminal domain was believed to be responsible for the phosphorylation of c-Fos and S6 protein (9Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have found that the sequence identity between N-terminal kinase domain of RLPK and p90RSKs is much higher (∼51%) than the overall sequence identity (∼37%). The sequence identity between N-terminal kinase domain of RLPK and that of p70RSK is also 51%. Such high similarity may account for the similar substrate specificity observed among these different groups of kinases. When the C-terminal kinase domain sequence of RLPK and that of the p90RSKs are compared, only 39% sequence identity is found, suggesting this domain in RLPK may differ more from its p90RSK counterpart in its function or regulation mechanism than the N-terminal kinase domain. As we mentioned in the results section, the C-terminal kinase domain of RLPK is similar to MAP kinase-regulated protein kinases. Although we showed that phosphorylation of RLPK by ERK or p38 in vitro had no influence on its activity toward histone 2B, we cannot exclude the possibility that phosphorylation did enhance the kinase activity of the C-terminal kinase domain, and the inability to detect such activation in our kinase assay would be the result of the inability of the C-terminal kinase domain to use histone 2B as substrate. Nevertheless, the role of phosphorylation of RLPK by MAP kinases still needs further investigation.Although RLPK is activated by growth factors, as are p90RSKand p70RSK, the studies using chemical inhibitors indicated that the upstream signal pathways of RLPK differ from both p90RSK and p70RSK. However, the possibility that the different kinase domains phosphorylate specific substrates suggested that the data present in Fig. 3 may only partially represent the activation and regulation of RLPK, since stress stimuli may have increased RLPK activity to substrates other than histone 2B. The partial inhibition of RLPK activation by PD98059 and SB203580 may have also resulted from the use of unsuitable substrate for the kinase assay. A key question to be investigated is the existence and identification of specific substrates for each kinase domain.Crystal structure studies have revealed that some kinases such as ERK2 functioned as dimers and that phosphorylation is required for the dimer formation, which is essential for the kinase normal ligand-dependent relocalization (42Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The two kinase domain structure of RLPK and p90RSK may be functionally equivalent to a dimerized pair of kinase molecules. If this is true, a study of truncated RLPK derivatives containing two kinase domains independently would provide valuable insight into their separate regulation and substrate specificity. Although the independent activities of each kinase domain is important, a cooperative effect between the two kinase domains is also potentially of great interest. Furthermore, as discussed above, the role of post-translational modification of RLPK in kinase relocalization and interaction with other proteins needs to be defined.Addendum—During the preparation of this manuscript, Deaket al. (43Deak M. Clifton A. Lucocq J. Alessi D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) reported the sequence of a human kinase termed MSK1 that is identical to RLPK. Two families of ribosomal S6 protein kinase, p90RSK and p70RSK, have been identified in mammals (1Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These two protein families were collectively called RSK because of their ability to phosphorylate ribosomal S6 protein of the 40 S ribosomal subunit (10Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl.

However, the fact that specific inhibition by rapamycin of the p70RSK but not p90RSK inhibited growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of S6 proteinin vivo demonstrated that p70RSK, rather than any isoforms of the p90RSK, was really responsible for growth-associated phosphorylation of S6 protein (18Price D.J.

Although both p70RSK and p90RSK respond to growth factor-related stimuli, quite different mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of these kinases. The p70RSK is rapamycin-sensitive and relies on multisite phosphorylation to be activated (31Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Thomas G. Biochem. Soc.

Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As for p90RSKs, ERK1 and ERK2 were believed to be responsible, at least in part, for their activation (4Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Despite the progress in this field, regulation mechanisms and biological functions of these two RSK protein kinase families are still largely unknown. In this study, we reported cloning and characterization of RLPK, a novel protein kinase with two kinase domains. The overall sequence identity of this kinase to p90RSKs is about 37%, which is much lower than that within the p90RSK family (79–82%), suggesting that while it is homologous to p90RSKs, it is not an isoform of p90RSK family. Despite the distinct amino acid sequence of RLPK, we have found similarities in its substrate specificity and activation profile to that of both p90RSKand p70RSK. We demonstrated that the intrinsic activity of recombinant RLPK is not dependent on phosphorylation and cannot be regulated by MAP kinases in vitro. Therefore, RLPK may represent another class of kinase with two kinase domains, and its regulation mechanism and function may differ from that of p90RSK and p70RSK. DISCUSSIONWe have identified and cloned a novel RSK-like protein kinase, RLPK. This protein shows 37% overall identity to p70RSKand p90RSK and has been demonstrated to share similarin vitro substrates to these two families of kinases. Structurally like p90RSKs, RLPK contains two kinase domains. The N-terminal kinase domain of RLPK is homologous to p70RSK and the C-terminal kinase domain shows homology to a group of known MAP kinase-regulated protein kinases. In addition to this two-kinase domain structure, the activation profile of RLPK is also more similar to p90RSK than to p70RSK in that RLPK is insensitive to rapamycin inhibition. However, by contrast, several structural features of RLPK distinguish it from the p90RSK family. First, the overall similarity of RLPK to the p90RSKgroup as a whole is much lower than that within the p90RSKfamily (37% versus 79–82%). Second, RLPK contains an additional 49-amino acid C-terminal serine and threonine-rich tail, which is missing in all isoforms of p90RSKs. Third, although the Thr-581 residue of RLPK falls in the conserved LXTP motif in the T-loop of the C-terminal kinase domain, the residue in the X position is a positively charged lysine. This is unique to all of known MAP kinase-regulated protein kinase, including all members of p90RSKs that have a neutral (methionine) residue instead (Fig. 1 A). These features indicate that RLPK represents a new class of protein kinase rather than being an isoform of p90RSK.RLPK activity was found to be tightly controlled in vivo(Fig. 3 A). However, kinase activity associated with recombinant RLPK was not influenced by phosphorylation with MAP kinase or dephosphorylation with phosphatase. These data argue against our original prediction that RLPK is a MAP kinase-regulated protein kinase. However, if the following assumptions are true, RLPK may still be considered a MAP kinase-regulated protein kinase: 1) pre-existing post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or protease cleavage is required for RLPK to be regulated by MAP kinases; 2) other co-factors are involved in RLPK regulation by MAP kinases. It has been proposed that the two kinase domains in p90RSK comprise different substrate specificities and that the N-terminal domain was believed to be responsible for the phosphorylation of c-Fos and S6 protein (9Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have found that the sequence identity between N-terminal kinase domain of RLPK and p90RSKs is much higher (∼51%) than the overall sequence identity (∼37%). The sequence identity between N-terminal kinase domain of RLPK and that of p70RSK is also 51%. Such high similarity may account for the similar substrate specificity observed among these different groups of kinases. When the C-terminal kinase domain sequence of RLPK and that of the p90RSKs are compared, only 39% sequence identity is found, suggesting this domain in RLPK may differ more from its p90RSK counterpart in its function or regulation mechanism than the N-terminal kinase domain. As we mentioned in the results section, the C-terminal kinase domain of RLPK is similar to MAP kinase-regulated protein kinases. Although we showed that phosphorylation of RLPK by ERK or p38 in vitro had no influence on its activity toward histone 2B, we cannot exclude the possibility that phosphorylation did enhance the kinase activity of the C-terminal kinase domain, and the inability to detect such activation in our kinase assay would be the result of the inability of the C-terminal kinase domain to use histone 2B as substrate. Nevertheless, the role of phosphorylation of RLPK by MAP kinases still needs further investigation.Although RLPK is activated by growth factors, as are p90RSKand p70RSK, the studies using chemical inhibitors indicated that the upstream signal pathways of RLPK differ from both p90RSK and p70RSK. However, the possibility that the different kinase domains phosphorylate specific substrates suggested that the data present in Fig. 3 may only partially represent the activation and regulation of RLPK, since stress stimuli may have increased RLPK activity to substrates other than histone 2B. The partial inhibition of RLPK activation by PD98059 and SB203580 may have also resulted from the use of unsuitable substrate for the kinase assay. A key question to be investigated is the existence and identification of specific substrates for each kinase domain.Crystal structure studies have revealed that some kinases such as ERK2 functioned as dimers and that phosphorylation is required for the dimer formation, which is essential for the kinase normal ligand-dependent relocalization (42Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The two kinase domain structure of RLPK and p90RSK may be functionally equivalent to a dimerized pair of kinase molecules. If this is true, a study of truncated RLPK derivatives containing two kinase domains independently would provide valuable insight into their separate regulation and substrate specificity. Although the independent activities of each kinase domain is important, a cooperative effect between the two kinase domains is also potentially of great interest. Furthermore, as discussed above, the role of post-translational modification of RLPK in kinase relocalization and interaction with other proteins needs to be defined.Addendum—During the preparation of this manuscript, Deaket al. (43Deak M. Clifton A. Lucocq J. Alessi D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) reported the sequence of a human kinase termed MSK1 that is identical to RLPK.

Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is presumed to modify its apoptosis-inhibitory function. By utilizing an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic cell line, we examined the structural requirements of Bcl-2 phosphorylation and the correlation of this post-translational modification with its function. In the presence of IL-3, constitutively expressed Bcl-2 was phosphorylated on serine residue(s), and phosphorylated Bcl-2 lost its capacity to heterodimerize with Bax. Whereas the majority of Bcl-2 resided in mitochondria, phosphorylation only affected a minor pool of total Bcl-2 that selectively partitioned into a soluble fraction. Cytosolic targeting of Bcl-2 greatly increased its ratio of phosphorylation. Bcl-2 phosphorylation was reduced during IL-3 deprivation, and its phosphorylation was also delayed after transient cytokine deprivation. This pattern of phosphorylation temporally correlated with the accelerated exit and delayed reentry of Bcl-2-expressing cells into the cell cycle upon transient IL-3 deprivation and subsequent cytokine restimulation. Thus, IL-3-induced phosphorylation of a distinct pool of Bcl-2 may contribute to the inactivation of its antiproliferative function.

The process of apoptosis is executed by a distinct genetic pathway that is apparently shared by all multicellular organisms. The family of Bcl-2-related proteins constitutes a class of apoptosis-regulatory gene products that act at the effector stage of apoptosis. In vertebrates, two functional classes of Bcl-2-related proteins exist that share highly conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; IL-3, interleukin 3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RIPA, radioimmunoprecipitation assay. 1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 domains: (a) antiapoptotic members, including Bcl-2, that inhibit cell death; and (b) proapoptotic members, including Bax, that accelerate apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Reed J.C.

Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2265-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Several gene ablation studies confirm that in vertebrates, the balance between death-promoting and death-repressing members of the Bcl-2 family does indeed contribute a critical checkpoint that determines a cell's susceptibility to an apoptotic stimulus (reviewed in Ref.2Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Beside regulating apoptosis, a number of recent studies demonstrate that Bcl-2-related proteins can also modulate the entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 2Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). For instance, when constitutively expressed in lymphocytes, Bcl-2 significantly delays the response of both B and T cells to a variety of mitogenic stimuli (4Linette G.P. Li Y. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6991-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which Bcl-2 alters cell cycle entry is poorly understood, but mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the apoptosis-inhibitory and antiproliferative effects of Bcl-2 can be genetically separated (8Huang D.C.S. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Cory S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the BH1 or BH2 domains of Bcl-2 (5O'Reilly L.A. Huang D.C.S.

In light of the emerging dual role of Bcl-2 as both an apoptosis- and cell cycle-inhibitory protein, we considered whether phosphorylation selectively alters one function of the molecule in certain cell types. To examine the structural requirements for Bcl-2 phosphorylation and the temporal correlation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation status and its function, we have utilized an IL-3-dependent lymphoid cell line, FL5.12, in which Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis after growth factor withdrawal (19Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar). Of note, IL-3 promotes cell growth by simultaneously stimulating cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. This effect is achieved by receptor engagement-initiated activation of several distinct signal transduction pathways that regulate effector components of these two major cell fates (20Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar,21Miyajima A. Kinoshita T. Wakao H. Hara T. Yoshimura A. Nishinakamura R. Murray R. Mui A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11 Suppl. 3: 418-422PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that in the presence of IL-3, a fraction of constitutively expressed Bcl-2 was phosphorylated on serine residue(s), and this phosphorylated pool of Bcl-2 lost its capacity to heterodimerize with Bax. Whereas the majority of Bcl-2 resided in mitochondria, phosphorylation involved a minor pool of total Bcl-2 that selectively partitioned into a soluble fraction. Cytosolic targeting of Bcl-2 by deletion of its membrane insertion domain greatly increased its ratio of phosphorylation. The reduced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 upon IL-3 deprivation and its delayed rate of phosphorylation upon cytokine restimulation temporally correlated with the accelerated exit and delayed reentry of Bcl-2-expressing cells into the cell cycle. Thus, above a threshold level of Bcl-2 expression, IL-3-induced phosphorylation of a distinct pool of Bcl-2 may represent a selective inactivation mechanism of its antiproliferative function. The IL-3-dependent murine cell line FL5.12, a lymphoid progenitor clone, and all its derivatives were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% WEHI-3B conditional medium as a source of IL-3 (19Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar). To induce apoptosis, FL5.12 cells were washed three times in serum-free medium to remove the growth factor and cultured in the absence or presence of 25 IU/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (Genzyme). mAbs 6C8 (a human Bcl-2-specific hamster mAb; Ref. 19Hockenbery D.M.

Before metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, cells were washed three times in prewarmed, serum-free, methionine-free Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were resuspended at 3–5 × 106 cells/ml in methionine-free Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-dialyzed fetal calf serum with or without 50 IU/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (Genzyme). Metabolic labeling was performed with 40 uCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Translabel; ICN) for the indicated times before lysis. For phosphorylation studies, cells were washed three times in prewarmed, serum-free, phosphor-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were resuspended at 3–5 × 106 cells/ml in phosphor-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% water-dialyzed fetal calf serum with or without 50 IU/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (Genzyme). Metabolic labeling was performed with 100 uCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (ICN) for the indicated times before lysis. All steps of the subsequent immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (22Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar), except that some gels containing 32P-labeled proteins were transferred on polyvinylidine difluoride membrane and immunostained (see below) before autoradiography. Cells were metabolically labeled as described above and lysed in hypotonic buffer (42.5 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) by passaging them four times through a 30-gauge needle. Isotonicity was reestablished by adding an equal volume of hypertonic buffer (242.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Nuclei and unlysed cells were pelleted twice at 200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect the heavy membrane pellet. That supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the final supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction, and the pellet was collected as the light membrane fraction. The heavy membrane pellet was washed twice in H medium (0.25 mm mannitol, 0.075 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin). Both heavy and light membrane pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer and, together with the soluble fraction, were immunoprecipitated with mAb 6C8 as described above. For immunoblots, proteins were electrotransferred at 4 °C on polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore). Filters were blocked for 2 h with 3% non-fat milk in PBS. All additional immunostaining steps were performed in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) at room temperature. Filters were incubated with primary antibody and species-specific biotinylated secondary mAb (1:300) for 2 h. Immunoblots were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (1:1000; Pierce) for 1 h. Filters were washed in PBS-T four times for 5 min between each step and developed with diazobenzidine (Bio-Rad) enhanced with nickel chloride (0.03%). Cell cycle analysis was performed as described previously (25Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were washed in PBS, and the pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome solution (3.4 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.8, 100 μg/ml propidium iodide, 180 units/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 30 mg/ml polyethylene glycol) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The cell suspension was then supplemented with 1 ml of hypertonic solution (356 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 30 mg/ml polyethylene glycol) and stored at least for 6 h at 4 °C before analysis. Propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei were measured and analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 was previously observed in selected cell lines (12May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol.

Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 16Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol.

Also, the structural features of Bcl-2 required for this post-translational modification were not examined in detail. Our studies utilized the IL-3-dependent early lymphoid progenitor murine cell line FL5.12, whose viability and proliferation is maintained by a minimum of 25 IU/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (data not shown). In the absence of IL-3, FL5.12 dies by apoptosis, but overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly extends its survival without maintaining its proliferation (19Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 expression level in these FL5.12-Bcl-2 clones (26Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 27Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar) was approximately the same as that seen in a cell line established from a patient with t(14;18)-bearing follicular B-cell lymphoma or in pre-B cells (19Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar), thus representing physiologically relevant protein levels. Of note, FL5.12 cells do express a significant amount of endogenous Bax as well as a low amount of endogenous Bcl-2 that is insufficient to provide protection against IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis (24Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar). To investigate whether phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is dependent on its capacity to heterodimerize with Bax, FL5.12 clones stably expressing either wild type human Bcl-2 (Bcl-2) or a BH1 substitution mutant of human Bcl-2 (mI-3)(G145A) were examined. This mutant fails to counter apoptosis in FL5.12 cells (26Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) and heterodimerize with Bax in a yeast two-hybrid assay (22Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of FL5.12-Bcl-2 and FL5.12-Bcl-2 mI-3 cells were metabolically labeled for 6 h with either [32P]orthophosphoric acid or [35S]methionine in the presence of recombinant murine IL-3 and subsequently immunoprecipitated with the human Bcl-2-specific 6C8 mAb (19Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar). FL5.12-Bcl-2 and FL5.12-Bcl-2 mI-3 cells contained a comparable amount of [35S)]methionine-labeled (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3) and [32P]orthophosphoric acid-labeled (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 4) proteins. Thus, phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is not dependent on its capacity to dimerize with Bax in FL5.12 cells. Also, phosphoamino acid analysis of Bcl-2 confirmed the IL-3-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 exclusively on serine residue(s) (Fig.1 B), as described previously (12May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In FL5.12 cells, the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 molecule resides predominantly in the mitochondria, whereas the majority of proapoptotic Bax is located in the cytosol in monomeric form (28Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Upon apoptosis induction, cytosolic Bax undergoes a change in its conformation and translocates to mitochondria (28Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 29Hsu Y. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the absence of proapoptotic signals, nonionic detergents, such as Nonidet P-40, are able to induce this conformational change of Bax and permit Bcl-2/Bax dimerization in cell lysates (33Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 34Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To test whether the native conformation of Bcl-2 is altered by its phosphorylation, nonionic detergent-induced dimerization between Bcl-2 and Bax was examined using co-immunoprecipitation experiments on Nonidet P-40 lysates of FL5.12-Bcl-2 cells. To compare the relative efficiency of co-immunoprecipitations with human Bcl-2-specific mAb 6C8 and murine Bax-specific mAb 4D2, [35S]methionine labeling was performed. Parallel co-immunoprecipitations on Nonidet P-40 lysates of FL5.12-Bcl-2 cells revealed a reduced amount of Bcl-2 in anti-Bax 4D2 immunoprecipitates compared with the total amount of Bcl-2 precipitated through the human Bcl-2-specific 6C8 mAb (Fig.2 A). To examine anti-Bcl-2 and anti-Bax mAb immunoprecipitates of [32P]orthophosphoric acid-labeled Nonidet P-40 cell lysates, gels were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes and immunostained with human Bcl-2-specific mAb 124. This immunostaining demonstrated human Bcl-2 expression in FL5.12-Bcl-2 cells in a ratio comparable to that seen in [35S]methionine-labeled samples (data not shown). Autoradiography of the same membrane revealed the expected ∼25-kDa phosphorylated Bcl-2 in the anti-Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates of [32P]orthophosphoric acid-labeled FL5.12-Bcl-2 lysates. In contrast, no corresponding protein could be immunoprecipitated with the anti-Bax 4D2 mAb. The faint ∼25-kDa protein band visible in this lane is likely to represent the [32P]orthophosphoric acid-contaminated light chain of the anti-Bax mAb utilized in the experiment (Fig. 2 B). Thus, Nonidet P-40 is unable to induce dimerization between phosphorylated Bcl-2 and Bax, suggesting a conformational change of Bcl-2 after its phosphorylation. In FL5.12 cells, the majority of Bcl-2 resides in the mitochondria as an integral membrane protein (19Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar, 28Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). A possible consequence of a phosphorylation-induced change in Bcl-2's conformation is a modification of the molecule's intracellular targeting. To explore this idea, subcellular fractionations of FL5.12-Bcl-2 cells were performed as described previously (19Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar, 28Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). As an internal control, we used a C-terminally truncated human Bcl-2 mutant (Bcl-2 ΔTM), in which the last 22 amino acids of the molecule that comprises its membrane insertion domain were removed (27Hockenbery D.M.

Of note, deletion of the membrane insertion domain of Bcl-2 shifts its localization from a membrane-bound form to the cytosol, as shown by both subcellular fractionation (27Hockenbery D.M.

Briefly, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphoric acid in the presence of IL-3 for 6 h and, after the removal of nuclear fractions and unlysed cells, were subfractionated to heavy membrane, light membrane, and soluble cytosolic fractions by differential ultracentrifugation. Heavy membrane fractions enriched in mitochondria and the fraction containing light membranes enriched in endoplasmic reticulum were solubilized with RIPA lysis buffer. These lysates and the remaining soluble S100 fraction representing the cytosol were immunoprecipitated with anti-Bcl-2 6C8 mAb, and the subcellular localization patterns of [35S]methionine- and [32P]orthophosphoric acid-labeled Bcl-2 were compared. The majority of [35S]methionine-labeled Bcl-2 localized to the heavy membrane fraction, with only minor amounts observed in the light membrane and S100 fractions, whereas Bcl-2 ΔTM localized to the S100 fraction (Fig. 3 A, left panels), as described previously (27Hockenbery D.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylated Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 ΔTM were both found almost exclusively in the S100 fraction (Fig. 3 A, right panels). We conclude that whereas the majority of Bcl-2 is localized to the heavy membrane fraction in FL5.12-Bcl-2 cells, the membrane integration of phosphorylated Bcl-2 is compromised. Because phosphorylated Bcl-2 localized to the S100 cytosolic fraction, we next asked whether targeting Bcl-2 to the cytosol by removal of its membrane insertion domain enhances its rate of phosphorylation. To this end, FL5.12-Bcl-2, FL5.12-Bcl-2 mI-3, and FL5.12-Bcl-2 ΔTM cells were labeled with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphoric acid in the presence of IL-3 for 6 h, lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated with the human Bcl-2-specific 6C8 mAb. Immunoprecipitates of [35S]methionine-labeled cell lysates revealed a comparable amount of Bcl-2 expression in all three cell lines (Fig. 3 B, top"

We have purified two proteins that are capable of regulating the formation of this disulfide bond and found them to be members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family. By regulating the formation of the disulfide cross-link, these proteins are capable of regulating the dimerization state of E proteins. PDI-mediated reduction appears to dissociate E protein homodimers and favors heterodimer formation with other basic helix-loop-helix proteins in both a purified protein system and in cellular extracts.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic, helix-loop-helix; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; HMK, heart muscle kinase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser absorption ionization; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NF, nuclear factor; βME, β-mercaptoethanol. proteins are a family of lineage- and development-regulated transcription factors that appear to regulate cell type-specific transcription and differentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 2Kadesch T.

HLH proteins are distinguished by a dimerization domain consisting of two amphipathic α helices linked by a loop segment. The basic domain is responsible for DNA binding and is characteristically rich in the basic amino acids lysine and arginine (4Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H.

This class is exemplified by the Id proteins, which bind to E proteins and prevent dimerization with other bHLH proteins and DNA binding (20Sun X.H. Copeland N.A. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

Although E2A proteins can form functional heterodimers with tissue-specific factors, during B cell differentiation E proteins form homodimers and bind to the μE2, μE4, μE5, and κE2 regions of the immunoglobulin enhancer heavy and light chain enhancers (34Kadesch T.

These dimers form at the transition between the pro-B cell and pre-B cell stages of development and play a critical role in immunoglobulin rearrangement and B cell differentiation as evidenced by the loss of function mutations in mice (33Wilson R.B. Kiledjian M. Shen C.P. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6185-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37Jacobs Y. Xin X.Q. Dorshkind K.

In addition, overexpression of E47 is sufficient to stimulate sterile transcription from the IgH enhancer in fibroblasts and immunoglobulin rearrangement in a pre-T cell (42Choi J.K. Shen C.P.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Restriction of E2A homodimers to the B cell lineage may in part be explained by the formation of a tissue-specific intermolecular disulfide bond that is required for stable homodimer DNA binding (1Benezra R. Cell. 1994; 79: 1057-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Importantly, this disulfide bond is formed in the majority of B cell-specific DNA-binding complexes as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The bond is formed between cysteine residues located at position 570 in the first helical region of the HLH domain. E protein homodimer formation in cells other than pre- and mature B cells is inhibited by the Id proteins, lower E2A gene expression, and an activity that apparently reduces the disulfide bond necessary for E2A homodimer stability at physiologic temperatures (1Benezra R. Cell. 1994; 79: 1057-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Wilson R.B. Kiledjian M. Shen C.P. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell.

We report here the purification and identification of two proteins from HeLa cell extracts which are capable of regulating the E protein dimerization state via a redox mechanism. These proteins are both members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and are capable of reducing a disulfide bond that links E protein homodimers. Reduction of this bond prevents E protein homodimerization and fosters E protein heterodimerization in both a purified protein system and with endogenous bHLH complexes from cell extracts. Thus, the PDI family of redox active proteins is capable of regulating E protein dimerization and may play a role in the B cell developmental pathway. E47, Flag-E47, PDI I, and PDI II were cloned into pET28 (Novagen), expressed in BL21/DE3 Escherichia coli, and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer. Flag-E47 contains the sequence DYKDDDDK consisting of the core Flag epitope tag NH2-terminal to the E47 coding sequence. HMK-E47 was created by removing the NH2-terminal T7 epitope tag from Flag-E47 and replacing it with the sequence RRASV, containing the phosphorylation sequence for bovine heart muscle kinase (HMK). This protein was then radiolabeled as described in Blanar and Rutter (45Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Protein preparations were dialyzed extensively against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmEDTA, and 350 mm KCl. Recombinant Id-1 was cloned into pET19b (Novagen), expressed in E. coli, and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer. PDI I was also prepared from insect cells using the baculovirus system (used in Fig. 3 D) and was the generous gift of A. Attie (University of Wisconsin-Madison). MyoD was the gift of M. Thayer (Oregon Health Sciences University) and was prepared as described previously (46Thayer M.J. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6483-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). MBP-E12 and Hsp-90 fusion proteins were prepared as described (47Shaknovich R. Shue G. Kohtz S. Mol. Cell.

Panel A: upper, reduction activity of fractions eluted from a Q-Sepharose column. The area between thegray lines represents the pooled peak fractions of reduction activity. Protein concentrations of each fraction were determined by Bradford assays and are indicated (♦). In this and all other reduction assays using HMK-E47, reduction activity is indicated by the amount of monomeric E47 generated during reactions as determined by PhosphorImager analysis (■). The y axis is marked in arbitrary PhosphorImager units. Lower, 5 μl of every fourth fraction was resolved by 12% discontinuous SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-PDI monoclonal antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panel B, Qp2 pooled active fractions were incubated with anti-PDI monoclonal antibody (⋄) or anti-T7 epitope monoclonal antibody (Novagen) (■) and depleted using protein A-Sepharose. Depleted fractions were incubated with HMK-E47 for the indicated times at 37 °C. Monomeric E47 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis.

Panel D, HMK-E47 was incubated with 260 ng of baculovirus-produced PDI I at 37 °C for the indicated times. Monomeric E47 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All mobility shift assays with purified proteins were performed as described previously (21Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Protein components were mixed on ice (with or without DTT), incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, transferred to 25 °C for 5 min, and probe DNA was added followed by an additional 5-min incubation at 25 °C. The DNA-binding buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 6% glycerol, and 100 μg/μl poly(dI-dC). For nuclear extracts, identical reaction conditions were used except both DNA binding and electrophoresis were carried out at 37 °C. The upper strand of the oligonucleotides used was as follows: E box (sense), 5′-CCCCAACACCTGCCTGCCTGA-3′; octamer (sense), 5′-GATCCCTGGGTAATTTGCATTTCTAA-3′. HeLa cytoplasmic lysates were prepared from 100 liters of cells from suspension culture according to the procedure of Dignam et al. (49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) as modified by Briggs et al. (50Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Extracts were dialyzed extensively against buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol), frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Nuclear extracts from 3T3 and Namalwa cells were prepared according to the procedure of Schreiberet al. (51Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). RH18 myotube, C2C12 myoblast, and MEL whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (23Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). For purification of PDI II, all chromatographic steps were performed using Bio-Rad Econo Column supports and driven by a Bio-Rad Econo Pump. HeLa cytoplasmic extract (2.5 g) was applied to a 120-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A. The bound protein was eluted with a 1.2-liter gradient of 50–500 mm KCl in buffer A. In this and all subsequent chromatographic steps the protein concentration was monitored by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). The pooled fractions were then dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm MES (pH 6.0), 20 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) and loaded onto a 20-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. DTT was included in dialysis buffer because it was found to prevent spontaneous inactivation of the activity during dialysis. The column was washed using 20 column volumes of buffer B lacking DTT, and protein was eluted using a 200-ml gradient of 20–500 mm KCl in buffer B lacking DTT. The active SP peak was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 20 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT), loaded onto a 4-ml heparin column (Sigma), washed with 40 ml of buffer C lacking DTT, and eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of 20–500 mm KCl in buffer C lacking DTT. For the determination of specific reduction activity, pooled active fractions from each column were incubated with substrate HMK-E47 for 5 min at 37 °C, and the monomeric E47 generated was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of activity required to cause a 25% increase in monomeric E47 during this 5-min incubation. The protein composition of different column fractions was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dye. For Western analysis, 5 μl of every fourth fraction from the Q-Sepharose column was electrophoresed on a 10% discontinuous SDS gel and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose filter. After transfer, the filter was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 5% milk. Primary antibody incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1 ng/ml anti-PDI antibody (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.). After primary antibody binding, the filter was washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:10,000. The filter was then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunodepletions/immunoprecipitations were performed by adding 1 μg of either anti-PDI (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.) or anti-T7 (Novagen) monoclonal antibody to 50 μl of pooled Qp2 fractions. Reactions were incubated for 30 min on ice, and then 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added. Samples were rocked at 4 °C for 30 min, and then beads were collected by a 10-s centrifugation. The immunodepleted supernatants were used for reduction assays. Beads were washed twice with 500 μl of buffer A (above) and resuspended in 20 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol as indicated in the text. Samples were then placed at 95 °C for 5 min before electrophoresis on a 10% discontinuous SDS gel. The protein composition of immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by silver staining (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). For reduction assays samples and fractions were added to 20 ng of E47, Flag-E47, or HMK-E47 substrate and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. SDS loading buffer was then added, and samples were immediately incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Monomeric and dimeric E47 were resolved by discontinuous 7.5% SDS-PAGE. In experiments using HMK-E47 substrate, gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, dried, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. In experiments using E47 and Flag-E47 substrates, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and E47 was detected by Western blot using anti-T7 or anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies, respectively. For protease studies, 2 μg of HeLa cell extract was incubated with the indicated amounts of trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of protease inhibitors (1 ng of leupeptin, 1 ng of antipain, 10 ng of benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 ng of soybean trypsin inhibitor). Treated extracts were then used in the reduction assays described above. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Ponceau S-stained bands were excised, digested in situ with trypsin, and resulting peptides were fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a 0.8-mm Vydac C18 column (52Lui M. Tempst P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Selected peptides were analyzed by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Reflex III; Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) and chemical microsequencing (477A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)(53). 12 tryptic peptides derived from the PDI immunoprecipitation were analyzed by chemical sequencing/matrix-assisted laser absorption ionization mass spectrometry.

Nine tryptic peptides derived from the 57-kDa heparin-agarose protein were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Their predicted sequences (R)TADGIVSHLKK(Q), (K)FVMQEEFSR(D), (K)LSKDPNIVIAK(M), (R)ELSDFISYLQR(E), (K)VDCTANT-NTCNK(Y), (R)FLQDYFDGNLKR(Y), (R)EATNPPVIQEEKPK(K), (R)YLKSEPIPE-SNDGPVK(V), and (R)FAHTNVESLVNEYDDNGEGIILFRPSHLTNK(F) are identical to sequences found in phospholipase Cα (55Bennett C.F. Balcarek J.M. Varrichio A. Crooke S.T. Nature. 1988; 334: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that homodimers of the bHLH protein E12 spontaneously form disulfide cross-links that span the two HLH domains (1Benezra R. Cell. 1994; 79: 1057-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Ademonstrates that E47 (the major splice product of the E2A gene (38Shen C.P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4518-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) is isolated from bacteria as a 50% mixture of species with monomeric and dimeric apparent molecular weights. The dimer is not observed in the presence of the strong reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that there is a linkage mediated by a disulfide bond similar to that of E12. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrates that under nonreducing conditions E47 is fully functional in binding DNA as a homodimer (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of binding by heterodimerization with the dominant negative HLH protein Id-1 is dependent upon inclusion of the reducing agent DTT in the binding reaction (lane 5). It appears likely that, similar to E12, reduction of the disulfide bond in E47 homodimers is necessary for the formation of heterodimeric interactions. An activity present in cellular extracts can reduce the intermolecular disulfide bond in E47 homodimers. To monitor this activity we designed an assay that directly detects the presence of the disulfide bond in a Western blot analysis. In the following assays, bacterially expressed, epitope-tagged E47 protein was purified and dialyzed into nonreducing buffers. Aliquots of this protein were mixed with cellular extracts and incubated at 37 °C. Monomeric and dimeric E47 proteins were then resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and detected with antibodies against the epitope tag. As demonstrated in Fig.2 A, an activity present in C2C12 myoblast extracts is able to convert oxidized, homodimeric E47 to the monomeric state in a time-dependent manner. To investigate the distribution of this activity, we tested extracts from several different cell types. This activity appears to be present in extracts from many different cells types including lines derived from myoblast (C2C12), epithelial (HeLa), and erythroid (MEL) lineages but is conspicuously reduced in a B lymphocyte cell line (Namalwa) (Fig.2 B, left). Quantitative analyses of B cell extracts (assay described below) demonstrate that lymphocytes contain less than 50% of the activity present in HeLa cells (Fig.2 B, right). We also note that neither thioredoxin, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, nor CoA is capable of converting the dimer to a monomer (data not shown). This indicates that the factor responsible for the activity has widespread tissue distribution, is reduced significantly in B lymphocytes, and is not any of a number of small, physiologic reducing agents. To demonstrate that this reduction activity is a protein, protease studies were performed. Fig. 2 C demonstrates that cellular extracts predigested with the serine protease trypsin lose significant activity (compare lane 3 with lanes 4–6) compared with extracts treated with protease inhibitors alone. This indicates that the reduction activity depends on at least one protein component. Extracts containing this activity can also be inactivated by incubation at 85 °C (data not shown). We sought to purify this activity by standard biochemical fractionation procedures. First, to obtain quantitative estimates of specific activity, we added a bovine HMK site to our substrate E47 and radiolabeled the protein using [γ-32P]ATP. Use of this radiolabeled protein allows rapid, quantitative analysis of E47 conversion by PhosphorImager analysis. HeLa cytoplasmic lysates were used as a source of activity because these cells could be grown to high density and are particularly rich in the activity. As a first step, 2.5 g of crude cytoplasmic HeLa lysate was dialyzed against buffer A, applied to a 120-ml Q-Sepharose column, and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (Fig. 3 A). The reduction activity is plotted as the amount of monomeric E47 generated after incubation of dimeric E47 with each fraction at 37 °C for 5 min. The reduction activity clearly separates into two active peaks, one eluting at approximately 200 mm KCl and one at 350 mm KCl. We designated these two peaks Qp1 and Qp2, respectively. In these reduction assays, we define 1 unit of activity as that that produces a 25% increase in monomeric E47 in a 5-min reaction at 37 °C. The input cytoplasmic lysate contained 1.81*106 units with a specific activity of 725 units/mg of protein, Qp1 contained 3.49*106 units with a specific activity of 2.8*104 units/mg, Qp2 contained 1.33*106 units with a specific activity of 1.1*104 units/mg, and flow-through and washes contained no significant amounts of activity. This net increase in activity is probably the result of removal of proteins present in the crude lysate which inhibit or interfere with the reduction activity. The enzyme PDI has recently been demonstrated to be important for the redox regulation of several mammalian and chloroplast transcription and translation factors and can catalyze the net reduction of proteins (56Kim J.

Because our reduction activity behaves similarly to PDI on several purification resins, we sought to determine whether PDI was responsible for this activity. For this purpose, we performed Western bl"

Previous studies utilizing HTC cells stably transfected with β-globin:PAI-1 chimeric constructs demonstrated that at least two regions within the PAI-1 3′-untranslated region mediate the cyclic nucleotide-induced destabilization of PAI-1 mRNA; one of these regions is the 3′-most 134 nucleotides (nt) of the PAI-1 mRNA (Heaton, J. H., Tillmann-Bogush, M., Leff, N. S., and Gelehrter, T. D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14261–14268). In the present study, ultraviolet cross-linking analyses of this region demonstrate HTC cell cytosolic mRNA-binding proteins ranging from 38 to 76 kDa, with a major complex migrating at ∼50 kDa. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrate high molecular weight multiprotein complexes that specifically interact with the 134-nt cyclic nucleotide-responsive sequence. The 50, 61, and 76 kDa and multiprotein complexes form with an A-rich sequence at the 3′ end of the cyclic nucleotide-responsive region; a 38-kDa complex forms with a U-rich region at the 5′ end of the 134 nt sequence. Mutation of the A-rich region prevents both the binding of the 50-, 61-, and 76-kDa proteins and formation of the multiprotein complexes, as well as cyclic nucleotide-regulated degradation of chimeric globin:PAI-1 transcripts in HTC cells. These data suggest that the proteins identified in this report play an important role in the cyclic nucleotide regulation of PAI-1 mRNA stability.

Sappino A.-P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). This protein is also known to play a major role in biological processes involving localized proteolysis of extracellular matrix, such as tissue remodeling and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (2Vassalli J.-D. Pepper M.S. Nature. 1994; 370: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Type-1 plasminogen activator-inhibitor (PAI-1), a 50-kDa glycoprotein, is a major regulator of plasminogen activation (3Kruithof E.K.O. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,4van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is synthesized in a variety of cell types and its expression is regulated by growth factors and hormones, including agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (5Andreasen P.A. Georg B. Lund L.R. Riccio A. Stacey S.N. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 68: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 6Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. Mol.

In HTC rat hepatoma cells, the cyclic nucleotide analogue 8-bromo-cAMP, together with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (designated cA), increases tissue type PA activity more than 50-fold primarily by decreasing PAI-1 mRNA by 90% and protein by 60–70%. The decrease in PAI-1 mRNA is due to a 60% decrease in the rate of PAI-1 gene transcription and, more importantly, a 3-fold increase in the rate of PAI-1 mRNA decay (8Heaton J.H. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing HTC cells stably transfected with chimeric constructs containing portions of the mouse β-globin gene and rat PAI-1 cDNA, the 1730-nucleotide (nt) PAI-1 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (nt 1331–3060) was shown to contain sequences that mediate the cA-induced destabilization (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, results obtained from deletion and insertion analyses using a series of β-globin coding region:PAI-1 3′-UTR chimeric constructs demonstrated that at least two regions within the PAI-1 3′-UTR mediate the cA effect. One of these regions is the 3′-most 134 nt, from position 2926 to 3060, of the PAI-1 mRNA. This 134-nt sequence includes a 75-nt U-rich region present at its 5′ end and a 24-nt A-rich region at its 3′ end (Fig. 1 A) (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Zeheb R. Gelehrter T.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The decay rates of many mRNAs have been shown to be regulated by a variety of external stimuli including hormones, growth factors, and agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (see Refs. 12Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 13Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar for review). Studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism(s) involved in regulating mRNA stability have identified a number of potentialcis-acting sequences and/or trans-acting factors (12Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar); however, the molecular basis for the cyclic nucleotides regulation of mRNA stability remains largely undefined. The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in the cyclic nucleotide-induced destabilization of PAI-1 mRNA in rat HTC cells. To this end, studies were conducted to identify the cytosolic factors that bind to the 3′-most 134 nt of the PAI-1 mRNA, to characterize the specificity and binding sites for these factors, and to determine their role in cA-induced PAI-1 mRNA destabilization. Results from ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking analyses demonstrate that specific RNA-protein complexes of ∼38, 50, 53, 61, 65, and 76 kDa form with the 134-nt sequence, while RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (R-EMSAs) demonstrate the formation of high molecular mass multiprotein complexes. The 50-, 61-, and 76-kDa and multiprotein complexes form between the A-rich region and HTC cell cytosolic proteins that are found in both polysomal and post-ribosomal fractions, while the 38-kDa complex forms between the U-rich region and proteins found in the polysomal fraction. Mutations in the A-rich region abolished formation of the 50, 61, and 76 kDa and multiprotein complexes as well as the ability of cA to regulate the decay of transcripts from stably transfected globin:PAI-1 chimeric contructs, suggesting that these RNA-protein complexes play an important role in the cA-induced destabilization of PAI-1 mRNA. 8-Bromo-cAMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, benzamidine,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E64), heparin (sodium salt), RNase T1, and tRNA (from Bakers' yeast, type X) were purchased from Sigma. Leupeptin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzoylsulfonyl fluoride-hydrochloride (Pefabloc®SC (AEBSF)), proteinase K, RNase inhibitor, and T3 RNA polymerase were obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim. Coomassie® Plus Protein Assay reagent was acquired from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Eagle's minimal essential medium, RNase A, RNase T2, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, Benchmark® prestained molecular weight markers, okadaic acid, and calyculin A were purchased from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Ampliscribe™ T3 transcription kit was obtained from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). Polyadenylic (poly(A)), polycytidylic (poly(C)), polyguanadylic (poly(G)), and polyuridylic (poly(U)) acids were acquired from Pharmacia Biotech. Centricon® concentrators were purchased from Amicon (Beverly, MA). [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]ATP (400 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham. Prestained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) standards were from Bio-Rad. Monolayer cultures of rat HTC hepatoma cells were grown and maintained as described previously (9Heaton J.H. Kathju S. Gelehrter T.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 10 to 16 h, harvested by trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmPefabloc®SC (AEBSF), 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm E64. The cell pellets were subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles (10 min/cycle) followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant fraction (S10) was removed, assayed for protein concentration using Coomassie® Plus Protein Assay reagent as directed by the manufacturer, and stored at −70 °C. Isolation of polysomal and post-ribosomal (S130) extracts was performed essentially as described (14Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with additional proteinase inhibitors added to buffer A (1 mm Pefabloc®SC (AEBSF), 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm E64). The S130 fraction was concentrated using Centricon-3® concentrators as instructed by the manufacturer. The polysomal and S130 fractions were assayed for protein concentration and stored at −70 °C. The DNA template for transcribing the PAI-1 RNA probes 2926–3060 (the full-length 134-nt region of the 3′-UTR) and 2926–2966 was prepared as follows: pKS− 3′-PAI, which contains the PAI-1 3′-UTR subcloned into the XbaI site of the pBluescript KS− (pKS−) multicloning site (MCS), was digested with KpnI (pKS−: MCS) andApaI (PAI-1: bp 2926), incubated with T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends, and religated using T4 ligase. PAI-1 2926–3060 or 2926–2966 template DNA was linearized with XbaI orNdeI, respectively, prior to in vitrotranscription. The DNA template for generating the PAI-1 probe 2966–3060 was prepared by digesting pKS− 3′-PAI withKpnI and NdeI (PAI-1: bp 2966), creating blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase, and religating using T4 ligase. The template was linearized with XbaI prior to in vitro transcription. The DNA template for PAI-1 sequence 2125–2296 was generated by deletion of the SalI (pKS−: MCS)-NcoI (PAI-1: bp 2125) fragment from pKS− 3′-PAI, blunt end formation and ligation, and linearization with DdeI (PAI-1: bp 2296) prior to in vitro transcription. pKS−CAT, which contains chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding region sequence (bp 2528–2829) subcloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of the pKS− MCS was digested with BamHI (pKS−: MCS) prior to in vitrotranscription. The DNA templates used to generate PAI-1 RNA probes 2926–3024, 3010–3060, and 3024–3060 were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequence for the T3 RNA polymerase promoter (AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG) was included at the 5′ end of the forward primer and used with the appropriate reverse primer in PCR reactions with pSVL G/P (globin coding region/PAI-1 3′-UTR; Ref. 10Heaton J.H.

The DNA templates for 2926–3060 containing the A-rich region mutations were also generated by PCR (see Fig. 5 A for description of mutations) by incorporating the mutant sequences into the reverse PCR primer. The DNA templates used to generate the wild-type and mutant 3010–3040 (Fig. 5 A) were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides containing the sequence for the T3 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′ end followed by the appropriate PAI-1 sequence. Preparation of radiolabeled RNA probes was performed essentially as described (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley Interscience, NY1989: 4.7.1-4.7.8Google Scholar) by incubating the DNA template DNA (oligo- or PCR-generated templates: 100–200 ng, linearized plasmid templates: 0.5–1.0 μg) with 10 units of T3 RNA polymerase under the following conditions: 40 μm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 20 °C), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm CTP, 0.4 mm GTP, 37.5 μm ATP, 37.5 μmUTP, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (400 Ci/mmol). To generate unlabeled competitor RNA, in vitro transcription from the template DNAs was carried out using the Ampliscribe™ T3 transcription kit as directed by the manufacturer. For R-EMSA, extracts and 32P-radiolabeled RNA were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in buffer containing 8 units of RNase inhibitor, 10 μg of yeast tRNA, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 5 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. RNase T1 (1 unit/μl) was added to each reaction and incubation continued at 25 °C for 10 min. Heparin (5 mg/ml) was added and the reactions were incubated at 25 °C for an additional 10 min. The reactions were subjected to electrophoresis through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 40 mA, 4 °C, 4 h) and visualized by autoradiography. For UV cross-linking analyses, extracts and32P-radiolabeled RNA were incubated and treated with RNase T1 and heparin as described for R-EMSA. The reactions were then exposed to a UV light source (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene) at a distance of 2.5 cm from the light source for 10 min (1.8 μJ/cm2) unless otherwise specified. RNase A (10 mg/ml) and RNase T2 (100 units/ml) were added and incubation continued at 25 °C for 10 min; a combination of RNases was utilized in order to maximize digestion of the unbound radiolabeled RNA probe. SDS sample buffer was added and reactions were heated at 85 °C for 2 min; RNA-protein complexes were analyzed by 0.1% SDS-10% PAGE (38:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 40 mA, 25 °C, 4 h) followed by autoradiography. For competition analyses, S10 proteins were preincubated with unlabeled competitor RNA for 10 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of radiolabeled RNA. Each R-EMSA or UV cross-linking analysis figure presented is representative of at least three independent experiments. Cell culture and maintenance, stable transfections, construction of pSVL G/G+2925/3054, riboprobe preparation, and ribonuclease protection analyses were conducted as previously reported (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To prepare the chimeric construct pSVL G/G+2925/3054 double mutant, the PAI-1 sequence from nt 2925–3054 was amplified by PCR, digested with BglII, and ligated into the BglII site of pSVL G/G (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The forward primer contained BglII sequences at its 5′ end, while the reverse primer contained the two mutations in the A-rich region (nt 3023–3028; AAAAAAA changed to cccccc and nt 3030–3035 AUAAA changed to ccgccc) and BglII sequences at its 5′ end. To identify potential mRNA-binding proteins in HTC cell cytosolic extracts that interact with the 3′-most 134 nt of the PAI-1 3′-UTR (nt 2926–3060), UV cross-linking analyses were conducted. Using radiolabeled nt 2926–3060 and HTC cytoplasmic extracts, a major ribonucleoprotein complex with anM r of 50,000 (doublet) and minor complexes of 38,000, 53,000, 61,000, 65,000, 76,000, and 86,000 were detected (Fig.1 B, lane 1). Formation of the RNA-protein complexes was dependent on protein concentration and on the time of exposure to UV light; no additional interactions were detected with greater than 30 μg of extract or after 5 min of UV exposure (data not shown). To ensure complete formation of RNA-protein interactions, all subsequent reactions were exposed to UV light for 10 min (1.8 μJ/cm2). Ribonucleoprotein complex formation was abolished when the samples were treated with proteinase K or when S10 proteins were denatured by heating the extract prior to incubation with radiolabeled RNA (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). No complexes were detected when the RNA alone was subjected to UV cross-linking analysis. These results confirm that the complexes are comprised of RNA and protein. Heating the RNA for 15 min at 85 °C prior to incubation with protein had no effect on complex formation (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Identical ribonucleoprotein complexes were seen when longerin vitro generated transcripts (nt 2714–3060 or nt 2502–3060) that included the 3′-most 134 nt were used as probes in UV cross-linking (data not shown). R-EMSAs using the 3′-most 134 nt of the PAI-1 3′-UTR (nt 2926–3060) demonstrated the formation of an abundant high molecular mass RNA-protein complex of approximately 175 kDa (determined by comparison with protein molecular mass markers) and a minor complex of approximately 140 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). Complex formation was protein concentration-dependent and was abolished when proteinase K was added to the reaction or when S10 proteins were denatured prior to incubation with radiolabeled probe (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). No complexes were detected in the absence of extract (data not shown). These results indicate that the complexes are comprised of RNA and protein. Heating the RNA prior to incubation with protein had no effect on complex formation (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). To determine the subcellular distribution of the cytoplasmic proteins that interact with PAI-1 sequence 2926–3060, UV cross-linking analyses were performed using S10, polysomal, or S130 fractions as the source of proteins. The 38-kDa complex was formed with polysome-associated proteins, but not with S130 proteins; the remainder of the RNA-protein complexes formed using proteins found in both the polysomal and S130 fractions. Using equal amounts of protein from the polysomal and S130 fractions, the majority of the mRNA binding activity was in the polysomal fraction. Likewise, the multiprotein complexes detected by R-EMSA formed with proteins found in both the polysomal and S130 fractions (data not shown). The specificity of the interactions detected between HTC cell cytoplasmic proteins and the radiolabeled PAI-1 sequence 2926–3060 was demonstrated by competition UV cross-linking analyses and R-EMSA (Fig.2). Extract was preincubated with unlabeled competitor RNA prior to the addition of radiolabeled PAI-1 probe. Unlabeled PAI-1 sequence 2926–3060 as competitor reduced formation of the RNA-protein complexes detected by both UV cross-linking (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–4) and R-EMSA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5) in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that these interactions are specific. A portion of the PAI-1 3′-UTR (nt 2125–2296), which when inserted into the 3′-UTR of the β-globin gene fails to confer cA-responsiveness (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was not able to compete with labeled 2926–3060 for complex formation (Fig. 2, A, lane 6;B, lane 7). Likewise, there was no competition for most of the complexes when CAT RNA was used as a nonspecific competitor (Fig.2, A, lane 5; B, lane 6); however, the 86-kDa complex may be nonspecific as CAT RNA did compete for its binding. Furthermore, no RNA-protein interactions were detected when HTC cell S10 extract was incubated with radiolabeled PAI–1 sequence 2125–2296 or CAT RNA (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that the observed interactions are specific for the 134-nt cA-responsive sequence. Since PAI-1 sequence 2926–3060 contains a 75-nt U-rich region and a 24-nt A-rich region (Fig. 1 A), competition UV cross-linking analyses and R-EMSAs were performed using unlabeled homoribopolymers as competitor RNAs. In the UV cross-linking studies (Fig.3 A), formation of the 38-kDa complex was inhibited by the presence of poly(U), but not poly(A). In contrast, formation of the 50-, 61-, and 76-kDa complexes was inhibited by the presence of poly(A), but not poly(U); the 38-, 53-, and 65-kDa complexes remained after competition with poly(A). Poly(C) and poly(G) did not inhibit formation of any of the observed complexes. These data suggest that the 38-kDa complex forms with PAI-1 sequences contained within the U-rich region and that the 50-, 61-, and 76-kDa complexes form with the A-rich sequence between nt 3023 and 3046. In the R-EMSA studies (Fig. 3 B), formation of the RNA-protein complexes was abolished by the presence of poly(A), but was unaffected by poly(U), poly(G), or poly(C). These results suggest that the multiprotein complexes and the major complexes observed by UV cross-linking require the same A-rich sequence. To further define the nucleotide sequences to which the cytoplasmic proteins bind, radiolabeled RNA probes corresponding to those diagrammed in Fig. 4 A were generated and used in UV cross-linking analyses. In each case, molar equivalents of each radiolabeled RNA were used (Fig. 4 B). S10 proteins and nt 2966–3060 formed complexes with the same migration as those observed using nt 2926–3060. Cytoplasmic proteins and nt 3010–3060 or 3024–3060, containing the A-rich region, also formed complexes essentially the same as those observed using 2926–3060, except that the 38-kDa complex was absent. When S10 proteins were incubated with 3010–3040, the abundant complexes migrating at 50 kDa were present as well as faint complexes at 53, 61, 65, and 76 kDa; the 38-kDa complex was absent. Incubation of cytoplasmic proteins with nt 2926–3024 (Fig. 4 B, lane 6), which contains only the U-rich region, resulted in formation primarily of the 38-kDa complex; only faint bands appeared at ∼50, 53, and 65 kDa. This pattern of RNA-protein interactions was also observed using another 3′-UTR U-rich sequence located upstream at nt 2790–2911 as probe (data not shown). S10 incubated with nt 2926–2966 resulted in no RNA-protein complex formation (Fig. 4 B, lane 7). As a correlate to these studies, radiolabeled 2926–3024 or 3010–3040 were used as probes in R-EMSAs to determine if the A-rich region was also important for formation of the multiprotein complexes detected by native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the complexes detected using nt 2926–3060 also form with nt 3010–3040, but not with nt 2926–3024 (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). These data indicate that the multiprotein complexes form using the same A-rich region as those ribonucleoprotein complexes detected by UV cross-linking analyses. Together with results from homoribopolymer competition assays, these studies suggest that (i) the majority of the RNA-protein complexes detected by both R-EMSA and UV cross-linking analysis are the result of an interaction of cytoplasmic proteins with a sequence containing the A-rich region (nt 3023–3046) and (ii) only formation of the 38-kDa RNA-protein complex detected by UV cross-linking analysis results from specific interactions between S10 proteins and a sequence containing the U-rich region (nt 2948–3022). Since the U-rich region of the 134-nt sequence alone does not confer cA-responsiveness onto the otherwise non-responsive globin mRNA (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the majority of the RNA-protein interactions occur within the A-rich region, mutational analyses were performed on the A-rich region. Mutations were generated in the context of the 134-nt PAI-1 sequence (nt 2926–3060) or a 30-nt sequence containing the A-rich region (nt 3010–3040), as illustrated in Fig. 5 A. Mutation of the A-rich region (mutant I: nt 3023–3028, AAAAAA to cccccc and mutant II: nt 3030–3035, AAUAAA to ccgccc) results in loss of RNA binding activity when the mutations were present in either RNA context (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the A-rich region located between nt 3023–3035 is necessary for formation of the 50-, 61-, 65-, and 76-kDa complexes. In addition, formation of the multiprotein complexes detected by R-EMSA also requires this region as indicated by the lack of complex formation using radiolabeled 2926–3060 containing either mutation (Fig. 5 C). Mutations in the A-rich region made in the context of the 134-nt sequence also decreased formation of the 38-kDa complex (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and 3). HTC cells were stably transfected with a chimeric construct containing the wild-type cA-responsive PAI-1 fragment inserted into the 3′-UTR of the murine β-globin gene (pSVL G/G+2925/3054 (10Heaton J.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) or pSVL G/G+2925/3054 containing both A-rich region mutations (pSVL G/G+2925–3054 double mutant). HTC cells were incubated in the absence or presence of cA and the decay rates of the chimeric mRNAs were determined as described previously (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The top panel of Fig. 6 shows the gel from an RNase protection assay of one such experiment and the bottom panel shows graphically the pooled data from two experiments. The wild-type 130-nt fragment mediated cA-induced destabilization of the globin:PAI-1 chimeric mRNA; in contrast, the mutant 130-nt fragment failed to confer cA-responsiveness onto the β-globin gene. Consistent with previous reports (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), control constructs pSVL G/G (globin coding region/globin 3′-UTR) and pSVL G/P (globin coding region/PAI-1 3′-UTR) showed no cA responsiveness and a 2-fold increase in mRNA turnover in response to cA, respectively (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the same A-rich region that interacts with HTC cell cytoplasmic proteins mediates cyclic nucleotide-induced destabilization of mRNA in HTC cells. In HTC rat hepatoma cells, cA causes a 3-fold increase in the rate of degradation of PAI-1 mRNA; the 3′-most 134 nt of the PAI-1 mRNA is sufficient to mediate the major part of this effect (10Heaton J.H. Tillmann-Bogush M. Leff N.S. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism by which cA induces destablization of PAI-1 mRNA, studies were conducted to identifytrans-acting factors that interact with the 134-nt cA-responsive sequence, to characterize the specificity and binding sites of these interactions, and to determine their role in the regulation of mRNA stability. UV cross-linking analysis demonstrated HTC cytoplasmic mRNA-binding proteins of approximately 38, 50, 53, 61, 65, and 76 kDa, and R-EMSA demonstrated multiprotein complexes of ∼175 and 140 kDa that interact with the cA-responsive 134-nt sequence. The 38-kDa mRNA-binding protein appears to interact with the U-rich region. Its binding is competed by poly(U), and the 38-kDa complex forms"

To resolve the structural basis for higherM r paraglobosyl and gangliosyl LOS, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) with a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS with a quadrupole mass analyzer, combined with enzymatic and chemical degradations, to the LOS of MS11mkC. Because we had not previously used MALDI-MS techniques to analyze neisserial LOS, we also analyzed the O-deacylated LOS of MS11mkA, which yields a single major hexasaccharide product upon acid hydrolysis and HF treatment, Galβ1→4Glcβ1→4(GlcNAcα1→2Hepα1→3)Hepα1→Kdo, as an aid in interpreting spectra of O-deacylated MS11mkC LOS. Aspergillus niger α-galactosidase, anhydrous hydrazine, and LPS from Salmonella typhimurium Ra mutant TV 119 were obtained from Sigma and acetonitrile and methanol from Fisher. A 48% aqueous HF solution was purchased from Mallinckrodt (Muskegon, MI). β-Galactosidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, both from jack bean meal, were obtained from Oxford GlycoSystems (Bedford, MA). β-Glucosidase from sweet almonds was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Acrylamide solution, ammonium persulfate, and N, N,N′N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) were acquired from Bio-Rad. Resolving and stacking gel buffers were prepared as described by Apicella et al. (12Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 243-252Google Scholar). The enzymatic substrate for immunoblots was obtained from Tropix (Western-Light Chemiluminescent Detection System, Bedford, MA), and blocking and washing solutions were prepared according to recommendations of the manufacturer. MAb 2-1-L8 was provided by Dr. Wendall D. Zollinger (13Schneider H. Hale T.L. Zollinger W.D. Seid Jr., R.C. Hammack C.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 544-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was an anti-mouse-IgG alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated mAb obtained from Sigma. F62 and the A and C LOS variants of MS11mk each were cultured as described previously (5Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Boslego J.W. Hitchcock P.J. Zahos K.M. Apicella M.A. J. Exp.

LOS were extracted and purified from each variant by a modification of the hot phenol-water method (12Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 243-252Google Scholar, 15Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1972; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). LOS samples wereO-deacylated before MS analyses as reported previously (16Mandrell R.E. Kim J.J. John C.M. Gibson B.W. Sugai J.V. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Yamasaki R. J.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LOS (0.1–1.0 mg) was placed in a 1.5-ml polypropylene tube, to which was added 200 μl of anhydrous hydrazine. Samples were kept at 37 °C in a water bath for 20 min and intermittently vortexed and sonicated. The solution was cooled, and 1 ml of chilled acetone (−20 °C) was added dropwise. The precipitatedO-deacylated LOS was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed with cold acetone, centrifuged again, and the supernatant was removed. To the pelleted O-deacylated LOS, 200–500 μl of H2O was added, and the sample was lyophilized. Phosphoesters were removed by HF treatment because neither the MALDI- nor ESI-MS had sufficient accuracy to distinguish between HexNAc substitutions and HPO3 with PEA ones. The O-deacylated LOS was reacted with 48% aqueous HF to remove phosphoester moieties. From 0.1 to 1 mg of O-deacylated LOS was placed in a 1.5-ml polypropylene tube, and cold 48% aqueous HF was added to make a 5–10 μg/μl solution which then was allowed to react at 4 °C for 16–20 h. Excess HF was removed in a vacuum under a stream of N2 with an in-line NaOH trap (18Phillips N.J. John C.M. Reinders L.G. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 731-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Negative ion MALDI-MS was performed in the linear mode with delayed extraction on a Voyager Elite TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) (19Gibson B.W. Engstrom J.J. John C.M. Hines W. Falick A.M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 645-658Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analyses were carried out with a 150-ns time delay and a grid voltage of 92–94% of full acceleration voltage, 20 kV, and external calibration. The LOS samples were prepared in 100 mm 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid. Small amounts (3–10 μl) of sample were desalted with cation exchange beads (Dowex 50X) before crystallization on the MALDI plates. From 50 to 160 scans were averaged and digitally smoothed. Spectra were mass assigned using an external two-point calibration with a standard of O-deacylated LPS prepared from S. typhimurium Ra mutant TV 119; average masses were used for calculating the predicted molecular weight of the LPS. The software of the manufacturer (PerSeptive Biosystems) was used to correct the external calibration of the spectrum ofO-deacylated HF-treated MS11mkC LOS, and the peak forO-deacylated HF-treated paraglobosyl LOS atm/z 2509.5 was used as an internal one-point calibrant. Negative ion ESI-MS was performed on a Bio-Q instrument (VG Instruments, Manchester, U. K.) (17Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scans were acquired over a range of m/z 300–3000. Samples were dissolved in H2O/acetonitrile (7/3 v/v) to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl, and aliquots of 1–5 μl were injected, using a Rheodyne injector, into a constant stream of 1% acetic acid in H2O/acetonitrile or H2O/methanol (1/1 v/v). A flow rate of 10 μl/min was maintained throughout the analysis. The instrument was calibrated as for MALDI-MS. Spectra were averaged over several scans and digitally smoothed. We compared MALDI and ESI spectra of the MS11mk A and C variant LOS. According to the manufacturer if the concentration of β-galactosidase from jack bean meal is kept below 1 unit/ml with a substrate concentration of 15 μm, the enzyme can be used to distinguish galactose-linked β1→3, which is cleaved at a relative rate of 1%, from galactose-linked β1→6 and β1→4, which are cleaved at relative rates of 100% and 75%, respectively (20Li S.C. Mazzotta M.Y. Chien S.F. Li Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6786-6791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase from jack bean meal was reconstituted in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.5, to a concentration of 0.8 unit/ml. Approximately 30 μg of LOS was added to 625 μl of enzyme solution to achieve a substrate concentration of approximately 15 μm, and the solution was incubated for approximately 20 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by boiling the solution briefly (2–3 min). S. typhimurium Ra mutant LPS and MS11mkC LOS were digested with α-galactosidase. The reaction in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0, was for 20 h at 37 °C. The enzyme concentration was 2 units/ml, and from 20 to 100 μg/ml LOS was digested. Sequential glycosidase digestions of MS11mkC LOS were performed in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, first by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (10 units/ml) and then by β-galactosidase (0.5 unit/ml) or β-glucosidase (5 units/ml). MS11mkC LOS also was digested sequentially with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase followed by α-galactosidase (2 units/ml), but this reaction was performed at pH 4.0. Digestions were carried out for 18–20 h at 37 °C, and the solutions were boiled briefly to inactivate the glycosidases. In one experiment an aliquot of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase-digested MS11mkC LOS was removed for analysis after inactivation of the enzyme, and β-galactosidase then was added to a concentration of 0.5 unit/ml, and the digestion continued, as described above. Native and enzyme-digested LOS were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, as described (12Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 243-252Google Scholar). Long (32 cm) 12.9% acrylamide resolving gels with 3% stacking gels were used (12Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 243-252Google Scholar). The resolving gel was prepared using 15 ml of 30% acrylamide to which was added 7 ml of resolving buffer and 12.2 ml of deionized H2O. Just before casting the gel, 300 μl of ammonium persulfate (75 mg/ml) and 10 μl of TEMED were added to the acrylamide, and the solution was mixed well. After casting the gel, 800 μl of H2O was added gently to the top; after 1 h this was removed, and the stacking gel was added. The stacking gel was prepared by adding 1 ml of 30% acrylamide and 1.0 ml of spacer buffer to 7.8 ml of deionized H2O, degassing the solution, and then adding to it, with stirring, 0.1 ml of 10% SDS, 0.1 ml of ammonium persulfate, and 5 μl of TEMED. The stacking gel was added with the comb in place. The gel was run at a constant 15-mA current until the dye front had moved through the stacking buffer, after which the current was increased to 35 mA. The gel was stained with silver using the general procedure of Tsai and Frasch (21Tsai C.-M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar), with stopping of the reaction as described by Apicella et al. (12Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 243-252Google Scholar). One of duplicate SDS-polyacrylamide gels of native and enzyme-digested MS11mkC LOS was stained with silver, and the other was blotted to nitrocellulose paper for 12 h at 15 V in 20% MeOH with 20 mmtris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. The blot was washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and then incubated in blocking buffer for 2 h. The blot then was washed in phosphate-buffered saline twice for 5 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mAb 2-1-L8 diluted in blocking buffer. The blot was washed and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody in blocking buffer. Bound antibody was detected with a chemiluminescence substrate for alkaline phosphatase and autoradiography. Negative ion MALDI spectra ofO-deacylated and O-deacylated/HF-treated LOS from MS11mkA are presented in Fig. 1,A and B, respectively; their interpretation is based on the known structure of this molecule's glycose moiety and reported structures of neisserial LOS lipoidal moieties. Proposed compositions for deprotonated molecular ions and some observed fragment ions are shown in Table I; there were relatively few molecular ion peaks. Essentially all observed deprotonated ions were singly charged, as were the molecular ion peaks at m/z 2507.2, 2426.8, and 2346.8.Table IStructures and masses of LOS in MALDI mass spectramajorO-deacylated LOS (boldface)Experimental MrCalculated +/−moietyCalculated MraBased on the structure shown in the far left column plus or minus the residue or residues shown in the far right column., bLipoidal moiety (LM) isO-deacylated and contains two N-linked, β-hydroxymyristic acids (diphosphoryl M r = 953.0, average; after HF treatment M r = 793.0, average; mono- and triphosphoryl LMs also occur, albeit in lower abundances).

Open table in a new tab The mass of the most abundant molecular ions atm/z 2426.8 was consistent with a (Hex)2HexNAc(Hep)2 PEA(Kdo)2lipoidal moiety structure and the established structure of the glycose moiety of the MS11mkA LOS (9Kerwood D.E. Schneider H. Yamasaki R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12760-12768Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The molecular ion peaks atm/z 2507.2 and 2346.8 differed from the peak atm/z 2426.8 by the mass of HPO3 (80 Da). That these represented tri- and monophosphoryl lipoidal moiety variants of the m/z 2426.8 species, with the same glycose moiety, was supported by the presence of a prominent peak atm/z 950.8 that corresponded to deprotonated ions of the diphosphoryl lipoidal moiety, a much less prominent peak for the monophosphoryl lipoidal moiety at m/z 871, and a peak for the triphosphoryl lipoidal moiety at m/z1030.8 that, albeit present in Fig. 1 A, was somewhat more prominent in other spectra of this sample. The peak atm/z 2346.8 corresponded to a double charged peak at m/z 1172.8 in the ESI spectrum of the MS11mkA LOS (data not shown). Its relative abundance, however, was much greater in the MALDI than in the ESI spectrum. The difference in relative abundances suggested that the losses of HPO3 and H3PO4 observed in the MALDI spectrum were partially the result of prompt fragmentation occurring in the source. The small peaks at m/z 2303.3, 2223.3, and 2206.0 differed from the peak at m/z 2426.8 by the loss of PEA (−123 Da), both HPO3 and PEA, or HexNAc (−203 Da for both), and Kdo (−220 Da), respectively. The peaks observed in the region of m/z1200–1500 were B-type oligosaccharide fragments ions (19Gibson B.W. Engstrom J.J. John C.M. Hines W. Falick A.M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 645-658Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Domon B. Costello C.E. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 397-409Crossref Scopus (2392) Google Scholar) in which the glycosidic oxygen is retained by the lipoidal moiety. The peaks atm/z 1473.4 and 950.8 corresponded to the glycose and lipoidal fragments, respectively, of the m/z2426.8 LOS. The peaks at m/z 1429.3, 1252.7, and 1209.8 arose from the losses of CO2 (−44 Da), Kdo (−220 Da), and both Kdo and CO2 (−264 Da), respectively, from the oligosaccharide fragments at m/z 1473.4. The most prominent peak in the spectrum of theO-deacylated/HF-treated MS11mkA LOS (Fig. 1 B) was at m/z 2144.2, 282.6 Da less than them/z 2426.8 peak in Fig. 1 A, and corresponded to the loss of the two lipoidal HPO3 groups and a PEA from the m/z 2426.8 LOS. The peak atm/z 2326.5 was unexpected. It differed from the peak at m/z 2144.2 by 182 Da and most likely resulted from retention of a single laurate during incompleteO-deacylation. Loss of Kdo (220 Da) from ions at m/z 2144.2 yielded the ion peak at m/z 1924 (TableII). A peak that arose from a B-type glycosidic bond cleavage between the twoN-myristoylglucosamines of the lipoidal moiety can be seen at m/z 1756.4; loss of Kdo from these ions yielded those at m/z 1536.5. The peak atm/z 1351.4, a B-type oligosaccharide fragment ion peak, differed from the m/z 1473.4 peak in Fig.1 A by the loss of a PEA moiety (123 Da). The peak atm/z 1306.9 arose from loss of CO2(−44 Da) from the m/z 1351.4 peak.Table IIStructures and masses of MS11mkC LOS from ESI mass spectrometryMajorO-deacylated LOS structureaFormats used in Table II are the same as those listed at the end of Table I.ExperimentalM rCalculated +/− moietyCalculatedM rCharge statebCharge states refer to the (M −nH)n– ions observed for each LOS species.

Open table in a new tab We compared mass spectra of the MS11mk C variant LOS with those of LOS from the A variant. TheO-deacylated diphosphoryl variant A LOS molecular ion peak at m/z 2426.8 was replaced in the negative ion MALDI spectrum of the O-deacylated MS11mkC LOS by a series of peaks for molecular ion pairs at m/z 2669.5 and 2792.6, m/z 2872.5 and 2995.6, andm/z 3034.9 and 3158.0 (Fig.2 A). These peaks were not present in the spectrum of the variant A LOS; each pair differed between peaks by a PEA (123 Da). An analogous series of single peaks which lacked phosphoesters (−160 Da or −283 Da) were atm/z 2874.2, 2712.4, and 2509.5 in the MALDI spectrum of the O-deacylated/HF-treated variant C LOS (Fig.2 B). These three molecular ion peaks were consistent with the addition of HexHexNAc (+365 Da) to the MS11mkAm/z 2426.8 molecule (m/z2792.6) followed by the further additions of HexNAc (+203 Da,m/z 2995.6) and HexHexNAc (m/z 3158.0) to the MS11mkCm/z 2792.6 molecule (Table I). The peaks at m/z 2630.3 and 2572.0 in the Fig.2 A spectrum were consistent with the loss of a Hex residue (−162 Da) and a Kdo residue (−220 Da), respectively, from the peak atm/z 2792.6. There were several small peaks for B-type oligosaccharide fragments in the m/z1500–1900 range, including the fragment ion peak atm/z 1840.3 that arose from loss of the lipoidal moiety (−953 Da) from the prominent peak at m/z2792.6. The peaks at m/z 1796.2 and atm/z 1576.3 arose from the peak atm/z 1840.3 by loss of CO2 (−44 Da) and the loss of CO2 and Kdo (−44 and −220 Da), respectively. The peak at m/z 1716.6 originated from loss of the lipoidal moiety from the (−PEA) peak atm/z 2669.5. Di- and monophosphoryl lipoidal moiety fragment ion peaks were present at m/z952.1 and m/z 854 (−H2O; −18 Da). The spectrum of the HF-treated MS11mkC LOS in Fig. 2 Bcontained deprotonated molecular ion peaks at m/z 2874.2, 2712.4, 2509.5, and peaks (not labeled) for the loss of H2O (−18 Da) from the molecular ion peaks. Fragment ion peaks that arose from glycosidic bond cleavage during HF treatment were more prominent in the spectrum of O-deacylated/HF-treated MS11mkC LOS (Fig.2 B) than in the spectrum of similarly treated MS11mkA LOS (Fig. 1 B). For example, the prominent peak atm/z 2122.4 and a less prominent one atm/z 2325.7 originated from the molecular ions atm/z 2509.5 and 2712.4 by glycosidic bond cleavage between the N-myristoylglucosamines of their lipoidal moieties (−387 Da). The prominent peak at m/z1902.5 corresponded to the loss of Kdo (−220 Da) from the respective hemilipoidal m/z 2122.4 molecules, whereas loss of Kdo from the major, m/z 2509.5, molecular ion peak accounted for the m/z 2289.5 ion peak. The loss of the remainder of the lipoidal moiety from the peak atm/z 2122.4 (Fig. 2 B) produced the peak at m/z 1717.6 observed atm/z 1716.6 (calculated m/z1716.5) in the spectrum of O-deacylated MS11mkC LOS (Fig.2 A). The peak at m/z 1673.4 arose from loss of CO2 (−44 Da) from the peak atm/z 1717.6. The peaks atm/z 1740.3 and m/z 1537.1 ar"

To identify transcriptional events that determine myeloid cell determination, we have been investigating the regulation of the neutrophil elastase (NE) 1The abbreviations used are: NE, neutrophil elastase; PR-3, proteinase-3; IL-3, interleukin-3; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor; HI-FBS, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; TK, thymidine kinase; LUC, luciferase; MPO, myeloperoxidase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: NE, neutrophil elastase; PR-3, proteinase-3; IL-3, interleukin-3; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor; HI-FBS, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; TK, thymidine kinase; LUC, luciferase; MPO, myeloperoxidase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s). gene. NE is a microbicidal serine protease present in the primary granules of granulocytes and monocytes (1Takahashi H. Nukiwa P. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2543-2547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In bone marrow, NE mRNA is present mainly in promyelocytes (2Fouret P. duBois R.M. Bernaudin J.-F. Takahashi H. Ferrans V.J. Crystal R.G. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and transcriptional regulation plays a key role in its lineage-specific expression (3Yoshimura K. Crystal R.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 2733-2740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated a 17-kb genomic murine NE clone and found that, like the human NE gene, the murine gene contains five exons and initiates transcription 30 bp downstream from a TATAA homology (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the 5′-flanking region of the NE gene contains a 60-bp proximal enhancer, located just upstream of the TATAA homology, which is strongly active in 32D cl3 myeloid cells differentiating in response to granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but only weakly active in uninduced 32D cl3 cells or in fibroblasts (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This proximal enhancer is activated cooperatively by C/EBP, c-Myb, CBF, and Ets family members such as PU.1 or GABP (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol.

The NE gene is located just downstream of the proteinase-3 (PR-3) gene, which in turn is located just downstream of the azurocidin gene (7Zimmer M. Medcalf R.L. Fink T.M. Mattmann C. Lichter P. Jenne D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8215-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These three serine protease genes are expressed specifically and coordinately in immature myeloid cells (7Zimmer M. Medcalf R.L. Fink T.M. Mattmann C. Lichter P. Jenne D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8215-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the promoter of each contains conserved binding sites for C/EBP, c-Myb, and PU.1 (7Zimmer M. Medcalf R.L. Fink T.M.

Immunol. 1996; 211: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the murine NE gene contains additional regulatory regions, we assessed the activity of NE genomic subclones functionally after transient transfection into 32D cl3 cells. A 2-kb NE genomic region extending from −7.3 to −9.3 kb stimulated the NE promoter 7-fold, and stimulated the herpes TK promoter as well, whereas none of the other subclones, from −7.3 to +7.5 kb, were active. Recent results indicate that this enhancer maps to the second intron of the adjacent PR-3 gene, 2S. Shapiro, personal communication. 2S. Shapiro, personal communication. and so might stimulate both the NE and PR-3 promoters in vivo. We therefore designate it the myeloid protease enhancer. Functional analysis identified a 220-bp “core” enhancer, centered at −8.6 kb, which activated transcription 15–31-fold. Deletional analysis of this segment identified an Sp1-binding site and two flanking Ets family-binding sites, which contributed to its activity in 32D cl3 cells. Also, Sp1 and GABP cooperatively activated transcription via these sites in Schneider cells. Notably, Sp1 had been shown previously to cooperate with Ets factors to regulate several myeloid promoters. 32D cl3 cells (9Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altman S.

For induction of granulocytic differentiation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% HI-FBS supplemented with 1,000 units/ml G-CSF (Amgen). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% HI-FBS. Schneider cells (ATCC CRL-1963) were maintained at 22–24 °C in Schneider cell medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% FBS. 32D cl3 cells proliferating in IL-3 were transiently transfected by a DEAE-dextran procedure as described, using 10–15 μg of reporter DNA (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, the 32D cl3 cells were cultured in G-CSF or split between IL-3- and G-CSF-containing media. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation using 3 μg of reporter DNA, followed 18 h later by a 3.5-min, 15% glycerol shock in phosphate-buffered saline (10Chen C. Okayama H.

Schneider cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 5 μg of reporter DNAs and 2.5 μg of effector DNAs. pMSV-CAT (0.25–0.5 μg) or pCMV-βGal (1 μg) were employed as internal control plasmids where indicated. Total cell extracts were prepared 42 h after transfection and analyzed for luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or β-galactosidase activities as described (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S.

In brief, 10–12 μg of nuclear extract, 1 footprinting unit of Sp1, or approximately 100 ng of the GST fusion proteins were incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 ng of an oligonucleotide probe, which had been radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow fill-in of 5′-overhangs. For detection of Sp1 in 32D cl3 nuclear extracts, the binding solution was 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mmKCl, 70 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. For the U937 extracts, recombinant Sp1, or the GST fusion proteins, the binding solution was 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 or 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 1% Ficoll. 10–100-Fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added 5 min prior to probe addition, and 1 μl of Sp1 antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Sp1 antisera and specific peptide were added 30 min prior to probe addition. Reaction mixtures were then subject to electrophoresis on 5% acrylamide gels in 0.33–0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA at 180–200 V. The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. A restriction map of the murine NE genomic locus is presented in Fig. 1 A, top panel. The 1.8-kb BamHI-NcoI segment located just upstream of the first exon was studied previously (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six other segments, designated I–VI, were subcloned upstream of the proximal enhancer and the luciferase reporter, by insertion between theHindIII and XhoI sites of pNE(m−107/−103)LUC (4Nuchprayoon I.

Segments of NE-I were subcloned upstream of the proximal enhancer similarly. These segments are diagrammed in Fig. 1 A,bottom panel. Division of NE-I.11 into NE-X, NE-Y, and NE-Z was facilitated by insertion of BglII sites into NE-I.11 by site-directed mutagenesis after annealing mutagenic oligonucleotides and single-stranded DNA as described (4Nuchprayoon I.

The sequence of pNE-Z, the core protease enhancer, is given in Fig. 1 B. NE-Z was further divided into NE-A, NE-B, and NE-C by insertion of BamHI sites at bp 76–81 or 157–162 using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The final polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations had been introduced. A 39-bp segment of NE-C, NE-C1, was ligated upstream of the NE promoter as a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide. Several mutant versions of NE-C1 were ligated similarly. The sequences of the top strand of these oligonucleotides are given below. Each has a 4-bp 5′-overhang compatible with HindIII, and the bottom strand had a similar overhang compatible with XhoI.

The 109-bp herpes simplex virus TK promoter was ligated upstream of the luciferase reporter in p19LUC (11van Zonneveld A.-J. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NE genomic segments NE-I.11 and NE-Z were ligated upstream of the TK promoter in this plasmid to create pNE(I.11)tkLUC and pNE(Z)tkLUC. I.11 was also subcloned in reverse orientation in front of the 103-bp NE promoter region, to generate pNE-I.11r(−103)LUC. The sequences of oligonucleotides containing known Sp1- and Ets-binding sites, and of an irrelevant oligonucleotide, used as competitors in EMSA are given below. For trans-activation experiments, Sp1 and the GABP subunits were expressed using pPac-Sp1 (12Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) (gift from R. Tjian, University of California, Berkeley, CA) and pPac-GABPα + pPac-GABPβ (gift from N. Speck, Dartmouth University, Hanover, NH). Fig.1 A diagrams our murine NE genomic λ clone. The five NE exons span 1.7 kb (13Belaaouaj A. Walsh B.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Shapiro S.D. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 1.8-kb region located just upstream of the first exon was studied previously and shown to contain a 60-bp proximal NE enhancer located between −90 and −30, just upstream of the TATAA homology (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six additional genomic regions were positioned upstream of −103 in the NE promoter linked to the luciferase reporter. The activities of these constructs were assessed relative to the −103 promoter segment alone after transient transfection into 32D cl3 myeloid cells and culture in G-CSF for 2 days (Fig. 2 A). Region I stimulated transcription 7.4-fold, on average, whereas the other regions were inactive. Several segments of Region I were then also subcloned upstream of the promoter and luciferase and analyzed similarly. These segments are diagrammed in the bottom panelof Fig. 1 A, and the results of transient transfection analysis are shown in Fig. 2 B. I.1 stimulated transcription 6.5-fold, whereas I.2 only increased activity 2.2-fold. Also, when I.2 was divided into I.21 and I.22, neither of these DNA segments stimulated the NE promoter. On the other hand, subdomains of I.1, I.11 and I.12, both retained significant activity. I.11 activated transcription 14-fold, I.12 activated transcription 6-fold, and both together stimulated activity 17-fold. Thus, the 1.4-kb genomic region contained in I.11 and I.12 is the smallest portion of the 16.8-kb murine NE λ clone, which has enhancer activity. As this enhancer maps in the second intron of the adjacent PR-3 gene,2 we designated it as the myeloid protease enhancer. We chose to focus on I.11, the most active segment of this region, for further analysis. Using BglII sites inserted by site-directed mutagenesis, region I.11 was divided into domains X, Y, and Z. Domain X stimulated the NE promoter 4-fold, domains X and Y together stimulated activity 2.5-fold, and domains Y and Z stimulated activity 3-fold. Strikingly, domain Z alone stimulated activity 31-fold. Apparently domain X is minimally active, domain Y is actually repressive, and domain Z is very stimulatory. We designate domain Z as the core protease enhancer, realizing that nearby regions X and I.12 may also contribute to the activity of the NE enhancer. The sequence of domain Z is given in Fig. 1 B. To determine whether the myeloid protease enhancer could function in either orientation, region I.11 was positioned in reverse orientation upstream of the NE promoter and luciferase. I.11 activated transcription 8-fold in the forward orientation and 18-fold in the reverse orientation in induced 32D cl3 cells (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether the enhancer could activate a heterologous promoter, regions I.11 and Z were positioned upstream of the herpes simplex TK promoter. Region I.11 stimulated the TK promoter 5-fold, and region Z stimulated the promoter 10-fold in induced 32D cl3 cells (Fig.2 C). The NE promoter region alone was 5-fold more active when transfected 32D cl3 cells were cultured for 48 h in G-CSF, compared with IL-3 (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the myeloid protease enhancer might also be more active in G-CSF, the activity of several of these constructs was also assessed in IL-3 (Fig. 2 C). When the observed increased activities of the NE and TK promoters in cells cultured in G-CSF compared with IL-3 are taken into account, we conclude that the protease enhancer is equally active in 32D cl3 cells cultured in G-CSF or in IL-3. The activity of the myeloid protease enhancer was also assessed in NIH 3T3 cells. Region I.11 activated the NE promoter 8-fold in induced 32D cl3 cells and 3-fold in NIH 3T3 cells. Region Z activated the promoter 23-fold in 32D cl3 cells (the average of the data in Fig. 2 Band Fig. 3 A) and 7-fold in NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, the protease enhancer was more active in 32D cl3 myeloid cells than in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The activity observed in NIH 3T3 cells could indicate binding by factors not normally expressed in myeloid cells or that do not have access to the enhancer in the chromatin of non-myeloid cells. Region Z was divided into segments A, B, and C by inserting BamHI sites in place of bp 76–81 or 157–162. Segments ABC (NE-Z), A, AB, AC, BC, and C were then assessed for their ability to enhance the activity of the NE promoter region in induced 32D cl3 cells (Fig.3 A). Segment A only activated transcription 2-fold, when assayed alone or when added to segment C. Segment B increased the activity of segment A 3-fold and of segment C 2-fold. On the other hand, segment C activated the promoter 10-fold alone and 6-fold with segment A. Thus the 75-bp segment C was more stimulatory than segments A or B. To map the active region of segment C, segment C1 was synthesized and linked to the proximal enhancer. Segment C1 activated transcription 12-fold (Fig. 3 A), indicating that this 39-bp region was critical to the activity of the core enhancer. Of note, introduction of a BamHI site at bases 157–162, between segments A and B, disrupted a consensus site for CBF. This mutation did not decrease the activity of the core enhancer. 3I. Nuchprayoon and A. D. Friedman, unpublished data. Inspection of the sequence of C1 revealed an Sp1 consensus site, GGGCGG, flanked by two GGAA motifs, which are potential binding sites for Ets family members. Oligonucleotides containing 2-bp mutations in each of these sites were synthesized and linked to the NE promoter. The 5′-GGAA was mutated to TTAA (GG1), and the 3′-GGAA was mutated to GGTT (AA2), so that the introduced mutations would be separate from the Sp1 consensus. A double GGAA mutant version of C1 was also prepared (GG1/AA2). Similarly, the Sp1 consensus was mutated to GTTCGG (Sp2) in an effort to avoid interfering with the GGAA sites. This oligonucleotide still weakly bound Sp1 (data not shown), and so a 5-bp Sp1 site mutation, GTTTTT (Sp5), was also prepared. Finally, an oligonucleotide containing mutations in both GGAA sites and a 5-bp mutation in the Sp1 site were also ligated into the basal reporter. The activities of these constructs relative to that of C1 linked to the NE promoter were then assessed in induced 32D cl3 cells (Fig.3 B). Mutation of the 5′-GGAA reduced activity 3.6-fold, mutation of the 3′-GGAA reduced activity 2.6-fold, and mutation of both Ets sites reduced activity 4.4-fold. The 2- or 5-bp mutation in the Sp1 site had a similar effect, reducing activity 7.6-fold, and mutation of all three sites reduced activity 6.3-fold. Thus, integrity of the Sp1 site and both Ets sites is important for the activity of segment C1 in the core myeloid protease enhancer in myeloid cells. A nuclear extract from induced 32D cl3 cells was prepared and incubated with radiolabeled C1. The reaction was then resolved on a 5% native acrylamide gel (Fig.4 A). Two gel shift species were observed. Both were competed by 10- or 50-fold excess of unlabeled C1 or of a consensus Sp1 site. A C1 oligonucleotide carrying a 2-bp mutation in the Sp1 site competed far less efficiently, whereas the GG1 or AA2 mutations did not prevent efficient competition. When Sp1 antisera was added to the reaction, the more slowly migrating gel shift species was supershifted efficiently, whereas the lower species was only mildly affected. The specific peptide prevented the supershift. Thus, C1 binds Sp1 via the GGGCGG consensus and may bind a less abundant, Sp1-related protein or degradation product present in 32D cl3 nuclear extracts as well. No additional bands, which might correspond to Ets family members, were observed, even on long exposures of the autoradiographs. In particular, we easily detected binding of PU.1 to the NE proximal enhancer (5Oelgeschläger M. Nuchprayoon I. Lüscher B. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and C1 only weakly competed for this binding (data not shown). To further characterize proteins capable of binding C1, we also employed several purified proteins and U937 nuclear extracts (Fig.4 B). Purified Sp1 bound efficiently (lane 2), and binding was also detected using bacterially expressed GST-PU.1, GST-GABPα, or GST-GABPα with GST-GABPβ (lanes 3–5). GABP is an Ets family member, which also binds and activates the NE promoter (6Nuchprayoon I. Simkevich C. Luo M. Friedman A.D. Rosmarin A.G. Blood. 1997; 89: 4546-4554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several bands were detected in EMSA using a U937 extract, including a prominent doublet (open arrows) reminiscent of the doublet detected using 32D cl3 extracts (lane 6). Interestingly, competition with a consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide inhibited binding by all of the bands except for a minor band present between the doublet (lane 8, filled arrow). And competition with an oligonucleotide derived from the CD18 promoter, which is known to bind PU.1 and GABP (14Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), prevented binding by this minor species but not by the major doublet (lane 9). An irrelevant oligonucleotide competitor had no effect. These results indicate that the Ets factors PU.1 and GABP can bind C1. They also identify an endogenous Ets factor that can bind C1. This endogenous factor was not PU.1 or GABP, as it did not supershift with the corresponding antisera (data not shown). We next explored the possibility that the endogenous Ets factor, which bound C1, might do so more efficiently if the Sp1-binding site is mutated (Fig. 4 C). Using radiolabeled C1 and a U937 extract in an EMSA (lane 2) we again identified a minor gel shift species (dark arrow) between the two Sp1-related species (open arrows). When the C1-Sp5 oligonucleotide was used as a probe with the same extract, the Sp1 species were not detected, and the minor band was more prominent (lanes 4 and 7). Binding by this species was competed more efficiently by the homologous probe (lanes 5 and 6) than by C1-mGG1/AA2, carrying mutations in both Ets consensus sites (lanes 8 and9). Thus, Sp1 and an Ets factor present in U937 extracts can simultaneously bind C1. Of note, when purified Sp1 and GST-PU.1 or GST-GABPα/β were used in an EMSA with C1 as probe, no additional, more slowly migrating species was detected, indicating that Sp1 and PU.1 or GABP did not bind C1 simultaneously under these conditions.3 Sp1 is abundant in mammalian cells. Therefore, we employed DrosophilaSchneider cells for trans-activation experiments. Initial experiments suggested that Sp1 could activate the proximal NE enhancer in pNE(Δ−103)LUC. Therefore, for these experiments we positioned C1 just upstream of the TATAA homology in the NE promoter, followed by the luciferase reporter. The empty pPac Drosophila expression vector did not affect the activity of this reporter. 4C. P. Simkevich, M. Luo, and A. G. Rosmarin, unpublished data. Sp1 did not activate the NE promoter in pNE(Δ−42)LUC alone, but activated the C1 segment of pC1-NE(−42)LUC 3-fold, on average (Fig.5 A). Neither PU.1 nor GABP alone activated segment C1 in Schneider cells, and PU.1 did not increase stimulation by Sp1. On the other hand, the combination of GABP and Sp1 stimulated pC1-NE(−42)LUC 8-fold, but did not stimulate pNE(Δ−42)LUC. Thus, Sp1 and GABP cooperated to stimulate transcription via the enhancer segment C1 in Schneider cells. To verify that cooperation between Sp1 and GABP was dependent upon binding to the Sp1- and Ets-binding sites in C1, additional transfection experiments were carried out using reporters carrying either C1, C1-mGG1/AA2, or C1-mSp5, linked to NE(−42)LUC (Fig.5 B). In this set of experiments, Sp1 activated C1 5-fold, and Sp1 + GABP activated C1 12-fold. Mutation of the two Ets-binding sites did not prevent activation by Sp1, but prevented additional activation by GABP. Mutation of the Sp1-binding site prevented activation by Sp1, alone or with GABP. We previously studied 1.8 kb of the murine NE 5′-flanking region and identified a proximal NE enhancer within the first 100 bp, which activated transcription 300-fold (4Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now assessed the ability of an additional 15 kb of the murine NE genomic locus to enhance transcription from the proximal NE enhancer/promoter in 32D cl3 myeloid cells as they differentiate in response to G-CSF. Only a 2-kb region centered at −8.3 kb was active, and this region includes a highly active 220-bp core enhancer, which activated the proximal enhancer/promoter 30-fold in 32D cl3 cells. Using a similar functional approach we identified an enhancer at −3 kb in the murine myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene, which was also localized using a DNase I hypersensitivity assay (15Friedman A.D. Britos-Bray M. Suzow J. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 809-8"

Labeling of PLD1 was abolished by treatment with hydroxylamine at neutral pH, indicating that the fatty acid is linked via thioester to the enzyme. In pulse-chase studies the label persisted over a 3-h chase, indicating a slow rate of turnover. A catalytically inactive point mutant of PLD1 that changes serine at position 911 to alanine (S911A) was partially but not entirely redistributed to the cytosol, and it contained no detectable palmitate label. Similarly, N- and C-terminal domain fragments of the protein, encompassing in combination the entire coding region and all expressed to levels comparable with the wild type protein, showed no label with palmitate. Treatment of immunoprecipitated PLD1 with hydroxylamine diminished catalytic activity to background levels in a dose response manner that paralleled the removal of label from [3H]palmitate-labeled protein.

In mammalian cells, two isoforms of PLD have been identified based on sequence homology to plant and yeast enzymes PLD1 and PLD2 (2Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D.

In addition to differences in primary sequence, the two PLD isoforms differ also in intracellular localization and with respect to their ability to be regulated by a variety of activating proteins and a lipid. Whereas PLD1 is activated in vitro by two small GTP-binding proteins ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) and Rho, as well as by protein kinase C and by the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PLD2 in vitro is constitutively active and only requires phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In terms of localization, PLD1 is found mainly in intracellular membranes, whereas PLD2 is on plasma membrane. Based on its localization and activation requirements, PLD1 is a good candidate to mediate those aspects of vesicular traffic in which a “PLD activity” has been implicated from earlier studies (4Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 5Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr.

Bioessays. 1998; 20: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Although PLD activity responsive to the known activators is evident in Golgi-enriched membranes from a variety of cell lines, endogenous PLD1 protein is difficult to detect, and it has not been purified to homogeneity from any source. We and others have begun studying the localization, activity, and regulation of PLD1 following overexpression, either transiently or in inducible cell lines. In this work we identify fatty acylation as a post-translational modification of PLD1. This modification is undetectable in a catalytically inactive mutant and in fragments of the protein that together encompass the entire coding sequence. Removal of palmitate by hydroxylamine renders PLD1 catalytically inactive, suggesting an important role for this modification in PLD1 function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the function of PLD1 in vivo, and especially those aspects of the enzyme implicated in intracellular transport, we have raised peptide-based antibodies against the two terminal regions of PLD1, and we have made recombinant plasmids encoding full-length PLD1, parts of PLD1, or point mutants. Reagents that will be discussed in this work are shown in Fig.1.When expressed transiently in COS cells, PLD1 is largely membrane-bound, despite the lack of a transmembrane domain or of recognizable consensus sequences specifying modification by lipid moieties (3Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that PLD1 is nevertheless modified covalently with lipid by labeling COS cells expressing the protein with [3H]palmitate, immunoprecipitating, and analyzing the immunoprecipitates by autoradiography. Following such an experiment, PLD1 is labeled specifically with tritium (Fig.2 A). Labeling for 2 h results in stronger signal than labeling overnight (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 5), reflecting the fact that the half-life of PLD1 in COS cells is short and incorporation of palmitate into cells is linear for only the first 5–6 h of labeling (results not shown). The nature of the tritium linkage on PLD1 was explored by treating resolved PLD1 with neutral hydroxylamine, a condition known to cleave thioester bonds (9Magee A.I. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Labeling of resolved PLD1 was completely sensitive to neutral hydroxylamine (Fig.2 A) and resistant to Tris, suggesting a linkage to a cysteine residue. A portion of the lysates used for immunoprecipitation in Fig. 2 A were resolved and immunoblotted (Fig.2 B). It can be seen that both PLD1 and SHS accumulate to the same level in COS cells.Figure 2Palmitoylation of PLD1. A, COS cells transfected with a control plasmid (−) or with plasmids encoding full length PLD1 (PLD) or an N-terminal fragment (SHS) were labeled overnight or for 2 h with [3H]palmitate. Following lysis and immunoprecipitation with N-terminal antibodies, the samples were resolved on identical SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis and fixing, one gel was treated with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (− hydroxylamine), and the other with 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.0 (+ hydroxylamine), before autoradiography. Shown is a 30-day exposure. B, lysates from the samples shown inA were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with N-terminal antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We expanded the analysis of labeling with [3H]palmitate to various fragments of PLD1 expressed separately in COS cells and to a catalytically inactive point mutant that was originally constructed by Sung et al. (10Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and changes serine at position 911 to alanine. After transfection into COS cells, labeling was done either with [35S]methionine or with [3H]palmitate and immunoprecipitation with both N- and C-terminal-specific antibodies. With methionine labeling, it can be seen that all proteins are synthesized to comparable levels (Fig.3, top panels), and the ability to be immunoprecipitated is strictly dependent on the type of antibody used. In addition, hydroxylamine treatment does not change the amount of label in any of the relevant bands (Fig. 3, top panels, compare − hydroxylamine with + hydroxylamine). Equally clear is the result with palmitate labeling: the only protein that incorporates label is the wild type PLD1, and again this label is sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment. We point out that, although in general the N-terminal antibodies immunoprecipitate better than the C-terminal antibodies, this alone does not explain why the amount of tritium-labeled PLD1 immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal antibodies is so much less than that immunoprecipitated with the N-terminal antibodies (Fig. 3,bottom right panel). We have not explored this difference further.Figure 3Relative palmitoylation of wild type PLD1, fragments, and S911A mutant. COS cells transfected with the indicated PLD-related constructs were labeled either with35S TranSlabel or with [3H]palmitate as indicated for 2 h, and lysates were prepared. Lysates from each sample were divided in half, and each was immunoprecipitated with N- or C-terminal antibodies as indicated. After immunoprecipitation the samples were resolved on duplicate SDS-polyacrylamide gels, one of which was treated with Tris-HCl, pH 7 (− hydroxylamine), and the other with hydroxylamine, pH 7 (+ hydroxylamine), before autoradiography. Shown is a 60-day exposure. S/Astands for S911A; the rest of the abbreviations are as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The absence of detectable label in the fragments suggests that palmitoylation of PLD1 may not be dependent simply on the availability of a relevant amino acid sequence but in addition may relate to the catalytic ability of this protein. This is strengthened by our observation that the S911A mutant (which contains all potential relevant cysteine residues) incorporates no palmitate. We examined the accumulation of this mutant after transfection into COS cells and its activity in our hands (Fig. 4). S911A is synthesized and accumulates to very comparable levels with the wild type protein in COS cells (Fig. 4 A and results not shown), and it can be immunoprecipitated as efficiently. It is different from the wild type protein in electrophoretic mobility in that it does not reveal a faint higher molecular mass form of the protein as does the wild type protein, an observation originally made by Sung et al. (10Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1 and4 with lanes 2, 3, 5, and6). This upper band has been proposed to represent a covalent intermediate with phosphatidic acid in the hydrolytic cycle of PLD1 (10Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), but we have not seen formation of such an intermediate during catalysis in vitro. 2M. Manifava, unpublished observations. In agreement with Sung et al. (10Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the S911A mutant has no hydrolytic activity after immunoprecipitation from COS cells (Fig. 4 B) or in vivo (data not shown). We have also examined the subcellular distribution of S911A. By immunofluorescence, the wild type PLD1 when overexpressed to reasonable levels shows a distribution that is perinuclear and is characterized by numerous punctate structures (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the S911A mutant shows no punctate structures, and it has a more diffuse distribution suggestive of relocation to the cytosol (Fig.5 A). In parallel experiments, distribution was assessed biochemically, and it largely confirmed the microscopic data. Whereas PLD1 was primarily found with the membrane fraction (Fig.5 B, lane 3), about half of the S911A mutant was in the cytosolic pool (Fig. 5 B, lane 5).Figure 4Expression and catalytic activity of S911A. A, COS cells were transfected with wild type PLD1 or with two independent isolates of the S911A point mutant. Following lysis and immunoprecipitation, both lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with N-terminal antibodies. Note the absence of higher molecular mass eight band in S911A. B, COS cells were transfected with control plasmid (−) or with plasmids encoding wild type PLD1 or S911A. After immunoprecipitation and extensive washing, the beads were incubated with GTPγS and14C-labeled phosphatidylcholine in the context of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids with or without recombinant Arf6 for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC.PC, phosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid;O, origin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Immunofluorescence and fractionation of PLD1 and S911A. A, COS cells were transfected with wild type PLD1 (PLDwt) or with S911A (PLDS911A) and plated on coverslips for immunofluorescence. Shown are representative examples of cells expressing the two proteins and stained with N-terminal antibodies. B, COS cells were transfected with wild type PLD1 or with S911A. Post nuclear supernatants (PNS) were produced and further fractionated by sedimentation into membrane (mem) and soluble (cyt) fractions. Membranes were resuspended to the same volume as the soluble fraction, and equal aliquots from each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with N-terminal antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data on the S911A mutant can be interpreted in two ways that are not mutually exclusive: either modification of PLD1 with palmitate is part of the requirement for membrane attachment as is the case for many other proteins (11Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or membrane attachment is partially a consequence of catalytic ability (perhaps as simple as binding the substrate lipid), which in turn depends to some extent on palmitoylation. Because membrane attachment seems to depend on additional mechanisms unrelated to palmitoylation and restricted to specific regions of PLD1, 3J. Sugars, unpublished results. it was easier to address the second possibility alone. In the cases where palmitoylation can be shown to have a functional role, depalmitoylation with hydroxylamine has been used to probe the function of several proteins such as rhodopsin, the asialoglycoprotein receptor and phospholipid scramblase (12Pepperberg D.R. Morrison D.F. O'Brien P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 348-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Zeng F.Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the same vein, we treated immunoprecipitated PLD1 with hydroxylamine and assayed its catalytic activity (Fig.6). Hydroxylamine treatment abolished PLD1 activity (over 85% reduction by densitometry), both unstimulated and stimulated with Arf6 (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 5 and 6 with the other lanes). When the concentration of hydroxylamine was varied, we found a linear reduction of PLD1 activity as a function of hydroxylamine concentration (Fig.6 B, bottom panel). (The overall reduction in activity observed with both Tris and hydroxylamine treatments (Fig.6 B, bottom panel, compare lane 1 with the other lanes) is explained by the fact that some PLD is lost from the beads during the additional washes (Fig. 6 B, top panel, compare lane 1 with the other lanes).) We chose the highest concentration of Tris or hydroxylamine (1 m) to follow the activity of the treated enzyme as a function of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 6 C). It can be seen that although the Tris-treated enzyme displays linear activity as a function of incubation at 37 °C, the enzyme that was treated with hydroxylamine was essentially inactive, and even at the longer incubation times its activity was reduced compared with the Tris-treated sample by 85% (Fig. 6 C, compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). It is of course possible that in addition to fatty acid removal, hydroxylamine treatment changes the structure of PLD1 sufficiently to account for reduction in catalytic activity. We cannot rule this possibility out based on our data. However, when the ability of hydroxylamine to remove the palmitate label was assayed as a function of concentration (Fig. 6 D), we found a very good correspondence between reduction in catalytic activity and palmitate removal (compare lanes 7–10 in Fig. 6 B,bottom panel, with lanes 5–8 in Fig.6 D, top panel). We also point out that treatment with hydroxylamine had no effect on electrophoretic mobility of PLD1 or on its immunoreactivity (Fig. 6 B, top panel, and Fig. 6 D, bottom panel).Figure 6Effect of depalmitoylation on PLD activity. COS cells were transfected with PLD1. A, after immunoprecipitation and extensive washing, the beads were divided into four equal aliquots. One aliquot (PBS) was kept on ice. The other three were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with PBS (PBS*), 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7 (hydroxyl.), or 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7 (Tris). The beads were then washed twice with PBS, again divided in two, and assayed for PLD activity as described above with or without Arf6. The production of phosphatidic acid was measured by TLC after extraction of the lipids. B, after immunoprecipitation and extensive washing, the beads were divided into 11 equal aliquots and treated as indicated for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed twice with PBS and assayed for PLD activity by TLC shown in the bottom panel. One-tenth of the actual activity reaction was removed and mixed with sample buffer, and its PLD1 content was determined after electrophoresis and immunoblotting (shown in thetop panel labeled blot). C, after immunoprecipitation and washing, the beads were divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was treated with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and the other was treated with 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.0, for 40 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed twice with PBS and divided into four aliquots. PLD substrate with Arf6 and GTPγS was added to each aliquot, and the assay for PLD activity was carried out at 37 °C for the indicated times. At the end of incubation, lipids were extracted, and phosphatidic acid formation was measured by TLC. Note that the total amount of PLD1 protein per sample for this experiment was three times that of PLD1 used in other experiments to account for the loss of protein from the beads during the washing steps. D, cells were labeled for 2 h with [3H]palmitate and lysed, and PLD1 was immunoprecipitated. After washing, the beads were divided into eight equal aliquots and treated for 30 min at room temperature as indicated (sample labeled PBS was treated on ice, the one labeled PBS* at room temperature). The beads were then washed twice with PBS and resolved by SDS-PAGE on duplicate gels. One gel, containing one-tenth of the sample, was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with PLD antibodies (blot). The other gel, containing the rest of the sample, was fixed, enhanced, dried, and exposed for autoradiography (3-H palm). Shown is a 20-day exposure.

If it represented a covalent lipid intermediate in catalysis, it would be expected to be short-lived because unstimulated PLD1 is catalytically active in COS cells.2 If, on the other hand, it were a permanent modification that facilitates catalytic activity, it would be expected to last for as long as the newly synthesized enzyme. Labeling of PLD1 in parallel with [35S]methionine or with [3H]palmitate and chasing for various times revealed that the half-life of tritium label is comparable with the label with35S (Fig. 7). This suggests that under our experimental constraints, modification with palmitate is long-lived. It is possible that under conditions of stimulation or inhibition of the enzyme, modification may vary.Figure 7Rate of turnover of PLD1 labeled with [35S]methionine or with [3H]palmitate.COS cells transfected with PLD1 were plated on 6-well plates in duplicate. 40 h after transfection half of the samples were labeled for 2 h with 35S TranSlabel and the other half were labeled for 2 h with [3H]palmitate. At the end of 2 h one set of samples was placed on ice (0 min chase). For the rest, the labeling medium was replaced with medium containing methionine, cysteine, and 150 μm palmitate, and the samples were returned to 37 °C for the indicated times. At the end of incubation the cells were lysed, and PLD1 was immunoprecipitated and resolved on duplicate gels and fixed overnight. One gel was treated with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (− hydroxylamine), and the other was treated with 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.0 (+ hydroxylamine). Shown are the 18-h exposure for [35S]methionine (35-S met) and the 30-day exposure for [3H]palmitate (3-H palm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In conclusion, we have identified a modification on PLD1 that is consistent with palmitoylation: it is evident after palmitate labeling, and it is sensitive to neutral hydroxylamine. The low levels of PLD1 expression (even using the strong promoter described here) combined with the weakness of the tritium label have precluded us so far from establishing the identity of the fatty acid unambiguously, and we are currently in the process of exploring other detection methods. Interestingly, this modification is present only on catalytically active PLD1. It is absent from the catalytically inactive mutant S911A that replaces a serine thought to be involved in initiating catalysis with an alanine. Complementary to this, wild type PLD1 is rendered catalytically inactive by pretreatment with neutral hydroxylamine. The simplest interpretation of our data is that modification of PLD1 with fatty acid facilitates catalysis, perhaps by enabling the enzyme to interact better with its phospholipid substrate in situ, and that the region of PLD1 around serine 911 is probably involved in the binding of the fatty acid.

Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 457-509Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, two isoforms of PLD have been identified based on sequence homology to plant and yeast enzymes PLD1 and PLD2 (2Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D.

In addition to differences in primary sequence, the two PLD isoforms differ also in intracellular localization and with respect to their ability to be regulated by a variety of activating proteins and a lipid. Whereas PLD1 is activated in vitro by two small GTP-binding proteins ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) and Rho, as well as by protein kinase C and by the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PLD2 in vitro is constitutively active and only requires phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In terms of localization, PLD1 is found mainly in intracellular membranes, whereas PLD2 is on plasma membrane. Based on its localization and activation requirements, PLD1 is a good candidate to mediate those aspects of vesicular traffic in which a “PLD activity” has been implicated from earlier studies (4Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 5Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr.

Although PLD activity responsive to the known activators is evident in Golgi-enriched membranes from a variety of cell lines, endogenous PLD1 protein is difficult to detect, and it has not been purified to homogeneity from any source. We and others have begun studying the localization, activity, and regulation of PLD1 following overexpression, either transiently or in inducible cell lines. In this work we identify fatty acylation as a post-translational modification of PLD1. This modification is undetectable in a catalytically inactive mutant and in fragments of the protein that together encompass the entire coding sequence. Removal of palmitate by hydroxylamine renders PLD1 catalytically inactive, suggesting an important role for this modification in PLD1 function. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the function of PLD1 in vivo, and especially those aspects of the enzyme implicated in intracellular transport, we have raised peptide-based antibodies against the two terminal regions of PLD1, and we have made recombinant plasmids encoding full-length PLD1, parts of PLD1, or point mutants. Reagents that will be discussed in this work are shown in Fig.1.When expressed transiently in COS cells, PLD1 is largely membrane-bound, despite the lack of a transmembrane domain or of recognizable consensus sequences specifying modification by lipid moieties (3Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that PLD1 is nevertheless modified covalently with lipid by labeling COS cells expressing the protein with [3H]palmitate, immunoprecipitating, and analyzing the immunoprecipitates by autoradiography. Following such an experiment, PLD1 is labeled specifically with tritium (Fig.2 A). Labeling for 2 h results in stronger signal than labeling overnight (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 5), reflecting the fact that the half-life of PLD1 in COS cells is short and incorporation of palmitate into cells is linear for only the first 5–6 h of labeling (results not shown). The nature of the tritium linkage on PLD1 was explored by treating resolved PLD1 with neutral hydroxylamine, a condition known to cleave thioester bonds (9Magee A.I. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Labeling"

The haptoglobin promoter is highly specialized in its tissue of action; the viral promoter has few restrictions. The apoAI-CIII gene is naturally active in only two tissues, whereas theHprt gene region is ubiquitously active. Expression of both transgenes at substantial levels was achieved only (a) when the transgenes were inserted into the genome close to a known tissue-specific enhancer/locus control region in the apoAI-CIII gene cluster, and (b) when known conditions for function of their promoters were met. The specificities of the two chromosomal regions and of the two promoters are preserved, but their interactions are not specific. We conclude that transgenes are affected by locus-related enhancers in the same manner as nearby endogenous genes.

Transgenic mouse technology has been widely and effectively used for studying the physiological consequences of expressing exogenous gene products or analyzing promoter function and protein structure-function relationships in vivo (1Palmiter P.D. Brinter R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 459-499Crossref Scopus (869) Google Scholar). However, analysis with transgenic mice produced by pronuclear microinjection requires multiple founders because a foreign gene incorporated into the mouse genome is often expressed differently, both in amount and in tissue specificity in one founder versus in another. Integration of the exogenous DNA into random chromosomal locations and in unpredictable numbers of copies, together with rearrangements in the introduced DNA or in the sites of incorporation associated with the integration event, are among the factors accounting for these variations (2Soriano P. Gridley T. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Meisler M.H. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have previously described a general way of introducing single-copy transgenes into the mouse germ line via embryonic stem (ES) 1The abbreviations used are: ES cells, embryonic stem cells; apo, apolipoprotein; Gapdh , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene; Hp , human haptoglobin gene; Hp 2, Hp 2 allele; hHp 2, Hp 2 transgene; mHp , mouse haptoglobin gene; Hprt , hypoxanthine phophoribosyl transferase gene; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Neo , neomycin resistance gene; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. cell technology as a means of comparing the expression of different transgenic sequences without the complications of variation in copy number and insertion site (4Bronson S.K.

In this earlier work, we tested the method by inserting into the hypoxanthine phophoribosyltransferase (Hprt) locus on the X chromosome a single copy of a murine Bcl-2 cDNA driven either by a chicken β-actin promoter or by a human β actin promoter and demonstrated that expression of the two transgenes differed in a predictable fashion. The Hprt gene is a housekeeping gene, transcriptionally active in all tissues, and modification of the locus does not affect the overall development and health of the animals. Furthermore, the availability ofHprt − ES cells, such as E14TG2a (5Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and HM-1 (6Selfridge J. Pow A.M. McWhir J. Magin T.M. Melton D.W. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and of vectors capable of mediating highly efficient and directly selectable homologous recombination at the Hprt locus makes this system simple to use. The previous work, however, also showed that despite expression of the Hprt locus in all tissues, expression of the Bcl-2 transgene driven by the human or the chicken β actin promoter was very low or undetectable in the liver and kidney; this has prompted us to search for a locus in which liver-specific expression of a targeted transgene can be readily studied. A gene cluster on mouse chromosome 9, which contains genes, coding for apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV is a potential target for such studies. The region is relatively easily targeted (7Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and alteration of a single copy of any of the three genes in the locus has physiologically insignificant consequences that do not affect the development or overall health of the resulting mice (8Kreuzer J. von Hondenberg E. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: 113-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three apolipoprotein genes are expressed highly in the liver and small intestine, and the promoter/enhancer elements controlling the expression of these genes are well characterized in humans. In the present study, we tested the expectation that the choice of the site of transgene insertion will cause a predictable influence on the tissue-specific expression of an inserted transgene. To do this, we introduced a transgene cassette into two different chromosomal locations in mice: the apoAI-CIII locus on chromosome 9 and the Hprt locus on the X chromosome. The targeting cassette was composed of a neomycin resistance (Neo) gene driven by the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter with polyoma enhancers (9Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar) and a human haptoglobin (Hp) gene driven by its own 1.1-kb promoter sequence (10Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); haptoglobin is the major hemoglobin-binding protein in serum, and its gene is mainly expressed in the liver. Our results demonstrate that the specificities of the two chromosomal regions and of the two promoters are preserved, but their interactions are not specific. The entire human Hp 2 gene (10Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is contained within a 9-kb fragment extending from an XbaI site at approximately 1.1 kb 5′ to the starting codon to an ApaI site 1.6 kb 3′ to the stop codon. This fragment with 1.1-kb DNA encoding the pMC1neopoly(A) gene (Stratagene) attached to its 5′ end in the opposite transcriptional orientation was used as aNeo-hHp 2 transgene cassette. The vector to introduce theNeo-hHp 2 cassette into the Hprt locus was a modified form of the previously described locus-specific targeting vector, pMP8 (14Reid L.H. Shesely E.G. Kim H.-S. Smithies O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The regions of homology are 4 kb of DNA 5′ to the Hprt locus and 1.6 kb of DNA extending 3′ from aHindIII site in intron 2 to an EcoRI site in intron 3 of the Hprt gene. The Neo gene and the hHp 2 gene were inserted as shown in Fig. 1. A 9-kb BamHI fragment of mouse genomic DNA containing theApoa-1 gene and a 3′ part of the Apoc-3 gene (7Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was used to make the targeting construct designed to insert theNeo-hHp 2 cassette into the apoAI-CIII region. The Neo-hHp 2 cassette was inserted so as to replace a 450-bp BglII-BstXI fragment 3′ to the Apoc-3 gene. The BstXI site is at 30 bp downstream of the poly(A) addition signals for theApoc-3 transcripts. A herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene was placed at the 3′ end of the construct (Fig. 2). Cell culture, electroporation and selection using mouse ES cells (BK4, a subclone of E14TG2a, provided by Dr. B. Koller, University of North Carolina) were as described (7Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Southern blots were made withHindIII digests of genomic DNA isolated from cells or from tails of mice at weaning (3 μg). Probe 1 (Fig. 1 C) is a 250-bp RsaI fragment in the intron 3 of the mouseHprt gene. Probe 2 (Fig. 2 C) is a 600-bpKpnI-BamHI fragment containing a part of theApoc-3 gene. The presence of a 7.6-kb with probe 1 or an 8-kb band with probe 2 detects targeting in the Hprt locus or apoAI-CIII region. Inflammation was induced in mice (10–18 months old) by injecting 25 μg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Calbiochem) intraperitoneally. Blood was collected retroorbitally 24 h after LPS injection. Tissues were collected at 12 h after LPS injection for RNA analyses by primer extension and at 24 h for Northern blot analyses. Sera (4–5 μl) were mixed with 1 μl of a fresh lysate of red blood cells containing approximately 3% hemoglobin and electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.9 (16Maeda N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 158-166PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were soaked in 0.1m potassium acetate, pH 5.0, for 15 min before staining with 0.2% benzidine (w/v) in 0.5% acetic acid (v/v) containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (w/v). Total RNA was isolated using TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde before transfer onto a Nytran Plus membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were sequentially hybridized to probes using conventional protocols. The human haptoglobin β probe was a 650-bpBamHI-HindIII fragment corresponding to exon 7 of the Hp 2 gene. The mouse apoA-I probe was a 180-bp EcoRI-NheI fragment corresponding to exon 4. The mouse apoC-III probe was a 410-bp SauIIIA fragment corresponding to exon 4. The mouse apoA-IV probe was a 321-bpPvuII fragment corresponding to exon 3. The Neoprobe was a 380-bp PstI-NcoI fragment in pMC1neopoly(A). The Gapdh probe was a 315-bpSacI-BamHI fragment corresponding to exons 5 through 8 (pTRI-GAPDH-mouse, Ambion). Oligonucleotide primers were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (1.3 × 107cpm/pmol) and incubated for 10 min at 68 °C with 20 μg of total RNA in 30 μl of 0.05 m PIPES buffer, pH 6.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl. The reaction mixture was then incubated overnight at 42 °C before treatment with reverse transcriptase, as described (17Sambook D. Fttitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The reaction products were resolved in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea. Gels were then dried and exposed to Kodak XAR films for at least two different times. Densitometoric analyses were performed using NIH Image, and the relative amount of mouse Hp, humanHp 2, or Neo transcripts were estimated in each sample by the intensities of corresponding bands relative to that of Gapdh. The following primers were used: 5′-GCCACAGGCAGCATGACATACTT-3′ for haptoglobins (nucleotides 901–923 of human Hp 2 (10Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 761–783 of mouse, (18Yang F. Linehan L.A. Friedrichs W.E. Lalley P.A. Sakaguchi A.Y. Bowman B.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)); 5′-ACCCATCACAAACATGGGGGCAT-3′ for mouse Gapdh(nucleotides 420–442(19)); and 5′-CCGATCCCCTCAGAAGAACTCTCGA-3′for Neo (nucleotides 1522–1544). The validity of the assay for quantitating amounts of transcript was established by the linearity of the signal for theHp and the Gapdh genes over a range of total liver RNA from 0 to 40 μg and with primer amount varying from 0 to 105 cpm. Because the haptoglobin primer hybridizes to both human and mouse transcripts equally well, the relative amounts of transcripts within a sample can be readily compared. For comparisons between samples or between different experiments, the expression levels were adjusted against that of Gapdh with the caution that the normalized values in different tissues may not be completely comparable, because expression of Gapdh itself is somewhat variable in different tissues (20Spanakis E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3809-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase I and used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a standard protocol (21Wang A.M. Mark D.F. Amplification of RNA in PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 21-27Google Scholar). The primers specific to humanHp 2 were 5′-AGAAGGAGATGGAGTATACACC-3′ and 5′-TTAAGGTGTACACTCCATCTCC-3′ (10Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and specific to mouse Hpwere 5′-CAGTGCCCGAGAAGAAAAACTT-3′ and 5′-TACACAGAGCGACTTGAACA-3′ (18Yang F. Linehan L.A. Friedrichs W.E. Lalley P.A. Sakaguchi A.Y. Bowman B.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After initial incubation at 95 °C for 2 min, PCR for 35 cycles was at 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, 94 °C for 30 s, followed finally by 72 °C for 4 min. Isolation of liver nuclei and in vitro nuclear run-on assay were carried out according to Ntambi (22Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10925-10930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting radioactive RNA was hybridized to immobilized DNA probes for apoC-III, apoA-I, Neo, and Gapdhdescribed above. The two genes chosen as transgenes for the present study are the human haptoglobin transgene (hHp 2) on a 9-kb fragment of human genomic DNA that includes the hHp 2 gene with its own promoter and 3′ untranslated sequence and neomycin-resistant gene (Neo) from the pMC1neopoly(A). The two genes are in opposite transcriptional orientations. The overall scheme for inserting theNeo-hHp 2 transgene cassette into the partially deleted Hprt locus on the X chromosome of BK4 ES cells is diagrammed in Fig. 1. The targeting vector is derived from pMP8SKB (14Reid L.H. Shesely E.G. Kim H.-S. Smithies O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) used in our previous studies of targeted transgenesis at this locus. In the current vector, the promoter and exons 1 and 2 of the Hprt genes in pMP8SKB were removed, and selection to facilitate identification of targeted cells was with G418 instead of with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine. Approximately 1 in 10 G418-resistant colonies had a single copy of the transgene inserted into the Hprt locus. Because the ES cell used for targeting is karyotypically male, and thus hemizygous for the X-chromosome-linked Hprt locus, the modified ES cell genome was transmitted from the chimeras to their F1 female offspring. Mating of these F1 heterozygous females with C57BL/6 males was used to generate male progeny, and Southern blot analyses of their genomic DNA showed either a 7.1-kb or a 7.6-kb HindIII fragment, corresponding to the wild type or targeted Hprt locus (Fig. 1 D). We designate the resulting hemizygous males having one copy of the hHp 2 transgene on their X chromosomes as Hprt-Hp2 mice. The scheme for inserting the Neo-hHp 2transgene cassette into the apoAI-CIII gene cluster on chromosome 9 is diagrammed in Fig. 2. The transgene replaces a 450-bp BglII/BstXI fragment between the Apoa-1 and Apoc-3 genes. Approximately one in three colonies resistant to G418 and ganciclovir had an insertion of the transgene at the correct position as judged by the presence in Southern blot analyses of an 8-kb HindIII fragment in addition to a 12-kb band from the unmodified locus. The transgene was passed from chimeric males to approximately half of their offspring. We designate the resulting (heterozygous) mice carrying one copy of the hHp 2 transgene as Apo-Hp2 mice. Males at the F2 or F3 generation were used for further experiments. Because the Neo gene in theNeo-hHp 2 transgene cassette is driven by a powerful herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter and a duplicated polyoma enhancer, the Neo transgene was expected to be expressed in most cell types regardless of the location of insertion (9Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). We, therefore, first determined the tissue distribution and relative levels of Neo transgene expression in the Apo-Hp2 and Hprt-Hp2 mice. The Neo transcripts were detectable by Northern blotting in the liver and small intestine of the Apo-Hp2 mice but not in the Hprt-Hp2 mice (Fig. 3). Comparison of the levels of Neo transcripts in different tissues was carried out by primer extension analyses as illustrated in Fig. 4 A for the liver and 4B for the small intestine. Fig. 4 C summarizes these and also presents analyses of RNA from lung, adipose tissue, bone marrow, and spleen. The results show that expression of theNeo transgene in the apoAI-CIII gene cluster differs considerably in different tissues. However, in general, the relative levels of expression in the various tissues parallel to that of theApoa-1 and Apoc-3 genes, which are highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. Thus, relative to liver expression as 100%, the amounts of Neo transcripts per μg of total RNA in small intestine, adipose tissue, and lung were 57, 14, and 3% that of the liver. No Neo transcripts were detectable in the spleen and bone marrow.Figure 4Primer extension analysis of expression of the Neotransgene. mRNAs (20 μg) from the liver (A) and from the small intestine (B) of the indicated animals were subjected to primer extension analyses with Neo primer (105 cpm) and with GAPDH primer (105cpm).

Liver is the major organ of haptoglobin production in humans and in mice. Northern blot analysis of liver total RNA (Fig.3 A) using a probe (hpβ) derived from the β region of the human Hp 2 gene showed that human haptoglobin transcripts were readily detectable in the Apo-Hp2 mice. The level of expression in the transgene homozygotes with two copies of the transgene was approximately twice as much as that in the single copy heterozygotes. Human Hp 2 transcripts were also detectable by Northern blot in the intestine of the Apo-Hp2 mice, but in considerably less amounts (Fig. 3 B). Expression of the endogenous mouse Hp gene (detectable by a low level cross-reaction of its mRNA with the hpβ probe) was stimulated by LPS in the liver but not in the intestine. To compare the expression of the human Hp 2transgene with the expression of the endogenous mouse haptoglobin gene in tissues where the levels are too low for Northern blot analysis, we used primer extension analyses as illustrated in Figs.5 A through 5 D and presented in a quantitative manner in Fig. 5 E. The data show that the endogenous mouse Hp gene is expressed at about 15% that of the liver level in lung, adipose tissue, and bone marrow, respectively. Endogenous mouse Hp transcripts were also detected (not shown) in the thymus and adrenal gland at approximately 5% that of the liver, with still lesser amounts in the intestine, spleen, kidney, and testis. Increased expression of the mouse gene was observed in the liver after LPS treatment, which is known to induce synthesis of haptoglobin, an acute-phase response protein. The amount of humanHp 2 transcripts in the liver of Apo-Hp2 mice from a single copy of the transgene was approximately 70% that of a single copy of the endogenous mouse Hp gene. The mRNA levels of both the endogenous mouse Hp gene and the hHp transgene were increased equally by about 30% at 12 h after LPS treatment. Human Hp 2transcripts were also found in the small intestine, lung, adipose tissue, bone marrows, and spleen, at about 3% of the liver expression of the endogenous mouse gene. Less than 1% of liver levels of transcript were seen in the other tissues examined (not shown), including brain, thymus, heart, kidney, adrenal gland, testis, and ovary. In general, expression of the human transgene in the Apo-Hp2 mice in these extra-hepatic tissues was approximately half or less of the endogenous mouse gene expression, except that in the intestine expression of the transgene, which was approximately five times that of the mouse gene (itself very low at approximately 1.5% of the liver expression). In the Hprt-Hp2 mice, the level and tissue distribution of transgene expression was markedly different from that in the Apo-Hp2 mice. No transcripts of the hHp 2 transgene were detectable by primer extension analyses in the liver, adipose tissue, small intestine, and kidney in the Hprt-Hp2 mice, although they were detectable when total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR analyses (data not shown). Transcripts, detectable by primer extension analyses in the lung, bone marrow, and spleen, were, respectively, at about 4, 3, and 2% levels of the endogenous mouse gene in the liver. Expression in the brain, heart, and testis was detectable but at less than 1% of the liver expression (data not shown). LPS treatment did not affect expression of the transgene in any of these tissues. To investigate whether the insertion of the transgene 3′ to the Apoc-3 gene had influenced the expression of the nearby Apoa-1,Apoc-3, and Apoa-4 genes in the Apo-Hp2 mice, the Northern blots used for Fig. 3 were sequentially rehybridized with probes corresponding to each of these apolipoprotein genes. The amounts of Apoa-1 and Apoa-4 transcripts in the Apo-Hp2 mice were not different from those in the wild type mice. However, the amount of Apoc-3 transcripts was reduced to about 50% that of wild type in heterozygotes, and transcripts were not detectable in homozygous Apo-Hp2 mice. Thus the insertion of the transgene cassette approximately 30 bp 3′ to the poly(A) addition signal sequence affected the Apoc-3 gene expression, although the transcriptional orientations of the Neo genes and the Apoc-3genes are opposed (Fig. 2). A preliminary nuclear run-on experiment with the liver of a homozygous Apo-Hp2 mouse showed that initiation of the Apoc-3 gene transcription appears to be normal (data not shown). This suggests that the likely cause of the undetectable amounts of Apoc-3 gene mRNA in the Apo-Hp2 homozygotes is that insertion of the transgenes just downstream of the gene results in an unstable message or in failure of the transcripts to be processed properly. The levels of expression of the Apoa-1, Apoc-3, Apoa-4, and the Neo genes were unaltered by LPS treatment. We compared the levels of the endogenous and human haptoglobin proteins in the circulation of the transgenic mice by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of plasma proteins at pH 8.9 (Fig. 6). The amount of endogenous mouse haptoglobin differs in the plasma of different individuals, with no protein being detected in some mice. Plasma haptoglobin levels are much more variable than the corresponding mRNA levels of the animals. Reliable detection of haptoglobin in the plasma of all mice was, however, achieved by treating them with LPS, which induces the synthesis of haptoglobin. Mouse haptoglobin, like the monomeric form of human haptoglobin, hp1, contains one free sulfydryl group in its α subunit and migrates as a single tetrameric (αβ)2 band, like human haptoglobin type 1-1 individuals. The human hp2 protein α subunit, in contrast, contains two free sulfydryl groups and forms a series of heteromultimers in the presence of hp1 proteins. Thus, in human type 2-1 heterozygotes, haptoglobin migrates as a ladder during gel electrophoresis. A similar ladder of haptoglobin heteromultimers, detectable in the Apo-Hp2 mice after LPS treatment, demonstrates that the haptoglobin hp2 protein is secreted in combination with the type 1-like mouse haptoglobin. Human haptoglobin was readily detected in the plasma of (homozygous) Apo-Hp2 mice having two copies of the transgene, even without LPS treatment. Plasma from human type 2-1 heterozygous individuals yields a ladder with up to 9 identifiable bands. But only three bands are detected in the plasma of Apo-Hp2 mice, with the first being the heaviest. This pattern is very similar to that seen in individuals having the haptoglobin 2-1-modified phenotype (23Connell G.E. Smithies O. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is caused by the production of less hp2 protein than hp1 (16Maeda N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 158-166PubMed Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of plasma from the Apo-Hp2 mice, therefore, demonstrates that the human haptoglobin is made and secreted in these mice, but the amount of the human hp2 protein is less than the mouse protein, consistent with the mRNA data presented above, showing that the expression of the Hp 2 transgene is somewhat lower than that of the endogenous mouse gene. In marked contrast to these observations with the Apo-Hp2 mice, no human haptoglobin was detectable in the plasma of Hprt-Hp2 mice, even after LPS-treatment, although the endogenous mouse haptoglobin was normally present. Our results show that the chromosomal location of a transgene markedly and with a considerable degree of predictability affects the levels of its expression. Thus the Neo gene in the Hprt locus is expressed in many tissues of the Hprt-Hp2 mice at a uniform level, reflecting the ubiquitous pattern of the Hprt gene expression. However, although the Neo gene is driven by a strong viral promoter, its expression in the Hprt locus is relatively low. In contrast, the tissue expression of the same Neo gene in the apoAI-CIII region of the Apo-Hp2 mice takes on the same strong expression pattern as the apolipoprotein locus, which is highly expressed in the liver and intestine. Expression in the liver of theNeo gene in the apoAI-CIII locus is at least 9-fold that of the same gene in the Hprt locus. In contrast to the Neo gene with its viral promoter, the liver expression in the Hprt-Hp2 mice of the hHp 2 transgene driven by its own promoter sequence was only detectable by RT-PCR. This agrees with earlier work in which a sequence that included the 1.1-kilobase pair promoter of hHp 2 gene was not able to support high levels of liver expression of reporter genes randomly inserted into the genome as transgenes (12D'Armiento J. Dalal S.S. Okada Y. Berg R.A. Chada K. Cell. 1992; 71: 955-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 13Martinez A. Jansen L. Buchanan J.M. Adrian G.S. Yang F. Herbert D.C. Weaker F.J. Walter C.A. Bowman B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), despite its being sufficient for liver-specific transient expression of the gene in hepatic cells in tissue culture (11Oliviero S. Morrone G. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, high levels of liver expression of the haptoglobin gene require not only a liver-competent promoter but also enhancer element(s) outside of the 9-kb DNA containing the hHp 2 gene. The apoAI-CIII region, but not the Hprt locus, can supply the enhancer element(s), and the hHp 2 transgene inserted close to theApoa-1 gene is expressed in the liver at approximately 70% that of the level of the endogenous mouse Hp gene. The apoAI-CIII region is also known to contain enhancers that functions in the intestine, and the expression of the hHp 2transgene in this tissue in the apoAI-CIII locus was five times that of the endogenous mouse Hp gene in the same tissue. These results demonstrate that tissue-specific enhancer elements present in the apoAI-CIII region can interact with the hHp 2promoter as well as with the viral thymidine kinase promoter and that high levels of expression of the transgene can be obtained in the liver by interactions between either of these quite different promoters when they are inserted into the genome within the range of the tissue-specific enhancers. Studies using transgenic mice have shown that a 256-bp sequence from the human apoA-1 gene (24Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K.A.M. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a 780-bp sequence from the human apoC-III gene (25Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are sufficient for driving their respective gene expression at high levels in the liver. The cis-elements within these regions that are necessary for the liver-specific expression have been well characterized (26Zannis V. Kardassis D. Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 285: 1-23PubMed Google Scholar). The same studies also showed that neither element is able to support the expression of the transgenes in the intestine, but that high levels of intestinal expression of the transgenes can be achieved by the simultaneous presence of a DNA segment 5′ to the apoC-III gene (−500 to −900) that functions as a classical enhancer. This distal DNA segment, which contains multiple regulatory elements, also enhances expression from the apoA-I and apoC-III promoters in the liver 5- to 10-fold in the tissue culture system (24Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K.A.M. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancement of expression in both the liver and the intestine of the Neo-hHp 2 transgenes when inserted into the mouse apoAI-CIII region is most likely the consequence of similar interactions. Unusual aberrant expression of a foreign gene in a particular transgenic mouse line is frequently attributed to chromosomal position effect, although proving this effect is often difficult. In one such case of an aberrant tissue expression of a transgene, Al-Shawi et al. (27Al-Shawi R. Kinnaird J. Burke J. Bishop J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the expression patterns of the transgene changed by recovering and reintroducing it into the secondary transgenic mice. Position independence of transgene expression can be obtained when relatively large genomic segments are introduced or when the transgene is attached to a sequence for matrix attachment sites (or scaffold attachment sites) (28Stief A. Winter D.M. Stratling W.H. Sippel A.E. Nature. 1989; 341: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) or to very strong enhancers such as the locus-controlling region of the β-globin genes (29Talbot D. Collis P. Antoniou M. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Greaves D.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our work clearly demonstrates how expression levels in various tissues is affected by interaction between the promoter elements of the introduced transgene and enhancers that reside near the location of the transgene. It will be of interest to test how the introduction of matrix attachment sites or a locus-controlling region will influence the expression patterns of endogenous genes near a chosen chromosomal insertion site. The predictable expression of the Neo and hHp 2 transgene in the liver of the Apo-Hp2 mice demonstrates the usefulness of the apoAI-CIII region for introducing a targeted transgene when expression in the liver is desirable. The transcriptional properties of the foreign promoters appear to be maintained, but their promoter activities in the liver and intestine (and potentially in the adipose tissue) are greatly enhanced. Thus the acute phase response of the Hp promoter was retained, as shown by the increase in the hHp 2 gene expression, under LPS stimulation to approximately the same extent as the increase in endogenous gene expression. Inactivation of theApoc-3 gene by an insertion in opposite transcriptional orientation of the Neo gene at approximately 30 bp 3′ to the poly(A) addition signal sequence was a slight complication in the present experiments, and adjustment of the position of the insertion may be desirable to eliminate or reduce the influence of the transgene on expression of the Apoc-3 gene. However, the reduction of apoCIII expression itself is unlikely to influence the phenotype ascribable to the transgene, because mice completely lacking apoCIII are healthy and exhibit only a mild hypotriglyceridemia (30Maeda N. Li H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23610-23616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the ability to control the levels of tissue-specific expression of a transgene in vivo by choosing both the promoter driving the gene and the site of chromosomal integration with its nearby enhancers makes targeted transgenesis a very versatile approach for achieving a predictable in vivo function of the transgene. Furthermore, by using repeated insertion of variant transgenes into the same locus, targeted transgenesis allows the systematic dissection of in vivo promoter functions or effects of subtle structural changes in the products of the transgenes.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 regulates actin microfilaments on the basis of its ability to bind to and regulate a host of actin severing, capping, and bundling proteins in vitro (9Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 also binds to proteins with pleckstrin homology domains, such as pleckstrin or all phospholipase C isozymes (10Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 11Parker P.J. Hemmings B.A. Gierschik P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 54-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, PtdIns and its phosphorylated metabolites also play important roles in the regulation of membrane traffic (12De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Since the PtdIns(4,5)P2 metabolism plays such crucial roles in several aspects of cell physiology, it is logical that PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis and degradation are stringently regulated. Mammalian cells contain several isoforms of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase with different biochemical properties. The type I PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is stimulated by both heparin and spermine. On the other hand, the type II PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is inhibited by heparin, and inhibited or not affected by spermine (13Ling L.E. Schulz J.T. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5080-5088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18012-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the type I and not type II PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is also stimulated by phosphatidic acid (15Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This stimulation may be essential for resynthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in response to PtdIns(4,5)P2hydrolysis by phospholipase C and subsequent conversion of DG to phosphatidic acid. An additional mechanism for resynthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 may involve protein kinase C-mediated activation of the PtdIns 4-kinase and PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase. This speculation is based on the ability of phorbol esters and DG to elevate levels of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in intact cells (16Boon A.M. Bresford B.J. Mellors A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consequently, elevation of DG levels following activation of phospholipase C may promote synthesis of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. However, direct evidence for involvement of protein kinase C in activation of PtdIns 4-kinase and PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is missing. On the other hand, small GTP -binding protein Rho was found to interact with and regulate PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (17Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 1994: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 18Ren X.-D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP was implicated in regulation of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Kato H. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3116-3121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Buxeda et al. (20Buxeda R.J. Nickels J.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6248-6255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the 45- and 55-kDa forms of S. cerevisiaePtdIns 4-kinase are neither phosphorylated nor regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Recently, type II (21Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Divecha N. Truong O. Hsuan J.J.

This surprising finding identifies PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase as a key player capable of generating several polyphosphoinositide signaling molecules. In this study we show that at least one form of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase inSchizosaccharomyces pombe is associated with plasma membrane. We describe purification and characterization of this PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase and present evidence that this PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is phosphorylated and regulated by casein kinase I (CK1) in vitro and in vivo. Protein purification media were from Pharmacia. Calibration proteins for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. Phospholipids were from Sigma and detergents from Pierce. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham and [3H]inositol from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. S. pombe strain SP223 (h+ ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18) was grown at 32 °C in minimal medium (27Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar) supplemented with 75 mg/liter each of adenine, leucine, and uracil. Preparation of the membrane fraction was performed batchwise, starting from cells grown in 3 liters of YEA medium to A 600 nm = 1.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,000 × g × 10 min), washed once with water and once with spheroplast buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1.4 m sorbitol, 10 mm NaN3, 0.3% 2-mercaptoethanol). The spheroplasts were prepared and lysed as described previously (28Wang P.C. Vancura A. Desai A. Carmel G. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12014-12023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crude extract (≈150 ml) was centrifuged at 5,000 × gfor 10 min, supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet (P2) from this spin was resuspended in 15 ml of sucrose solution (55% sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml each of pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Aliquots of 2.5 ml were placed at the bottom of a 1.4 × 8.9-cm centrifuge tubes (each batch was processed in 6 tubes) and subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation as described previously (28Wang P.C. Vancura A. Desai A. Carmel G. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12014-12023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet fraction in centrifuge tubes was overlaid with the following volumes and concentrations of sucrose (containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml each of pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) at 0 °C: 1 ml × 50%, 1 ml × 47.5%, 1.5 ml × 45%, 1.5 ml × 42%, 1.5 ml × 40%, 1 ml × 37.5%, and 1 ml × 30%. After centrifugation (16 h × 170,000 × g, SW41 rotor), the gradients were fractionated from the top (600-μl fractions) and labeled sequentially as fractions 1–19. The pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of the sucrose solution and taken as fraction 20. All fractions in one tube were assayed in duplicate for marker enzymes, which included vanadate-sensitive plasma membrane ATPase, NADPH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, α-d-mannosidase, and GDPase (29Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity containing fractions (10Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 5080-5088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from all centrifuge tubes were combined and stored at −80 °C until another 3 batches were processed in the same way. The pooled fractions 10–13 from all batches (total volume ≈60 ml) were diluted with 120 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl) and centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100 and concentrated by ultrafiltration under N2 gas in a stirred pressure cell (Amicon) to 20 ml. The concentrated sample was loaded onto phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with 10 ml of the above buffer and then developed with 30 ml of linear gradient of decreasing NaCl (from 1 m to 0m) in the same buffer and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase eluted at 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity were loaded on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (1.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated and developed with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mNaCl (buffer A). Fractions (5 ml each) with PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity were pooled and loaded on a Mono Q 5/5 FPLC column equlibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A and then developed with 40 ml of linear gradient of 0.1–0.4 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity elutes as a sharp peak centered at 230 mm NaCl. The active fractions (1 ml each) were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against storage buffer (50% glycerol, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Brij 35, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at −20 °C. The PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase was assayed essentially as described (13Ling L.E. Schulz J.T. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5080-5088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18012-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (total volume 50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm PtdIns(4)P, 2 mm Triton X-100, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol). The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP, allowed to continue for 5 min at 30 °C, and terminated by an addition of 200 μl of 1 mHCl. The reaction product was extracted with 600 μl of chloroform, methanol, 12 m HCl (200:100:1). The phases were separated by centrifugation, the aqueous phase was removed and discarded, and the organic phase was washed once with 500 μl of methanol, 1m HCl (1:1). The organic phase was then dried in a vacuum concentrator (Savant), resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform, methanol, 12 m HCl (200:100:1), and spotted onto Whatman Silica Gel 150A plates. The plates were developed in chloroform, methanol, water, 15 m ammonium hydroxide (90:90:20:7). Standard phospholipids were visualized with iodine vapor and the reaction products by autoradiography. Radioactivity in the reaction product was determined by scraping the silica gel corresponding to the labeled product and quantitating by scintillation counting. The renaturation assay was performed according to Ref. 13Ling L.E. Schulz J.T. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5080-5088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar with few modifications. Purified PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (650 ng) was incubated in SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8) for 15 min at room temperature. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 8% gel and electrophoresed at 4 °C. After transfer to nitrocellulose using Mini-Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad), the membrane was washed in 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 30 min. The membrane was then cut into 19 sections and each section was incubated individually for 6 h in a buffer containing 200 μg/ml PtdIns(4)P, 400 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 1 mm Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of methanol, 1 m HCl (1:1) and extracted with 0.3 ml of chloroform. The organic layer was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform:methanol:water (2:1:0.01), and spotted onto Whatman Silica Gel 150A plates. The plates were developed in chloroform, methanol, water, 37% ammonium hydroxide (45:35:8.5:1.5) and PtdIns(4,5)P2 was visualized by autoradiography. Radioactivity was determined by excising the appropriate piece of TLC plate and counting it in a liquid scintillation mixture. Recombinant Cki1 (one of the four homologs of casein kinase I in S. pombe) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and assayed as described (28Wang P.C. Vancura A. Desai A. Carmel G. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12014-12023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (0.2 μg) was incubated with the indicated amounts of Cki1 at 30 °C in 10 μl of the following buffer: 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm ATP. Following the incubation with Cki1, the reaction mixture was diluted to 100 μl with PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase assay buffer, and the activity of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase was determined. The 32P-labeled PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase was subjected to phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analysis essentially as described (30Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 31Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the wet gel was exposed to film (Hyperfilm-MP, Amersham) at room temperature for several hours. The phosphorylated bands corresponding to PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase were excised, the protein extracted overnight in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, mixed with 40 mg of bovine serum albumin, and precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid at −20 °C. Precipitated proteins were washed in 95% ethanol (−20 °C) and subjected to partial hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 90 min at 105 °C. The samples were lyophilized, resuspended in electrophoresis buffer (88% formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water, 50:156:1780, pH 1.9), and separated by electrophoresis on cellulose thin layer plates in a buffer (pyridine/acetic acid/water, 10:100:1890, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 3.5) for 40 min at 900 V. The marker phosphoamino acids were visualized by staining with ninhydrin (0.25% in acetone). Cleavage of proteins byN-chlorosuccinimide was performed as described (32Lischwe M.A. Sung M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4976-4980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Russo G.L. Vandenberg M.T. Yu I.J. Bae Y.-S. Franza Jr., B.R. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20317-20325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The32P-labeled PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase was subjected to SDS-PAGE and the wet gel was exposed to film at room temperature for 4 h. The bands corresponding to the phosphorylated PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase were excised and rinsed in 0.1% (w/v) solution of urea in acetic acid and water (1:1). The gel slices were then incubated in 60 mm N-chlorosuccinimide in the above solution. After 3 washes in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the gel slices were equilibrated in sample loading buffer before electrophoresis on 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The cells were grown in minimal medium to A 600 nm∼ 1.5, harvested, and washed with inositol-free minimal medium, and cultured in 10 ml of the same medium containing 20 μm[3H]inositol (5 μCi/ml) for 16 h. The cells were then harvested, washed with water, resuspended in 2 ml of methanol, and disrupted with glass beads. The homogenate was acidified with 2 ml of 1m HCl and extracted 3 times with 2 ml of chloroform. The combined extracts were washed with 2 ml methanol, 1 m HCl (1:1) and concentrated under stream of nitrogen. TLC analysis was performed as described above and radioactivity corresponding to PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 was determined by excising the appropriate pieces of TLC plate and counting them in a liquid scintillation mixture. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Marker enzymes for subcellular fractions were assayed as described previously (28Wang P.C. Vancura A. Desai A. Carmel G. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12014-12023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity is easily detectable in cell lysates of S. pombe, however, the specific activity depends on the method of cell breakage. Osmotic lysis of spheroplasts consistently yielded about 2-fold higher specific activity of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (∼0.3 nmol/min/mg) than breakage with glass beads. Moreover, PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity was more stable in cell lysates prepared by the former method, probably because osmotic lysis of spheroplasts minimizes proteolysis. Therefore, we chose osmotic lysis of spheroplasts for preparation of cell lysates with PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity. In pilot experiments to determine the subcellular distribution of S. pombe PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase, we found that the PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity was exclusively associated with particulate fractions, no activity was detectable in soluble fraction. When we performed differential centrifugation, almost 80% of the PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity was recovered in pellet fraction sedimenting between 5,000 × g and 25,000 × g (fraction P2). Approximately 10% of the activity was recovered in pellet fractions sedimenting at 5,000 × g (fraction P1) and about 10% of the activity was recovered in pellet fraction sedimenting between 25,000 × g and 170,000 × g(fraction P3). To determine the subcellular localization of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase, the P2 pellet fraction was further purified on sucrose density gradient and assayed for organelle-specific enzyme markers (28Wang P.C. Vancura A. Desai A. Carmel G. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12014-12023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as for the PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity (Fig. 1). PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase cofractionated with vanadate-sensitive ATPase, which is a marker for the plasma membrane fraction. The peak fraction had 27- and 34-fold higher specific activities of the ATPase and PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase, respectively, than the crude lysate. PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase did not comigrate with marker enzymes for mitochondria (cytochrome c oxidase), endoplasmic reticulum (NADPH-cytochrome c reductase), Golgi apparatus (GDPase), or vacuole (α-mannosidase) (Fig. 1). To further characterize the PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity, we investigated the interactions between the protein and the plasma membrane. The plasma membranes purified by sucrose density gradient were incubated with one of the following: 1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 m Na2CO3, or 1m NH2OH. After the incubation, membranes were centrifuged (170,000 × g) and the supernatants and the pellets were assayed for PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity. The best extraction and the highest specific activity in the supernatant was achieved by 1 m NaCl. More than 90% of the PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase was recovered in the supernatant. Because most of the other proteins remained associated with the membrane, this simple extraction procedure resulted in a further 10-fold purification of the kinase. The solubilization with other reagents resulted in a significantly reduced recovery of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase in the supernatant. However, in this experiment it is difficult to distinguish between the effect of dissociation of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase from the membrane and the effect of the solubilizing reagents on the activity. Nevertheless, this result shows that PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is a peripheral membrane protein and that the association with plasma membrane is mediated by ionic interactions. The salt extract of the plasma membrane fraction was further fractionated by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography on a column of phenyl-Sepharose (Fig. 2 A). This chromatography yielded only modest 3-fold purification. However, when we omitted this step, the quality of resolution in subsequent purification steps suffered. The next purification step featured gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-100 column (Fig. 2 B). PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase eluted as a sharp peak corresponding to molecular mass of 65 kDa. This step efficiently removes high molecular weight contaminants that are difficult to eliminate using other methods. It also removes sodium chloride remaining from the previous step. The final chromatographic step is an anion exchange chromatography over a Mono-Q column (Fig.2 C), and yields a homogenous enzyme preparation with a high specific activity (Table I). Analysis of the preparation by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig.3) reveals that the purified enzyme consists of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa.Table IPurification of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinaseTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgnmol/minnmol/min/mg%-foldCrude extract9,8563,1540.321001Pellet P22,0702,5211.22803.8Sucrose gradient1801,966116234Salt extract161,82811458357Phenyl-Sepharose4.61,31628642894Sephacryl S-1001.3803618251,930Mono Q0.233921,704125,325 Open table in a new tab Figure 3SDS-PAGE and renaturation of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase.

The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose strip was washed, cut into 19 sections, and each section assayed separately for PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity. The only detectable activity corresponded exactly to the position of the Coomassie-stained band and therefore the purified band contains PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (Fig. 3). The kinetic characterization of the enzyme showed that PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is activated by nonpolar detergents and some phospholipids. Variety of detergents (CHAPS, cholate, deoxycholate, digitonin, β-octylglucoside, Triton X-100, Zwittergent 3-14, and Lubrol PX) were tested for their effect on PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity. The highest stimulation of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity was obtained in the presence of Triton X-100, the optimal concentration was found to be 2 mm, followed by an apparent inhibition of activity at concentrations above 2 mm. These results are indicative of surface dilution kinetics (35Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

The formation of this complex required active trypsin, was favored at low pH, and could be reversed by the addition of covalent or non-covalent trypsin inhibitors. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the complex demonstrated that it was an acyl-enzyme complex, formed after an unusual exopeptidase attack on the C-terminal-Arg-Glu-OH sequence by trypsin. The complex could sequester over 50% of the trypsin in a digestion mixture, and as anticipated, the protein was an effective trypsin inhibitor.

The complex could sequester over 50% of the trypsin in a digestion mixture, and as anticipated, the protein was an effective trypsin inhibitor. Proteolysis of native proteins is influenced by higher order structural features of the interaction between substrate and proteinase, in addition to the restrictions imposed by the primary specificity of the proteinase. Proteolysis can be limited, and the rate of digestion of peptide bonds with equivalent primary specificity seems to depend on several parameters, the most important of which is the capability for local flexibility of the polypeptide chain in the region of the scissile bond (reviewed recently in Ref. 1Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Proteolytic enzymes can therefore be used as probes of flexible or exposed regions of a polypeptide chain, to monitor changes in such parameters after conformational shifts such as those elicited by ligand binding, and to generate functional subdomains by excision of accessible connecting regions (2Fontana A.

We have used limited proteolysis as a structural probe of major urinary proteins (MUPs). 1The abbreviations used are: MUP, major urinary protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ESI, electrospray; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; TLCK, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. MUPs are a group of closely related proteins that are secreted into mouse urine and that are members of the lipocalin class of proteins (4Finlayson J.S. Potter M. Runner C.R. J. Natl. Cancer.

Behav. 1998; 55: 1285-1297Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or to protect them from, for example, atmospheric oxidation. We have become interested in the role of these proteins in ligand binding and release and in the ability of proteolysis to affect the loss of ligands by disruption of the structure of the native holoprotein. Further, an N-terminal MUP-derived hexapeptide may be important in communicating additional chemosignals (11Mucignat-Caretta C. Caretta A. Cavaggioni A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 517-522Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and we have explored the role of proteolysis in the generation, or destruction, of this motif. As part of this investigation we have exposed MUPs to different proteinases and analyzed the products. Digestion by trypsin yielded an unusual pattern of behavior, specifically, the generation of substantial amounts of a high mass covalent complex of trypsin and MUP, which we have characterized. Pooled urine was collected from unanesthetized mice by bladder massage from mature BALB/c males, housed together in groups of 8–16 using a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle and given free access to food and water. Immediately after collection, the urine was desalted on 5-ml “spun columns” of Sephadex G-25, previously equilibrated with water, and further concentrated with Centricon centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Stonehouse, Gloucester, United Kingdom) with anM r = 10,000 cut-off. The resultant stock solutions contained MUPs at 40–60 mg/ml (E 2801% = 6.1). This pool comprises a mixture of very similar allelic variants (12Robertson D.H.L. Cox K.A. Gaskell S.J. Evershed R.P. Beynon R.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but when we have resolved these variants by ion exchange chromatography, we have observed no difference in behavior during limited proteolysis 2C. Wu, D. H. L. Robertson, S. J. Hubbard, S. J. Gaskell, and R. J. Beynon, unpublished observations. and we have routinely used the mixed pool. The mixture of proteins in the preparation differ in conservative substitutions of only four amino acids (12Robertson D.H.L. Cox K.A. Gaskell S.J. Evershed R.P. Beynon R.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This pool of very similar allellomorphs is referred to in the singular, as MUP, in this paper. Trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) from porcine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co, Poole, Dorset, UK) was incubated with MUPs in a volume of 120 μl with 1:1 (by weight) enzyme/substrate ratio. Incubation time, temperature, and pH were varied in different experiments. The pH was buffered as follows: chloroacetate, pH 3.0; formate, pH 4.0; benzoate, pH 5.0; maleate, pH 6.0; Hepes, pH 7.0–8.0; borate, pH 9.0–10.0; and CAPS, pH 11.0. All buffers were 20 mm, and the ionic strength was adjusted to 0.1 m with NaCl. Buffers were thermodynamically corrected for temperature and ionic strength effects (http://www.bi.umist.ac.uk/buffers.html). Where other reactants, such as soybean trypsin inhibitor and TLCK were included, they were dissolved in buffer (10 mg/ml) or methanol (5 mm), respectively. Carboxypeptidase B was added from a 10 mg/ml stock as supplied by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, East Sussex, UK). Enzyme reactions were stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,500 rpm. The pellets were washed 2–3 times with 200 μl of diethyl ether to remove excess trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to separation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in 17.5% acrylamide gels (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis, Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned at 300 pixels per inch in an 8-bit grayscale and analyzed using Quantifier software (Phoretix International, Newcastle, UK). The relationship between band volume and amount of protein was linear over the range used in the experiment 0–100 μm MUP (r = 0.98). In some experiments, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, UK) by electroblotting overnight at a constant 30 V in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3). The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in a 1:1000 rabbit anti-MUP serum solution in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween (v/v), pH 7.3) and visualized by a 1-h incubation with 1:3000 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, UK) followed by a further incubation with a mixture of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). Proteins from SDS-gels were also blotted on to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11.0). After a brief staining with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue in 40% (v/v) methanol, 1% (v/v) acetic acid, the desired protein bands were cut from the membrane and subjected to 5 cycles of Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 476A protein sequencer. For electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI/MS), the pellets recovered after proteolysis were redissolved with gentle heating for a few seconds on a boiling water bath in a 100-μl ESI/MS mobile phase (50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid). Spectra were acquired on a Quattro triple quadropole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) fitted with an electrospray ionization source and upgraded to Quattro II specifications. The instrument was tuned and calibrated with a 20 pmol/μl solution of horse heart myoglobin made up in 50% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Samples were introduced into the source at 10 μl/min. Scanning was fromm/z 950 to 1500 at 10 s/scan. Twenty to thirty scans were averaged to produce the final spectra. Data acquisition, instrument control, and post-run processing were by the VG MassLynx software (Micromass). Mass assignments were made from maximum entropy-processed data (14Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J. Green B.N. Jarvis S.A. Skilling J. Rapid. Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 707-711Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The protein masses thus calculated were within 2 Da of the cDNA-inferred masses (12Robertson D.H.L. Cox K.A. Gaskell S.J. Evershed R.P. Beynon R.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and repeated measurements over a 6-month period of three of the proteins yielded mass assignments of 18644.2 ± 0.78 Da, 18694 ± 0.84 Da, and 18708.2 ± 1.75 Da (mean ± S.D., n = 10 for each protein). Anion-exchange chromatography was on an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fitted with a Resource-Q column (V t = 6 ml). The column was equilibrated with 20 ml of 50 mmformate buffer, pH 5.0, before application of 500 μl of the tryptic digest of MUP (1 mg/ml MUP, 7 mg/ml trypsin, pH 4.0, incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mm formate, pH 5.0). The column was developed using a 100-ml linear salt gradient (0–1m NaCl) at a flow rate of 6.0 ml/min. Protein fractions were collected and reconcentrated with Centricon (Amicon) centrifugal concentrators. Anhydrotrypsin was prepared by a published method (15Ako H. Foster R.J. Ryan C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 47: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with some modifications, and purified by affinity chromatography. Porcine pancreatic trypsin (200 mg) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (70 mg), dissolved in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm CaCl2, were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with occasional additions of 20 mm NaOH to maintain the pH at 7.0. Trypsin activity was monitored throughout the incubation period. The reaction was stopped by adjusting the pH to 3.0 with 1 m HCl. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of 1 mm HCl at 4 °C. The solution of phenylmethylsulfonyl trypsin thus obtained was brought to 50 mm KOH at 0 °C and incubated for 12 min, then adjusted to pH 5.0 with formic acid to stop the reaction. The mixture was finally adjusted to pH 8.0 by the addition of 2m Tris/HCl. Affinity chromatography of the anhydrotrypsin was performed on immobilized soybean trypsin inhibitor (Pierce & Warriner, Chester, UK) packed in a 5-ml spun column. Typically 2 ml of gel was used with a capacity of 20 mg of trypsin per ml of gel. The column was equilibrated with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, before application of 10 ml (20 mg) of anhydrotrypsin. The bound material was washed with 20 ml of the same buffer and eluted with 3 ml of 100 mm sodium chloroacetate buffer, pH 2.0. The anhydrotrypsin thus purified was concentrated/desalted with centrifugal concentrators. The final concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically (E 2801% = 14.7). Tryptic activity at 25 °C toward Bz-Arg-4-nitroanilide was monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 405 nm. MUP, MUP1/9–161, and the synthetic peptides, SLQARE and SLQAR, were tested for trypsin inhibitory properties at low pH in a total volume of 1 ml of assay solution consisting of 20 mmformate, pH 4.0, 0.2 mm N α-benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-nitroanilide, 2.1 μm trypsin. The concentrations of potential inhibitors ranged from 0 to 25 μm. Purified MUPs comprise over 98% of the proteins in mouse urine and were used after desalting but without further purification. This preparation comprises a mixture of MUPs with a high level of sequence identity, differing in only 4 of 162 amino acids (9Robertson D. Hurst J.L. Hubbard S.J. Gaskell S.J. Beynon R.J. J. Chem. Ecol. 1998; 24: 1127-1140Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), each with a molecular mass of approximately 18–19 kDa. When the MUP mixture (referred to subsequently in the singular) was treated with trypsin, a product band (MUP′), approximately 1 kDa smaller than the MUP, was formed quite rapidly and was resistant to further proteolysis (Fig.1 a). Thus, proteolysis was limited and was consistent with removal of short peptide fragments from the N and/or C termini of the molecule. However, SDS-PAGE analysis also demonstrated an unexpected outcome of the proteolytic reaction. Specifically, additional bands, predominantly in the region of 40 kDa and to a lesser extent at 32 kDa, appeared on the gel. These bands were not present in the starting materials and were not formed when the two proteins were incubated singly under identical conditions. In this proteolytic reaction, the digestion was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). When the reaction was stopped using SDS-PAGE sample buffer, without acid precipitation, no higher molecular weight bands were evinced. These bands were present in the presence or absence of reducing agents during SDS-PAGE, precluding the possibility of disulfide-linked complexes. The amount of the high mass complexes that were formed was dependent on the concentration of both trypsin and MUP (Fig. 1 b). The precise pattern of limited proteolytic attack on MUP was defined by electrospray mass spectrometry. We have demonstrated previously that ESI/MS combined with maximum entropy data analysis is a powerful method of MUP characterization and is able to identify several gene products that are consistent (within 2 Da) with cDNA-predicted molecular masses (12Robertson D.H.L. Cox K.A. Gaskell S.J. Evershed R.P. Beynon R.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Evershed R.P. Robertson D.H.L. Beynon R.J. Green B.N. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ESI/MS analysis of the undigested MUP mixture identified three masses, 18646, 18694, and 18708 Da, each of which is consistent with a different, but intact, MUP in urine (12Robertson D.H.L. Cox K.A. Gaskell S.J. Evershed R.P. Beynon R.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After tryptic digestion, the overall distribution of peaks remained the same but the pattern had shifted down the mass scale, to 17699, 17746, and 17760 Da, by measured decrements of 948, 947, and 948 Da, respectively (Fig. 2). The mass decrements and SDS-PAGE data are thus consistent and suggest the removal of an N-terminal or a C-terminal peptide. However, the loss of approximately 948 Da cannot be explained by a simple hydrolytic release of a C- or N-terminal peptide, generated by cleavage at the first or last tryptic sites in the sequence. Specifically, cleavage at the first tryptic site in the sequence: NH2-EEASSTGR↓NFNVEF … would yield new masses lower by 817 Da. An additional loss of 129 Da, provided by a second hydrolysis at the C-terminal end of the molecule, … CLQAR161↓E162 yields a loss of 946 Da. N-terminal sequencing would have only revealed the new N terminus, and the CLQAR161↓E162-OH cleavage, an exopeptidase attack, would not normally be considered a cleavage site for trypsin. The product of the N- and C-terminal proteolysis on the same substrate molecule is designated as MUP9–161. Both the N and C termini of MUP are flexible, and the C terminus cannot be visualized in the crystal structure (17Bocskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E.V. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B.C. North A.C.T. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Proteolytic attack at the extrema is therefore explicable in terms of accessibility of the termini of the protein, although the exopeptidase attack was unexpected. The 40-kDa band was also unexpected, as there were no species of that size, or larger, in the initial incubation mixtures. When probed by Western blotting with a MUP polyclonal antibody it was evident that the 40-kDa species contained MUP (results not shown). The 40-kDa band was also blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to automated Edman degradation. Three sequences could be identified (a) IVGGY … , at 6–8 pmol; (b) EEA … , at 4 pmol; and (c) NFNVE … , at 4 pmol. The first is attributable to trypsin, the second to the N-terminal sequence of unproteolyzed MUP, and the third to the N-terminal sequence of the MUP9 –C terminus. Thus, the complex contained both MUP and trypsin, and the amounts of each protein were consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry, as predicted by the mass of the complex. The 40-kDa complex was stable to the conditions of SDS-PAGE and was likely therefore to be a covalent complex of trypsin and MUP (referred to hereafter as T-MUP) which is trapped by the virtually instantaneous denaturation by trichloroacetic acid and concomitant inactivation of trypsin. If one or the other protein components was first denatured with trichloroacetic acid before addition of the second protein, the complex was not formed. Further, the appearance of two MUP-derived N-terminal sequences in the complex suggested that the complex could also be formed by MUP9 –C terminus. To test this directly, the tryptic product MUP9–C terminus was prepared by tryptic digestion and subsequently purified and separated from trypsin and unproteolyzed MUP on anion-exchange chromatography (MonoQ FPLC). This product (MUP9 –C terminus) was then reincubated with trypsin. Under these circumstances, the T-MUP complex was formed once again (results not shown). If trypsin was preincubated with the irreversible inhibitor TLCK (Fig.3 a), no complex could be generated, demonstrating the requirement for active enzyme. TLCK alkylates the active site histidyl residue and reduces the nucleophilicity of the active site seryl residue. TLCK-modified trypsin is unable to bind to immobilized peptides with a C-terminal argininyl residue (18Chowdhury S.K. Katta V. Chait B.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 4: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), consistent with some element of steric hindrance of the complex formation as well. In a further experiment, MUP was digested with trypsin for a fixed period, after which time a stoichiometric excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor was added. The complex could not be detected after addition of the soybean trypsin inhibitor (Fig.3 b). Thus the strength of the interaction between the soybean inhibitor and trypsin is sufficient to sequester trypsin, at the expense of the T-MUP complex. This is good evidence for a reversible but covalent association of proteinase and substrate. The need for catalytically active trypsin and the role of the active site nucleophile were further confirmed by experiments in which MUP was incubated with anhydrotrypsin (Fig. 3 c). Under such conditions, the complex was not formed. The formation of the T-MUP complex was strongly dependent on pH (Fig.4 a). Trypsin and MUP were reacted in buffers from pH 4 and pH 11 at a constant ionic strength. Proteolysis of the MUP, leading to the formation of MUP9–161, was evident at pH values of 6 and above, in accordance with the known pH optimum of trypsin. By contrast, complex formation was most evident at low pH values, and as the pH of the incubation increased, less of the complex was visible. At pH 4.0, approximately half of the MUP and trypsin was sequestered into the complex, as estimated by densitometry (Fig. 4 b). The complex is formed preferentially at low pH, under conditions in which the hydrolytic activity of trypsin would be expected to be minimal. Indeed, the lack of digestion of MUP at low pH (below pH 6.0) is evident from the SDS-PAGE analysis. However, electrospray mass spectrometry of the digestion reactions at three pH values indicated that although the N-terminal endopeptidase cleavage was suppressed at low pH values, the C-terminal exopeptidase reaction still took place (TableI). Formation of the complex between MUP or MUP9–161 and trypsin seems to preclude an intermediate derived directly from, and as an obligatory outcome of, the hydrolysis of the N-terminal octapeptide. Another possible explanation for complex formation would be a transpeptidation reaction, in which MUP9–161 was transferred to the N terminus of a second molecule of trypsin or MUP, which acted as an acceptor. This however is disproved by recovery of both the intact N-terminal trypsin sequence and the MUP sequence from the complex. Taken together, the data imply that the 40-kDa product is a stoichiometric, probably acyl-enzyme, complex between trypsin and MUP.Table IEffect of pH on tryptic proteolysis of MUPsTrypsin digestionpH 4.0pH 7.0pH 11.0Control18690.7 ± 0.7 Da+ trypsin18563.5 ± 0.4 Da18562.9 ± 0.4 Da17745.0 ± 0.3 Da17745.9 ± 0.6 DaΔMass−127.2 Da−127.8 Da−945.7 Da−944.8 DaInterpretationEEASSTGRNFN. . . . . . .

The reaction was terminated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and the MUP digestion products were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Open table in a new tab Trypsin (70 μm) and MUP (85 μm) were incubated for 5 min in formate (pH 4.0), Hepes (pH 7.0), or CAPS (pH 11.0) buffers, adjusted with NaCl to a constant ionic strength of 0.1m (see “Materials and Methods”). The reaction was terminated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and the MUP digestion products were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The formation of the complex seemed therefore to be associated with the unusual cleavage of the C-terminal glutamate residue. The role of the C-terminal, exposed Arg-161 was elaborated by an additional experiment in which MUP9–161 was treated with carboxypeptidase B to remove the C-terminal Arg-161 before incubation with trypsin (Fig.5). In this instance, formation of the complex was completely abolished, irrespective of the pH at which the reaction was conducted. This experiment also suggested that the complex was formed reversibly, since a C-terminal argininyl residue would not be susceptible to exopeptidase attack if the MUP was covalently and irreversibly linked via its C terminus to the catalytic seryl residue of trypsin. Since the complex is completely destroyed by incubation with the carboxypeptidase, it is reasonable to assume that the binding between proteolyzed MUP (with C-terminal arginine intact) and trypsin is rapid, favoring significant quantities of the complex. We have made repeated attempts to observe the intact complex by electrospray mass spectrometry. Previous electrospray mass spectrometric analyses of trypsin (19Ashton D.E. Ashcroft A.E. Beddell C.R. Cooper D.J. Green B.N. Oliver R.W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Kasai K. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), however, have indicated significant heterogeneity, and it has proved impossible to purify a trypsin variant that yields a single peak. Trypsin was incubated with a mixture of three MUPs at low pH, and the complex was trapped by precipitation before redissolution and analysis by ESI/MS. The three MUPs (starting masses 18646, 18694, and 18708 Da) were all completely converted into products (18518, 18565, and 18581 Da) that indicated trypsin-mediated exopeptidase cleavage of the C-terminal Glu-162. In the 42-kDa region of the mass spectrum, three peaks were also identified (Fig. 6). Each of these was within 4 Da of the predicted mass of the (MUP isoform1-161) + trypsin − 17 Da. The masses of the three peaks are therefore consistent with formation of an acyl-enzyme complex between MUP1–161 and trypsin. Quantitative estimates of the ratio of complex to unbound MUPs could not be derived from the ESI/MS data, but SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that as much as 40% of a stoichiometric mixture of trypsin and MUP is sequestered as the complex (Fig. 4 b). Why such a large proportion of trypsin should be sequestered into this T-MUP complex, particularly at low pH values, is unclear. It might be argued that the low pH conditions act in two ways. First, suppression of the C-terminal carboxylate charge might favor enhanced binding of the C-terminal arginine-exposed peptide to the substrate-binding site of trypsin. Second, the lowered concentration of the nucleophilic hydroxyl ion would favor accumulation of a covalent catalytic intermediate that would normally be attacked by this species. This hypothesis has also been invoked to explain the effect of lowered pH on the enhanced peptide synthesis activity of trypsin (18Chowdhury S.K. Katta V. Chait B.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 4: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ability of trypsin to catalyze peptide bond synthesis is strong support of the existence of such acyl or tetrahedral complexes. However, these reaction intermediates are generally thought to be transient, and the accumulation that is seen in the present example is surprising. The sequestration of large amounts of trypsin into the T-MUP complex implies that the MUPs should be capable of acting as trypsin inhibitors. This was tested by monitoring the ability of MUPs to alter the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate Bz-Arg-4-nitroanilide at low pH values, where the complex is particularly favored (Fig. 7). As anticipated, MUPs are weak trypsin inhibitors, but we do not ascribe any physiological significance to this observation. The unexpected accumulation of large quantities of a proteinase·substrate complex raised the possibility that the structure of MUP was an important contributory factor, and that the three-dimensional structure of the protein favors the accumulation or stabilization of the covalent intermediate. The structures of the C and N termini of MUPs are not visible by x-ray crystallography (17Bocskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E.V. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B.C. North A.C.T. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and are generally held to be mobile segments which would be expected to be accessible to proteolytic attack (1Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 2Fontana A. Polverino de Laureto P. De Fillipis V. Scaramella V. Zambonin M. Fold. Design. 1997; 2: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Indeed, simple molecular modeling experiments have shown that a plausible covalent complex can be formed between trypsin and the MUP C terminus without introducing any contentious intra- or intermolecular stereochemistry. Furthermore, this can be achieved without breaking the Cys-64–Cys-156 disulfide bond. To test the ability of trypsin to bind unstructured C-terminal peptides, we synthesized two peptides SLQARE and SLQAR. The first is the full C-terminal hexapeptide sequence of MUP, with the substitution of a seryl for a cysteinyl residue to obviate peptide dimerization through disulfide bonds. The second is the C-terminal sequence after removal of the glutamyl residue and is thus equivalent to the C-terminal sequence of MUP9–161. Both peptides were weak trypsin inhibitors (Fig. 7), and the shorter of the two was more potent. This may reflect the need for exopeptidase attack on the longer peptide. Trypsin was incubated with the peptides SLQAR or SLQARE, and the reaction products were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Fig.8). Trypsin was resolved as multiple peaks, and a second set of peaks, offset by approximately 557 Da, was also observed. These are consistent with addition of the peptide SLQAR to trypsin and loss of a water molecule as a consequence of formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The mass difference between trypsin and the peptide-acyl-enzyme adduct is not sufficient to be visible on SDS-PAGE, and we have already noted that ESI/MS cannot yield accurate measurements of the relative abundance of the different peaks. It is therefore not possible to assess the amount of the complex that was formed with the short peptides. Complex formation does not appear to be critically dependent on the three-dimensional structure of MUP, although the protein/protein interaction might enhance the amount of complex that is formed (Fig. 9).Figure 9Schematic of the route of formation of the T-MUP complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has long been recognized that trypsin is able to bind peptides that have an exposed C-terminal lysine or arginine residue. Indeed, this is the basis of the methods of recovery of such peptides using anhydrotrypsin as a trapping matrix (20Kasai K. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Chung S.Y. Ullah A.H.J. Sanders T.H. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1994; 42: 623-628Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is generally held that the association reflects non-covalent binding of the C-terminal residue to the specificity pocket. There has not, to our knowledge, been any indication previously that the interaction with intact trypsin might be covalent and reflect a partial reversal of the hydrolytic reaction. Obviously, the acyl or tetrahedral complex must be formed with the carbonyl group of one of the substrates when trypsin functions as a peptide synthetase; the amino group of the N-terminal donor then attacks this complex (reviewed in Ref. 22Kasche V. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 125-143Google Scholar). However, this reaction is relatively weak, and significant accumulation of acylated enzyme would be surprising. It remains to be seen whether such complexes involving C-terminal basic residues are a generic feature of trypsin catalysis or even whether the phenomenon can be extended to other serine proteases. In this respect, the recent structural elucidation of an acyl-enzyme complex between porcine pancreatic elastase and a heptapeptide, trapped at low pH values (23Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Robinson C.V. Roach P.L. Aplin R.T. Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is particularly relevant, as is the formation of SDS-stable complexes between serine proteases and serpins (24Christensen S. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Nielsen H.R. Roepstorff P. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14859-14862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in the latter example, the evidence pointed to covalent links additional to that generated in the acyl-enzyme complex. In this respect, the data presented here are simpler, as they clearly identify the role of the active site seryl residue. There may be new applications that can make use of the covalent trapping, should this association manifest itself as a common occurrence. For example, recovery of peptides that have a C-terminal argininyl residue would be enhanced at low pH values where adventitious tryptic endoproteolysis would be avoided. Such a tool may lend itself to methods of peptide analysis by mass spectrometry where, for example, a combined trypsin-peptide complex could be recovered. An endoproteolytic treatment at neutral pH might be followed by an acidification, in which case the only free peptide would be the C-terminal peptide. This additional identification tag might enhance the identification of the parent protein, which, together with new methods of N-terminal analysis (25Summerfield S.G. Bolgar M.S. Gaskell S.J. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1997; 32: 225-231Crossref Google Scholar), could reduce the complexity of the identification problem in proteome analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2027876842,"The platelet high affinity binding site for thrombin appears to be described by a classical receptor-ligand interaction that is distinct from the platelet thrombin receptor/substrate, PAR-1. However, the identification and function of the high affinity binding site with respect to its physiological importance have continued to elude investigators. Prior studies using two mutant thrombins suggested that thrombin interaction with the platelet high affinity binding site is mediated through an extensive portion of the thrombin molecule involving residues within the substrate binding pocket and the anion binding exosite (Leong, L., Henriksen, R. A., Kermode, J. C., Rittenhouse, S. E., and Tracy, P. B. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 2567–2575) and may mimic a thrombin-hirudin interaction.

The Ab recognized adherent platelets and those in suspension as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively.125I-Thrombin binding to platelets was inhibited in the presence of the anti-hirpeptide Ab in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition >90%. Analyses of data from binding studies of 125I-thrombin to platelets at a fixed Ab concentration indicated that the anti-hirpeptide Ab inhibited the high affinity binding interaction exclusively. In addition, thrombin-induced increases in platelet [Ca2+]iwere enhanced by blocking the high affinity binding site with the Ab due to redistribution of the agonist to PAR-1. Thrombin Quick I-induced platelet calcium mobilization was unaffected by the presence of the Ab, consistent with the inability of thrombin Quick I to bind to the high affinity site. Even though glycoprotein (GP) Ib contains a hirudin-like region within the α subunit, the postulated high affinity binding site, direct binding of 125I-thrombin could not be demonstrated to transfected Chinese hamster ovary and L cells expressing the GP Ib-IX-V complex. Furthermore, an anti-GP Ib Ab, raised to the peptide region proposed as the thrombin high affinity site, did not enhance thrombin-induced platelet calcium mobilization. The anti-hirpeptide Ab recognized a population of platelet membrane proteins distinct from PAR-1 and GP Ib by three-color immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. These combined studies demonstrate that the high affinity binding site for thrombin is a unique platelet protein distinct from GP Ib which modulates the effective thrombin concentration localized at the human platelet surface.

In addition, it has been proposed that kininogen binding to GP Ib-IX-V modulates thrombin binding to platelets and subsequent aggregation (9Bradford H.N. Dela Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.-F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, definitive isolation of the high affinity binding site for thrombin on platelets has not been accomplished. The focus of this investigation is to characterize the identity and function of the platelet high affinity binding site for thrombin. Thrombin interaction with the high affinity binding site on platelets is governed by a K d ≈ 0.1–4.0 nm at 50–1,200 sites as determined by dissociable, equilibrium binding techniques (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Martin B.M. Wasiewski W.W. Fenton J.W. Detwiler T.C.

Additional studies from our laboratory with native human thrombin and two mutant thrombins, thrombin Quick I and thrombin Quick II, demonstrate that thrombin binding to the platelet surface is mediated through an extensive portion of the thrombin surface, involving residues near the substrate binding pocket and the anion binding exosite (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Studies characterizing thrombin Quick I and thrombin Quick II binding to platelets (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) together with studies examining the binding of hirudin to these mutant thrombins (10Stone S.R. Schmitz T. Henriksen R.A. Hofsteenge J. Dodt J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6392-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) led to our hypothesis that the conformation of the platelet high affinity binding site for thrombin resembles hirudin. The amino acid substitution of Val for Gly at position 558 [226] 2Human thrombin residues are numbered according to the human prothrombin sequence (11Degan S.J.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Davie E.W.

Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9160-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thrombin Quick II has decreased binding affinity for hirudin, suggesting that the conformation of the active site cleft is not optimal for binding hirudin (10Stone S.R. Schmitz T. Henriksen R.A. Hofsteenge J. Dodt J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6392-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Decreased affinity of thrombin Quick II for a hirudin mutant with substitutions in the amino terminus implies that this region of hirudin interacts near the active site of thrombin (10Stone S.R. Schmitz T. Henriksen R.A. Hofsteenge J. Dodt J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6392-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, thrombin Quick II binding to platelets (K d ≈ 3.3–9.5 nm) is decreased by 1 order of magnitude compared with thrombin (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We postulated that the conformational changes in Quick II which limit access of hirudin to the active site must influence interactions between platelets and the anion binding exosite, the primary site of dissociable equilibrium binding. Thrombin Quick I, containing an Arg382 → Cys [67] amino acid substitution within the anion binding exosite, does not demonstrate high affinity binding to the platelet surface (K d ≈ 0.17–0.27 μm) (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The affinity of thrombin Quick I for full-length hirudin is 104-fold less compared with thrombin (10Stone S.R. Schmitz T. Henriksen R.A. Hofsteenge J. Dodt J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6392-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Truncated hirudin, lacking the COOH-terminal tail region, is a competitive inhibitor of thrombin Quick I, suggesting that the interactions that occur between thrombin and the COOH-terminal extension of hirudin are completely disrupted in the mutant thrombin (10Stone S.R. Schmitz T. Henriksen R.A. Hofsteenge J. Dodt J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6392-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The decreased affinity of thrombin Quick I for platelets is comparable in magnitude to its decreased affinity for hirudin. Taken together with the studies using Quick II, we hypothesized that the interaction of thrombin with the high affinity binding site on platelets occurs such that the active site of thrombin is directed toward the platelet surface and involves regions of the anion binding exosite as well as those near the active site. The platelet high affinity binding site for thrombin is distinct from the seven-transmembrane domain platelet thrombin receptor/substrate, PAR-1, which mediates thrombin-induced platelet activation events described by the formation of a Michaelis complex (14Hayes K.L.

Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that in the presence of anti-TR32–46, a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide spanning the thrombin cleavage site within PAR-1, the platelet intracellular calcium mobilization induced by thrombin and thrombin Quick I is inhibited >90% (14Hayes K.L.

Platelet activation induced by thrombin Quick I proceeds through PAR-1 and requires 10-fold more enzyme to yield responses equal in magnitude to thrombin stimulation (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, platelet activation does not require the high affinity binding site because saturation of the high affinity binding site with FPR-thrombin, although not inducing platelet activation, enhances the activation response to thrombin stimulation (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that thrombin Quick I does not demonstrate high affinity binding to the platelet surface at concentrations that effect platelet activation, nor does active site blocked thrombin increase its agonist activity (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these combined observations, we hypothesized that the platelet high affinity binding site for thrombin mimics the conformation of the COOH terminus of hirudin. We generated an anti-hirudin peptide antibody (anti-hirpeptide Ab) and demonstrated that it recognizes human platelets. The anti-hirpeptide Ab was used as a tool to characterize the interaction between thrombin and its high affinity binding site on the platelet surface. We further described the functional role of the high affinity binding site with respect to thrombin-induced platelet activation responses. In addition, we explored the relationship of the high affinity binding site with GP Ib and PAR-1.

Active site-blocked thrombin (FPR-thrombin) was prepared usingd-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone as described previously (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B.

Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Molecular weights and extinction coefficients,E 280 nm, 1 cm[1%], used were taken as follows: prothrombin, 72,000, 14.2 (20Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); thrombin, 37,000, 17.4 (21Fenton J.W. II Landis B.H. Walz D.A. Findlayson J.S. Lundblad R.L. Fenton J.W. II Mann K.G.

Thrombin and active site-blocked thrombin were radioiodinated using a modified IODO-GEN transfer technique as described previously (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The labeled thrombins were >95% precipitable with 10% trichloroacetic acid, with specific radioactivities of 2,200–2,500 cpm/ng. Radioiodinated thrombin retained full clotting activity (∼3,000 NIH units/mg). Washed platelets were prepared as described previously (14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For most experiments, washed platelets were suspended in 5 mm HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (0.137m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mmNaHCO2, 0.36 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dextrose), pH 7.4, with 0.35% bovine serum albumin (HEPES Tyrode's albumin) at 37 °C. CaCl2 was omitted from the wash solutions for experiments measuring intraplatelet [Ca2+]. In some experiments, platelets were pretreated with 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid and 0.5 μm prostaglandin E1 in platelet-rich plasma for 30 min before washing. Based on binding studies with the mutant thrombins, the most significant interactions involved in thrombin binding to hirudin occur between its anion binding exosite and the COOH-terminal region of hirudin. Therefore, a peptide mimicking the COOH-terminal region of full-length hirudin was designed. The peptide RNPNDGDFEEIPEEYLQNE was synthesized manually as a peptide amide using 4-methylbenzhydralamine and t-butyloxycarbonyl-blocked amino acids with an additional COOH-terminal cysteine for coupling as described previously (22Church W.R. Messier T. Howard P.R. Amiral J. Meyer D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6259-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, peptides representing the hirudin-like regions found in PAR-1 and platelet GP Ibα were synthesized according to the same procedure. The PAR-1 peptide sequence was YEPFWEDEEKNESGLTEY, representing residues 52–69, whereas the GP Ibα peptide sequence was DEGDTDLYDYYPEEDTEGD, representing residues 269–287. All peptides were purified by HPLC. Peptide compositions and concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis performed by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch Cancer Center. The peptides are designated as follows: the COOH-terminal hirudin peptide, hirpeptide; the PAR-1 peptide, TR52–69; and the GP Ibα peptide, GP Ib269–287. Three rabbit anti-peptide antisera were prepared by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) according to our supplied protocol (14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoglobulins, both nonimmune and specific, were purified using protein A immobilized to Sepharose 4B. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular weight and the extinction coefficient,E 280 nm, 1 cm[1%], for IgG were 150,000 and 14.0, respectively. Specificity of the anti-peptide Abs was assessed by solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) against antigen peptides and an irrelevant peptide, CVPDRGQQYQGR, as described previously (22Church W.R. Messier T. Howard P.R. Amiral J. Meyer D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6259-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-hirpeptide, anti-TR52–69, and anti-GP Ib269–287 Abs recognized their respective antigen peptides. Binding to the irrelevant peptide was not observed. Having demonstrated that the anti-hirpeptide Ab recognized the COOH terminus of hirudin, we evaluated its ability to recognize full-length hirudin. Hirudin inhibition of thrombin-catalyzed chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was examined in the presence of anti-hirpeptide Ab. Hirudin (6 nm) was preincubated with 0–500 nm anti-hirpeptide Ab for 3 min followed by the addition of 5 nm thrombin in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4. Thrombin activity was monitored by hydrolysis of 0.25 mm Spectrozyme TH over 15 min. Hirudin inhibition of thrombin proteolytic activity was reversed ≈ 50% by the presence of the anti-hirpeptide Ab (500 nm) compared with inhibition in the absence of anti-hirpeptide Ab (data not shown). These data indicate that the anti-hirpeptide Ab recognizes the COOH-terminal region of hirudin within the full-length protein. Based on our hypothesis that the conformation of the high affinity binding site resembles hirudin, we anticipated that the anti-hirpeptide Ab would bind to platelets. To test this prediction, we examined anti-hirpeptide Ab reactivity for platelets by ELISA and immunofluorescence microscopy using techniques described previously (14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Church W.R. Messier T. Howard P.R. Amiral J. Meyer D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6259-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-hirpeptide Ab reacted positively with platelets in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonimmune Ig using both techniques, indicating that the anti-hirpeptide Ab recognizes adherent (Fig. 1) and suspended platelets (data not shown). In control experiments, platelets showed no reactivity toward secondary Ab alone in the immunofluorescent protocols (data not shown). For studies that examined the effect of the anti-hirpeptide Ab on thrombin interaction with platelets, the platelets (2–4 × 108/ml) were preincubated with anti-hirpeptide Ab or nonimmune IgG for 10 min at ambient temperature. Measurements of dissociable, equilibrium binding of 125I-thrombin to platelets and thrombin-induced platelet intracellular calcium flux were performed as described previously (14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines, CHO and fibroblast-like L cells, transfected with GP Ibα, Ibβ, IX, and/or V subunits, were a generous gift from Dr. Jose Lopez, Baylor College of Medicine. The stable CHO and L cell lines have been characterized extensively (23Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12851-12859Google Scholar). Untransfected CHO cells were maintained in α-MEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). CHO βIX cells expressing GP Ibβ and IX subunits were maintained in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml G418. CHO αβIX cells, expressing Ibα, Ibβ, and IX subunits, were maintained in α-MEM with 10% FBS, 400 μg/ml G418, and 80 μmmethotrexate (23Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12851-12859Google Scholar). The L cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. L2H cells expressing Ibα, Ibβ, and IX were maintained in Dulbecco's modified MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium hypoxanthine, 4 μmaminopterin, and 160 μm thymidine. L2H cells expressing GP V were supplemented further with 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 99% humidity. Expression of the GP Ib/IX/V protein subunits was verified using specific monoclonal Ab for each glycoprotein by flow cytometric techniques as described previously (24Lopez J.A. Weisman S. Sanan D.A. Sih T. Chambers M. Li C.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subunits of the complex were labeled with the following antibodies: GP Ibα-AN51 (Dako Corp.), GP IX-FMC-25 (provided by Dr. Jose Lopez), and GP V-CD 42b (Dako). Direct binding of 125I-thrombin to the CHO and L cell lines was performed as described above with minor modifications. Cells were lifted at confluence with 0.54 mm EDTA. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm EDTA, 1% BSA. Cells were counted and adjusted to 1 × 106/ml.125I-Thrombin (1 nm) was added to the cell suspensions, and aliquots were removed over time (0–30 min). Bound and free fractions were separated by centrifugation over oil as described previously (1Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Kermode J.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In other experiments, the binding was determined over a range of thrombin concentrations (0–25 nm). Nonspecific binding was quantified by the addition of unlabeled FPR-thrombin (50 nm) to the 125I-thrombin-cell suspension. Washed platelets (1 × 107/ml) were triple labeled with Ab directed against platelet proteins as described previously (14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ab directed toward PAR-1 and GP Ib were chosen as such because they recognize epitopes other than the hirudin-like regions found within these platelet membrane proteins. To platelets suspended in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer with 20 mm EDTA and 5 μm prostaglandin E1, the following antibodies were added: 2 μmrabbit anti-hirpeptide Ab followed by Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunologicals, Inc.); Cy5-conjugated monoclonal anti-TR32–46 (2 μm), specific for PAR-1 (14Hayes K.L. Leong L. Henriksen R.A. Bouchard B.A. Ouellette L. Church W.R. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and FITC-conjugated monoclonal AN51 (10 μm), specific for platelet GP Ib (Dako). Control platelet samples were labeled with FITC or Cy5-conjugated nonspecific mouse IgG and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Platelets were visualized using the Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal system connected to a Olympus BX50 upright microscope in the Cell Imaging Facility, University of Vermont College of Medicine. The FITC, Texas Red, and Cy5 fluorophores were excited at 488, 568, and 647 nm, respectively, with a krypton/argon laser. Image analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software. The anti-hirpeptide Ab was generated to test the hypothesis that the high affinity binding site for thrombin mimics the conformation of hirudin. Having shown that the anti-hirpeptide Ab re"
