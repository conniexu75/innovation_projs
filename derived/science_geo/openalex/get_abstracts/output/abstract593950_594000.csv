https://openalex.org/W2748362049,"Previous studies have shown that self-esteem is an important predictor of subjective well-being. However, the majority of research has focused on self-esteem at the individual and the collective level, but has mostly ignored self-esteem at the relational level. According to social identity theory, individuals can maintain and enhance self-esteem through personal traits (personal self-esteem, PSE), relationships with significant others (relational self-esteem, RSE), and relationships with larger groups (collective self-esteem, CSE). The current research investigated whether RSE and CSE can predict subjective well-being beyond PSE among Chinese college students. With four cross-sectional studies and one longitudinal study (N = 847), we found that, when controlling for PSE, RSE was associated with greater life satisfaction, positive affect, meaning in life, happiness, and subjective vitality (Studies 1–5), but CSE was not (Studies 2–5). Implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2745631600,"Viral diseases pose a significant threat to the productivity in aquaculture. Heart- and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an emerging disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming. HSMI is associated with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) infection, but PRV is ubiquitous in farmed Atlantic salmon and thus present also in apparently healthy individuals. This has brought speculations if additional etiological factors are required, and experiments focusing on the causal relationship between PRV and HSMI are highly warranted. A major bottleneck in PRV research has been the lack of cell lines that allow propagation of the virus. To bypass this, we propagated PRV in salmon, bled the fish at the peak of the infection, and purified virus particles from blood cells. Electron microscopy, western blot and high-throughput sequencing all verified the purity of the viral particles. Purified PRV particles were inoculated into naïve Atlantic salmon. The purified virus replicated in inoculated fish, spread to naïve cohabitants, and induced histopathological changes consistent with HSMI. PRV specific staining was demonstrated in the pathological lesions. A dose-dependent response was observed; a high dose of virus gave earlier peak of the viral load and development of histopathological changes compared to a lower dose, but no difference in the severity of the disease. The experiment demonstrated that PRV can be purified from blood cells, and that PRV is the etiological agent of HSMI in Atlantic salmon."
https://openalex.org/W2750207702,"This study investigated the potential of bacterial-mediated polyethylene (PE) degradation in a two-phase microcosm experiment. During phase I, naturally weathered PE films were incubated for 6 months with the indigenous marine community alone as well as bioaugmented with strains able to grow in minimal medium with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) as the sole carbon source. At the end of phase I the developed biofilm was harvested and re-inoculated with naturally weathered PE films. Bacteria from both treatments were able to establish an active population on the PE surfaces as the biofilm community developed in a time dependent way. Moreover, a convergence in the composition of these communities was observed towards an efficient PE degrading microbial network, comprising of indigenous species. In acclimated communities, genera affiliated with synthetic (PE) and natural (cellulose) polymer degraders as well as hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were enriched. The acclimated consortia (indigenous and bioaugmented) reduced more efficiently the weight of PE films in comparison to non-acclimated bacteria. The SEM images revealed a dense and compact biofilm layer and signs of bio-erosion on the surface of the films. Rheological results suggest that the polymers after microbial treatment had wider molecular mass distribution and a marginally smaller average molar mass suggesting biodegradation as opposed to abiotic degradation. Modifications on the surface chemistry were observed throughout phase II while the FTIR profiles of microbially treated films at month 6 were similar to the profiles of virgin PE. Taking into account the results, we can suggest that the tailored indigenous marine community represents an efficient consortium for degrading weathered PE plastics."

We considered that using smartphone’s accelerometer to stablish a diagnostic test based on time-frequency differences between PD an ET could support the clinical diagnosis. Methods The study was carried out in 17 patients with PD, 16 patients with ET, 12 healthy volunteers and 7 patients with tremor of undecided diagnosis (TUD), who were re-evaluated one year after the first visit to reach the definite diagnosis. The smartphone was placed over the hand dorsum to record epochs of 30 s at rest and 30 s during arm stretching. We generated frequency power spectra and calculated receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC) curves of total spectral power, to establish a threshold to separate subjects with and without tremor. In patients with PD and ET, we found that the ROC curve of relative energy was the feature discriminating better between the two groups. This threshold was then used to classify the TUD patients. Results We could correctly classify 49 out of 52 subjects in the category with/without tremor (97.96% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity) and 27 out of 32 patients in the category PD/ET (84.38% discrimination accuracy). Among TUD patients, 2 of 2 PD and 2 of 4 ET were correctly classified, and one patient having PD plus ET was classified as PD. Conclusions Based on the analysis of smartphone accelerometer recordings, we found several kinematic features in the analysis of tremor that distinguished first between healthy subjects and patients and, ultimately, between PD and ET patients. The proposed method can give immediate results for the clinician to gain valuable information for the diagnosis of tremor. This can be useful in environments where more sophisticated diagnostic techniques are unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W2746918144,"Recent research has widely investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells and their secretory products, termed the secretome, in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The present study examined the capacity of the conditioned medium (CM) from human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPLSCs) under hypoxia (H-hPDLSCs-CM) to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of MS. To induce EAE, female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein peptide35-55 At the onset of symptoms, H-hPDLSCs-CM was infused via the tail vein of mice. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of H-hPDLSCs-CM treatment in diminishing clinical and histologic disease score. A key finding from this study is the marked expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37, paralleled by the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines in mice with EAE that were treated with H-hPDLSCs-CM. In addition, a consequent modulation of oxidative stress, autophagic, and apoptotic markers was observed in mice with EAE after hPDLSCs-CM administration. In addition, to provide additional evidence of the molecular mechanisms that underlie H-hPDLSCs-CM, we investigated its therapeutic action in scratch injury-exposed NSC-34 neurons, an in vitro model of injury. This model reproduces severe inflammation and oxidative stress conditions as observed after EAE damage. In vitro results corroborate the ability of hPDLSCs-CM to modulate inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptotic pathways. Taken together, our findings suggest H-hPDLSCs-CM as a new pharmacologic opportunity for the management of MS.-Giacoppo, S., Thangavelu, S.

https://openalex.org/W2746749596,"ROCK, or Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase, is a member of the AGC kinase family and has been shown to play a role in cell migration, ECM synthesis, stress-fiber assembly, and cell contraction. Increased ROCK expression has been reported in multiple pathological conditions, including cancer. Here, we report increased expression of ROCK 1 in pancreatic tumor epithelial cells as well as in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF). In our analysis, 62% of tumor samples exhibited ≥2+ in staining intensity by IHC analysis, versus 40% of adjacent normal tissue samples (P<0.0001). Thus, we hypothesized that ROCKs may play a significant role in pancreatic cancer progression, and may serve as a suitable target for treatment. We report a low frequency (4/34) amplification of the ROCK1 gene locus at chromosome 18q11.1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient tissue samples by aCGH analysis. Inhibition of ROCK kinase activity by a small molecule inhibitor (fasudil) resulted in moderate (IC50s of 6–71 μM) inhibition of PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and activation of co-cultured stellate cells. In the KPC mouse model for pancreatic cancer, fasudil decreased tumor collagen deposition. This translated to an enhanced overall survival of the mice and an increase in gemcitabine uptake. Though fasudil may target both the tumor epithelial cells and the CAFs, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of tumor stroma enhances drug penetration and efficacy in PDAC. Overall, our data suggests that ROCK1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target to enhance current treatment regimens for pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2745349880,"Autophagic impairment is implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the molecular mechanism is unclear. We found that autophagic flux was significantly inhibited in 3 murine models of NAFLD. Interestingly, the number of acidic organelles and the level of mature cathepsin D were reduced, suggesting defective lysosome acidification. Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) was induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to the generation of asparagine, which inhibited lysosome acidification. Both steatotic- and asparagine-treated hepatocytes showed reduced lysosomal acidity and retention of lysosomal calcium. Knockdown of ASNS in steatotic hepatocytes restored autophagic flux. As a potential biomarker, increased serum p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) level was an independent risk factor for patients with steatosis and lobular inflammation. Impaired autophagy in NAFLD is elicited by defective lysosome acidification, which is caused by ASNS-induced asparagine synthesis under endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent retention of lysosomal calcium. p62/SQSTM1 could be used as a noninvasive biomarker in the diagnosis of NAFLD patients.-Wang, X., Zhang, X., Chu, E.

https://openalex.org/W2746558777,"There is evidence that food outlet access differs according to level of neighbourhood deprivation but little is known about how individual circumstances affect associations between food outlet access and diet. This study explored the relationship between dietary quality and a measure of overall food environment, representing the balance between healthy and unhealthy food outlet access in individualised activity spaces. Furthermore, this study is the first to assess effect modification of level of educational attainment on this relationship. A total of 839 mothers with young children from Hampshire, United Kingdom (UK) completed a cross-sectional survey including a 20-item food frequency questionnaire to measure diet and questions about demographic characteristics and frequently visited locations including home, children’s centre, general practitioner, work, main food shop and physical activity location. Dietary information was used to calculate a standardised dietary quality score for each mother. Individualised activity spaces were produced by creating a 1000m buffer around frequently visited locations using ArcGIS. Cross-sectional observational food outlet data were overlaid onto activity spaces to derive an overall food environment score for each mother. These scores represented the balance between healthy and unhealthy food outlets using weightings to characterise the proportion of healthy or unhealthy foods sold in each outlet type. Food outlet access was dominated by the presence of unhealthy food outlets; only 1% of mothers were exposed to a healthy overall food environment in their daily activities. Level of educational attainment moderated the relationship between overall food environment and diet (mid vs low, p = 0.06; high vs low, p = 0.04). Adjusted stratified linear regression analyses showed poorer food environments were associated with better dietary quality among mothers with degrees (β = -0.02; 95%CI: -0.03, -0.001) and a tendency toward poorer dietary quality among mothers with low educational attainment, however this relationship was not statistically significant (β = 0.01; 95%CI: -0.01, 0.02). This study showed that unhealthy food outlets, like takeaways and convenience stores, dominated mothers’ food outlet access, and provides some empirical evidence to support the concept that individual characteristics, particularly educational attainment, are protective against exposure to unhealthy food environments. Improvements to the imbalance of healthy and unhealthy food outlets through planning restrictions could be important to reduce dietary inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2749401300,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most common hereditary muscular disorders. Currently FSHD has no known effective treatment and detailed data on the natural history are lacking. Determination of the efficacy of a given therapeutic approach might be difficult in FSHD given the slow and highly variable disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate in vivo the muscle alterations in various neuromuscular disorders. The main aim of the present study was to investigate longitudinally the time-dependent changes occurring in thigh muscles of FSHD patients using quantitative MRI and to assess the potential relationships with the clinical findings. Thirty-five FSHD1 patients (17 females) were enrolled. Clinical assessment tools including manual muscle testing using medical research council score (MRC), and motor function measure (MFM) were recorded each year for a period ranging from 1 to 2 years. For the MRI measurements, we used a new quantitative index, i.e., the mean pixel intensity (MPI) calculated from the pixel-intensity distribution in T1 weighted images. The corresponding MPI scores were calculated for each thigh, for each compartment and for both thighs totally (MPItotal). The total mean pixel intensity (MPItotal) refers to the sum of each pixel signal intensity divided by the corresponding number of pixels. An increased MPItotal indicates both a raised fat infiltration together with a reduced muscle volume thereby illustrating disease progression. Clinical scores did not change significantly over time whereas MPItotal increased significantly from an initial averaged value of 39.6 to 41.1 with a corresponding rate of 0.62/year. While clinical scores and MPItotal measured at the start of the study were significantly related, no correlation was found between the rate of MPItotal and MRC sum score changes, MFMtotal and MFM subscores. The relative rate of MPItotal change was 2.3% (0.5-4.3)/year and was significantly higher than the corresponding rates measured for MRCS 0% (0-1.7) /year and MFMtotal 0% (0-2.0) /year (p = 0.000). On the basis of these results, we suggested that muscle MRI and more particularly the MPItotal index could be used as a reliable biomarker and outcome measure of disease progression. In slowly progressive myopathies such as FSHD, the MPItotal index might reveal subclinical changes, which could not be evidenced using clinical scales over a short period of time."
https://openalex.org/W2746563807,"Introduction We investigate the associations between religious practice and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine-related awareness, knowledge, and receipt among young women in Utah. Methods We surveyed 326 insured women aged 18–26 by mail. Fisher's Exact Tests and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relations between religious practice and HPV vaccine-related outcomes. Data collection occurred January-December 2013; analyses were conducted June-September 2015. Results Multivariable analyses reveal that when controlling for age, educational attainment, and marital status, participants who practiced an organized religion were significantly less likely to have heard of HPV (aOR = 0.25, p = 0.0123), to have heard of the HPV vaccine (aOR = 0.41, p = 0.0368), to know how HPV is spread (aOR = 0.45, p = 0.0074), to have received a provider recommendation for the HPV vaccine (aOR = 0.36, p = 0.0332), and to have received at least one (aOR = 0.50, p = 0.0073) or all three (aOR = 0.47, p = 0.0026) doses of the HPV vaccine. Bivariate analyses produce parallel results. Conclusions Results indicate that religious young women in Utah are not only under-vaccinated, but are also under-informed about HPV and the HPV vaccine. These results suggest that suboptimal vaccine coverage among religious young women may present a serious health risk for the community. Strategies for educational interventions targeted to this population are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2746673021,"The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a serious polyphagous insect pest worldwide. This species is known as a long-distance migrant, and previous studies on its migration have been mostly carried out in regions where it can overwinter. However, what pattern of seasonal migration this species exhibits in regions where it cannot overwinter (i.e., the ‘summer breeding region’) remains unknown. Here, we present data from 14-years of monitoring on a small remote island located in the center of the Bohai Strait, in northern China, by means of searchlight trapping and ovarian dissection. We found that the population size of this overseas migration varied significantly among years, with very large migrations in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2014 that resulted in annual total catches of more than ten thousand individuals. In addition, nightly catches exhibited a significant inter-month variability, with the vast majority of S. exigua moths being trapped in August and September, (81.1 ± 3.6%), making S. exigua one of the most frequently encountered species in that period. The mean time from the earliest trap capture to the latest capture within a given year was 113 ± 22 d (range 57 d [2003] to 138 d [2008]). The sex ratio (females: males) was significantly less than 1:1 in each month, but the proportion of females showed an upward trend from June to October. The majority of trapped females in summer were mated (94.4 ± 10.7% in June, 80.0 ± 6.4% in July) and sexually mature (88.9 ± 11.1% in June, 61.8 ± 12.3% in July), suggesting the onset of mating and/or sexual maturation does not terminate the migration behavior in this species. These findings provide a good starting point for study of the trans-regional migration of S. exigua across different climate zones."
https://openalex.org/W2748196056,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions are neurodegenerative disorders that share the cytosolic deposition of TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) in the CNS. TDP-43 is well known as being actively degraded by both the proteasome and macroautophagy. The well-documented decrease in the efficiency of these clearance systems in aging and neurodegeneration, as well as the genetic evidence that many of the familial forms of TDP-43 proteinopathies involve genes that are associated with them, suggest that a failure of these protein degradation systems is a major factor that contributes to the onset of TDP-43-associated disorders. Here, we inserted preformed human TDP-43 aggregates in the cytosol of murine NSC34 and N2a cells in diffuse form and observed their degradation under conditions in which exogenous TDP-43 is not expressed and endogenous nuclear TDP-43 is not recruited, thereby allowing a time zero to be established in TDP-43 degradation and to observe its disposal kinetically and analytically. TDP-43 degradation was observed in the absence and presence of selective inhibitors and small interfering RNAs against the proteasome and autophagy. We found that cytosolic diffuse aggregates of TDP-43 can be distinguished in 3 different classes on the basis of their vulnerability to degradation, which contributed to the definition-with previous reports-of a total of 6 distinct classes of misfolded TDP-43 species that range from soluble monomer to undegradable macroaggregates. We also found that the proteasome and macroautophagy-degradable pools of TDP-43 are fully distinguishable, rather than in equilibrium between them on the time scale required for degradation, and that a significant crosstalk exists between the 2 degradation processes.-Cascella, R., Fani, G., Capitini, C., Rusmini, P., Poletti, A., Cecchi, C., Chiti, F.

https://openalex.org/W2745344914,"Accurate analysis of placental and fetal oxygenation is critical during pregnancy. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combines laser technology with ultrasound in real time. We tested the sensitivity and accuracy of PAI for analysis of placental and fetal oxygen saturation (sO2) in mice. The placental labyrinth (L) had a higher sO2 than the junctional zone plus decidua region (JZ+D) in C57Bl/6 mice. Changing maternal O2 from 100 to 20% in C57Bl/6 mice lowered sO2 in these regions. C57Bl/6 mice were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) from gestational day (GD) 11 to GD18 to induce hypertension. L-NAME decreased sO2 in L and JZ+D at GD14 and GD18 in association with fetal growth restriction and higher blood pressure. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α immunostaining was higher in L-NAME vs control mice at GD14. Fetal sO2 levels were similar between l-NAME and control mice at GD14 and GD18. In contrast to untreated C57Bl/6, L-NAME decreased placental sO2 at GD14 and GD18 vs GD10 or GD12. Placental sO2 was lower in fetal growth restriction in an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 knockout mouse model characterized by placental hypoxia. On phantom studies, patterns of sO2 measured directly correlated with those measured by PAI. In summary, PAI enables the detection of placental and fetal oxygenation during normal and pathologic pregnancies in mice.-Yamaleyeva, L. M., Sun, Y., Bledsoe, T., Hoke, A., Gurley, S.

https://openalex.org/W2746135725,"The development of antimicrobial resistance is triggered by the use of antibiotic drugs. Therefore, the consumption of antibiotics in livestock is monitored, and different measures may be applied if the usage of antibiotic drugs seems inappropriate. Unfortunately, the surveillance of antibiotic consumption is not standardised, and surveillance systems differ. In Germany, the food quality assurance system QS Qualität und Sicherheit GmbH (QS) began the documentation of antibiotic drug usage in pigs in 2012 in a private economic based database, and for its members, documentation has been mandatory in all pig age groups since 2014. In this investigation, we calculated the distribution of the antibiotics use per pig age group and half-year, and the percentage of the active substances used from overall treatments within German pig holdings from 1 July, 2013 to 30 June, 2015. In fattening pigs, the median of the treatment frequency is 4.3 in 2013-2 and exhibits a decreasing trend in this time period up to 2.1 in 2015-1. In weaners the median ranged between 11.3 in 2014-2 and 5.8 in 2013-2. The median of sucklers varies between 21.6 and 25.0. In sucklers and weaners, a clear temporal trend is not seen to date. The share of the active substances differs between the age groups. In fattening pigs, mostly tetracyclines and penicillines were used, occurring in approximately 60% of the total treatments. In weaners, amoxicillin and colistin have the highest shares of the treatment frequency, at approximately 60%. The treatment frequencies of macrolides and penicillines have the highest share in sucklers."
https://openalex.org/W2747771025,"Purpose To determine the prevalence of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and its long-term survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. Method We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and identified 2,440 breast cancer patients who received NSM during 1998–2013. We used chi-square and binary logistic regression to identify factors associated with the use of radiotherapy after NSM. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). We used the log-rank test and Cox regression to identify factors associated with CSS and OS. Results The median age of the population was 50 years. There were 725 (29.7%), 1064 (43.6%) and 651 (26.7%) patients who had Tis, T1 and T2-3 disease and 1943 (79.6%), 401 (16.4%) and 96 (3.9%) patients who had N0, N1 and N2-3 disease, respectively. The rates of RT use were 61.4%, 39.6% and 10.9% in patients with N2-3 disease, N1 or T3/N0 disease and Tis/T1-2N0 disease, respectively. Elderly age, African American race, and higher T-stage and N-stage were associated with receiving radiotherapy. For patients diagnosed between 1998–2010 (N = 763), the median follow-up was 69 months. The 5- and 10-yr CSS were 96.9% and 94.9%, respectively. The 5- and 10-yr OS were 94.1% and 88.0%, respectively. Ethnicity, T-stage and N-stage were factors independently associated with CSS, and age and T-stage were factors independently associated with OS. Conclusions The use of NSM has increased, and it is oncologically safe for breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2746639395,"Previous studies showed that olfactory cues are important for mammalian communication. However, many specific compounds that convey information between conspecifics are still unknown. To understand mechanisms and functions of olfactory cues, olfactory signals such as volatile compounds emitted from individuals need to be assessed. Sampling of animals with and without scent glands was typically conducted using cotton swabs rubbed over the skin or fur and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, this method has various drawbacks, including a high level of contaminations. Thus, we adapted two methods of volatile sampling from other research fields and compared them to sampling with cotton swabs. To do so we assessed the body odor of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using cotton swabs, thermal desorption (TD) tubes and, alternatively, a mobile GC-MS device containing a thermal desorption trap. Overall, TD tubes comprised most compounds (N = 113), with half of those compounds being volatile (N = 52). The mobile GC-MS captured the fewest compounds (N = 35), of which all were volatile. Cotton swabs contained an intermediate number of compounds (N = 55), but very few volatiles (N = 10). Almost all compounds found with the mobile GC-MS were also captured with TD tubes (94%). Hence, we recommend TD tubes for state of the art sampling of body odor of mammals or other vertebrates, particularly for field studies, as they can be easily transported, stored and analysed with high performance instruments in the lab. Nevertheless, cotton swabs capture compounds which still may contribute to the body odor, e.g. after bacterial fermentation, while profiles from mobile GC-MS include only the most abundant volatiles of the body odor."
https://openalex.org/W2746928349,"This study investigated the effects of manipulating the load components of aerobic training sessions on the physical performance of rats. To achieve this purpose, adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: an untrained control (CON) group and training groups with a predominant overload in intensity (INT) or duration (DUR) or alternating and similar overloads in intensity and duration (ID). Prior to, during, and after 8 weeks of the control or training protocols, the performance of the rats (evaluated by their workload) was determined during fatiguing, incremental-speed treadmill running. Two additional incremental running tests were performed prior to and at the end of the protocols to measure the peak rate of oxygen consumption (VO2peak). As expected, the rats in the trained groups exhibited increased performance, whereas the untrained rats showed stable performance throughout the 8 weeks. Notably, the performance gain exhibited by the DUR rats reached a plateau after the 4th week. This plateau was not present in the INT or ID rats, which exhibited increased performance at the end of training protocol compared with the DUR rats. None of the training protocols changed the VO2peak values; however, these values were attained at faster speeds, which indicated increased running economy. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the training protocols improved the physical performance of rats, likely resulting from enhanced running economy. Furthermore, compared with overload in duration, overload in the intensity of training sessions was more effective at inducing performance improvements across the 8 weeks of the study."

All patients were treated with neoadjuvant CHT, and underwent surgery for local control. All patients had FDG-PET at diagnosis and after CHT, prior to surgery. Several parameters were evaluated: SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume, total lesion glycolysis, 7 textural features and 3 shape features (SF). The segmentation was performed using an adaptive approach. Results were compared to histopathological regression of the resected tumor and to clinical follow-up for survival evaluation.For EWS, univariate analysis did not highlight any prognostic value on histological response, or survival regardless of all the considered metrics. For OST, only one of the SF, namely elongation, was significantly associated with PFS and OS on both univariate and multivariate analysis (PFS: p = 0.019, HR = 5.583; OS: p = 0.0062, HR = 7.113).Only elongation determined on initial FDG-PET has a potential interest as a prognostic factor of PFS and OS in pediatric OST patients. Unlike recent studies of the literature realized in adult population, all the metrics reveal limited additional prognostic value in pediatric EWS patients. This seems to reinforce the question of whether children experience different subtypes of the same pathologies than older patients, with different outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2749077189,"Misiones, Argentina, contains the largest remaining tract of Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest ecoregion; however, ~50% of native forest is unprotected and located in a mosaic of plantations, agriculture, and pastures. Existing protected areas are becoming increasingly isolated due to ongoing habitat modification. These factors, combined with lower than expected regional carnivore densities, emphasize the need to understand the effect of fragmentation on animal movement and connectivity between protected areas. Using detection dogs and genetic analyses of scat, we collected data on jaguars (Panthera onca), pumas (Puma concolor), ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), oncillas (Leopardus tigrinus), and bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) across habitats that varied in vegetation, disturbance, human proximity, and protective status. With MaxEnt we evaluated habitat use, habitat suitability, and potential species richness for the five carnivores across northern-central Misiones, Argentina. Through a multifaceted cost analysis that included unique requirements of each carnivore and varying degrees of overlap among them, we determined the optimal location for primary/secondary corridors that would link the northern-central zones of the Green Corridor in Misiones and identified areas within these corridors needing priority management. A secondary analysis, comparing these multispecies corridors with the jaguar’s unique requirements, demonstrated that this multispecies approach balanced the preferences of all five species and effectively captured areas required by this highly restricted and endangered carnivore. We emphasize the potential importance of expanding beyond a single umbrella or focal species when developing biological corridors that aim to capture the varied ecological requirements of coexisting species and ecological processes across the landscape. Detection dogs and genetic analyses of scat allow data on multiple species to be collected efficiently across multiple habitat types independent of the degree of legal protection. These data used with multifocal GIS analyses balance the varying degree of overlap and unique properties among them allowing for comprehensive conservation strategies to be developed relatively rapidly. Our comprehensive approach serves as a model to other regions faced with habitat loss and lack of data. The five carnivores focused on in our study have wide ranges, so the results from this study can be expanded and combined with surrounding countries, with analyses at the species or community level."

A national, longitudinal analysis using data from the French National Hospital database crossed with the population density of the municipality and a social deprivation index based on census data aggregated at the municipality level. For lung cancer diagnosed at the metastatic stage, one-year and two-year survival was not associated with the population density of the municipality of residence. In contrast, mortality was higher for people living in very deprived, deprived and privileged areas compared to very privileged areas (hazard ratios at two years: 1.19 [1.13-1.25], 1.14 [1.08-1.20] and 1.10 [1.04-1.16] respectively). Similar associations are also observed in patients diagnosed with non-metastatic disease (hazard ratios at two years: 1.21 [1.13-1.30], 1.15 [1.08-1.23] and 1.10 [1.03-1.18] for people living in very deprived, deprived and privileged areas compared to very privileged areas). Despite a universal healthcare coverage, survival inequalities in patients with lung cancer can be observed in France with respect to certain socioeconomic indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2747359560,"Selective autophagy and related mechanisms can act as variable defense mechanisms against pathogens and can therefore be considered as intracellular immune responses. When in hepatocytes, Plasmodium parasites reside in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and the PV membrane (PVM) is the main contact site between host cell and parasite. Early in infection, the PVM is directly labeled with host cell autophagy proteins LC3B and p62 (nucleoporin 62). We investigated the recruitment of different selective autophagy receptors and could show that mainly p62 and NBR1 (neighbour of BRCA1 gene 1) and to a lesser extent NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52) associate with the PVM. To investigate the recruitment of these receptors to the PVM in Plasmodium-infected cells, we generated LC3B knock out HeLa cells. In these cell lines, autophagosome formation and autophagic flux are not different to those in WT cells. Unexpectedly, p62 and NBR1 recruitment to the PVM was strongly impaired in LC3B-negative host cells, suggesting that LC3B recruits both receptors to the PVM of Plasmodium parasites. We also noticed that LC3B recruited ubiquitin to the PVM. This indicates that, in comparison to classical selective autophagy, in P. berghei-infected cells the order of membrane labeling with autophagy proteins appears to be inverted from canonical ubiquitin-receptor-LC3B recruitment to LC3B-receptor and possibly ubiquitin."
https://openalex.org/W2749732480,"Our previous studies have found that Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2)-a docking protein-governs the development of fatty liver disease. Here, we further demonstrate that Gab2 mediates hepatocarcinogenesis. Compared with a faint expression in para-carcinoma tissue, Gab2 was highly expressed in ∼60-70% of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Deletion of Gab2 dramatically suppressed diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC in mice. The oncogenic effects of Gab2 in HepG2 cells were promoted by Gab2 overexpression but were rescued by Gab2 knockdown. Furthermore, Gab2 knockout in HepG2 cells restrained cell proliferation, migration and tumor growth in nude mice. Signaling pathway analysis with protein kinase inhibitors demonstrated that oncogenic regulation by Gab2 in hepatic cells involved multiple signaling molecules, including ERK, Akt, and Janus kinases (Jaks), especially those that mediate inflammatory signaling. IL-6 signaling was increased by Gab2 overexpression and impaired by Gab2 deletion via regulation of Jak2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and the expression of downstream genes, such as Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), c-Myc, MMP7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7), and cyclin D1in vitro and in vivo These data indicate that Gab2 mediates the pathologic progression of HCC by integrating multiple signaling pathways and suggest that Gab2 might be a powerful therapeutic target for HCC.-Cheng, J., Zhong, Y., Chen, S., Sun, Y., Huang, L., Kang, Y., Chen, B., Chen, G., Wang, F., Tian, Y., Liu, W., Feng, G.-S., Lu, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2745805885,"The cause of death among the majority of endometrial cancer patients involves migration of cancer cells within the peritoneal cavity and subsequent implantation of cancer spheroids into neighbouring organs. It is, thereby, important to identify factors that mediate metastasis. Cell adhesion and migration are modified by the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) marker Sushi domain containing 2 (SUSD2), a type I transmembrane protein that participates in the orchestration of cell adhesion and migration through interaction with its partner Galactosidase-binding soluble-1 (LGALS1). MSCs have emerged as attractive targets in cancer therapy. Human endometrial adenocarcinoma (Ishikawa) cells were treated with TGFβ (10 ng/ml) for 72h. SUSD2, LGALS1 and MKI67 transcript levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. The proportion of SUSD2 positive (SUSD2+) cells and SMAD2/3 abundance were quantified by FACS and Western blotting, respectively. Senescent cells were identified with β-galactosidase staining; cell cycle and cell death were quantified using Propidium Iodide staining. Treatment of endometrial cancer cells (Ishikawa cells) with TGFβ (10 ng/ml) significantly decreased SUSD2 transcript levels and the proportion of SUSD2 positive cells. Silencing of SUSD2 using siRNA resulted in senescence and cell death of Ishikawa cells via activation of SMAD2/3. These findings suggest that SUSD2 counteracts senescence and cell death and is thus a potential chemotherapeutic target in human endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2747722145,"Exaggerated maternal immune responses must be strictly controlled to ensure a successful pregnancy. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been implicated as a potential mechanism for promoting inflammation in pregnancy-related disorders. In this study, we demonstrated that NETs play a key role in the pathogenesis of sphingosine kinase (Sphk)-mediated pregnancy loss. Perturbing the sphingolipid pathway by disrupting Sphk genes during pregnancy led to excessive NET formation exclusively at the fetomaternal interface and early fetal death. Neutrophils that formed NETs were characterized by histone hypercitrullination and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) overexpression. In addition, thrombus formation was enhanced in the decidua, but not in the plasma, of Sphk-deficient mice. Blocking NET formation with a PAD4 inhibitor protected Sphk-deficient mice from pregnancy loss. The PAD4 inhibition significantly reduced the expression of hypercitrullinated histone in neutrophils and ameliorated vascular injury in the decidua of Sphk-deficient mice. Moreover, NET formation was induced in human neutrophils stimulated with Sphk-deficient human decidual cells. Together, these findings indicate that targeting NETs might be a novel therapeutic strategy to treat idiopathic pregnancy loss in humans.-Mizugishi, K., Yamashita, K. Neutrophil extracellular traps are critical for pregnancy loss in sphingosine kinase-deficient mice on 129Sv/C57BL/6 background."
https://openalex.org/W2748365609,"Whole-genome sequencing provides a powerful tool to obtain more genetic variability that could produce a range of benefits for cattle breeding industry. Nanyang (Bos indicus) and Qinchuan (Bos taurus) are two important Chinese indigenous cattle breeds with distinct phenotypes. To identify the genetic characteristics responsible for variation in phenotypes between the two breeds, in the present study, we for the first time sequenced the genomes of four Nanyang and four Qinchuan cattle with 10 to 12 fold on average of 97.86% and 98.98% coverage of genomes, respectively. Comparison with the Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1 reference assembly yielded 9,010,096 SNPs for Nanyang, and 6,965,062 for Qinchuan cattle, 51% and 29% of which were novel SNPs, respectively. A total of 154,934 and 115,032 small indels (1 to 3 bp) were found in the Nanyang and Qinchuan genomes, respectively. The SNP and indel distribution revealed that Nanyang showed a genetically high diversity as compared to Qinchuan cattle. Furthermore, a total of 2,907 putative cases of copy number variation (CNV) were identified by aligning Nanyang to Qinchuan genome, 783 of which (27%) encompassed the coding regions of 495 functional genes. The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that many CNV genes were enriched in the immune system and environment adaptability. Among several CNV genes related to lipid transport and fat metabolism, Lepin receptor gene (LEPR) overlapping with CNV_1815 showed remarkably higher copy number in Qinchuan than Nanyang (log2 (ratio) = -2.34988; P value = 1.53E-102). Further qPCR and association analysis investigated that the copy number of the LEPR gene presented positive correlations with transcriptional expression and phenotypic traits, suggesting the LEPR CNV may contribute to the higher fat deposition in muscles of Qinchuan cattle. Our findings provide evidence that the distinct phenotypes of Nanyang and Qinchuan breeds may be due to the different genetic variations including SNPs, indels and CNV."
https://openalex.org/W2749844130,"Many crop pests rely on resources out of crop fields; understanding how they colonize the fields is an important factor to develop integrated pest management. In particular, the time of crop colonization and damage severity might be determined by pest movements between fields and non-crop areas. Notably, the pollen beetle, Brassicogethes aeneus, previously named Meligethes aeneus, one of the most important pests of winter oilseed rape, overwinters in woodlands. As a result, its abundance increases in oilseed rape fields near wooded areas. Here, we assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of the dispersal from woodlands to oilseed rape fields in diversified landscapes of a same region. We observed on four dates the abundance of pollen beetles in 24 fields spread in the Eure department, France. We modeled the abundance as a result of the dispersal from the neighboring woodlands. We compared the modalities of dispersal corresponding to different hypotheses on the dispersal origin, kernel shape and sources of variability. Within oilseed rape the distance to the edges of woodlands is not the main determinant of pollen beetle abundance. On the contrary, the variability of the abundance between fields is largely explained by the dispersal from neighboring woodlands but there is considerable variability between dates, sites and, to a lesser extent, between fields. The two dispersal kernels received similar support from the data and lead to similar conclusions. The mean dispersal distance is 1.2 km but seems to increase from a few hundred meters the first week to more than two kilometers the fourth, allowing the pollen beetles to reach more distant OSR fields. These results suggest that early varieties away from woodlands and late varieties close to the woodlands may limit attacks at the time when oilseed rape is the most sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W2749223990,"Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important sensors and regulators for cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose. LXRs play essential roles in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. We examined the effects of T0901317, a potent LXR agonist, on angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Treatment with T0901317 inhibited the tube formation and migration of HUVECs and reduced the in vivo angiogenesis, as determined by chorioallantoic membrane assay. T0901317 stimulated gene and protein expression of LXR target gene apolipoprotein D (ApoD). Overexpression of ApoD suppressed the tube formation of HUVECs. ApoD interacted with scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1), while knockdown of SR-B1 blocked suppressive effects of T0901317 on HUVEC migration. T0901317 treatment or overexpression of ApoD lessened expression of proteins regulating angiogenesis, including phospho-eNOS S1177, phospho-Akt T308, phospho-Akt S473, eNOS, mammalian target of rapamycin, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, IL-8, RhoB, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, -9, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Our study suggested that activation of LXR interferes with angiogenesis through induction of LXR target gene ApoD, which in turn suppresses PI3K-Akt-eNOS signaling, an essential pathway regulating angiogenesis. ApoD may be a potential therapeutic target for tumor angiogenesis.-Lai, C.-J., Cheng, H.-C., Lin, C.-Y., Huang, S.-H., Chen, T.-H., Chung, C.-J., Chang, C.-H., Wang, H.-D., Chuu, C.-P.

A precise description of the shape of human mitral valve has vital significance in studying its physiological structure and periodic movement. Unsatisfyingly, there is almost no unified mathematical description of the same shape of human mitral valve in literature. In this paper, we present a geometric model for human mitral valve, as an elastic shell with a special shape. Parametric equations for the shape of human mitral valve are provided, including the anterior and the posterior parts, which can be thought as portions of two interfacing semi-elliptic cylindrical shells. The minor axis of one ellipse is equal to the major axis of the other. All the parameters are determined from the statistical data. Comparison of fitting results with existing examples validates the accuracy of our geometric model. Based on the fitting shape, one can further simulate the physiological function of the mitral valve using a suitable dynamic physical equation."

Most PHIV women have been exposed to a high number of antiretroviral regimens, and they may have difficulties to achieve viral suppression. Psychosocial problems are not uncommon and could be an important barrier for treatment adherence. The effects of chronic HIV infection and long-term exposure to antiretroviral treatment of PHIV women cause concerns on the developing fetus. The aims of this study were to describe the prevention of mother-to-child transmission strategies in PHIV women and the infant outcomes in the Madrid Cohort of HIV-infected mother-infant pairs.All PHIV pregnant women registered in the Cohort that gave birth from 2000 to 2015 were included in the study.Twenty-eight pregnancies in twenty-two perinatally infected women were registered. Most women were Caucasian and heavily treatment-experienced. Nine cases (32.1%) were at high risk of HIV mother-to-child transmission. Maternal HIV-1 viral load was detectable close to delivery in four women (14.3%). The management of these cases was described, and the treatment strategies were discussed. None of the newborns acquired HIV infection. Eight infants (28.6%) were small for gestational age.This study included a large series of pregnancies among PHIV women attended according to a youth-centered care model. The challenges in the management of this population by health-care providers were described. Specific strategies to minimize perinatal transmission risks should be addressed in future collaborative studies."
https://openalex.org/W2749081162,"Potent adjuvant can improve the effectiveness of vaccines and reduce the antigen doses required for initiating the protective immunity. In this study, we identified that aqueous extract of Artemisia rupestris L. (AEAR) could be employed as an efficient adjuvant for influenza virus vaccine (V) to enhance immune responses and reduce the antigen doses required for initiating immunity, without compromising the immune response. ICR mice were subcutaneously co-administrated with V combined with different concentrations of AEAR demonstrated that 300 μg AEAR could significantly improve hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and increase IgG antibody titers in serum (P<0.05) and the population of CD4+CD44+ and CD8+CD44+ (P<0.05). Next, 300 μg AEAR combined with different doses of V in vivo markedly increased HI and specific IgG antibody level(P<0.05). It also significantly increased the amount of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+CD44+ and CD8+CD44+ T cells (P<0.05), improved lymphocyte proliferation, the secretion of CD4+IL-4, CD4+IFN-γ and CD8+IFN-γ (P<0.05), and the killing efficacy of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) (P<0.05). Furthermore, the combination increased the expression of major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II) and co-stimulatory molecules including CD40, CD80, and CD86 on dendritic cells (DCs), and downregulated the expression of CD25+Foxp3+Treg cells (P<0.05). No significant difference was observed between high-dose V and low-dose AEAR-V (10-fold lower) vaccination group (P>0.05), indicating a 10-fold reduction of antigen required for V vaccine administration. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that AEAR, as an adjuvant for influenza vaccine, could stimulate potent humoral and cellular immune responses and reduce the antigen dose required for effective vaccination, which were mediated by promoting DCs activation and repressing Treg expression."
https://openalex.org/W2749670155,"Background With the introduction of an add-on handcycle, a crank system that can be placed in front of a wheelchair, handcycling was made widely available for daily life. With it, people go into town more easily, e.g. to do groceries; meet up with friends, etc. They have more independency and can be socially active. Our aim is to explore some settings of the handcycle, so that it can be optimally used as a transportation device. Therefore, the effects of cadence and added resistance on gross mechanical efficiency and force application during sub-maximal synchronous handcycling were investigated. We hypothesized that a cadence of 52 rpm with a higher resistance (35 W) would lead to a higher gross mechanical efficiency and a more tangential force application than a higher cadence of 70 rpm and no extra resistance (15 W). Methods Twelve able-bodied men rode in an instrumented add-on handcycle on a motorized level treadmill at 1.94 m/s. They performed three sessions of three four-minute blocks of steady state exercise. Gear (70, 60 and 52 rpm) was changed in-between the blocks and resistance (rolling resistance +0 W, +10 W, +20 W) was changed across sessions, both in a counterbalanced order. 3D force production, oxygen uptake and heart rate were measured continuously. Gross mechanical efficiency (ME) and fraction of effective force (FEF) were calculated as main outcomes. The effects of cadence and resistance were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05) with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc pairwise comparisons. Results With a decrease in cadence a slight increase in ME (70 rpm: 5.5 (0.2)%, 60 rpm: 5.7 (0.2)%, 52 rpm: 5.8 (0.2)%, P = 0.008, η2p = 0.38), while an increase in FEF (70 rpm: 58.0 (3.2)%, 60 rpm: 66.0 (2.8)%, 52 rpm: 71.3 (2.3)%, P<0.001, η2p = 0.79) is seen simultaneously. Also with an increase in resistance an increase in ME (+0 W: 4.0 (0.2)%, +10 W: 6.0 (0.3)%, +20 W: 7.0 (0.2)%, P<0.001, η2p = 0.92) and FEF (+0 W: 59.0 (2.9)%, +10 W: 66.1 (3.4)%, +20 W: 70.2 (2.4)%, P<0.001, η2p = 0.56) was found. Interpretation A cadence of 52 rpm against a higher resistance of about 35 W leads to a more optimal direction of forces and is more mechanically efficient than propelling at a higher cadence or lower resistance. Therefore, changing gears on a handcycle is important, and it is advised to keep the linear hand velocity relatively low for locomotion purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2748533462,"Genetic mouse models of soft tissue sarcoma provide critical insights into disease pathophysiology, which are oftentimes unable to be extracted from human tumor samples or xenograft models. In this study we describe a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma mediated by adenoviral-Cre recombinase injection into Trp53fl/fl/Ptenfl/fl lox-stop-lox luciferase mice. Injection of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase, either subcutaneously or intramuscularly in two experimental groups, results in viral infection and gene recombination with 100% penetrance within the first 24 hours following injection. Luciferase expression measured by real-time bioluminescence imaging increases over time, with an initial robust increase following viral injection, followed by a steady rise over the next several weeks as primary tumors develop and grow. Intramuscular injections were more commonly associated with evidence of systemic viral distribution than subcutaneous injections. All mice developed soft tissue sarcomas at the primary injection site, with histological examination identifying 93% of tumors as invasive pleomorphic sarcomas based on microscopic morphology and immunohistochemical expression of sarcoma markers. A lymphocytic infiltrate was present in 64% of the sarcomas in this immunocompetent model and 71% of tumors expressed PD-L1. This is the first report of a viral-Cre mediated Trp53/Pten mouse model of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. The bioluminescence imaging feature, along with high penetrance of the model and its immunological characteristics, makes it suited for pre-clinical studies of soft tissue sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2749824185,"Translation-independent mRNA localization represents an emerging concept in cell biology. In Escherichia coli, mRNAs encoding integral membrane proteins (MPRs) are targeted to the membrane where they are translated by membrane associated ribosomes and the produced proteins are inserted into the membrane co-translationally. In order to better understand aspects of the biogenesis and localization of MPRs, we investigated their subcellular distribution using cell fractionation, RNA-seq and qPCR. The results show that MPRs are overrepresented in the membrane fraction, as expected, and depletion of the signal recognition particle-receptor, FtsY reduced the amounts of all mRNAs on the membrane. Surprisingly, however, MPRs were also found relatively abundant in the soluble ribosome-free fraction and their amount in this fraction is increased upon overexpression of CspE, which was recently shown to interact with MPRs. CspE also conferred a positive effect on the membrane-expression of integral membrane proteins. We discuss the possibility that the effects of CspE overexpression may link the intriguing subcellular localization of MPRs to the cytosolic ribosome-free fraction with their translation into membrane proteins and that the ribosome-free pool of MPRs may represent a stage during their targeting to the membrane, which precedes translation."
https://openalex.org/W2746167559,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are providing genomic information for an increasing number of healthy individuals and patient populations. In the context of the large amount of generated genomic data that is being generated, understanding the effect of disease-related mutations at molecular level can contribute to close the gap between genotype and phenotype and thus improve prevention, diagnosis or treatment of a pathological condition. In order to fully characterize the effect of a pathological mutation and have useful information for prediction purposes, it is important first to identify whether the mutation is located at a protein-binding interface, and second to understand the effect on the binding affinity of the affected interaction/s. Computational methods, such as protein docking are currently used to complement experimental efforts and could help to build the human structural interactome. Here we have extended the original pyDockNIP method to predict the location of disease-associated nsSNPs at protein-protein interfaces, when there is no available structure for the protein-protein complex. We have applied this approach to the pathological interaction networks of six diseases with low structural data on PPIs. This approach can almost double the number of nsSNPs that can be characterized and identify edgetic effects in many nsSNPs that were previously unknown. This can help to annotate and interpret genomic data from large-scale population studies, and to achieve a better understanding of disease at molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2746187307,"Important metabolic changes occur during transition period of late pregnancy and early lactation to meet increasing energy demands of the growing fetus and for milk production. The aim of this investigation is to present an innovative and non-invasive tool using ewe earwax sample analysis to assess the metabolic profile in ewes during late pregnancy and early lactation. In this work, earwax samples were collected from 28 healthy Brazilian Santa Inês ewes divided into 3 sub-groups: 9 non-pregnant ewes, 6 pregnant ewes in the last 30 days of gestation, and 13 lactating ewes ≤ 30 days postpartum. Then, a range of metabolites including volatile organic compounds (VOC), amino acids (AA), and minerals were profiled and quantified in the samples by applying headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, respectively. As evident in our results, significant changes were observed in the metabolite profile of earwax between the studied groups where a remarkable elevation was detected in the levels of non-esterified fatty acids, alcohols, ketones, and hydroxy urea in the VOC profile of samples obtained from pregnant and lactating ewes. Meanwhile, a significant decrease was detected in the levels of 9 minerals and 14 AA including essential AA (leucine, phenyl alanine, lysine, isoleucine, threonine, valine), conditionally essential AA (arginine, glycine, tyrosine, proline, serine), and a non-essential AA (alanine). Multivariate analysis using robust principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis was successfully applied to discriminate the three study groups using the variations of metabolites in the two stress states (pregnancy and lactation) from the healthy non-stress condition. The innovative developed method was successful in evaluating pre- and post-parturient metabolic changes using earwax and can in the future be applied to recognize markers for diagnosis, prevention, and intervention of pregnancy complications in ewes."
https://openalex.org/W2747511889,"The financial impact of early embryonic loss in Australia may be as high as $137 million AUD/year. Embryos may be lost due to environmental conditions, or maternal factors such as nutrition or progesterone (P4) profiles. However, studies on the supplementation of P4 during early pregnancy have returned contradictory results, partly as a reliable method of detecting embryos in the early stages of gestation (<day 20) has yet be established. As such, Merino ewes (n = 62) were either not supplemented (control) or were given exogenous P4 at the time of insemination (day 0) or 3 days later (day 3). Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) was performed on day 10, 12, 14, 17, 19 and 29 following laparoscopic artificial insemination. Transcutaneous ultrasound (TCUS) was performed on day 54 to confirm pregnancy and peripheral blood was collected for hormone analysis on day 19 to compare the accuracy of all three pregnancy diagnosis methods. Data were then analysed in developmental periods. The percentage of ewes detected as pregnant by TRUS during pre-, peri- and post implantation was 66% (41/62; day 12 and 14), 61% (38/62; day 17 and 19) and 58% (36/62; day 29), respectively. TCUS during established gestation recorded a pregnancy rate of 60% (37/62). The sensitivity of TRUS to correctly diagnose ewes as pregnant during pre-, peri- and post implantation was 68% (25/37), 89% (33/37) and 100% (36/36), respectively, while the sensitivity to correctly identify multiples was 49% (16/33), 60% (21/35) and 97% (34/35), respectively (P<0.05). The majority of embryonic loss occurred between pre- and peri- implantation (0.9±0.15 per ewe; P<0.001). No further loss was recorded after this point. Ewes that were given P4 at day 0 had significantly higher embryonic loss (77%) compared to the control (52%) and day 3-ewes (56%; P<0.05). These results show TRUS is a viable tool for investigating early embryonic loss and that the variability noted in previous P4 supplementation studies may be due to variation in time and length of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2747526125,"Background Primary vaginal carcinoma (PVC) is a rare malignancy. Established prognostic factors include tumour stage and age at diagnosis. The leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobuline-like domains (LRIG)-1 protein functions as a tumour suppressor, but less is known about the functions of LRIG2 and LRIG3. The present study aimed to evaluate the expression of LRIG proteins and analyse their possible associations with clinical characteristics and survival in a cohort of PVC patients. Methods We used immunohistochemistry to investigate LRIG1, LRIG2, and LRIG3 expression in tumour samples from a consecutive cohort of 70 PVC patients. The association between LRIG protein expression and clinical characteristics and cancer-specific survival was investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results The majority of PVC patients (72%) had >50% LRIG1- and LRIG2-positive cells, and no or low LRIG3-positive cells. HPV status was significantly correlated with LRIG1 expression (p = 0.0047). Having high LRIG1 expression was significantly correlated with superior cancer-specific survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. LRIG2 and LRIG3 expression did not significantly correlate with clinical characteristics or survival. Conclusion LRIG1 expression might be of interest as a prognostic marker in PVC patients, whereas the role of LRIG2 and LRIG3 expression remains to be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W2748559592,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 12 (PTPN12) is a multifunctional protein and has elicited much research attention because its decreased protein level has been associated with poor prognosis of several types of cancers. Recently, we have solved the crystal structure of the phosphatase domain of PTPN12, which disclosed a specific PTPN12-insert-loop harboring a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) phosphorylation site. However, the functional significance of this phosphorylation is undefined. In the present study, we found that S19 site phosphorylation of PTPN12 by CDK2 discharged its antitumor activity by down-regulation of its inhibitory role in cell migration, but not affecting its other regulatory functions. Phosphorylation of PTPN12 at the S19 site changed its substrate interface, and by doing so, selectively decreased its activity toward the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- pY1196 site, but not other HER2 phosphorylation sites or other known PTPN12 substrates. A further in-depth mechanism study revealed that the phosphorylation of PTPN12 by CDK2 impaired recruitment of the serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (PAK1) to HER2, resulted in the blockade of the HER2-pY1196-PAK1-T423 signaling pathway, thus increased tumor cell motility. Taken together, our results identified a new phosphorylation-based substrate recognition mechanism of PTPN12 by CDK2, which orchestrated signaling crosstalk between the oncogenic CDK2 and HER2 pathways. The newly identified governing mechanism of the substrate selectivity of a particular phosphatase was previously unappreciated and exemplifies how a phospho-network is precisely controlled in different cellular contexts.—Li, H., Yang, D., Ning, S., Xu, Y., Yang, F., Yin, R., Feng, T., Han, S., Guo, L., Zhang, P., Qu, W., Guo, R., Song, C., Xiao, P., Zhou, C., Xu, Z., Sun, J.-P., Yu, X.

Aim of this study was therefore to describe demographic, physical, psychological and social characteristics of working TKA patients and to subsequently compare these characteristics with retired TKA patients and the general population. Methods A cross-sectional analysis. Preoperative data of 152 working TKA patients was used. These data were compared with existing data of retired TKA patients in hospital registers and with normative values from literature on the general population. Demographic, physical, psychological and social (including work) characteristics were analyzed. Results The majority (83.8%) of working TKA patients was overweight (42.6%) or obese (41.2%), a majority (72.4%) was dealing with two or more comorbidities, and most (90%) had few depressive symptoms. Mean physical activity level was 2950 minutes per week. Compared to the retired TKA population, working TKA patients perceived significantly more stiffness and better physical functioning and vitality, were more physically active, and perceived better mental health. Compared to the general population working TKA patients perceived worse physical functioning, worse physical health and better mental health, and worked fewer hours. Conclusion This study shows that a majority of working TKA patients are overweight/obese, have multiple comorbidities, but are highly active in light-intensity activities and have few depressive symptoms. Working patients scored overall better on preoperative characteristics than retired patients, and except for physical activity scored overall worse than the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2745511338,"NADPH-dependent dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) plays an important role in both anthocyanin biosynthesis and proanthocyanidin synthesis in plants. A specific and quantitative RT-PCR assay for transcription from the DFR promoter detected high expression with limited variability in rice tissues. A 440 bp minimal promoter region was identified by transfection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter constructs into Jeokjinju variety. Alignment of the region with orthologous promoters revealed three conserved segments containing both bHLH (-386 to -381) and Myb (-368 to -362) binding sites. Transfection of β-glucuronidase constructs with targeted point mutations in the minimal promoter defined two sites important for promoter function to the transcription factor binding consensus sequences. The expression study showed that the bHLH binding domain (-386 to -381) is essential for DFR expression, and that a Myb binding domain (-368 to -362) is also required for full expression of the DFR gene, while the two bHLH binding domains (-104 to -99 and -27 to -22) nearest to the transcriptional start site are not necessary for DFR expression."
https://openalex.org/W2747483647,"Cell production and death are tightly regulated in the rapidly renewing gut epithelium, with proliferation confined to crypts and apoptosis occurring in villi and crypts. This study sought to determine how stress alters these compartmentalized processes. Wild-type mice made septic via cecal ligation and puncture had decreased crypt proliferation and increased crypt and villus apoptosis. Fabpi-TAg mice expressing large T-antigen solely in villi had ectopic enterocyte proliferation with increased villus apoptosis in unmanipulated animals. Septic fabpi-TAg mice had an unexpected increase in villus proliferation compared with unmanipulated littermates, whereas crypt proliferation was decreased. Cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 were decreased in jejunal tissue in septic transgenic mice. In contrast, villus and crypt apoptosis were increased in septic fabpi-TAg mice. To examine the relationship between apoptosis and proliferation in a compartment-specific manner, fabpi-TAg mice were crossed with fabpl-Bcl-2 mice, resulting in expression of both genes in the villus but Bcl-2 alone in the crypt. Septic bi-transgenic animals had decreased crypt apoptosis but had a paradoxical increase in villus apoptosis compared with septic fabpi-TAg mice, associated with decreased proliferation in both compartments. Thus, sepsis unmasks compartment-specific proliferative and apoptotic regulation that is not present under homeostatic conditions.-Lyons, J. D., Klingensmith, N. J., Otani, S., Mittal, R., Liang, Z., Ford, M. L., Coopersmith, C. M. Sepsis reveals compartment-specific responses in intestinal proliferation and apoptosis in transgenic mice whose enterocytes re-enter the cell cycle."

The females are thus identified for the first time, and their wing patterns and genitalia are described and illustrated for the convenience of morphological identification hereafter. A new subspecies, S. lucasii minor ssp. nov., from the northeastern and eastern parts of the Sichuan Basin of China, is reported. External and genital differences between the new taxon and the nominate subspecies, which is distributed in western Sichuan and newly discovered in northwestern Guangxi, are illustrated and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2748690313,"Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA) is the most common dominantly inherited optic neuropathy. In the majority of patients it is caused by OPA1 mutations and those predicted to introduce a premature termination codon (PTC) are frequently detected. Transcripts containing PTC may be degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), however very little is known about an effect of OPA1 mutations on NMD activation. Here, using a combination of linkage analysis and DNA sequencing, we have identified a novel c.91C>T OPA1 mutation with a putative premature stop codon (Q31*), which segregated with ADOA in two Polish families. At the mRNA level we found no changes in the amount of OPA1 transcript among mutation carriers vs. non-carriers. Specific allele quantification revealed a considerable level of the OPA1 mutant transcript. Our study identifies a novel pathogenic OPA1 mutation and shows that it is located in the transcript region not prone for NMD activation. The data emphasizes the importance of analyzing how mutated genes are being processed in the cell. This gives an insight into the molecular mechanism of a genetic disease and promotes development of innovative therapeutic approaches."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the multiecho fast field echo (mFFE) MRI in the detection of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and dural ossification (DO) of the cervical spine.Sixty-three patients who underwent MRI with mFFE and CT for cervical spine were retrospectively evaluated. The presence of OPLL and DO on MR images was assessed by two independent readers. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI for detecting OPLL and DO were determined using CT as a reference standard. Image contrast ratios were obtained between the OPLL and perilesional structures on each sequence.There were 31 patients with OPLL and 13 DO lesions. The mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both readers were 94%, 81%, 88% for OPLL and 92%, 81%, 86% for DO, respectively. The contrast ratios for OPLL and intervertebral disc, spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid were significantly superior on mFFE images, whereas those for OPLL and bone marrow were significantly inferior on mFFE images than those of T1-and T2-weighted images (p ≤ 0.016).MRI with mFFE may be sufficient for the assessment of OPLL and DO, with good contrasts between OPLL and intervertebral disc, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2748034701,"To identify exposure-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of individuals occupationally exposed to diesel exhaust (DE); to reveal strengths, knowledge gaps and misperceptions therein.A Mental Models approach was used to gather information about current scientific understanding of DE exposure hazards and the ways in which exposure can be reduced. Thirty individuals in British Columbia who were regularly exposed to occupational DE were interviewed. The audio was recorded and transcribed. Data was grouped together and examined to draw out themes around DE awareness, hazard assessment and risk reduction behaviors. These themes were then compared and contrasted with existing grey and research literature in order to reveal strengths, gaps and misperceptions regarding DE exposure.Study participants were aware and concerned about their exposure to DE but had incomplete and sometimes incorrect understanding of exposure pathways, health effects, and effective strategies to reduce their exposures. The perceived likelihood of exposure to DE was significantly greater compared to that of other work hazards (p<0.01), whereas the difference for their perceived severity of consequences was not significant. There was no universally perceived main source of information regarding DE, and participants generally distrusted sources of information based on their past experience with the source. Most of the actions that were taken to address DE exposure fell into the area of administrative controls such as being aware of sources of DE and avoiding these sources.This study of the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of those occupationally exposed to DE found, most notably, that more education and training and the creation of a health effects inventory regarding DE exposure were desired."
https://openalex.org/W3124470687,"The distribution of firm sizes is known to be heavy tailed. In order to account for this stylized fact, previous economic models have focused mainly on growth through investments in a company's own operations (internal growth). Thereby, the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on the firm size (external growth) is often not taken into consideration, notwithstanding its potential large impact. In this article, we make a first step into accounting for M&A. Specifically, we describe the effect of mergers and acquisitions on the firm size distribution in terms of an integro-differential equation. This equation is subsequently solved both analytically and numerically for various initial conditions, which allows us to account for different observations of previous empirical studies. In particular, it rationalises shortcomings of past work by quantifying that mergers and acquisitions develop a significant influence on the firm size distribution only over time scales much longer than a few decades. This explains why M&A has apparently little impact on the firm size distributions in existing data sets. Our approach is very flexible and can be extended to account for other sources of external growth, thus contributing towards a holistic understanding of the distribution of firm sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2748615069,"Obtaining kinematic patterns that depend on the shoulder injury may be important when planning rehabilitation. The main goal of this study is to explore whether the kinematic patterns of continuous and repetitive shoulder elevation motions are different according to the type of shoulder injury in question, specifically tendinopathy or rotator cuff tear, and to analyze the influence of the load handled during its assessment. For this purpose, 19 individuals with tendinopathy and 9 with rotator cuff tear performed a repetitive scaption movement that was assessed with stereophotogrammetry. Furthermore, static range of motion (ROM) and isometric strength were evaluated with a goniometer and a dynamometer, respectively. Dynamic measurements of maximum elevation (Emax), variablility of the maximum angle (VMA), maximum angular velocity (Velmax), and time to maximum velocity (tmaxvel) were found to be significantly different between the tendinopathy group (TG) and the rotator cuff tear group (RTCG). No differences were found in the ROM assessed with goniometry and the isometric strength. The effect of increasing the load placed in the hand during the scaption movement led to significant differences in Emax, VMA, tmaxvel and repeatability. Therefore, only the dynamic variables showed sufficient capability of detecting differences in functional performance associated with structural shoulder injury. The differences observed in the kinematic variables between patients with tendinopathy and rotator cuff tear seem to be related to alterations in thoracohumeral rhythm and neuromuscular control. Kinematic analysis may contribute to a better understanding of the functional impact of shoulder injuries, which would help in the assessment and treatment of shoulder pain."
https://openalex.org/W2747341931,"This paper presents the development and evaluation of the train-the-trainer (TTT) workshop for lay resident leaders to be lay health promoters. The TTT workshop aimed to prepare the trainees to implement and/or assist in conducting a series of community-based family well-being activities for the residents in a public low rent housing estate, entitled ""Learning Families Project"", under the FAMILY project. The four-hour TTT workshop was conducted for 32 trainees (72% women, 43% aged ≥ 60, 41% ≤ elementary school education). The workshop aimed to promote trainees' knowledge, self-efficacy, attitude and practice of incorporating the positive psychology themes into their community activities and engaging the residents to join these activities and learn with their family members. Post-training support was provided. The effectiveness of the TTT was examined by self-administered questionnaires about trainees' reactions to training content, changes in learning and practice at three time points (baseline, and immediately and one year after training), and the difference in residents' survey results before and after participating in the community activities delivered by the trainees. The trainees' learning about the general concepts of family well-being, learning family, leadership skills and planning skills increased significantly with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.5-1.4) immediately after the training. The effects of perceived knowledge and attitude towards practice were sustained to one year (Cohen's d: 0.4-0.6). The application of planning skills to implement community activities was higher at one year (Cohen's d: 0.4), compared with baseline. At one year, the residents' survey results showed significant increases in the practice of positive communication behaviours and better neighbour cohesions after joining the family well-being activities of LFP. Qualitative feedback supported the quantitative results. Our TTT workshop could serve as a practical example of development and evaluation of training programs for lay personnel to be lay health promoters.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02844244."
