Marked alterations in behavior in some patients were associated with the administration of l-methionine and of l-tryptophan."

https://openalex.org/W2084497226,"Amino-acid analysis shows that the proteins from two calcified tissues, enamel and snail shell, are related to collagen in that they also contain hydroxylysine . The presence of hydroxyproline is suggested but not confirmed. This evidence, together with other recent findings, suggests that hydroxylysine may have an important role in the calcification of each of these otherwise diverse proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2051722877,"BEDSON et al. 1 described the developmental forms of psittacosis virus using conventional staining methods and light microscopy. Subsequent studies by others, who used phase, ultra-violet2, and electron3 microscopy, and fluorescein-tagged antibody4, helped to describe the complex nature of the replication-cycle. In this work, we used Feulgen staining5 and fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange dye to demonstrate cytochemical changes in tissue cultures infected with psittacosis virus. Immunocytochemical changes were followed by fluorescent-antibody techniques6. Pretreatment of infected cells with ribonuclease was also used in these staining procedures."

Measurements of zinc-65 and chromium-Si in foods and in individuals consuming these foods are reported and are compared with zinc-65 concentrations resulting from fallout."

https://openalex.org/W2075031629,"Visible light killed the eggs and developing embryos of brook and rainbow trout. It is hypothesized that light could kill the eggs and embryos of all aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. Adaptations minimize but do not completely block this lethal effect. Under some circumstances, visible light could cause heavy mortality in a new year-class of an aquatic animal."

https://openalex.org/W2013082559,"IT has previously been shown that the blood and urine of rabbits suffering from haemolytic anaemia contain a mucoprotein humoral factor, haemopoietine or erythropoietine, which on injection into normal animals stimulates erythropoiesis1. The present experiments were undertaken to find out what effect this factor might have on nucleic acid biosynthesis in normal rabbit tissues in vitro. A crude preparation of erythropoietine was obtained from the urine of animals made anaemic with phenylhydrazine. The urine was brought to pH 4.5 with hydrochloric acid, and 4 volumes of ethanol were added. After standing overnight at 4° C. the precipitate was centrifuged down, washed with ethanol and ether, and dried. The dry powder was extracted with a small volume of Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer. The protein concentration of this ‘anaemic urine extract’ was determined by the biuret method. A ‘normal urine extract’ was similarly prepared from the urine of normal rabbits. The effects of both extracts on the incorporation of formate labelled with carbon-14 into the nucleic acids of bone marrow, spleen and liver in vitro were determined by the methods of Smellie et al.

https://openalex.org/W1981773791,"The coefficients of accumulation of strontium-90, cesium-137, and cerium-144 in seaweeds, eelgrass, actinia, mollusks, and crustaceans are presented. The discharge of strontium-90 into sea water from decomposing seaweed and the retention and additional absorption of cesium-137 and cerium-144 onto organic debris is discussed. Some observations are made about the ability of these elements to diffuse into sea water and about the relative hazard to man from strontium-90 and cerium-144 in marine life."

The same poison has been found in the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax catenella
1 on which the bivalves feed at certain times of the year, and the plankton has, therefore, been held responsible for the production of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2027808184,"THE existence of biochemical lesions in the complicated path from amino-acid to vitamin in man, and in experimental animals suffering from various diseases, has been identified by a number of authors analysing urinary metabolites of tryptophan by means of paper and column chromatography1–6. These analyses have shown an accumulation in the urine of metabolites proximal to the lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2035798276,THE taxonomy of the stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) has excited the interest of zoologists for more than two centuries. Even now there are many unexplained questions concerning the differentiation within the species. The most difficult to explain is the variable number of lateral plates covering the body of this fish.
