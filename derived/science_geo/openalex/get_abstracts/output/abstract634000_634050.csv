https://openalex.org/W2948160364,"Individuals vary widely in their responses to medicinal drugs, which can be dangerous and expensive owing to treatment delays and adverse effects. Although increasing evidence implicates the gut microbiome in this variability, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here we show, by measuring the ability of 76 human gut bacteria from diverse clades to metabolize 271 orally administered drugs, that many drugs are chemically modified by microorganisms. We combined high-throughput genetic analyses with mass spectrometry to systematically identify microbial gene products that metabolize drugs. These microbiome-encoded enzymes can directly and substantially affect intestinal and systemic drug metabolism in mice, and can explain the drug-metabolizing activities of human gut bacteria and communities on the basis of their genomic contents. These causal links between the gene content and metabolic activities of the microbiota connect interpersonal variability in microbiomes to interpersonal differences in drug metabolism, which has implications for medical therapy and drug development across multiple disease indications. High-throughput genetic analyses combined with mass spectrometry reveal that the gene products of diverse human gut bacteria affect a wide range of oral drugs, as well as drug metabolism in mice."

Here, we analyze the translatomes of 80 human hearts to identify new translation events and quantify the effect of translational regulation. We show extensive translational control of cardiac gene expression, which is orchestrated in a process-specific manner. Translation downstream of predicted disease-causing protein-truncating variants appears to be frequent, suggesting inefficient translation termination. We identify hundreds of previously undetected microproteins, expressed from lncRNAs and circRNAs, for which we validate the protein products in vivo. The translation of microproteins is not restricted to the heart and prominent in the translatomes of human kidney and liver. We associate these microproteins with diverse cellular processes and compartments and find that many locate to the mitochondria. Importantly, dozens of microproteins are translated from lncRNAs with well-characterized noncoding functions, indicating previously unrecognized biology.

Importantly, dozens of microproteins are translated from lncRNAs with well-characterized noncoding functions, indicating previously unrecognized biology. Translational regulation is a key component of gene expression, but our understanding of its role in human tissue is sparse. Genome-wide translatomes can be characterized using ribosome profiling (or Ribo-seq), which captures mRNA footprints protected by translating ribosomes (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R. Weissman J.S. Genome-Wide Analysis in Vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution Using Ribosome Profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Google Scholar). From these footprints, the codon-by-codon movement of ribosomes can be inferred and used to identify actively translated open reading frames (ORFs) (Calviello and Ohler, 2017Calviello L. Ohler U. Beyond Read-Counts: Ribo-seq Data Analysis to Understand the Functions of the Transcriptome.Trends Genet. 2017; 33: 728-744Google Scholar). Newly detected ORFs can include regulatory upstream ORFs (uORFs), which may repress the translational efficiency (TE) of mRNAs (Morris and Geballe, 2000Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Upstream open reading frames as regulators of mRNA translation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Google Scholar), or short ORFs (sORFs) translated from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), indicating potential microprotein production (Andrews and Rothnagel, 2014Andrews S.J. Rothnagel J.A. Emerging evidence for functional peptides encoded by short open reading frames.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 193-204Google Scholar). For a handful of microproteins (proteins smaller than 100 amino acids (aa)), key physiological roles have been uncovered (Anderson et al., 2015Anderson D.M. Anderson K.M. Chang C.L. Makarewich C.A.

Reyon D. et al.Toddler: an embryonic signal that promotes cell movement via Apelin receptors.Science. 2014; 343: 1248636Google Scholar), although a genome-wide catalog of microproteins in human tissue is lacking. Newly detected microprotein translation events can be used to expand and improve protein databases required for mass spectrometry (MS) searches because it is not trivial to perform de novo microprotein discovery with MS in the absence of a priori microprotein sequence information. Here we elucidate the translational landscape of 80 human hearts, comprising both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients and non-DCM controls. DCM has a prevalence of up to 1:250 and is the most common reason for heart transplantation (Hershberger et al., 2013Hershberger R.E. Hedges D.J. Morales A. Dilated cardiomyopathy: the complexity of a diverse genetic architecture.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2013; 10: 531-547Google Scholar). Combining genotypes, transcriptomes, and translatomes, we show that protein-truncating variants (PTVs), including titin-truncating variants (TTNtv) that commonly cause DCM (Herman et al., 2012Herman D.S. Lam L. Taylor M.R.G. Wang L. Teekakirikul P. Christodoulou D. Conner L. DePalma S.R. McDonough B. Sparks E. et al.Truncations of titin causing dilated cardiomyopathy.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 619-628Google Scholar), often inefficiently terminate translation. Moreover, we identify 169 lncRNAs and 40 circular RNAs (circRNAs) that encode previously unknown microproteins, which we validate in vivo and link to specific cellular processes and organelles, predominantly mitochondria. Dozens of microproteins are expressed from functionally characterized lncRNAs, such as DANCR (also known as ANCR) (Kretz et al., 2012Kretz M. Webster D.E. Flockhart R.J. Lee C.S. Zehnder A. Lopez-Pajares V. Qu K. Zheng G.X.Y. Chow J.

Transcription of the non-coding RNA upperhand controls Hand2 expression and heart development.Nature. 2016; 539: 433-436Google Scholar), suggesting undiscovered roles of these microproteins or their involvement in biological functions assigned to the lncRNA. The majority of these lncRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, and we demonstrate their translation in human kidney and liver. We present a detailed assessment of translation in 80 human hearts that may serve as a blueprint for characterizing the translational landscape of other human tissues. The data and analyses presented in this work can be explored via an interactive web application accessible at http://shiny.mdc-berlin.de/cardiac-translatome/. To study cardiac mRNA expression and translation, we applied mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and Ribo-seq to human left ventricular cardiac tissue of 65 end-stage DCM patients and 15 non-DCM controls (Figure 1A; Figures S1A and S1B; Table S1). Sequenced ribosomal footprints show expected size distributions (Figure S1C), map primarily to coding sequences (CDSs) of genes (Figure S1D) and display the 3-nt codon movement characteristic of actively translating ribosomes (Figure 1B; Figure S1E). To catalog translated sequences in the human heart, we created a de novo transcriptome assembly and performed an unsupervised search for actively translated ORFs using RiboTaper (Calviello et al., 2016Calviello L. Mukherjee N. Wyler E. Zauber H. Hirsekorn A. Selbach M. Landthaler M. Obermayer B. Ohler U. Detecting actively translated open reading frames in ribosome profiling data.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 165-170Google Scholar) (Figure 1C; Figures S1F and S1G). Among the 22,335 identified ORFs are 1,090 uORFs (Figure 1D) and 339 sORFs in non-repetitive sequences of 169 presumed lncRNAs (Figure 1E). Compared with left ventricle protein identification from the deepest human heart proteome to date (Doll et al., 2017Doll S. Dreßen M. Geyer P.E. Itzhak D.N. Braun C. Doppler S.A. Meier F. Deutsch M.-A. Lahm H. Lange R. et al.Region and cell-type resolved quantitative proteomic map of the human heart.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1469Google Scholar), we infer translation from our Ribo-seq data for twice as many gene products (Figure 1F), possibly because highly expressed cardiac sarcomere proteins hinder the detection of lower-expressed proteins by MS. In agreement with translation being the intermediate step between transcription and the proteome, Ribo-seq has a higher predictive value of final protein levels than mRNA-seq (Pearson’s correlation coefficient [r] = 0.40 versus 0.32) (Figure S1H). All cardiac translation events can be found in Table S1 and have been compiled into an annotated search database for MS-based proteomics that can be downloaded from the Shiny web server.Figure S1A Snapshot of Active Translation in 80 Human Hearts, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Dot plot displaying the fraction of raw sequence reads derived from tRNAs, the mitochondrial genome (MT), ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and canonical genes (clean) for human left ventricle Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq data.

Parts of the variance in protein abundance remain unexplained as protein levels are not only defined by transcription and translation rates, but also by post-translational variables such as protein stability. Additionally, differences in biological samples (different human hearts) and technologies (sequencing versus mass spectrometry) influence the presented correlations. Comparing DCM patients with controls, we detect 2,660 genes with differential mRNA expression levels and 2,648 genes with expression differences in the Ribo-seq data, of which 964 appear to have a transcriptional basis (Figure S2A; Table S2). To identify the fraction of genes that is specifically translationally regulated, we applied an interaction model that accounts for the transcriptional contribution to gene expression regulation (Chothani et al., 2017Chothani S. Adami E. Viswanathan S. Hubner N. Cook S. Schafer S. Rackham O. Reliable detection of translational regulation with Ribo-seq.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/234344Scopus (0) Google Scholar), yielding 327 translationally downregulated and 474 translationally upregulated genes (Table S2). We next correlated the translation levels of all differentially expressed genes across the 80 hearts to find process-specific expression coregulation. This identified 30 clusters of jointly regulated genes, of which 22 are enriched for distinct cellular processes (Figure 2A; Figure S2B). To define the contribution of transcription and translation to the expression regulation of each cluster, we performed a principal-component analysis (STAR Methods; Figure 2B). This revealed specific translational upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) production (Figures 2B and 2C), likely a manifestation of the hallmark fibrotic response to cardiac damage and failure (Travers et al., 2016Travers J.G. Kamal F.A. Robbins J. Yutzey K.E. Blaxall B.C. Cardiac fibrosis: The fibroblast awakens.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 1021-1040Google Scholar). In addition, we find that the downregulation of mitochondrial processes is initiated during transcription and significantly enhanced on the translational level, reflecting the energy-deficient state of the failing heart (Okonko and Shah, 2015Okonko D.O. Shah A.M. Heart failure: mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in CHF.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2015; 12: 6-8Google Scholar). Sarcomere components are mostly transcriptionally controlled (Figure 2C), similar to many genes known to cause DCM (most of which encode sarcomere proteins) (Figure S2C). Components of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a known master regulator of cardiac translation (Sciarretta et al., 2018Sciarretta S. Forte M. Frati G. Sadoshima J. New Insights Into the Role of mTOR Signaling in the Cardiovascular System.Circ. Res. 2018; 122: 489-505Scopus (122) Google Scholar), locate to a gene cluster highly upregulated in DCM hearts (Figure S2B). As a consequence, the translation of 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif-containing mTOR target genes (Thoreen et al., 2012Thoreen C.C. Chantranupong L. Keys H.R. Wang T. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. A unifying model for mTORC1-mediated regulation of mRNA translation.Nature. 2012; 485: 109-113Google Scholar) is significantly upregulated (p = 2.52 × 10−7) (Figures S2D and S2E). Most 5′ TOP genes are ribosomal proteins, and their translational upregulation in response to decreased mRNA expression (Figure 2C) suggests autonomous control of the translation machinery over ribosome production and, subsequently, translational activity in diseased hearts. We detect a total of 1,090 actively translated uORFs in 919 genes (8% of all translated genes) (Table S3), which display an expected decrease in translational efficiency (median TE, 0.90 versus 0.65; p = 6.15 × 10−28; Mann-Whitney U test) (Figure 2D; Figures S2F and S2G). Surprisingly, we mostly find no decreasing linear relationship (i.e., anticorrelation) between the translation rates of uORFs and primary ORFs but an overall mildly positive correlation (Figure 2E; Table S3). This also holds true for uORFs that show overlap with the primary ORF start or for uORFs that possess a particularly strong translation initiation codon (AUG) context; e.g., a Kozak sequence (Kozak, 1987Kozak M. An analysis of 5′-noncoding sequences from 699 vertebrate messenger RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar) or a Translation Initiator of Short 5′ UTR (TISU) element (Elfakess and Dikstein, 2008Elfakess R. Dikstein R. A translation initiation element specific to mRNAs with very short 5'UTR that also regulates transcription.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3094Google Scholar) (Figure S2H). We then hypothesized that uORFs that are positionally conserved to other species may have a more profound effect on TE. In translatomes of rat and mouse hearts, we find 281 human uORFs with translation initiation site conservation to rodent uORFs (Tables S1 and S3), but these do not have a stronger effect on or anticorrelation with the primary ORF TE (Figure S2H). These analyses illustrate that, for most uORFs, there is no detectable quantitative dependency between the frequency of uORF translation and the observed decrease in primary ORF TE. However, a handful of uORFs are differentially translated in DCM hearts and do anticorrelate with the primary ORF TE, including ZMPSTE24 and EIF4G2 (Figure 2F). EIF4G2 contains a 5′ UTR internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and can autoregulate its own translation rates when cap-dependent translation is suppressed (Henis-Korenblit et al., 2000Henis-Korenblit S. Strumpf N.L. Goldstaub D. Kimchi A. A novel form of DAP5 protein accumulates in apoptotic cells as a result of caspase cleavage and internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Google Scholar), potentially contributing to the observed anticorrelation. The regulation of ZMPSTE24 may be of particular importance to cardiac physiology because ZMPSTE24 specifically processes prelamin A (LMNA). Defective LMNA processing because of mutations in ZMPSTE24 leads to pathological cardiac dilation, phenotypically identical to DCM caused by LMNA mutations (Galant et al., 2016Galant D. Gaborit B. Desgrouas C. Abdesselam I. Bernard M. Levy N. Merono F. Coirault C. Roll P. Lagarde A. et al.A Heterozygous ZMPSTE24 Mutation Associated with Severe Metabolic Syndrome, Ectopic Fat Accumulation, and Dilated Cardiomyopathy.Cells. 2016; 5: e21Google Scholar, Pendás et al., 2002Pendás A.M.

Defective prelamin A processing and muscular and adipocyte alterations in Zmpste24 metalloproteinase-deficient mice.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 94-99Google Scholar). The influence of natural genetic variation on translational regulation in human tissue has remained unexplored. We therefore identified single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions (indels) from constitutive exons of genes expressed in cardiac tissue and tested their local association with mRNA abundance, ribosome occupancy, and TE (STAR Methods; Figures S3A–S3C; Table S4). We detect variants associated with mRNA abundance of 421 genes (false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.05) (Figure S3A), with effects similar to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (GTEx Consortium, 2017GTEx ConsortiumGenetic effects on gene expression across human tissues.Nature. 2017; 550: 204-213Google Scholar) and known left ventricle expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs; Heinig et al., 2017Heinig M. Adriaens M.E. Schafer S. van Deutekom H.W.M. Lodder E.M. Ware J.S. Schneider V. Felkin L.E. Creemers E.E. Meder B. et al.Natural genetic variation of the cardiac transcriptome in non-diseased donors and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.Genome Biol. 2017; 18: 170Google Scholar). Most of these variants are not associated with ribosome occupancy (Table S4), consistent with extensive buffering observed previously in a similarly sized cohort of HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (Battle et al., 2015Battle A. Khan Z. Wang S.H. Mitrano A. Ford M.J. Pritchard J.K. Gilad Y. Genomic variation.

Tilgner H. Araya C.L. Tang H. et al.Integrative analysis of RNA, translation, and protein levels reveals distinct regulatory variation across humans.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 1610-1621Google Scholar). Conversely, we detect genetic associations with ribosome occupancy for 81 genes, of which variants in 31 genes are not associated with mRNA expression. Both observations indicate translational regulation, and, indeed, variants in 37 genes are significantly associated with altered gene TEs (Figure S3A; examples in Figure S3D). None of the exonic variants that are associated with TE are located in regulatory features such as uORFs or Kozak sequences, but 8 are predicted to affect RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding and RNA secondary structure (Table S4; Mao et al., 2016Mao F. Xiao L. Li X. Liang J. Teng H. Cai W. Sun Z.S. RBP-Var: a database of functional variants involved in regulation mediated by RNA-binding proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D154-D163Google Scholar). PTVs can have dramatic consequences on protein function, but medical relevance has only been established for a fraction of PTVs (DeBoever et al., 2017DeBoever C. Tanigawa Y. McInnes G. Lavertu A. Chang C. Bustamante C.D. Daly M.J. Rivas M.A. Medical relevance of protein-truncating variants across 337,208 individuals in the UK Biobank study.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/179762Google Scholar), potentially because of gene haplosufficiency, functional redundancy, or premature stop codon readthrough (Bartha et al., 2015Bartha I. Rausell A. McLaren P.J. Mohammadi P. Tardaguila M. Chaturvedi N. Fellay J. Telenti A. The Characteristics of Heterozygous Protein Truncating Variants in the Human Genome.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004647Google Scholar, Huang et al., 2010Huang N. Lee I. Marcotte E.M. Hurles M.E. Characterising and predicting haploinsufficiency in the human genome.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001154Google Scholar, Jia et al., 2017Jia J. Werkmeister E. Gonzalez-Hilarion S. Leroy C. Gruenert D.C. Lafont F. Tulasne D. Lejeune F. Premature termination codon readthrough in human cells occurs in novel cytoplasmic foci and requires UPF proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130: 3009-3022Google Scholar). In our cohort, we detect 346 potential PTVs: 144 nonsense mutations and 202 frameshift indels (Table S4; Figures S3E–S3G; STAR Methods). For all detected PTVs, we analyzed mRNA allele ratios and Ribo-seq coverage to estimate allele-specific expression (ASE) and the ability of the premature stop to terminate translation in the absence of complete nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Only 32 of the 346 detected PTVs (9.2%) display an allelic imbalance of heterozygous SNVs indicative of NMD (Figures 3A and 3B ; Figure S3H), suggesting that many alleles with truncating mutations do not undergo extensive NMD. As a measure of premature translation termination, we calculated ribosome drop-off rates by comparing ribosome occupancy before and after the PTV (STAR Methods). For only 59 of 346 PTVs (17.1%), ribosome occupancy is significantly lower downstream of the introduced stop than upstream (Figures 3C and 3D; Figure S3I). Thus, for most of the PTVs that can be detected at the RNA level, translation either appears to be terminated inefficiently or reinitiated downstream of the PTV, likely influencing the functional effect of these PTVs. TTNtvs are the most prevalent cause of genetic DCM (Herman et al., 2012Herman D.S. Lam L. Taylor M.R.G. Wang L. Teekakirikul P. Christodoulou D. Conner L. DePalma S.R. McDonough B. Sparks E. et al.Truncations of titin causing dilated cardiomyopathy.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 619-628Google Scholar), albeit with variable penetrance and expressivity (McNally and Mestroni, 2017McNally E.M. Mestroni L. Dilated cardiomyopathy: Genetic determinants and mechanisms.Circ. Res. 2017; 121: 731-748Google Scholar).

Type I interferons (IFNs) produced by almost all type of cells play a vital role in host defense against viral infection and cancer immunosurveillance (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014Ivashkiv L.B. Donlin L.T. Regulation of type I interferon responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 36-49Google Scholar, Zitvogel et al., 2015Zitvogel L. Galluzzi L. Kepp O. Smyth M.J. Kroemer G.

Type I IFNs composed of IFN-α, IFN-β, and other IFNs are induced following activation of cell-surface or intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), stimulator of IFN genes (STING) protein, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Burdette et al., 2011Burdette D.L.

In response to microbial products (e.g., viral or bacterial components) or endogenous molecules (e.g., cytosolic and extracellular DNA and RNA), PRRs transmit distinct downstream signaling pathways to trigger type I IFN production. Upon recognized by IFN receptors, the type I IFN signal activates the Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, leading to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which control innate and adaptive immunity and intracellular antimicrobial programs (MacMicking, 2012MacMicking J.D.

RLRs like RIG-I and MDA5, as members of PRRs, are main cytosolic RNA sensors to trigger innate immune response by sequentially activating downstream axis for type I IFN production (Schlee and Hartmann, 2016Schlee M.

Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB and IRF 3.Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Google Scholar). Upon sensing diverse cytosolic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), RIG-I undergoes conformational changes, oligomerization, and exposure of the N-terminal CARD domains to recruit a signaling adaptor called mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein. The transmembrane (TM) domain at C terminus of MAVS is necessary for its mitochondrial outer membrane localization. Once activated, MAVS develops a functional prion-like structure at mitochondria, which serves as a platform to form a MAVS signalosome for activating TBK1 and IKKε. Phosphorylation of IRF3 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) by TBK1 and IKKε drives their nuclear translocation, leading to subsequent transcription of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine (Honda et al., 2006Honda K.

As a major source of cellular energy and cell mass, glucose is metabolized via glycolysis into pyruvate, which can either be imported to mitochondria for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle entry to generate acetyl-CoA, through pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) in the presence of oxygen, or be catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to generate lactate when oxygen is not available. Interestingly, most cancer cells are addicted to aerobic glycolysis known as “Warburg effect” for their survival and proliferation even in the presence of oxygen, accompanied by high lactate generation (DeBerardinis and Thompson, 2012DeBerardinis R.J.

Although lactate is previously considered as a waste product of glucose metabolism, accumulating evidence has underscored its pivotal role in regulating diverse biological processes, such as macrophage polarization, T helper cell differentiation, as well as tumor immune surveillance (Brand et al., 2016Brand A.

Until now, no direct protein target of lactate is identified to our knowledge. Whether lactate participates in other intracellular signal transduction and biological outcome through direct protein targeting remains to be determined. To investigate whether energy metabolism participates in regulating type I IFN production, we employed an unbiased, systemic metabolomics approach to examine the global metabolic changes during RLR-induced type I IFN production. Intriguingly, most metabolic intermediates downstream of glucose, such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate, and lactate, exhibited decreased levels at the initial stage of type I IFN production (Figures 1A and 1B ). The levels of TCA intermediates, such as aconitate, succinate, fumaric acid, and malate, were also significantly downregulated, likely resulting from the reduced level of pyruvate, which shunts into the TCA cycle for the production of these intermediates. However, oxaloacetate (OAA) level was not significantly affected (Figure 1A). As the direct pyruvate downstream metabolite, Acetyl-CoA production would be expected to decrease due to the reduction in pyruvate level, leading to the slower consumption of OAA for citrate production and thus maintaining the OAA level. These results suggest that glucose metabolism is impaired during the RLR signaling activation. Systemic glucose metabolism changes during RLR-induced type I IFN production raised the possibility that glucose catabolism is involved in the regulation of type I IFN production. To test this possibility, we incubated cells with high or low glucose to monitor RLR induced cytokine production and found low glucose-treated cells showed much stronger induction of IFN-β and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA upon poly(I:C) transfection, but not herring testis DNA (HTDNA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, which activates STING and TLR signaling, respectively, compared with those under high glucose treatment (Figures 1C–1E; Figures S1A–S1D), indicative of the specificity of glucose change in regulating RLR signaling. Importantly, higher IFN-β induction and lower virus replication were observed in fasted mice treated with low glucose compared to those treated with high glucose (Figures 1F and 1G). Similarly, 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG), which blocks glucose metabolism by inhibiting hexokinase (HK) activity, markedly enhanced IFN-β and IL-6 production driven by different RLR stimuli including poly(I:C) transfection, Sendai virus (SeV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, leading to the reduction in virus replication (Figures 1H–1J; Figures S1E–S1G). These data suggest that downregulation of glucose metabolism promotes RLR-induced type I IFN production. Since most glucose intermediates downstream of HK were downregulated during RLR-mediated type I IFN induction (Figure 2A), it is conceivable that HK activity might be affected during RLR activation. Indeed, HK activity decreased at early phase of RLR activation, correlated well with dynamic changes of glucose metabolites (Figure 2B; Figure S2A), indicating that a transient suppression of glucose metabolism through HK inhibition may be required for RLR-mediated type I IFN induction. To further validate our notion, we knocked down HK2, the major isoform of HK in most human cell types, to mimic the suppression of glucose metabolism. Consistently, HK2 knockdown not only decreased glycolysis determined by reduced pyruvate and lactate levels but also markedly enhanced TBK1-IRF3 signaling, cytokine production, and SeV replication suppression upon RLR activation (Figure 2C; Figures S2B–S2E). Moreover, restoration of HK2 expression compromised the heightened effect of HK2 knockdown on IFN-β induction (Figure S2F).Figure S2Reciprocal Regulation between Hexokinase and MAVS, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Analysis of Hexokinase (HK) activity in purified mitochondria isolated from HEK293 cells infected with SeV for indicated hours.(B and C) Analysis of pyruvate, lactate level (B) and HK2 expression (C) in Hep3B cells with control or HK2 knockdown by using Colorimetric assay kit or immunoblotting.(D) Q-PCR analysis of IL-6 mRNA expression in Hep3B cells with control or HK2 knockdown and transfected with Poly (I: C).(E) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β or SeV specific mRNA expression in Hep3B cells with control or HK2 knockdown and infected with SeV.(F) Q- PCR analysis of IFN-β mRNA expression in Hep3B cells infected with control or HK2 shRNA with or without Flag-HK2 expression and then transfected with poly(I:C).(G) Whole cell lysates of THP1 cells transfected with HTDNA for indicated hours were collected for IP with MAVS antibody, followed by IB analysis for indicated proteins.(H) HEK293 cells transfected with Flag-Vector or Flag-RIG-I(N) together HA-MAVS were immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-HA antibody, and IP complexes were analyzed by immunoblot analysis.(I) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β mRNA expression in HEK293 cells with control or RIG-I knockdown and infected with SeV as described in Figure 2H.(J) Immunoblot analysis of MAVS expression in Hep3B cells with control or MAVS knockdown.(K) Analysis of hexokinase (HK) activity in purified mitochondria isolated from wild-type and MAVS knockout MEF cells (upper panel).

Hexokinase Is an Innate Immune Receptor for the Detection of Bacterial Peptidoglycan.Cell. 2016; 166: 624-636Google Scholar). To gain insight into how HK activity was downregulated at early stage of RLR activation, we examined whether mitochondria HK2 level changes upon RLR activation. Of note, mitochondria HK2 decreased upon the poly(I:C) transfection, but not HTDNA or LPS treatment (Figure 2D), which might account for the downregulation of HK activity during RLR activation. We next explored the mechanism underlying HK2 dissociation from mitochondria. Interestingly, MAVS, as a mitochondria localized protein, physiologically interacted with HK2, but not with other mitochondria proteins, like Tom20 (Figure 2E). Remarkably, the interaction between MAVS and HK2 declined during initial activation of RLR signaling triggered by SeV infection, but not STING signaling activation upon HTDNA transfection, correlated with the dissociation of HK2 from mitochondria (Figure 2F; Figure S2G). Moreover, a direct switch of MAVS binding from HK2 to RIG-I was observed in cells with ectopic expression of activated form of RIG-I (Figure 2G; Figure S2H). Furthermore, the dissociation of HK2 from MAVS upon RLR activation was not observed in RIG-I knockdown cells (Figure 2H; Figure S2I). These results suggested that RLR-triggered MAVS-RIG-I recognition hijacks HK2 binding to MAVS, leading to the impairment of HK mitochondria localization and activation. As the downregulation of HK activity during RLR activation coincidences with RIG-I-MAVS recognition and subsequent MAVS activation upon RLR agonist stimulation (Schlee and Hartmann, 2016Schlee M. Hartmann G. Discriminating self from non-self in nucleic acid sensing.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 566-580Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Seth et al., 2005Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB and IRF 3.Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Google Scholar), we asked whether MAVS can regulate mitochondria HK activity. Interestingly, we found significant reduction of HK activity was observed in MAVS knockdown and knockout cells compared to control cells, accompanied by decreased pyruvate and lactate levels as well as extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (Figures 2I and 2J; Figures S2J and S2K). These results suggest that MAVS maintains HK activity. HK associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane through its interaction with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which is involved in glycolysis regulation (Roberts and Miyamoto, 2015Roberts D.J. Miyamoto S.

Hexokinase Is an Innate Immune Receptor for the Detection of Bacterial Peptidoglycan.Cell. 2016; 166: 624-636Google Scholar). To examine whether VDAC binding to HK2 is necessary for the interaction between HK2 and MAVS, we applied a peptide that is known to disrupt HKs from VDAC (Prezma et al., 2013Prezma T. Shteinfer A. Admoni L. Raviv Z. Sela I. Levi I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. VDAC1-based peptides: novel pro-apoptotic agents and potential therapeutics for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e809Google Scholar). Notably, disrupting VDAC1 and HK2 interaction by this peptide impaired the interaction of MAVS with HK2, indicating that binding to VDAC is required for HK2 interaction with MAVS (Figures S2L and S2M). Collectively, we conclude that MAVS is a previously unrecognized key regulator for HK, and switching MAVS binding from HK2 to RIG-I during RLR activation triggers HK2 release from mitochondria leading to impairing HK activity and subsequent glucose metabolism. As the two major glucose catabolism pathways, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and anaerobic glycolysis are tightly controlled in cells by a multistep mechanism to execute diverse biological processes (Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011Lunt S.Y. Vander Heiden M.G. Aerobic glycolysis: meeting the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 441-464Google Scholar). We showed that downregulation of glucose metabolism is required for full activation of RLR signaling. To dissect the key step of glucose metabolism involved in regulating type I IFN production, we adapted various strategies to challenge glucose metabolism either by triggering the switch from OXPHOS to anaerobic glycolysis or vice versa. Metabolic fate of pyruvate is mainly controlled by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and PDHc, which convert pyruvate to lactate or acetyl-CoA for TCA cycle, respectively (Ganeshan and Chawla, 2014Ganeshan K. Chawla A. Metabolic regulation of immune responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 32: 609-634Google Scholar). As the crucial PDHc subunit, pyruvate dehydrogenase α (PDHA) knockdown impaired mitochondria OXPHOS, thus promoting anaerobic glycolysis for lactate production. Interestingly, we found robust decrease of IFN-β production in PDHA knockdown cells compared with control cells upon RLR activation (Figure 3A; Figures S3A–S3D). Similarly, the treatment of cells with UK5099, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondria pyruvate transporter blocking pyruvate mitochondria entry for OXPHOS (Davies et al., 2017Davies L.C. Rice C.M.

By contrast, dichloroacetate (DCA), which shifts glucose metabolism from anaerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and thus activating PDHc (Baker et al., 2000Baker J.C.

While galactose expectedly impaired anaerobic glycolysis-mediated lactate production, it markedly enhanced IFN-β and IL-6 production upon poly(I:C) or SeV challenge (Figure 3C; Figures S3J–S3L). As a result, cells infected with GFP-labeled VSV showed a marked reduction in viral replication, as determined by GFP fluorescence, under galactose treatment (Figure 3D). These data suggest that anaerobic glycolysis serves as a negative signal to repress RLR-mediated MAVS signaling and cytokine production.Figure S3Anaerobic Glycolysis Affects RLR Triggered Type I IFN Production, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) Q-PCR analysis of PDHA mRNA expression (A) and measurement of lactate secretion (B) for HEK293 cells with control and PDHA knockdown as described in Figure 3A.(C and D) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β (C) and PDHA (D) mRNA expression HEK293 cells transfected with control or PDHA siRNA.(E) Analysis of lactate secretion in supernatant of HEK293 cells treated with or without UK5099 (10 μM) overnight.(F and G) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β mRNA expression in HEK293 cells pretreated with UK5099 overnight and then transfected with poly(I:C) (F) or infected with SeV (G).(H) Immunoblot analysis of HEK293 cells treated with or without UK5099 (10 μM) overnight and then transfected with poly(I:C) as indicated.(I) Analysis of lactate secretion in HEK293 cells treated with DCA as described in Figure 3B.(J) Detection of lactate secretion in immortalized bone marrow macrophage cells cultured in mediums containing glucose (25 mM) or galactose (25 mM) as described in Figure 3C.(K and L) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β (Raw264.7 cells) (K) or IL-6 (iBMM cells) (L) expression treated the same as in (J) and transfected with poly(I:C) for indicated hours.(M) Q-PCR analysis of VEGF mRNA expression in HEK293 cells exposed to normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) and transfected with poly(I:C).(N) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β expression in RAW264.7 macrophage cells treated with the same conditions as in (M) and transfected with poly(I:C) for indicated hours.(O and P) Q-PCR analysis of Glut4 mRNA expression (O) and measurement of lactate secretion (P) in RAW264.7 macrophage cells as indicated.

Knowledge of this diversity could help in crop improvement; however, gold-standard genomes have been elucidated only for modern temperate varieties. Here, we present a high-quality reference genome (contig N50 of 15.78 megabases) of the maize small-kernel inbred line, which is derived from a tropical landrace. Using haplotype maps derived from B73, Mo17 and SK, we identified 80,614 polymorphic structural variants across 521 diverse lines. Approximately 22% of these variants could not be detected by traditional single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based approaches, and some of them could affect gene expression and trait performance. To illustrate the utility of the diverse SK line, we used it to perform map-based cloning of a major effect quantitative trait locus controlling kernel weight—a key trait selected during maize improvement. The underlying candidate gene ZmBARELY ANY MERISTEM1d provides a target for increasing crop yields. A high-quality reference genome of the maize SK inbred line and analyses between the tropical SK line and two other maize genomes, B73 and Mo17, provide insights into structural variation and crop improvement."

Our study highlights LADC oncogenesis driven by endogenous mutational processes. Lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) is the most common type of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (Herbst et al., 2018Herbst R.S. Morgensztern D. Boshoff C. The biology and management of non-small cell lung cancer.Nature. 2018; 553: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). A large proportion of LADCs are attributed to chronic tobacco smoking. By generating genome-wide base substitutions that often target cancer-related genes (e.g., KRAS and TP53) and inducing global epigenetic modifications in the airway epithelial cells, tobacco smoking directly causes LADCs (Alexandrov et al., 2013Alexandrov L.B.

In contrast, about 25% of lung cancers develop in individuals who have not been smoking, and most of them are LADCs (Sun et al., 2007Sun S. Schiller J.H. Gazdar A.F. Lung cancer in never smokers--a different disease.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). LADCs of non-smokers have been associated with female sex and Asian ethnicity. Although studies have postulated various environmental factors—including secondhand smoke, radon, air pollution, household coal use, and occupational carcinogens (Sun et al., 2007Sun S. Schiller J.H. Gazdar A.F. Lung cancer in never smokers--a different disease.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar)—the etiology and oncogenesis of LADCs in non-smokers are still enigmatic. LADCs of non-smokers present frequent genetic alterations activating several oncogenes, e.g., point mutations in EGFR (20%−50% of LADCs) and gene fusions involving ALK, ROS1, and RET (>10% of all LADCs) (Herbst et al., 2018Herbst R.S. Morgensztern D. Boshoff C. The biology and management of non-small cell lung cancer.Nature. 2018; 553: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Previous studies confirmed transforming and tumorigenic activities of these oncogene alterations in experimental models (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D.

Pharmacologic inhibition of corresponding kinases in patients with LADCs harboring these oncogene alterations has revolutionized treatment in advanced stages (Mok et al., 2009Mok T.S. Wu Y.L.

However, the mutational processes generating these oncogenic alterations and the timing of their acquisition have not been fully characterized. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a unique opportunity to explore the mutational processes operating in cancer genomes. Genome-wide patterns of base substitutions, termed mutational signatures, have provided insights into the mutagenic processes (Alexandrov et al., 2013Alexandrov L.B. Nik-Zainal S. Wedge D.C.

Furthermore, integrative analyses of point mutations and copy-number alterations have deciphered the temporal sequence of somatic mutations including key oncogenic drivers in individual cancers (Mitchell et al., 2018Mitchell T.J.

In this study, we investigate the mutational processes operating in LADCs, with a focus on cases with minimal genomic evidence of smoking-associated mutagenesis, especially those driven by fusion oncogenes. Through a case-by-case characterization of 138 LADCs, our study deciphers the mutational processes and the timing of complex genomic rearrangements that lead to the development of LADCs.

All tumors were surgically resected, histologically confirmed lung adenocarcinomas, or its related histology (pathology findings of newly sequenced cases are available in Table S1).

We analyzed whole-genome sequences of 138 LADCs in a unified pipeline (median sequencing coverages of 42X and 32X for tumor and matched normal tissues, respectively; Table S1; STAR Methods). In 79 out of 138 LADCs, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets were also combined (newly sequenced: n = 34, publicly available: n = 45). We found high-confidence somatic mutations including 4,136,995 base substitutions and 186,170 indels (STAR Methods). In addition, we identified 21,420 high-confidence somatic genomic rearrangements with a wide variation in quantity between tumors (median = 117, range = 3−867). A substantial fraction of the rearrangements were linked with at least two other rearrangements, indicating that they were a part of a complex genomic rearrangement. These rearrangements were systematically clustered based on their spatial proximity (STAR Methods). We identified 893 complex rearrangement clusters accounting for 77% (16,585 out of 21,420) of the genomic rearrangements. Most tumors contained multiple clusters (median = 5, range = 0−32), each harboring 3 to 700 rearrangements (median = 5). All the variant information is summarized and publicly available online (http://genome.kaist.ac.kr). To characterize the mutational processes generating point mutations, we first analyzed mutational signatures for the 138 LADCs based on the COSMIC catalog (Table S2; Alexandrov et al., 2015Alexandrov L.B. Jones P.H. Wedge D.C. Sale J.E. Campbell P.J. Nik-Zainal S. Stratton M.R. Clock-like mutational processes in human somatic cells.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Among 131 tumors with available smoking history, the vast majority of LADCs of clinical never-smokers (n = 58) showed minimal contribution of mutational signature 4 (a C:G>A:T-dominant signature, related to exposure to smoking carcinogen), which was consistent with their clinical history (Figure S1B). However, the LADCs of ever-smokers (n = 73) exhibited variable contribution of this mutational signature to their mutational profiles. This variation was not fully explained by the amount of smoking exposure (in terms of pack-years), nor by other clinical variables (Figure S1B). Many smoker LADCs showed strong activity of signature 4. However, about one-third of smoker LADCs (24 of 73) displayed minor to no contribution of signature 4 despite their smoking history (median 25 pack-years; range = 1.5−80), indicating that smoking-associated mutagenesis minimally contributed to their mutational history. These tumors were largely the LADCs harboring activating mutations or fusions of canonical oncogenes (21 of 24), and their genomic characteristics were highly similar to LADCs of clinical never-smokers (Figure S1C). Therefore, we used mutational signature-based criteria rather than clinical records in classifying the LADCs for downstream analysis. This classification clustered our cohort into two groups, based on the count and the relative burden of signature 4 mutations (by k-means clustering; Figure 1B): 55 signature 4-high (S4-high) and 83 signature 4-low (S4-low) LADCs (Figures 1B–1D; STAR Methods). S4-high LADCs were associated with older age of diagnosis (65 versus 58 years, p = 0.0003, Student’s t test), had a higher proportion of male patients (72% versus 37%, p < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test), carried more mutations in KRAS (n = 18 versus 4), and showed a base substitution burden >10 times greater than S4-low LADCs (24.01/Mbp versus 1.89/Mbp, p < 0.0001). Number of indels (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001) was strongly correlated with the number of signature 4 mutations (Figure S1D), indicating that this could be a part of the smoking-related mutational signature. S4-low LADCs (n = 83) included LADCs harboring activating mutations of EGFR (n = 28), KRAS (n = 4; G12D and G12A; both from non-C:G>A:T mutations), ERBB2 (n = 2), and MET (n = 2; exon 14 splice site mutations), and all LADCs with known fusion oncogenes involving ALK, ROS1, RET, and others (n = 39) (Figure 1A). Their mutational spectra (Figure 1D) were predominantly explained by two endogenous mutational signatures: signatures 5 (median = 58%) and 1 (17%). These signatures are known to have clock-like properties and have been observed in most germline and normal somatic cells (Alexandrov et al., 2015Alexandrov L.B. Jones P.H. Wedge D.C. Sale J.E. Campbell P.J. Nik-Zainal S. Stratton M.R. Clock-like mutational processes in human somatic cells.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In contrast to base substitutions and indels, the number of genomic rearrangements was not significantly different between S4-high and -low LADCs (171 versus 145, p = 0.2665; Figure 1E). Although the number of simple deletions was positively correlated with the number of signature 4 mutations (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001, Pearson’s correlation), no other types of simple rearrangements were correlated as such (Figure S1D). Furthermore, the number of breakpoints in complex rearrangement clusters was also uncorrelated with the burden of signature 4 mutations (r = 0.04, p = 0.6709). Instead, the number of rearrangements was different between the molecular subgroups (defined by major driver oncogenes) within the S4-low LADCs: a significantly larger burden of rearrangements in the LADCs driven by activating base substitutions or indels in canonical oncogenes (EGFR, KRAS, ERBB2, and MET; n = 36; hereafter we refer this group to as S4-low LADCs with oncogene mutations) compared to the LADCs driven by fusion oncogenes (n = 39) (211 versus 87; p = 0.0009; Figure S1E). This suggests that the rearrangement processes are not stochastic and could be related to the biological properties of driving oncogenes. Although the ethnic compositions were different between the S4-high (largely patients of European ancestry) and the S4-low LADCs (mostly East Asian patients), we found no meaningful difference in the genomic landscapes of the two major ethnicities within the LADC subgroups, in considering point mutation burden, rearrangements, and copy-number variations (Figure S1F). We next focused on the driver fusion oncogene-generating rearrangements (FORs) in 39 S4-low LADCs with fusion oncogenes (one in each). Robust in-frame transcription of these fusion oncogenes was confirmed by RNA-seq analysis in all available cases (n = 26; Figure S2A). In 10 LADCs (26%), the FORs were simple rearrangements (Figures 2A and S2B): large deletions (n = 2; SFTPB-ALK and EZR-ROS1), reciprocal inversions (n = 5; EML4-ALK, KIF5B-RET, and CCDC6-RET) and reciprocal translocations (n = 3; CD74-ROS1 and CCDC6-ROS1). In contrast, in 29 LADCs (74%), FORs were complex (Figures 2A and 2B), involving a median of 20 rearrangement breakpoints (range = 4−281). We classified these 29 complex FORs into several groups by integrating various genomic features including copy number and breakpoint microhomology (Table S3). The FORs were also manually reconstructed to infer the structure of derivative chromosomes (Figure S2C; STAR Methods).Figure 2Complex Genomic Rearrangements Generating the Fusion OncogenesShow full caption(A) Patterns of genomic rearrangements underlying the LADC fusion oncogenes.(B) Examples of chromothripsis generating EML4-ALK fusion oncogenes.

Except for occasional imbalance due to deletion bridges and secondary amplification events (LU-F6), copy-number profiles in chromoplexy-related FORs were mostly balanced.

https://openalex.org/W2947039670,"Summary Transforming the vast knowledge from genetics, biochemistry, and structural biology into detailed molecular descriptions of biological processes inside cells remains a major challenge—one in sore need of better imaging technologies. For example, transcription involves the complex interplay between RNA polymerase II (Pol II), regulatory factors (RFs), and chromatin, but visualizing these dynamic molecular transactions in their native intracellular milieu remains elusive. Here, we zoom into single tagged genes using nanoscopy techniques, including an active target-locking, ultra-sensitive system that enables single-molecule detection in addressable sub-diffraction volumes, within crowded intracellular environments. We image, track, and quantify Pol II with single-molecule resolution, unveiling its dynamics during the transcription cycle. Further probing multiple functionally linked events—RF-chromatin interactions, Pol II dynamics, and nascent transcription kinetics—reveals detailed operational parameters of gene-regulatory mechanisms hitherto-unseen in vivo. Our approach sets the stage for single-molecule studies of complex molecular processes in live cells."
https://openalex.org/W2946899078,"Current challenges in capturing naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) suggest that the factors regulating human naive versus primed pluripotency remain incompletely defined. Here we demonstrate that the widely used Essential 8 minimal medium (E8) captures hPSCs at a naive-to-primed intermediate state of pluripotency expressing several naive-like developmental, bioenergetic, and epigenomic features despite providing primed-state-sustaining growth factor conditions. Transcriptionally, E8 hPSCs are marked by activated lipid biosynthesis and suppressed MAPK/TGF-β gene expression, resulting in endogenous ERK inhibition. These features are dependent on lipid-free culture conditions and are lost upon lipid exposure, whereas short-term pharmacological ERK inhibition restores naive-to-primed intermediate traits even in the presence of lipids. Finally, we identify de novo lipogenesis as a common transcriptional signature of E8 hPSCs and the pre-implantation human epiblast in vivo. These findings implicate exogenous lipid availability in regulating human pluripotency and define E8 hPSCs as a stable, naive-to-primed intermediate (NPI) pluripotent state."
https://openalex.org/W2948458736,"To accelerate malaria elimination in areas where core interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are already widely used, it is crucial to consider additional factors associated with persistent transmission. Qualitative data on human behaviours and perceptions regarding malaria risk was triangulated with quantitative data on Anopheles mosquito bites occurring indoors and outdoors in south-eastern Tanzania communities where ITNS are already used but lower level malaria transmission persists. Each night (18:00h-07:00h), trained residents recorded human activities indoors, in peri-domestic outdoor areas, and in communal gatherings. Host-seeking mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors and outdoors hourly, using miniaturized exposure-free double net traps (DN-Mini) occupied by volunteers. In-depth interviews were conducted with household representatives to explore perceptions on persistent malaria and its control. Higher proportions of people stayed outdoors than indoors in early-evening and early-morning hours, resulting in higher exposures outdoors than indoors during these times. However, exposure during late-night hours (22:00h–05:00h) occurred mostly indoors. Some of the popular activities that kept people outdoors included cooking, eating, relaxing and playing. All households had at least one bed net, and 83.9% of people had access to ITNs. Average ITN use was 96.3%, preventing most indoor exposure. Participants recorgnized the importance of ITNs but also noted that the nets were not perfect. No complementary interventions were reported being used widely. Most people believed transmission happens after midnight. We conclude that insecticide-treated nets, where properly used, can still prevent most indoor exposures, but significant risk continues unabated before bedtime, outdoors and at communal gatherings. Such exposure is greatest for rural and low-income households. There is therefore an urgent need for complementary interventions, particularly those targeting outdoor-biting and are applicable for all people including the marginalised populations such as migratory farmers and fishermen. Besides, the differences in community understanding of ongoing transmission, and feedback on imperfections of ITNs should be considered when updating malaria-related communication and interventions."

The stalling of ribosomes during translation sequesters ribosomal subunits in an inactive state and produces truncated, potentially toxic nascent-polypeptides. Therefore, all organisms have dedicated mechanisms that sense ribosome stalling and mediate subunit recycling and nascent-chain proteolysis (Defenouillère and Fromont-Racine, 2017Defenouillère Q.

In bacteria, ssrA/tmRNA (transfer-messenger RNA) is the canonical system sensing stalled ribosomes (Janssen and Hayes, 2012Janssen B.D. Hayes C.S. The tmRNA ribosome-rescue system.Adv. Protein Chem. Struct. Biol. 2012; 86: 151-191Google Scholar, Moore and Sauer, 2007Moore S.D. Sauer R.T. The tmRNA system for translational surveillance and ribosome rescue.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 101-124Google Scholar). tmRNA—a tRNA-mRNA hybrid molecule—binds to the empty A site of ribosomes stalled at the 3′ end of mRNAs; its alanine-charged tRNA moiety accepts the incomplete nascent-polypeptide, while the open reading frame in its mRNA moiety allows the ribosome to resume translation in trans. The translated tmRNA open reading frame encodes an 8–35 residue-long peptide (15 residues in Bacillus subtilis) that becomes appended to the nascent-chain’s C terminus and functions as a degron (“SsrA tag”) for ClpXP and other proteases (Janssen and Hayes, 2012Janssen B.D. Hayes C.S. The tmRNA ribosome-rescue system.Adv. Protein Chem. Struct. Biol. 2012; 86: 151-191Google Scholar, Moore and Sauer, 2007Moore S.D. Sauer R.T. The tmRNA system for translational surveillance and ribosome rescue.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 101-124Google Scholar). The tmRNA system is exclusive to eubacteria. In eukaryotic cells, ribosomal stalling is sensed by “rescue” factors—such as Pelota/Dom34 and ABCE1/Rli1—which promote ribosomal splitting, releasing 60S subunits with a nascent-chain-tRNA conjugate still attached (Figure S1). Such jammed large ribosomal subunits are the substrates of ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC); the obstruction is sensed by Rqc2/NEMF, which next recruits the E3 ligase Ltn1/Listerin for tagging the nascent-chain with ubiquitin for proteasome-mediated destruction (Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010Bengtson M.H.

Moreover, studies in yeast have shown that when Ltn1 fails to find a suitable ubiquitylation site on the exposed nascent-chain, Rqc2 recruits “free” Ala- or Thr-charged tRNA to extend the nascent-chains with a C-terminal Ala and Thr tail (CAT tail), which pushes out and exposes Lys residues otherwise hidden in the exit tunnel to Ltn1 (Kostova et al., 2017Kostova K.K.

Although the activity of Rqc2 in RQC is tightly coupled to Ltn1’s, Ltn1 is eukaryote-specific while Rqc2 homologs are found in bacteria and archaea, with the phylogenetic distribution suggesting that an Rqc2 ancestor was already present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) (Burroughs and Aravind, 2014Burroughs A.M.

Whether prokaryotic Rqc2 homologs function in an RQC-related process has remained unknown—in bacteria, Rqc2 homologs are known as fibronectin-binding proteins, are required for virulence of important human pathogens, and have been proposed to act extracellularly in mediating host adhesion, although the mechanisms have remained unclear (Dramsi et al., 2004Dramsi S.

In archaea, Rqc2 homologs have not been characterized. To investigate whether prokaryotic Rqc2 homologs function in RQC, here, we study the Rqc2 homolog of B. subtilis, a Gram-positive model organism. We find that the bacterial Rqc2 homolog acts in a bona fide RQC pathway and provide evidence for RQC-mediated C-terminal tailing of nascent-chains outside of yeast. However, unlike in yeast where Rqc2 functions in facilitating Ltn1-mediated ubiquitylation, the B. subtilis Rqc2 homolog makes homopolymeric Ala tails that act themselves as a proteolytic signal and are directly recognized by the ClpXP protease. Finally, in light of the phylogenetic distribution of Rqc2 homologs, our findings suggest that an ancient RQC pathway was already present in the LUCA. Members of the Rqc2 family have a high extent of sequence homology (Burroughs and Aravind, 2014Burroughs A.M. Aravind L. A highly conserved family of domains related to the DNA-glycosylase fold helps predict multiple novel pathways for RNA modifications.RNA Biol. 2014; 11: 360-372Google Scholar; Figures 1A–1C and S2). Bioinformatics analyses predict that Rqc2 homologs also have similar domain arrangements, with the bacterial proteins comprised of a basic “core” of NFACT-N, helix-hairpin-helix, coiled coils, and NFACT-R domains (NFACT stands for “domain found in NEMF, FbpA, Caliban, and Tae2”) (Figure 1B; Burroughs and Aravind, 2014Burroughs A.M. Aravind L. A highly conserved family of domains related to the DNA-glycosylase fold helps predict multiple novel pathways for RNA modifications.RNA Biol. 2014; 11: 360-372Google Scholar). The NFACT-C domain has no known function, is only found in Rqc2 homologs in archaea and eukaryotes (see Figure S2B), and is not encoded by bacterial genes such as to complement the bacterial Rqc2 homologs in trans (Burroughs and Aravind, 2014Burroughs A.M.

Rqc2p and 60S ribosomal subunits mediate mRNA-independent elongation of nascent chains.Science. 2015; 347: 75-78Google Scholar). Bacterial and archaeal Rqc2 homologs are also likely to have an M domain equivalent—inspection of protein sequence conservation (Figure S2) suggests that at least some of the M domain’s secondary structure elements (Shao et al., 2015Shao S. Brown A. Santhanam B. Hegde R.S. Structure and assembly pathway of the ribosome quality control complex.Mol. Cell. 2015; 57: 433-444Google Scholar) are already present in prokaryotes. Moreover, human NEMF W375, which appears to mediate a stacking interaction with the SRL (Shao et al., 2015Shao S. Brown A. Santhanam B. Hegde R.S. Structure and assembly pathway of the ribosome quality control complex.Mol. Cell. 2015; 57: 433-444Google Scholar), is conserved between archaea and eukaryotes (Figure S2). The alignment also indicates that the M domain is smallest in bacteria and largest in eukaryotes (Figure S2). Consistent with the conservation of Rqc2 core domains among its homologs, the overall structural architecture of Streptococcus suis FBPS (Musyoki et al., 2016Musyoki A.M. Shi Z. Xuan C. Lu G. Qi J. Gao F. Zheng B. Zhang Q. Li Y. Haywood J. et al.Structural and functional analysis of an anchorless fibronectin-binding protein FBPS from Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus suis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 13869-13874Google Scholar) and human NEMF (Shao et al., 2015Shao S. Brown A. Santhanam B. Hegde R.S. Structure and assembly pathway of the ribosome quality control complex.Mol. Cell. 2015; 57: 433-444Google Scholar) show previously unappreciated similarity, with NFACT-N and NFACT-R domains brought together in physical proximity by the connecting coiled-coils (Figure 1D). Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that Rqc2 homologs across all domains of life share a fundamental role, and this role is to mediate RQC. Strengthening this possibility, we have observed that genes encoding Rqc2 homologs in archaea (that we refer to as aRqcH) are syntenic across diverse archaeal species with homologs of the stalled ribosome rescue factors, Pelota and ABCE1 (Figures 1E and S1; Table S1). Rqc2 homologs are represented in all major bacterial phyla, with the exception of gamma-proteobacteria, to which E. coli belongs, and actinobacteria (Burroughs and Aravind, 2014Burroughs A.M. Aravind L. A highly conserved family of domains related to the DNA-glycosylase fold helps predict multiple novel pathways for RNA modifications.RNA Biol. 2014; 11: 360-372Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that those proteins mediate RQC, we first analyzed the protein and RNA interactions of B. subtilis YloA, which we rename RqcH for “Rqc2 homolog” (B. subtilis RqcH and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rqc2 are 20% identical). As predicted, RqcH-Flag selectively and specifically co-immunoprecipitated both with proteins and with rRNA (23S and 5S) of the 50S ribosomal subunit, but not with proteins or rRNA (16S) of the 30S subunit (Figures 2A–2C and S3; Table S2). In fact, proteins of the 50S subunit were RqcH’s main interactors according to mass spectrometry analyses of co-immunoprecipitated proteins (Figure 2B), and RqcH-Flag co-sedimented primarily with 50S subunits in sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments (Figure 2D). These findings support the possibility that a major function of RqcH is in mediating RQC.Figure S3RqcH Selectively Co-immunoprecipitated with 23S rRNA, Related to Figure 2Show full captionrRNA co-immunoprecipitated with RqcH-Flag wild-type (red trace) and rRNA present in the cell extract (input; blue trace) analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) rRNA co-immunoprecipitated with RqcH-Flag wild-type (red trace) and rRNA present in the cell extract (input; blue trace) analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis. To further substantiate the model, we analyzed the structure of the co-immunoprecipitated RqcH-50S subunit complex by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). The results confirmed that RqcH predominantly co-immunoprecipitated with the 50S subunit (Figures 2E and S4), although a density that might have corresponded to RqcH was not evident, even after extensive sub-classification, perhaps because it is bound in a flexible state. Unexpectedly, the cryo-EM map also lacked density for the 23S rRNA helices H68, H69, and H71 (Figures S4C and S4D); the significance of this finding is currently unclear. Importantly, ∼30% of the 50S particles contained P-site tRNA density, and structural refinement indicated that the P-site tRNA was connected to nascent-chain density in the ribosomal exit tunnel (Figure 2E). This implies that the 50S subunit had engaged in translation prior to being bound by RqcH. We speculate that, like eukaryotic Rqc2 and NEMF (Lyumkis et al., 2014Lyumkis D. Oliveira dos Passos D. Tahara E.B. Webb K. Bennett E.J. Vinterbo S. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Joazeiro C.A.

The above results raised the question of how RqcH functions in bacterial RQC. The capillary electrophoresis fractionation experiment had revealed that RqcH-Flag also co-immunoprecipitated with small RNA species, presumed to be tRNA (Figure 2C). The major source of this tRNA was not 50S-obstructing peptidyl-tRNA conjugates, because the tRNA was present in ∼18-fold molar excess over 5S rRNA, as determined by comparison of the area under the respective peaks (Figure 3A). Moreover, unless spontaneously hydrolyzed, tRNA conjugated to nascent-chains would have been discarded from these samples during the phenolic extraction step utilized to purify total RNA from proteins. The observation was reminiscent of yeast Rqc2, which, in addition to binding to tRNA linked to nascent-chains trapped in 60S subunits, can bind to free Ala- or Thr-charged tRNA to make CAT tails (Shen et al., 2015Shen P.S. Park J. Qin Y. Li X. Parsawar K. Larson M.H. Cox J. Cheng Y. Lambowitz A.M. Weissman J.S. et al.Protein synthesis.

Likewise, mutation of the equivalent residue in RqcH (Asp97) markedly reduced the tRNA co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) (Figures 3A and S5A). Mutation of other three conserved residues in the NFACT-N domain (E121/I122/M123; henceforth referred to as EIM; Figure 1C) also predicted to function in tRNA binding based on structural modeling (not shown) similarly impaired the coIP (Figures 3A and S5A). These NFACT-N domain mutations selectively interfered with tRNA binding, without altering RqcH’s levels (Figure S5B) or binding to the 50S subunit (Figure S5A and data not shown). These results suggest that the binding of RqcH to free tRNA is specific and does not require the simultaneous association with 50S particles.Figure S5Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) RqcH co-immunoprecipitated with 23S (but not 16S) rRNA and tRNA (expanded figure).

Here, we identified neural circuits underlying thirst satiation and examined their contribution to reward signals. We show that thirst-driving neurons receive temporally distinct satiation signals by liquid-gulping-induced oropharyngeal stimuli and gut osmolality sensing. We demonstrate that individual thirst satiation signals are mediated by anatomically distinct inhibitory neural circuits in the lamina terminalis. Moreover, we used an ultrafast dopamine (DA) sensor to examine whether thirst satiation itself stimulates the reward-related circuits. Interestingly, spontaneous drinking behavior but not thirst drive reduction triggered DA release. Importantly, chemogenetic stimulation of thirst satiation neurons did not activate DA neurons under water-restricted conditions. Together, this study dissected the thirst satiation circuit, the activity of which is functionally separable from reward-related brain activity."

Here we show that directly reprogrammed neurons, despite their rapid maturation kinetics, can model teratogenic mechanisms that specifically affect early neurodevelopment. We delineated distinct phases of in vitro maturation during reprogramming of human neurons and assessed the cellular phenotypes of valproic acid (VPA), a teratogenic drug. VPA exposure caused chronic impairment of dendritic morphology and functional properties of developing neurons, but not those of mature neurons. These pathogenic effects were associated with VPA-mediated inhibition of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) pathways, which caused transcriptional downregulation of many genes, including MARCKSL1, an actin-stabilizing protein essential for dendritic morphogenesis and synapse maturation during early neurodevelopment. Our findings identify a developmentally restricted pathogenic mechanism of VPA and establish the use of reprogrammed neurons as an effective platform for modeling teratogenic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2948786527,"West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) is a widely distributed arthropod-borne virus that has negatively affected human health and animal populations. WNV infection rates of mosquitoes and human cases have been shown to be correlated with climate. However, previous studies have been conducted at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and the scale-dependence of these relationships has been understudied. We tested the hypothesis that climate variables are important to understand these relationships at all spatial scales. We analyzed the influence of climate on WNV infection rate of mosquitoes and number of human cases in New York and Connecticut using Random Forests, a machine learning technique. During model development, 66 climate-related variables based on temperature, precipitation and soil moisture were tested for predictive skill. We also included 20–21 non-climatic variables to account for known environmental effects (e.g., land cover and human population), surveillance related information (e.g., relative mosquito abundance), and to assess the potential explanatory power of other relevant factors (e.g., presence of wastewater treatment plants). Random forest models were used to identify the most important climate variables for explaining spatial-temporal variation in mosquito infection rates (abbreviated as MLE). The results of the cross-validation support our hypothesis that climate variables improve the predictive skill for MLE at county- and trap-scales and for human cases at the county-scale. Of the climate-related variables selected, mean minimum temperature from July–September was selected in all analyses, and soil moisture was selected for the mosquito county-scale analysis. Models demonstrated predictive skill, but still over- and under-estimated WNV MLE and numbers of human cases. Models at fine spatial scales had lower absolute errors but had greater errors relative to the mean infection rates."

In many (radiomic) studies, small size and heterogeneity of datasets is a challenge that often limits performance and potential clinical applicability of these models. The current study is example of a retrospective multi-centric study with challenges and caveats. To highlight common issues and emphasize potential pitfalls, we aimed for an extensive analysis of these multi-center pre-treatment datasets, with an additional 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan acquired during treatment.The dataset consisted of 138 stage II-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from four different cohorts acquired from three different institutes. The differences between the cohorts were compared in terms of clinical characteristics and using the so-called 'cohort differences model' approach. Moreover, the potential prognostic performances for overall survival of radiomic features extracted from CT or FDG-PET, or relative or absolute differences between the scans at the two time points, were assessed using the LASSO regression method. Furthermore, the performances of five different classifiers were evaluated for all image sets.The individual cohorts substantially differed in terms of patient characteristics. Moreover, the cohort differences model indicated statistically significant differences between the cohorts. Neither LASSO nor any of the tested classifiers resulted in a clinical relevant prognostic model that could be validated on the available datasets.The results imply that the study might have been influenced by a limited sample size, heterogeneous patient characteristics, and inconsistent imaging parameters. No prognostic performance of FDG-PET or CT based radiomics models can be reported. This study highlights the necessity of extensive evaluations of cohorts and of validation datasets, especially in retrospective multi-centric datasets."

Limb-innervating lateral motor column MNs (LMC-MNs) seem to be particularly vulnerable and are among the first MNs affected in ALS. Here, we report association of this differential susceptibility with reduced expression of the mir-17∼92 cluster in LMC-MNs prior to disease onset. Reduced mir-17∼92 is accompanied by elevated nuclear PTEN in spinal MNs of presymptomatic SOD1G93A mice. Selective dysregulation of the mir-17∼92/nuclear PTEN axis in degenerating SOD1G93A LMC-MNs was confirmed in a double-transgenic embryonic stem cell system and recapitulated in human SOD1+/L144F-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs. We further show that overexpression of mir-17∼92 significantly rescues human SOD1+/L144F MNs, and intrathecal delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV)9-mir-17∼92 improves motor deficits and survival in SOD1G93A mice. Thus, mir-17∼92 may have value as a prognostic marker of MN degeneration and is a candidate therapeutic target in SOD1-linked ALS. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

High throughput screening of clinically used drugs identified Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as protective in FA patient cells. Here we demonstrate that DMF significantly increases frataxin gene (FXN) expression in FA cell model, FA mouse model and in DMF treated humans. DMF also rescues mitochondrial biogenesis deficiency in FA-patient derived cell model. We further examined the mechanism of DMF's frataxin induction in FA patient cells. It has been shown that transcription-inhibitory R-loops form at GAA expansion mutations, thus decreasing FXN expression. In FA patient cells, we demonstrate that DMF significantly increases transcription initiation. As a potential consequence, we observe significant reduction in both R-loop formation and transcriptional pausing thereby significantly increasing FXN expression. Lastly, DMF dosed Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients showed significant increase in FXN expression by ~85%. Since inherited deficiency in FXN is the primary cause of FA, and DMF is demonstrated to increase FXN expression in humans, DMF could be considered for Friedreich's therapy."

The study population comprises 1176 children from the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 (CCC2000) assessed at age 5–7 years by the SDQ and reassessed at 11–12 years with the Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA) for evaluation of ICD-10 mental disorders. Odds Ratios (ORs), sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated for the SDQ predictive algorithms regarding ICD-10 diagnoses of hyperkinetic-inattentive-, behavioural- and emotional disorders. Significant ORs ranging from 2.3–36.5 were found for the SDQ predictive algorithms in relation to the corresponding diagnoses. The highest ORs were found for hyperkinetic and inattentive disorders, and the lowest for emotional disorders. Sensitivities ranging from 4.5–47.4, specificities ranging from 83.0–99.5, PPVs ranging from 5.0–45.5 and NPVs ranging from 90.6–99.0 were found for the SDQ predictive algorithms in relation to the diagnoses. The results support that the SDQ predictive algorithms are useful for screening at preschool-age to identify children at an increased risk of mental disorders in preadolescence.

Our aim was to compare survival and cost-effectiveness of PMCs placed by conventional techniques (CT) and biological Hall techniques (HT) using a prospective randomized control trial in a general dental practice from Khartoum. One hundred and nine and 103 PMCs were placed in randomly selected children (5-8years) with 1-2 carious primary molars using HT and CT respectively and followed for 2 years. Socioeconomic status, periodontal health, occlusion, anxiety, and procedure time were compared using student t-test. Kaplan-Meier survival rates and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) were compared between CT and HT. CT and HT groups were similar for age, gender, socio-economic status. Survival rates were high (over 90%) for both study arms and not statistically different (p>0.05). Anxiety scores were significantly higher in CT arm after 12 months compared to HT (p<0.001). Clinically, gingival and plaque indices were similar between groups (p>0.05) but occlusions were raised in nearly all subjects in the HT arm (p<0.05). Periodontal health improved, and occlusions adjusted over time in both arms. There were 3 (2.7%) and 6 (5.8%) minor failures, 7 (6.4%) and 6 (5.8%) major failures in HT and CT arms respectively. Mean procedure time was lower in HT (9.1 min) than CT (33.9 min); p<0.001. Mean PMC cost was US$2.45 and US$7.81 for HT and CT respectively. The ICER was US$136.56 more for each PMC placed by CT per life year. We show that PMCs have high survival outcomes in disadvantaged populations similar to results from developed countries. As HT can be carried out by less experienced dental operators and therapists, this biological approach provides a promising cost-effective option to manage caries in developing countries with limited resources.

Design Prospective observational cohort study. Setting A tertiary-care university hospital in Brazil. Patients Children younger than three years attending the pediatric emergency room with ALRI who were admitted to the hospital. Interventions None. Measurements and main results Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients from June 1st, 2008 to May 31st, 2009within the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for 17humanrespiratory viruses by molecular and immunofluorescence based assays. Simple and multiple log-binomial regression models were constructed to assess associations of virus type with a need for PICU admission. Age, prematurity, the presence of an underlying disease and congenital heart disease were covariates. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for at least one virus in 236 patients. Rhinoviruses were detected in 85.6% of samples, with a preponderance of rhinovirus C (RV-C) (61.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 59.8% and human coronavirus (HCoV) in 11% of the samples. Co-detections of two to five viruses were found in 78% of the patients. The detection of HCoV alone (adjusted relative risk (RR) 2.18; 95% CI 1.15–4.15) or in co-infection with RV-C (adjusted RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.23–4.58) was independently associated with PICU admission. Conclusions The detection of HCoV alone or in co-infection with RV-C was independently associated with PICU admission in young children hospitalized for ALRI."
https://openalex.org/W2948797047,"The need to consider the role of social factors in the efficacy of farm management and, consequently, in the onset and persistence of diseases typical to animal farms is increasingly being realized increasingly worldwide. Many risk analysis studies have been conducted to assess the role of various factors in the development of animal diseases; however, very few have accounted for the role of social factors. The aim of this work was to bridge this gap, with the main hypothesis that different socio-economic factors could be valid indicators for the occurrence of different animal diseases. A socio-economic analysis was performed using demographic characteristics of the farmers and data from 44 social indicators released by the Italian Statistician National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) database. African swine fever (ASF) in wild boars (WB) and domestic pigs and other endemic animal diseases and zoonoses in Sardinia were considered, such as cistic echinococcosis (CE), contagious agalactia (CA), trichinellosis, West Nile disease (WND), and bluetongue (BT). Seven different negative binomial regression models were fitted using the number of cases between 2011-2017. Three indicators-cultural demand, employment rate, and legality-showed a statistically significant association with risk for all the diseases considered, but with varying effects. Some indicators, such as the age and sex of the farmer, material deprivation index, number of farms and animals, micro-criminality index, and rate of reported thefts were common to ASF, CA, trichinellosis, and CE cases. Others such as the forest surface and the energy produced from renewable sources were common to BT, WND, and ASF in WB. Tourism in seasons other than summer was a valid predictor of ASF and trichinellosis, while out-of-region hospital use had a statistically significant role in CE risk identification. These results may help understand the social context in which these diseases may occur and thus guide the design and implementation of additional risk management measures that go beyond well-known veterinary measures."
https://openalex.org/W2948644971,"A number of recent studies have shown that cell shape and cytoskeletal texture can be used as sensitive readouts of the physiological state of the cell. However, utilization of this information requires the development of quantitative measures that can describe relevant aspects of cell shape. In this paper we develop a toolbox, TISMorph, that calculates a set of quantitative measures to address this need. Some of the measures introduced here have been used previously, while others are new and have desirable properties for shape and texture quantification of cells. These measures, broadly classifiable into the categories of textural, irregularity and spreading measures, are tested by using them to discriminate between osteosarcoma cell lines treated with different cytoskeletal drugs. We find that even though specific classification tasks often rely on a few measures, these are not the same between all classification tasks, thus requiring the use of the entire suite of measures for classification and discrimination. We provide detailed descriptions of the measures, as well as the TISMorph package to implement them. Quantitative morphological measures that capture different aspects of cell morphology will help enhance large-scale image-based quantitative analysis, which is emerging as a new field of biological data."

There exists a vital need for the discovery of novel drugs and identification of parasite drug targets for the development of chemotherapies. New drug development requires the identification of compounds that target molecules essential to parasite survival and preclinical testing in robust, standardized animal models of human disease. This process can prove costly and time consuming using conventional, low-throughput methods. We have developed a novel high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify anthelmintics for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths. Our high-throughput, plate reader-based assay was used to rapidly assess compound toxicity to Ancylostoma ceylanicum L1 larva. Using this method, we screened 39,568 compounds from several small molecule screening libraries at 10 μM and identified 830 bioactive compounds that inhibit egg hatching of the human hookworm A. ceylanicum by >50%. Of these, 132 compounds inhibited hookworm egg hatching by >90% compared to controls. The nematicidal activities of 268 compounds were verified by retesting in the egg hatching assay and were also tested for toxicity against the human HeLa cell line at 10 μM. Fifty-nine compounds were verified to inhibit A. ceylanicum egg hatching by >80% and were <20% toxic to HeLa cells. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined for the 59 hit compounds and ranged from 0.05–8.94 μM. This stringent advancement of compounds was designed to 1) systematically assess the nematicidal activity of novel compounds against the egg stage of A. ceylanicum hookworms in culture and 2) define their chemotherapeutic potential in vivo by evaluating their toxicity to human cells. Information gained from these experiments may directly contribute to the development of new drugs for the treatment of human hookworm disease."
https://openalex.org/W2948431369,"Aims The advent of direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and limited effectiveness of prevention have generated interest in “Treatment as Prevention” (TasP), in which those most likely to transmit HCV (i.e. people who inject drugs [PWID]) are treated to reduced secondary transmission. However, there are scant data regarding the feasibility of treating PWID at high risk for secondary transmission or the optimal approach to treatment delivery. Methods We conducted a 2:1 randomized trial of modified directly-observed (mDOT) versus unobserved HCV treatment with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir daily for 8 weeks among PWID with 36 weeks of follow-up in San Francisco from 2015–2017.

Results Of 83 individuals eligible for screening, 72 (87.6%) attended the screening visit, 33 were eligible, and 31 enrolled; mean age was 42 years, 81% were male, 74% white. All but one participant (in the mDOT arm) completed treatment and 89.4% of mDOT and 96.6% of unobserved arm visits were attended. HCV was undetectable for 96.8% (30/31) at end of treatment and 89.7% (26/29) 12 weeks later (1 relapse, 1 reinfection), with no differences by arm. Two additional reinfections were subsequently identified, for a reinfection rate of 16.3 (95% CI 5.3–50.5) per 100 person-years of observation. Conclusions It was feasible to recruit active PWID for HCV treatment and achieve high retention, viral response, and satisfaction with either mDOT or unobserved protocols, supporting treatment of PWID at risk of transmitting HCV to others. The reinfection rate suggests we successfully reached a high-risk population and that successful HCV TasP initiatives may aim to be sufficient in scope to significantly lower prevalence in the community.

https://openalex.org/W2948746275,"Background We conducted in 2018 a descriptive, quantitative, population-based, cross-sectional survey estimating the prevalence of cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and associated risk factors among adult women living in N’Djamena, Chad. Methods Five of the 10 districts of N’Djamena were randomly selected for inclusion. Peer educators contacted adult women in community-churches or women association networks to participate in the survey and come to the clinic for women’s sexual health “La Renaissance Plus”, N’Djamena. Medical, socio-demographical and behavioral informations were collected. HPV DNA was detected and genotyped in endocervical swab using Anyplex II HPV28 genotyping test (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea). Results 253 women (mean age, 35.0 years; range, 25–65) including 3.5% of HIV-positive women were prospectively enrolled. The prevalence of HPV infection was 22.9%, including 68.9% of HR-HPV infection and 27.6% being infected with multiple genotypes, providing a total HR-HPV prevalence of 15.8% (95% CI%: 11.3–20.3). The most prevalent HR-HPV genotypes were HPV-58, HPV-35, HPV-56, HPV-31, HPV-16, HPV-45, HPV-52 and HPV-18. HPV types targeted by the prophylactic Gardasil-9 vaccine were detected in nearly 70% (67.5%) and HPV-58 was the most frequently detected. HIV infection was a risk factor strongly associated with cervical infection with any HPV [adjusted Odds ratio (aOR): 17.4], multiple types of HPV (aOR: 8.9), HR-HPV (aOR: 13.2) and cervical infection with multiple HR-HPV (aOR: 8.4). Conclusion These observations highlight the unsuspected high burden of cervical HR-HPV infection in Chadian women, and point the potential risk of further development of HPV-associated cervical precancerous and neoplastic lesions in a large proportion of women in Chad. The high rate of preventable Gardasil-9 vaccine genotypes constitutes the rationale for introducing primary vaccine prevention against cervical cancer in young female adolescents living in Chad."
https://openalex.org/W2948866751,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disorder causing renal failure. Mutations of polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) account for most ADPKD cases. Defective ciliary localization of polycystin-1 (PC1), a large integral membrane protein encoded by PKD1, underlies the pathogenesis of a subgroup of patients with ADPKD. However, the mechanisms by which PC1 and other ciliary proteins traffic to the primary cilium remain poorly understood. A ciliary targeting sequence (CTS) that resides in ciliary receptors is considered to function in the process. It has been reported that the VxP motif in the intracellular C-terminal tail of PC1 functions as a CTS in an ADP ribosylation factor 4 (Arf4)/ArfGAP with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat and PH domain 1 (ASAP1)–dependent manner. However, other recent studies have revealed that this motif is dispensable for PC1 trafficking to cilia. In this study, we identified a novel CTS consisting of 8 residues (RHKVRFEG) in the PC1 C tail. We found that this motif is sufficient to bind protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)α, a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase in the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family. Mutations in this CTS motif disrupt binding with PP1α and impair ciliary localization of PC1. Additionally, short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of PP1α results in reduced ciliary localization of PC1 and elongated cilia, suggesting a role for PP1α in the regulation of ciliary structure and function.—Luo, C., Wu, M., Su, X., Yu, F., Brautigan, D.

https://openalex.org/W2948289379,"Lung tissue causes significant small-angle X-ray scattering, which can be visualized with grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging. Structural lung diseases alter alveolar microstructure, which often causes a dark-field signal decrease. The imaging method provides benefits for diagnosis of such diseases in small-animal models, and was successfully used on porcine and human lungs in a fringe-scanning setup. Micro- and macroscopic changes occur in the lung during breathing, but their individual effects on the dark-field signal are unknown. However, this information is important for quantitative medical evaluation of dark-field thorax radiographs. To estimate the effect of these changes on the dark-field signal during a clinical examination, we acquired in vivo dark-field chest radiographs of two pigs at three ventilation pressures. Pigs were used due to the high degree of similarity between porcine and human lungs. To analyze lung expansion separately, we acquired CT scans of both pigs at comparable posture and ventilation pressures. Segmentation, masking, and forward-projection of the CT datasets yielded maps of lung thickness and logarithmic lung attenuation signal in registration with the dark-field radiographs. Upon correlating this data, we discovered approximately linear relationships between the logarithmic dark-field signal and both projected quantities for all scans. Increasing ventilation pressure strongly decreased dark-field extinction coefficients, whereas the ratio of lung dark-field and attenuation signal changed only slightly. Furthermore, we investigated ratios of dark-field and attenuation noise levels at realistic signal levels via calculations and phantom measurements. Dark-field contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) per lung height was 5 to 10% of the same quantity in attenuation. We conclude that better CNR performance in the dark-field modality is typically due to greater anatomical noise in the conventional radiograph. Given the high physiological similarity of human and porcine lungs, the presented thickness-normalized, ventilation-dependent values allow estimation of dark-field activity of human lungs of variable size and inspiration, which facilitates the design of suitable clinical imaging setups."
https://openalex.org/W2948348485,"We propose a machine learning (ML)-based model for predicting cochlear dead regions (DRs) in patients with hearing loss of various etiologies. Five hundred and fifty-five ears from 380 patients (3,770 test samples) diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) were analyzed. A threshold-equalizing noise (TEN) test was applied to detect the presence of DRs. Data were collected on sex, age, side of the affected ear, hearing loss etiology, word recognition scores (WRS), and pure-tone thresholds at each frequency. According to the cause of hearing loss as diagnosed by the physician, we categorized the patients into six groups: 1) SNHL with unknown etiology; 2) sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL); 3) vestibular schwannoma (VS); 4) Meniere's disease (MD); 5) noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL); or 6) presbycusis or age-related hearing loss (ARHL). To develop a predictive model, we performed recursive partitioning and regression for classification, logistic regression, and random forest. The overall prevalence of one or more DRs in test ears was 20.36% (113 ears). Among the 3,770 test samples, the overall frequency-specific prevalence of DR was 6.7%. WRS, pure-tone thresholds at each frequency, disease type (VS or MD), and frequency information were useful for predicting DRs. Sex and age were not associated with detecting DRs. Based on these results, we suggest possible predictive factors for determining the presence of DRs. To improve the predictive power of the model, a more flexible model or more clinical features, such as the duration of hearing loss or risk factors for developing DRs, may be needed."
https://openalex.org/W2948840242,"The clinical significance of BRAF alterations in well-differentiated (WD) metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (panNET) is unknown, but BRAF-mutated panNET could represent a subset characterized by an identifiable and clinically actionable driver. Following the identification of two patients with WD metastatic panNET whose tumors harbored BRAF mutations, we queried the MSK-IMPACT series of 80 patients with WD metastatic panNET for additional mutations in BRAF, and in other genes involved in RAS/ RTK/ PI3K signaling pathways. BRAF mutations were identified in six samples (7.5%): two tumors harbored V600E mutations, one tumor each expressed K601E, T599K, and T310I mutations, and one tumor expressed both G596D and E451K BRAF. Few additional actionable driver alterations were identified. To determine the ERK activating capability of four BRAF mutations not previously characterized, mutant constructs were tested in model systems. Biochemical characterization of BRAF mutations revealed both high and low activity mutants. Engineered cells expressing BRAF K601E and V600E were used for in vitro drug testing of RAF and MEK inhibitors currently in clinical use. BRAF K601E demonstrated reduced sensitivity to dabrafenib compared to BRAF V600E, but the combination of RAF plus MEK inhibition was effective in cells expressing this mutation. Herein, we describe the clinical course of a patient with BRAF K601E and a patient with BRAF V600E WD metastatic panNET, and the identification of four mutations in BRAF not previously characterized. The combined clinical and biochemical data support a potential role for RAF and MEK inhibitors, or a combination of these, in a selected panNET population."
https://openalex.org/W2948286272,"Mucoid mucA22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic lung pathogen of cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients that is highly sensitive to acidified nitrite (A-NO2-). In this study, we first screened PA mutant strains for sensitivity or resistance to 20 mM A-NO2- under anaerobic conditions that represent the chronic stages of the aforementioned diseases. Mutants found to be sensitive to A-NO2- included PA0964 (pmpR, PQS biosynthesis), PA4455 (probable ABC transporter permease), katA (major catalase, KatA) and rhlR (quorum sensing regulator). In contrast, mutants lacking PA0450 (a putative phosphate transporter) and PA1505 (moaA2) were A-NO2- resistant. However, we were puzzled when we discovered that mucA22 mutant bacteria, a frequently isolated mucA allele in CF and to a lesser extent COPD, were more sensitive to A-NO2- than a truncated ΔmucA deletion (Δ157–194) mutant in planktonic and biofilm culture, as well as during a chronic murine lung infection. Subsequent transcriptional profiling of anaerobic, A-NO2--treated bacteria revealed restoration of near wild-type transcript levels of protective NO2- and nitric oxide (NO) reductase (nirS and norCB, respectively) in the ΔmucA mutant in contrast to extremely low levels in the A-NO2--sensitive mucA22 mutant. Proteins that were S-nitrosylated by NO derived from A-NO2- reduction in the sensitive mucA22 strain were those involved in anaerobic respiration (NirQ, NirS), pyruvate fermentation (UspK), global gene regulation (Vfr), the TCA cycle (succinate dehydrogenase, SdhB) and several double mutants were even more sensitive to A-NO2-. Bioinformatic-based data point to future studies designed to elucidate potential cellular binding partners for MucA and MucA22. Given that A-NO2- is a potentially viable treatment strategy to combat PA and other infections, this study offers novel developments as to how clinicians might better treat problematic PA infections in COPD and CF airway diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2948538605,"Background Fisherfolk are a most-at-risk population for HIV being prioritized for the scale up of HIV treatment in Uganda. Heavy alcohol use and potential drug use may be a major barrier to treatment adherence for men in this setting. Objective This study examines the prevalence of substance use, and its influence on antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence, among male fisherfolk on ART in Wakiso District, Uganda. Methods This cross-sectional study included structured questionnaires (N = 300) with men attending HIV clinics near Lake Victoria. Using generalized logistic modeling analyses with a binomial distribution and logit link, we conducted multivariate models to test the association between each alcohol variable (quantity and frequency index, hazardous drinking) and missed pills, adjusting for covariates, and tested for interactions between number of pills prescribed and alcohol variables. Results Thirty-one percent of men reported sub-optimal adherence. Half (46.7%) reported drinking, of which 64.8% met criteria for hazardous drinking. Illicit drug use was low (6%). In the multivariate model, men with greater scores on the alcohol frequency and quantity index were more likely to report missed pills compared to those reporting no drinking (AOR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.29–1.97). Hazardous drinking had a greater effect on missed ARV doses among men taking twice daily regimens compared to once daily (AOR: 4.91, 95% CI: 1.68–14.37). Conclusions Our findings highlight the need for targeted alcohol-reduction interventions for male fisherfolk on ART who drink at high quantities to improve ART adherence and to prevent the known negative health effects of alcohol for HIV-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2948657630,"When non-linear models are fitted to experimental data, parameter estimates can be poorly constrained albeit being identifiable in principle. This means that along certain paths in parameter space, the log-likelihood does not exceed a given statistical threshold but remains bounded. This situation, denoted as practical non-identifiability, can be detected by Monte Carlo sampling or by systematic scanning using the profile likelihood method. In contrast, any method based on a Taylor expansion of the log-likelihood around the optimum, e.g., parameter uncertainty estimation by the Fisher Information Matrix, reveals no information about the boundedness at all. In this work, we present a geometric approach, approximating the original log-likelihood by geodesic coordinates of the model manifold. The Christoffel Symbols in the geodesic equation are fixed to those obtained from second order model sensitivities at the optimum. Based on three exemplary non-linear models we show that the information about the log-likelihood bounds and flat parameter directions can already be contained in this local information. Whereas the unbounded case represented by the Fisher Information Matrix is embedded in the geometric framework as vanishing Christoffel Symbols, non-vanishing constant Christoffel Symbols prove to define prototype non-linear models featuring boundedness and flat parameter directions of the log-likelihood. Finally, we investigate if those models could allow to approximate and replace computationally expensive objective functions originating from non-linear models by a surrogate objective function in parameter estimation problems."
https://openalex.org/W2948250702,"The gains in maternal and child health in Nepal was impressive in the last two decade but success was unevenly distributed. The Dalits of Nepal are the most disadvantaged caste group and have benefitted least from the advances in maternal health service. This study investigated the rate of and factors associated with the institutional delivery among the Dalit women of the Mahottari, Nepal.A cross-sectional study was conducted during July-December 2014 using a structured questionnaire. A total of 328 mothers who had their childbirth within one year were interviewed. Descriptive statistics followed by binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were computed to find the association of key variables with institutional delivery.In this study, only 30% of the mother had institutional delivery. Fifty eight percent mothers had no any birth preparedness and complication readiness. Four or more antenatal visits (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.54, CI: 1.82-6.90), birth preparedness (AOR: 3.15, CI: 1.61-6.18), planned pregnancy (AOR: 2.63, CI: 1.37-5.06) and receiving advice from health staffs (AOR: 3.96, CI: 2.00-7.86) and mother's autonomy (AOR: 2.25, CI: 1.03-4.49) were associated with child birth at the health facility.This study indicated that birth preparedness, ANC visit frequency, planning of pregnancy, advice for institutional delivery and mother's autonomy were significantly associated with health facility delivery. Less than one-third mothers had institutional delivery and reasons were feeling of un-necessary, far distance, lack of transportation and associated cost; and birth preparedness is also low. Hence, promotion of birth preparedness, uptake of ANC service, proper counselling for institutional delivery, promoting women autonomy and strengthening women to have planned pregnancy were some recommendation to promote institutional delivery for such disadvantage community."
https://openalex.org/W2948531166,"This study evaluated the prognostic ability of lactate normalization achieved within 6 and 24 h from septic shock recognition. Data from a septic shock registry from October 2015 to February 2017 were reviewed. The study included 2,102 eligible septic shock patients to analyze the prognostic ability of lactate normalization, defined as a follow-up lactate level <2 mmol/L within six hours of bundle therapy and within 24 hours of delayed normalization. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 21.4%. The rates of lactate normalization within 6 and 24 h were significantly higher in the survivor groups than in the non-survivor group (42.4% vs. 23.4% and 60.2% vs. 31.2%; P<0.001, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both 6- and 24-h lactate normalization were independent predictors (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.75, p<0.001 and OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33–0.54, p<0.001, respectively). When we could not achieve the lactate normalization, the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value to predict mortality were 76.6%, 42.4%, 26.5% and 87.0% respectively for 6-h normalization, and 68.8%, 60.2%, 32.0% and 87.7% respectively for 24-h normalization. Besides 6-h lactate normalization, 24-h delayed lactate normalization was associated with decreasing mortality in septic shock patients. Lactate normalization may have a role in early risk stratification and as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2948567597,"The transcription elongation factor TFIIS is encoded by a three member gene family in vertebrates. Here we show that one member of this family, TCEA3, is upregulated during skeletal muscle differentiation and acts to promote gene activation by the myogenic regulatory family of transcription factors, which includes MyoD and myogenin. We show that myogenin is a direct regulator of Tcea3. Myogenin binds to the Tcea3 promoter and is required to recruit RNA polymerase II. TCEA3 can bind to both myogenin and MyoD and is co-recruited with the MRFs to promoters dependent on the MRFs. Depletion of myogenin inhibits the recruitment of TCEA3, suggesting that the interaction of TCEA3 with the MRFs serves to aid in recruitment to target promoters. Like TFIIS, we show that TCEA3 interacts with RNA polymerase II. TCEA3 travels with the elongating RNA polymerase II in the coding region of genes and depletions of TCEA3 inhibit the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters. In proliferating cells, TCEA3 expressed at low levels and is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, upon differentiation, TCEA3 is upregulated and transported exclusively to the nucleus. Thus, our data show that TCEA3 is a required co-factor for MRF driven gene expression during myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2948879693,"Introduction Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD) constitute a heterogeneous group of disorders, sometimes requiring surgical lung biopsies (SLB) to obtain a definite diagnosis. Transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBCB) is a new promising interventional bronchoscopic method of obtaining lung tissue that is gaining ground against SLB. Methods Fifty consecutive patients with indeterminate DPLD (definite/possible UIP excluded), after expert panel review referral, were retrospectively analyzed from January 2016 to August 2018. Patients underwent TBCB under deep sedation with endotracheal intubation and spontaneous breathing at a single, tertiary-care, reference hospital. Results A total of 110 TBCBs (2.7 per patient, range 1 to 4) were performed. Frequent complications included mild pneumothorax in 5 patients (10%), requiring only oxygen supplementation, and bleeding in 31 patients (62%) that was mild in 19 patients and moderate in 12 patients. No serious bleeding was observed. There was zero mortality and no serious adverse events. Adequate samples for diagnostic purposes were obtained in 46 patients (92%) and pathologic histologic diagnosis was reached in 40 patients (80%). The most frequent histopathological patterns were organizing pneumonia (OP) (25%) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (15%). After an expert panel review of all cases a final diagnosis was achieved in 38 patients, corresponding to a diagnostic yield of 76% for TBCB. Conclusion Our single center cohort demonstrates that establishing TBCBs as a new technique is safe and feasible after proper training in specialized centers, resulting in low complication rates and adequate diagnostic yields."

However, little is known about the effects of DAAs on survival, liver decompensation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).To compare the incidence of liver-related events and mortality between patients aged ≥65 and <65 years.Prospective study comparing patients aged ≥65 and <65 years treated with DAAs. The incidence of liver-related events and mortality, and HCC was compared between age groups.Five hundred patients (120 aged ≥65 and 380 aged <65 years) were included. The incidence of liver-related events was 2.62 per 100 patient-years (py) in older and 1.41/100 py in younger patients. All-cause mortality was 3.89 and 1.27/100 py in older and younger patients, respectively. The respective liver-related mortality rates were 1.12 and 0.31/100 py. In patients with cirrhosis (stage F4), all-cause mortality (P = 0.283) and liver-related mortality (P = 0.254) did not differ between groups. All five liver-related deaths were related to multifocal HCC. The incidence of HCC was 1.91 and 1.43 per 100 py in the older and younger groups, respectively (P = 0.747). The diagnosis of HCC was 8 months after the end of treatment.The incidence of liver-related events and liver-related mortality was low in older people treated with DAAs and was similar to that in younger patients. The extra mortality in people aged ≥65 years treated with DAAs seems to be secondary to non-liver-related causes. These results support the utilization of DAAs in patients aged ≥65 years."
https://openalex.org/W2948968855,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human lateral prefrontal cortex, particularly the ventral region, often causes considerable discomfort to subjects. To date, in contrast to abundant literature on stimulations to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex has been less frequently stimulated, partly because some subjects are intolerable of stimulation to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. To predict the additional number of subjects required for the stimulation of the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, 20 young healthy subjects reported two evaluation scores: the discomfort caused by TMS and the resulting intolerability to complete the TMS experiments. Single-pulse stimulation (SPS) or theta-burst stimulation (TBS) was administered to the lateral prefrontal cortex. The high-resolution extended 10–20 system was used to provide accurate estimation of the voxelwise scores. The discomfort ratings with the SPS and TBS were relatively higher in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex than those in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Both the SPS and TBS elicited maximal discomfort at the stimulation position F8. The SPS and TBS to F8 under the standard TMS protocols were intolerable for approximately one half (11 and 10, respectively) of the subjects. The intolerability was further calculated for all voxels in the lateral prefrontal cortex, which enabled us to estimate the additional number of subjects required for specific target areas. These results suggest that prior knowledge of subjects’ discomfort during stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex can be of practical use in the experimental planning of the appropriate number of recruited subjects and provide the database for the probability of intolerability that can be used to predict the additional number of subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2948329712,"Our goal has been to evaluate the importance that the incorporation of Bcl2 in the ER/PGR/Her2/Ki67 bio-profile can have as predictor of the Oncotype Dx categories.156 consecutive cases of HR+/Her2- pN0/1 primary breast carcinoma were sent to the Oncotype Dx test. Immunohistochemical determination of Bcl2/ER/PGR/Ki67/Her2 expression was evaluated for each case. After the selection of the appropriate cut-off values for PGR and Ki67, explorative as well as confirmative statistical analyses were performed to build and validate predictive risk-of-recurrence immunohistochemical only bio-profiles.The predictive capacity of these immunohistochemical profiles was compared with both traditional and TAILORx Oncotype Dx risk class classification. This comparison showed that immunohistochemical bio-profiles select those cases not associated with high risk-of-recurrence of disease (luminal-A/B and luminal A/B Bcl2) and those that are instead at high risk and therefore worthy of chemotherapy (luminal-B ki67 and luminal-B Bcl2/Ki67), strongly suggesting to only submit PGR-positive/Bcl2-Ki67 altered cases to Oncotype Dx, thus reducing the number of cases to be tested.Our results indicate that the addition of Bcl2 to an immunohistochemical bio-profile definitely improves its predictive capacity to correctly select which cases to send to the Oncotype Dx test. We have also suggested that institutions with a significant number of breast carcinomas sent to the Oncotype Dx test can use these latter to derive their own PGR and Ki67 cut-off values, overcoming the drawbacks of sharing common inter-laboratory values. Validation of these bio-profiles as predictors of the Oncotype Dx categories is ongoing in a prospective series of new cases."

We modeled the abundance of two Rhagoletis fly (Diptera: Tephritidae) pests, apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh), and western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran, in Washington State (WA), U.S.A. using biologically relevant environmental variables. We tested the hypothesis that abundance of the two species is influenced by different environmental variables, based on the fact that these two species evolved in different environments, have different host plants, and that R. pomonella is an introduced pest in WA while R. indifferens is native. We collected data on fly and host plant abundance at 61 randomly selected sites across WA in 2015 and 2016. We obtained land-cover, climate, and elevation data from online sources and used these data to derive relevant landscape variables and modeled fly abundance using generalized linear models. For R. pomonella, relatively high winter mean minimum temperature, low elevation, and developed land-cover were the top variables positively related to fly abundance. In contrast, for R. indifferens, the top variables related to greater fly abundance were high Hargreaves climatic moisture and annual heat-moisture deficits (indication of drier habitats), high host plant abundance, and developed land-cover. Our results identify key environmental variables driving Rhagoletis fly abundance in WA and can be used for understanding adaptation of insects to non-native and native habitats and for assisting fly quarantine and management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2948924895,"Non-invasive genotyping methods provide valuable information on insect populations. However, poor DNA amplification and time-consuming sampling procedures limit these methods, especially for small insects. An efficient and convenient method was developed for non-invasive, non-lethal genotyping of a large insect, Mythimna separata, and a small insect, Drosophila melanogaster, by amplification of endogenous and exogenous, nuclear and mitochondrial genes from insect frass, exuviae, and food waste. For M. separata, the chitin synthesis gene MsCHSB and the COI gene were successfully detected by PCR from exuviae DNA. However, a COI fragment could not be detected directly by PCR from frass, probably due to DNA degradation. To improve the detection rate, DNA from frass was first amplified by Multiple Displacement Amplification with phi29 DNA polymerase, after which the COI fragment was detected from all samples by PCR. For D. melanogaster, second instar larvae were reared individually for three days and then DNA was extracted from food waste of each individual. The endogenous fragment serendipity α (sryα), exogenous transgene ΦC31 integrase, and the kl-5 gene, a Y-chromosome-located male-specific marker gene were successfully detected from most samples. We developed a simple, non-invasive, non-lethal method to determine gender and identify transgenic individuals early in the larval stage. This universal method is applicable to most insects and has potential application in genetic and ecological studies of insects and other arthropods."
https://openalex.org/W2948926562,"Kidney failure occurs in 5–13% of individuals with sickle cell disease and is associated with early mortality. Two APOL1 alleles (G1 and G2) have been identified as risk factors for sickle cell disease nephropathy. Both risk alleles are prevalent in individuals with recent African ancestry and have been associated with nephropathic complications in other diseases. Despite the association of G1 and G2 with kidney dysfunction, the mechanisms by which these variants contribute to increased risk remain poorly understood. Previous work in zebrafish models suggest that the G2 risk allele functions as a dominant negative, whereas the G1 allele is a functional null. To understand better the cellular pathology attributed to APOL1 G2, we investigated the in vivo effects of the G2 risk variant on distinct cell types using RNA sequencing. We surveyed APOL1 G2 associated transcriptomic alterations in podocytes and vascular endothelial cells isolated from zebrafish larvae expressing cell-type specific reporters. Our analysis identified many transcripts (n = 7,523) showing differential expression between APOL1 G0 (human wild-type) and APOL1 G2 exposed podocytes. Conversely, relatively few transcripts (n = 107) were differentially expressed when comparing APOL1 G0 and APOL1 G2 exposed endothelial cells. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed transcripts in podocytes showed enrichment for autophagy associated terms such as “Lysosome” and “Phagosome”, implicating these pathways in APOL1 G2 associated kidney dysfunction. This work provides insight into the molecular pathology of APOL1 G2 nephropathy which may offer new therapeutic strategies for multiple disease contexts such as sickle cell nephropathy."

The DTI and QSM results on the phantom agreed well with those in the literature. Furthermore, studies on ex vivo specimens have demonstrated the applicability of DTI and QSM on our system to probe microstructural changes in a mild traumatic brain injury rat model. The feasibility of in vivo rat DTI was also demonstrated. We showed that the inserted ultra-high-strength gradient coil was successfully integrated on a clinically used magnet. After careful tuning and calibration, we verified the accuracy and quantitative preclinical imaging capability of the integrated system in phantom and in vivo rat brain experiments.

By performing an integrated analysis of A-to-I RNA editing, we found that single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) might induce the downregulation of ADAR2 enzymes, and further caused the abnormal occurrence of RNA editing in malignantly transformed cell lines. These editing events were significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes between normal cell line and malignantly transformed cell lines. In addition, oncogenes CTNNB1 and FN1 were highly edited and significantly overexpressed in malignantly transformed cell lines, thus may be responsible for the lung cancer progression. Our work provides a systematic analysis of RNA editing from cell lines derived from human bronchial epithelial cells with high-throughput RNA sequencing and DNA sequencing. Moreover, these results provide further evidence for RNA editing as an important tumorigenesis mechanism."

There has been little research to date on the question of what motivates real-life prospective memory tasks, and this is true both generally and within the subfield of aging and prospective memory. In the current study, we investigated whether the prospective memory tasks of younger and older adults were motivated by different personal goals and concerns, a question that has not been addressed in past research. Participants completed a questionnaire on current prospective memory tasks and the higher level goals and concerns that motivated these tasks. In general, younger and older adults reported prospective memory tasks motivated by different goals and concerns that reflected different social age systems or developmental tasks. Specifically, younger adults were more likely to report prospective memory tasks related to goals for education, profession, property, self, and leisure, and related to concerns about education and profession. In contrast, older adults were more likely to report prospective memory tasks related to concerns about world issues and war/terrorism. We also examined prospective memory task motivation more generally as approach motivation (goal-relatedness) and avoidance motivation (concern-relatedness). Both measures showed a gender by age group interaction. That is, older males showed especially low approach motivation and especially high avoidance motivation for their real-life prospective memory tasks. We suggest that a new approach to prospective memory research that incorporates motivational influences would enhance the ecological validity of prospective memory and aging research and may inform more effective memory interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2948648397,"The random allocation of patients to treatments is a crucial step in the design and conduct of a randomized controlled trial. For this purpose, a variety of randomization procedures is available. In the case of imperfect blinding, the extent to which a randomization procedure forces balanced group sizes throughout the allocation process affects the predictability of allocations. As a result, some randomization procedures perform superior with respect to selection bias, whereas others are less susceptible to chronological bias. The choice of a suitable randomization procedure therefore depends on the expected risk for selection and chronological bias within the particular study in question. To enable a sound comparison of different randomization procedures, we introduce a model for the combined effect of selection and chronological bias in randomized studies with a survival outcome. We present an evaluation method to quantify the influence of bias on the test decision of the log-rank test in a randomized parallel group trial with a survival outcome. The effect of selection and chronological bias and the dependence on the study setting are illustrated in a sensitivity analysis. We conclude with a case study to showcase the application of our model for comparing different randomization procedures in consideration of the expected type I error probability."

Here, we assessed how the Drosophila crossveinless (cv) gene, that encodes a BMP-binding factor, is transcriptionally regulated in the developing embryonic tracheal system. We identify an upstream regulatory region of cv that promotes reporter gene expression in the tracheal precursors. We further demonstrate that this promoter region is directly responsive to the basic, helix-loop-helix-PAS domain factors Trachealess (Trh) and Tango (Tgo), that function to specify tracheal fate. Moreover, cv expression in embryos is lost in trh mutants, and the integrity of the Trh/Tgo binding sites are required for promoter-lacZ expression. These findings for the first time elucidate the transcriptional regulation of one member of a family of BMP binding proteins, that have diverse functions in animal development."
