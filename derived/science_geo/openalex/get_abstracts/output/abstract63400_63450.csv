https://openalex.org/W2036543993,"Neurons in inferotemporal cortex (area TE) of the monkey had visual receptive fields which were very large (greater than 10 by 10 degrees) and almost always included the fovea. Some extended well into both halves of the visual field, while others were confined to the ipsilateral or contralateral side. These neurons were differentially sensitive to several of the following dimensions of the stimulus: size and shape, color, orientation, and direction of movement."
https://openalex.org/W1970683644,Normal neuroglial cells buffer the extracellular space around neurons and presynaptic terminals against increases in potassium ions. Epileptic foci resulting from brain injury are characterized by areas of intense fibrillary gliosis bordering neuronal tissue. The known pathological changes that occur in gliosis may impair glial control of extracellular potassium ions and lead to excessively excitable neuronal border regions.

https://openalex.org/W1584029749,"Abstract Purified cytocuprein from human liver, brain, and erythrocytes was found to contain near 2 g atoms of zinc per mole of protein. Both the copper and zinc were strongly bound and only relatively small amounts of them could be removed from the protein by dialysis against EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline under various conditions. Virtually all of the metal was removed by treatment with potassium cyanide at neutral pH. There appeared to be very little change in the tertiary structure of the protein upon removal of the metal. This was indicated by the observations that the velocity and equilibrium sedimentation properties, the immunological properties, and absorption in the 200 to 240 mµ range of the native and apoprotein are similar. However, such treatment resulted in a diminution in the intensity of absorption of cytocuprein between 240 and 400 mµ and the disappearance of the broad absorption peak with a maximum near 675 mµ."

https://openalex.org/W1515808875,"Abstract Formation of antibodies to human cytochrome c was observed in nearly all rabbits immunized with the antigen incorporated in complete Freund's adjuvant. About 30 to 40% of the antibodies failed to react with Macaca mulatta cytochrome c, which differs from the human protein only at Residue 58, where M. mulatta cytochrome c has a threonyl residue and the human protein has isoleucine. Only human and kangaroo cytochromes c, which have isoleucyl residues at this position, reacted with those antibodies which failed to combine with M. mulatta cytochrome c. In contrast, antibodies elicited in rabbits by M. mulatta cytochrome c reacted identically with M. mulatta and human cytochromes c. Thus, the presence of the hydrophobic correlates with the occurrence of an immunogenic determinant, whereas in the absence of isoleucine, this region is immunogenically inert. Those antibodies to human cytochrome c which do combine with the M. mulatta protein reacted equally well with both proteins, indicating that the identity in amino acid sequence, outside the isoleucine site, correlates with identity in antigenic structure. In contrast, some of the antigenic sites of kangaroo cytochrome c which interacted with antibody to human cytochrome c displayed a lower affinity for the antibody than corresponding sites on the human protein. The isoleucine site, however, was found to be antigenically identical in the human and kangaroo proteins. The appearance of this in human and kangaroo cytochromes c, and its importance in immunogenicity, emphasize the difficulties inherent in attempting to analyze evolutionary pathways through antigenic analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2018284469,"Abstract Acid-soluble phosphate compounds represent about 25% of the total phosphate of Bacillus megaterium vegetative cells, but only 7% of the total phosphate in dormant spores. In vegetative cells, 12 compounds make up 90% of the acid-soluble phosphate. These same compounds predominate throughout growth and early sporulation, although their relative amounts change during the process. One hour before refractile spores appear within sporangia, 3-phospho-d-glyceric acid (PGA) becomes a major component of the sporangial pool and, with the appearance of refractile spores, PGA becomes more difficult to extract. PGA is the largest component of the acid-soluble phosphate pool of B. megaterium spores produced in rich as well as minimal media, and also predominates in Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis spores. Spore PGA appears to be synthesized in a compartment which is inaccessible to inorganic phosphate in the medium, although, at the time of synthesis, Pi from the medium does enter the sporangium. PGA in dormant spores is very firmly bound, and does not readily exchange with external PGA."
https://openalex.org/W1536237973,"Abstract A soluble enzyme from Mycobacterium phlei catalyzes the reaction: Fatty acid + S-adenosylmethionine → fatty acid methyl ester + S-adenosylhomocysteine The reaction was studied by incubation of fatty acid with S-adenosylmethionine-methyl-14C and isolation of the labeled ester. This was characterized by thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography and by isolation of labeled methanol from alkaline hydrolysates of the ester. Of several substrates tested only S-adenosylmethionine was an effective methyl donor (Km = 2.5 x 10-5 m) and oleic acid was the most effective fatty acid acceptor (Km = 1.3 x 10-3 m). Some methyl ester was formed when phospholipids were added to the incubation mixture, presumably because lipase action liberated fatty acids which could serve as substrates. The optimum pH for the reaction lay between 8 and 9. Some inhibition of the reaction was observed with calcium ion, while S-adenosylhomocysteine was a potent inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1525726899,"Abstract Pools of free amino acids in spores and vegetative cells were compared. Spores contained a restricted number of free amino acids, in contrast with the wide variety found in vegetative cells. l-Glutamic acid was the predominant component of the amino acid pools of vegetative cells and of spores of several species. Free l-lysine and l-arginine were found in spores of some species. Spore extracts also contained several ninhydrin-reactive compounds which could not be identified with commonly occurring amino acids. The level of free glutamate in spores was not greatly affected by the amount of glutamate in the sporulation medium, and was the same whether sporulation occurred in a simple or a complex medium. The free glutamate in spores was very firmly bound and did not exchange with exogenous glutamate, but it could be released by extraction with water at 100°. During germination, free l-glutamate was released to the medium. A wide variety of free amino acids was generated from endogenous sources during germination, apparently by proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1980256697,Penicillin induces partial depolarization and increased excitability of the neuronal membrane of crayfish stretch receptor. Such effects suggest that the epileptic focus created by the topical application of penicillin to the mammalian cerebral cortex may result from the lowering of the threshold for impulse initiation by excitatory synaptic action within the neuron population.

https://openalex.org/W1548338247,"Abstract Mutants of Escherichia coli that fail to show the characteristic increase in permeability induced by brief treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate have been isolated. They were examined to see whether they release lipopolysaccharide as expected during such a treatment. Mutants derived from two strains released only 20 to 40% less lipopolysaccharide than their parents, but further analysis of one mutant and its parent showed that this represented reduction of a specific lipopolysaccharide fraction. Both organisms released two lipopolysaccharide components differing in sedimentation rate in sucrose density gradients, but while both released similar amounts of the faster moving component, the mutant released only about one-third as much of the slower moving component. These results suggest that release of the slower component may be required for the permeability increase induced by EDTA."

https://openalex.org/W1561059576,"Abstract Photooxidation of supernatant glutamate aspartate transaminase, limited to the stage during which much of the enzyme activity and only histidine residues are destroyed, does not induce gross protein structural changes as judged by ultracentrifugation, optical rotatory dispersion in the ultraviolet region, and microcomplement fixation techniques. Photooxidized apoenzyme has been shown to bind at least 90% as much coenzyme as the native enzyme and forms holopyridoxal or pyridoxamine enzyme which is very similar to the native enzyme in optical and absorption spectral properties in the visible region of the spectrum. The absorption spectrum of photooxidized apo- or holoenzyme has a new maximum at 325 mµ. Because of analogy to the absorption of the photooxidation product of a model compound, glycyl-histidyl-glycine, the new maximum in photooxidized transaminase has been assigned to the photoproduct of the altered histidines in the enzyme. Circular dichroism measurements of apoenzyme revealed positive ellipticity bands in the 280 to 300 mµ regions of the spectrum. They remain essentially unaltered after photooxidation. Binding of pyridoxal phosphate to this apoenzyme results in the appearance of the well known positive ellipticity bands in the visible region and formation of new negative ellipticity bands centered at 298 and 290 mµ in the aromatic region. Photooxidation eliminates the 290 mµ band from the pyridoxal form of the holoenzyme. The circular dichroism pattern of pyridoxamine phosphate bound to photooxidized transaminase is identical with that of native pyridoxamine holoenzyme only if this enzyme form is produced by transamination of photooxidized pyridoxal holoenzyme, not if formed by addition of pyridoxamine phosphate to photooxidized apoenzyme. Another physical anomaly resulting from photooxidation is the shift of the bound pyridoxal phosphate pK from 6.3 to 6.8. Since controlled photooxidation results in modification of only histidyl residues, this shift in pK may be due to the modification of a histidine in the steric vicinity of the pyridoxal phosphate at the active site, resulting in a localized perturbation of the environment of the coenzyme. The role of the histidyl residue at the active site cannot be associated with coenzyme binding."

https://openalex.org/W1552492563,"Abstract In the serum of patients with hyper-pre-β-lipoproteinemia there frequently occurs in abundance an ultracentrifugally distinct low density lipoprotein component of the Sf 20 class. This study concerns the characterization of this component, present in the serum of 14 of 15 patients. The lipoprotein has been isolated ultracentrifugally; it has the electrophoretic and immunological properties of a β-lipoprotein but is distinct from very low density lipoproteins. It has a buoyant density of 1.004 g per ml which is lighter than the major low density lipoproteins of normal serum, and this observation is consistent with its higher triglyceride content. This lipoprotein has a sedimentation coefficient corrected for concentration and viscosity of -68 S, measured in a solvent of density 1.20 g per ml, and a molecular weight of approximately 4.2 million. Electron microscopy of this larger low density lipoprotein shows spherical macromolecules with a diameter approximating 256 A."
https://openalex.org/W1523169438,"Abstract A complex containing 15 to 20% of the lipopolysaccharide, 10 to 15% of the phosphatidylethanolamine, and 10 to 15% of the UDP-galactose-lipopolysaccharide galactosyltransferase of the cell is released from Escherichia coli cells by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. It can be separated from the rest of the released material, which consists mainly of an additional 30 to 35% of the lipopolysaccharide of the cell, by sedimentation in a 10 to 30% sucrose gradient. The ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine phosphate to lipopolysaccharide glucose in the complex is 1.6:1. The enzyme complex is unstable as isolated but can be stabilized in 20% sucrose or glycerol. It has been purified 10-fold over the material released by EDTA and 20-fold over extracts obtained by sonic treatment of whole cells. Varying cell concentration during EDTA treatment does not alter the amount of complex released per cell, and labeled lipopolysaccharide or phosphatidylethanolamine added during EDTA treatment is not incorporated into the complex. These results, as well as additional evidence presented, suggest that the complex is not formed during isolation, but is the biosynthetic unit present in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2019697991,"Abstract During germination in simple or complex media, the 3-phosphoglyceric acid content of dormant spores was rapidly utilized, and inorganic phosphate was generated from endogenous sources. The uptake of Pi from the medium during the first 40 min of germination in a complex medium or in glucose was extensive as compared to germination initiated by l-alanine or KBr. In the complex medium Pi was incorporated into acid-insoluble material (RNA) within 5 to 10 min. The principal acid-soluble products were glucose-6-P, fructose diphosphate, ATP, and l-α-glycerophosphate. The hexose phosphates increased throughout the first 40 min of germination. The level of α-glycerophosphate passed through a maximum in a complex germination medium, but not in the other media. These results indicate that energy-yielding metabolism begins very early in germination. Endogenous reserves, such as phosphoglyceric acid, may represent the earliest energy source, and at least part of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway becomes functional within a few minutes after germination is initiated. These results do not necessarily imply the absence of a pathway of direct oxidation of hexose monophosphates, but intermediates specific to this pathway were not found."

https://openalex.org/W1541070547,"Abstract Xanthine oxidase appears to be the endogenous activating agent of inactive holotryptophan pyrrolase. Injection of 4-hydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (allopurinol), a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, in control, hydrocortisone-treated, or tryptophan-treated rats is followed by inhibition of the activity of tryptophan pyrrolase in whole liver homogenates and high speed supernatants. This inhibition is not caused by a direct effect on tryptophan pyrrolase, because allopurinol does not inhibit the activity or conjugation with its prosthetic group in purified preparations of tryptophan pyrrolase. Nor is the synthesis de novo of tryptophan pyrrolase caused by hydrocortisone impaired by allopurinol. Furthermore, removal of xanthine oxidase from high speed liver supernatants by addition of homologous antibody is followed by a loss of activation of the inactive holotryptophan pyrrolase by purines. The degree of activation of the inactive enzyme by purines is dependent upon the level of xanthine oxidase activity. Because this activation by purines is not dependent upon addition of hemoglobin, the xanthine oxidase is apparently activating the inactive holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1994799312,"ETHYLENEDIAMINETETBAACETIC acid (EDTA) is known to increase the permeability of Enterobacteriaceae to certain compounds such as actinomycin1 and to make Escherichia coli susceptible to lysozyme lysis2. Presumably, this is related to the disruption of the cell wall characterized by loss of lipopolysaccharide3. Weiser, Asscher and Wim-penny4 reported that EDTA increases the sensitivity of certain organisms resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, chlor-amphenicol and tetracycline presumably by overcoming their permeability barrier to these antimicrobials. Resistance to ampicillin, penicillin and chloramphenicol has been demonstrated to be the result of an inactivation of the drugs by penicillinase5,6 and chloramphenicol acetyl trans-ferase7. The mechanism of resistance to tetracycline is unclear although Franklin8 suggested a change in permeability in E. coli with transferable resistance."

But if a mixture of 90Sr and 90Y is injected intramuscularly, 90Sr is free to diffuse into the blood stream but the injected 90Y is almost immobilized locally. The 90Sr is largely taken up into the bones and in these circumstances soft tissue content of 90Y may be an index of transport of 90Y formed in bone out of bone and into the blood stream."
