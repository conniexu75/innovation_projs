https://openalex.org/W2077024125,"Abstract A method is described for the rapid determination of binding capacity and subcellular distribution of radioactive dexamethasone by cultured lymphoma cells. Using it, a number of steroid-resistant lymphoma cell clones were shown to be deficient in steroid binding to specific cytoplasmic receptors (r-) in transfer of the receptor-steroid complex to nuclei (nt-), or in the reactions subsequent to nuclear localization of the complex (d-). The relative proportions of those types of variants were determined in a steady-state population. About 80% were r-, and the remainder were equally divided between nt- and d-. Quantitative steroid-binding experiments suggest that certain receptor-containing variants possess altered receptor molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1990927954,"The effect of reverse transformation agents (dibutyryl 3′:5′ cyclic adenosine monophosphate plus synergizing compounds like testosterone) on Chinese Hamster Ovary cells has been studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, under conditions of low and high cell density. The disappearance of the cell surface knobs or blebs and the cell elongation previously described by light microscopy are even more striking under the higher resolving power of electron microscopy. The cell elongation is accompanied by and appears to be due to an increase in number of microtubules per unit volume of cytoplasm, and a change in their distribution from a random arrangement to an orderly alignment in parallel to each other and to the long axis of the cell. Increasing cell density, and therefore number of cell contacts in untreated cultures, causes the morphology to change in the direction to be expected if the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP is increased. Ultrastructural details of the cells in the various conditions studied are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1508157020,"A number of synthetic and naturally occurring steroids were studied for competitive binding to two progesterone receptors, one in chick oviduct and another in human uterus. The results show a good correlation of relative (to progesterone) binding affinity with progestational activity as measured by subcutaneous Clauberg assay. 17α-Ethynyltestosterone and closely related compounds compete very well in binding to both receptors; 19-nor derivatives show dramatic enhancement of binding affinity to the human receptor. Of the substituted progesterones tested, 21-fluoro- and 6αfluoroprogesterone competed best with progesterone for binding to both receptors. 17α-Acetoxyprogesterone and the substituted 17α-acetoxyprogesterones tested were fairly good competitors for the human receptor but did not compete at all for the chick. The binding data are assessed in terms of structural requirements for formation of a steroid-receptor complex. The data suggest that the receptors are able to modify the mode of binding at ring D to accommodate several different types of C-17 substitution. Of the steroids with reactive halo, thio, diazo or chloromercuri substituents which were tested as possible substrates for affinity labeling of the receptor active site, only 6α- and 6β-bromoprogesterone and 17β-thiol- and 17β-methylthio-4-androsten-3-one competed sufficiently well with progesterone as to be considered good candidates."
https://openalex.org/W1560957286,"Pancreatic islets rich in β cells and microdissected from noninbred ob/ob mice contained about 15 pmol sialic acid per μg dry weight as determined by a microversion of the Warren thiobarbituric acid method. Removal of half of the sialic acid by treatment with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase had no effect on the islet content of insulin, moderately inhibited glucose oxidation, and resulted in decreased insulin secretory responses to 20 mM D glucose, 5 mM D glyceraldehyde, 20 mM L leucine, 10 mM L arginine, and 5 μg of glucagon per ml. In contrast, the insulin releasing action of 20 mM glucose in combination with 5 mM theophylline, 1 mM N 6, O 2' dibutyryl adenosine 3':5' monophosphate, or 0.1 mM iodoacetamide, and insulin release in response to 0.1 mM glibenclamide, 0.05 mM chloromercuribenzene p sulfonic acid, 1 mM 6,6' dithiodinicotinic acid, and 1 mM 4 acetamido 4' isothiocyanate stilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid were not significantly inhibited. In addition to the above previously known stimulators of insulin release, cholera toxin was studied. It did not stimulate insulin release in the absence of glucose but potentiated the insulin releasing action of 20 mM glucose. The potentiating action of 5 μg of cholera toxin per ml was abolished by neuraminidase treatment of the islets. In control islets incubated for 60 min with 1 or 5 μg of cholera toxin per ml or 5 mM theophylline, the content of cyclic adenosine 3':5' monophosphate (cyclic AMP) was significantly increased and was correlated with the potentiating actions of cholera toxin and theophylline on glucose initiated insulin release. Treatment with neuraminidase abolished the capacity of cholera toxin, but not that of theophylline, to raise the islet content of cyclic AMP. The cyclic AMP content did not differ between islets incubated for 60 min with 3 or 20 mM glucose alone, although insulin release was markedly stimulated by the higher concentration. Conversely, cholera toxin doubled the content of cyclic AMP in control islets incubated without glucose although insulin release was not stimulated. It is suggested that sialic acid is essential for the activity of adenylate cyclase in pancreatic β cells and hence for the maintenance in these cells of cyclic AMP at a concentration that is requisite for adequate insulin release in response to glucose and certain other stimuli. However, the results fail to support the idea that the capacity of glucose to initiate insulin release is mediated by stimulation of the adenylate cyclase. (Less)"
https://openalex.org/W1493241817,"Abstract Adenosine and the adenine nucleotides AMP, ADP, and ATP (but not adenine) cause a rapid increase in the concentration of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in cultured human astrocytoma cells. Adenosine and AMP are equi-potent, causing a half-maximal rise in cAMP content at a concentration of about 10 µm. The time course of a rise in cAMP content to the maximal level effected by adenosine or AMP is the same (t1/2 ≃ 1 min). AMP is converted to adenosine in the incubation medium but not to an extent sufficient to account for its effect. The rate of uptake of adenosine into the cells is markedly faster than that of AMP, even though the t1/2 of their effects is the same. During a 10-min exposure of cells to 100 µm [3H]adenosine, the intracellular concentration of cAMP rises to 600 to 800 pmoles per mg of protein, of which only 30 to 40 pmoles per mg of protein are contributed by exogenous adenosine. The uptake of adenosine can be inhibited to greater than 95% by dipyridamole without any inhibition of the effect of adenosine on cAMP content. Such observations suggest that nucleotides act directly and need not be converted to adenosine to cause a rise in intracellular cAMP and that adenosine need not enter the cell to increase cAMP content. Theophylline is a rapidly acting, competitive inhibitor of the effect of adenosine. The inhibitory effect of theophylline is presumed to occur at the proposed extracellular site of action of adenosine and could not be related by our experiments to its well known action as an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity. On the other hand, papaverine potentiates the effect of adenosine, presumably as a result of the inhibition of phosphodiesterase. In contrast to theophylline, papaverine is a potent inhibitor (I50 = 17 µm) of the soluble, low Km phosphodiesterase from the astrocytoma cells. Catecholamines, which potentiate the effect of adenosine in brain slices, cause only additive increases in cAMP content in the astrocytoma cells when present with adenosine. Neither α- nor β-adrenergic receptor antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol) have any inhibitory action on the effect of adenosine. The results suggest that adenosine increases intracellular cAMP content as a result of its interaction with a specific plasma membrane surface receptor which results in the activation of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1994868772,"Abstract Mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells that were resistant to the adenine analog 2, 6-diaminopurine generally were deficient in the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyl transferase. Such mutants did not occur spontaneously, and were rare even after mutagenesis, presumably because two active genes in this pseudodiploid line must be affected for the recessive drug-resistant phenotype to be expressed. Revertants of one such double mutant were selected on the basis of their ability to utilize adenine as a purine source. These revertants contained reduced levels of enzyme activity and were presumed to be heterozygous for the enzyme structural gene. Forward mutation to diaminopurine resistance, starting with these heterozygous revertants, occurred at a rate 1,000 times greater than that found for the original homozygous cells. The results agree with predictions based on the idea that mutations in the structural gene for the enzyme are responsible for the drug-resistant character of these variants."
https://openalex.org/W1489218150,"Abstract Equations have been derived for calculating the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and AMP in equilibrium with phosphocreatine and creatine by use of association constants for the protonated species and Mg2+ complexes of the reactants and the equilibrium constants for the AMP kinase and creatine kinase reactions. The equations have been used to calculate the expected concentrations of free ATP, ADP, and AMP as high energy phosphate is discharged by a representative muscle. Arguments are advanced for the validity of the results as an estimate of in vivo conditions when based only on measured concentrations of phosphocreatine, creatine, and total adenosine phosphates. Changes in phosphocreatine concentration cause rapid changes in the calculated concentrations of ADP and AMP that are consistent with postulated regulatory effects of these compounds on the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. The amount of ADP and AMP formed by a given discharge of high energy phosphate depends upon the H+ concentration, and physiological changes in pH are sufficient to cause significant changes in the rate of glycolysis in this way. The physiological significance of phosphocreatine as an effector is less clear."
https://openalex.org/W2077845371,"Steroid binding has been studied in cytoplasmic extracts of normal mouse kidney, an androgen sensitive organ, and of kidney from mice affected with testicular feminization (Tfm mutant) that have inherited androgen resistance. Macromolecules that bind 3H-5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT, the presumed active androgen in most testosterone target organs) and sediment in glycerol gradient at 8–9S can be observed in cytosol from kidney of mice of different sex, age, and hormonal history. The 8–9S component from normal females is heat labile, pronase sensitive, and dissociated by high salt to a lower molecular weight entity. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for the DHT-receptor complex is 1.4 × 10−9M, and there are about 1500 binding sites per testosterone-sensitive kidney proximal tubule cell. Cytosol from Tfm/Y  animals also shows a sharp peak of 3H-DHT-binding activity at 8–9S. The Tfm protein, however, has reduced affinity for DHT and binds only 10–25% as much 3H-DHT as wild-type receptor at 3H-DHT concentrations from 5 × 10−11M to 1.2 × 10−8M. Scatchard analysis, and studies involving competition with unlabeled steroids, relative binding of various androgens, and dissociation of the 3H-DHT-binding protein complex after extensive dialysis have led to the conclusion that Tfm kidney contains very little, if any, androgen receptor with properties similar to that found in normal kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1576955306,"Abstract A sensitive, specific, and rapid immunochemical method for the measurement of the synthesis of lipoproteins in rooster liver is described. Incubation of liver slices with [3H]leucine resulted in the incorporation of radioactivity into protein material that could be precipitated from crude extracts by a monospecific antibody directed against the antigen common to plasma very low density and low density lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein antigen). Use of this assay permitted the demonstration of a 4-fold increase in the rate of hepatic synthesis of the very low density lipoprotein antigen occurring 16 hours after the administration of estrogen to roosters. Since under these conditions as much as 18% of the total protein synthesized by the rooster liver represented very low density lipoprotein antigen, this system may provide a model for studying not only the effect of a steroid hormone on specific gene expression but also the mechanism of regulation of very low density lipoprotein synthesis in higher animals."
https://openalex.org/W1601355415,"The serum factor that participates in the fibrinolytic activity associated with tumor and transformed cells has been purified by two independent methods. The chromatographic, electrophoretic, and biochemical properties of this molecule are consistent with the properties of the known fibrinolytic pre-cursor, plasminogen. Purified plasminogen was isolated by affinity chromatography from fetal bovine, chicken, dog, and human sera and its activation by factors released from a variety of transformed cell cultures, including human tumor cell lines, was examined. The specificity of activation is absolute in the avian system, i.e. chicken plasminogen is activated only by the factor from cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus. The mammalian plasminogens are activated to varying extents by the activators from all transformed cells tested."

Inhibition is correlated with a depolarization of the presynaptic process, as in the mammalian spinal cord; the depolarization is accompanied by a conductance increase, and is mediated by interneurons that can be excited by a variety of routes."

https://openalex.org/W1542594322,"Concentrations of total NAD+ and NADH have been measured and the NAD+:NADH ratio calculated for 3T3 fibroblasts and SV40 transformed 3T3 cells and for normal rat kidney fibroblasts and murine sarcoma virus (Kirsten strain)-transformed normal rat kidney fibroblasts. The absolute levels were found to decrease 2- to 3-fold with transformation. The NAD+:NADH ratio in the normal cells ranged from 3.1 to 3.6, and increased 3- to 4-fold as they grew from logarithmic to stationary phase. The final ratio was found to be a direct function of the final cell density achieved for the 3T3 cells. In contrast, the NAD+:NADH ratio of transformed cells was low, (1.2 to 3.2) and did not rise when the cells reached a heavy density. Comparable results were obtained for the ratio of free NAD+:NADH. This ratio was determined by analysis of cellular pyruvate and lactate concentrations and calculated using the Keq of lactate dehydrogenase. Attempts to alter the ratio by treatment of the cells with agents capable of elevating intracellular cyclic adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate levels, such as N6, O2′-dibutyryl cyclic AMP or prostaglandin E1, were unsuccessful. Nor did serum deprivation or agents capable of lowering cyclic adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate levels affect the NAD+:NADH ratio. We suggest that the inability of cells to elevate their NAD+: NADH ratio at confluency is a characteristic of transformed cells and related to their defective growth control."
https://openalex.org/W1642960380,"Abstract In the genetically obese (ob/ob) mouse, a well characterized model of insulin resistance, the number of insulin receptors on thymic lymphocytes is decreased as has been previously noted with liver cells and with liver and fat cell membranes from these animals. Furthermore, insulin stimulates the transport of α-aminoisobutyric acid less effectively in thymocytes from the obese mice than in cells from thin animals, suggesting that a reduction in receptors per cell is associated with a decrease in cell responsiveness to insulin. Thus it appears that the insulin receptors in lymphocytes respond in vivo to the same metabolic influences as do receptors in liver and fat and are therefore suitable for the study of the physiology of the insulin receptors."

The complex sediments at 8–9S in glycerol gradients. In males bearing the androgen-insensitivity mutation (analogous to human testicular feminization), the specific dihydrotestosterone receptor activity is decreased about 8 fold. The residual binding activity has wild type affinity (KD = 1.5 × 10−9M) for dihydrotestosterone and also sediments at 8–9S. Kidney cytosol from castrated mutant mice displays a new binding component with low affinity and high capacity for dihydrotestosterone."
https://openalex.org/W1541314927,"Abstract Apolipoprotein-serine (apoLP-Ser or apoC-I) is one of the apoprotein constituents of human plasma very low density lipoprotein. The protein has 57 amino acid residues, including one residue of methionine and is lacking histidine, cysteine, cystine, and tyrosine. The NH2 terminus of apoLP-Ser is threonine and the COOH terminus is serine. Cleavage of apoLP-Ser with cyanogen bromide, followed by chromatography of the digest on Bio-Gel P-30 in 25% formic acid, yielded two fragments corresponding to the NH2-terminal (CNBr I) and the COOH-terminal (CNBr II) fragments and accounting for the 57 residues of the intact protein. The amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides from CNBr I and chymotryptic peptides from CNBr II were determined by conventional methods. The amino acid sequence of apoLP-Ser is as follows: Thr-Pro-Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Ala-Leu-Asp-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Phe-Gly-Asn-Thr-Leu-Glu-Asp-Lys-Ala-Arg-Glu-Leu-Ile-Ser-Arg-Ile-Lys-Gln-Ser-Glu-Leu-Ser-Ala-Lys-Met-Arg-Glu-Trp-Phe-Ser-Glu-Thr-Phe-Gln-Lys-Val-Lys-Glu-Lys-Leu-Lys-Ile-Asp-Ser."
https://openalex.org/W1499091864,"Abstract In collagenase isolated rat pancreatic islet incubates, d-glucose stimulated the accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) as measured both by incorporation of [3H]adenine into cAMP and by assay of the total amount of nucleotide by the protein kinase binding method. l-Glucose failed to stimulate [3H]cAMP accumulation in islets. d-Glucose had no effect on [3H]cAMP accumulation in rat adipocytes. It is therefore concluded that the action of glucose is specific in the islet. Stimulation by d-glucose (5 mg per ml) was detectable after 45 to 135 s. [3H]cAMP accumulated rapidly during the first 10 min of incubation, after which a sustained but lower rate of accumulation was observed up to 120 min. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 0.1 mm, markedly potentiated the stimulatory effect of a high glucose concentration, while [3H]cAMP accumulation in the presence of low glucose (0.6 mg per ml) was only slightly raised. Stimulation of cAMP accumulation induced by high glucose in the presence of IBMX was abolished within 3 min when the glucose concentration of the medium was rapidly decreased. Efflux of radioactive cyclic nucleotide was undetectable under basal conditions. In incubates stimulated by high glucose with or without IBMX, elevated contents of [3H]cAMP could be measured from 30 min on, the nucleotide continuing to accumulate in the medium up to 120 min of incubation. Over a range of glucose concentrations (0.6 to 7.0 mg per ml), insulin release after a 60-min incubation was well correlated with medium [3H]cAMP content both in the presence and absence of IBMX. Stimulation of both cAMP accumulation and insulin release were observed with small changes in medium glucose level such as increasing it from 0.9 to 1.2 mg per ml. In the incubation system used here, cAMP accumulation seems to precede the initiation of insulin release. The results presented in this report are compatible with the hypothesis that insulin release induced by glucose may be mediated by cAMP in the β-cell."
https://openalex.org/W1982962779,"Abstract Viral mRNA isolated from infected cells and the virion RNA isolated from two classes of defective interfering particles have been analyzed by RNA-RNA duplex reactions. The results show that the RNA of both defective interfering particles is viral, not host in origin. The RNA isolated from the two defective particles represents homogeneous populations of molecules containing only part of the genetic information present in the whole VSV genome. Annealing competition experiments indicate that if any overlap exists between the two, it is less than 220 nucleotides. We conclude from the data presented that a rudimentary physical map of the VSV and DI particle genomes is Our results suggest that there is not a single specific site that is required for autointerference."
https://openalex.org/W1507566314,"Abstract Cytochrome o can be chemically reduced by excess dithionite and oxidized by ferricyanide and ammonium persulfate. The latter reagent is colorless and allows spectral observations in the Soret region. The spectrum of the form of the reduced cytochrome, which has absorption maxima at 576, 543, and 414 nm, is elicited in aerobic solution by enzymatic reduction with NADH, and when formed in this way the oxygenated form is very stable. When the solution is made anaerobic, the spectrum of the reduced (non-oxygenated) form appeared. The reduced form becomes spectrophotometrically detectable when the dissolved oxygen falls below 14 µm and is at half-maximal concentration at 6 µm oxygen. The reintroduction of oxygen results in reappearance of the spectrum of the oxygenated form. The addition of ammonium persulfate or sodium dithionite to the oxygenated form produced the oxidized or reduced cytochrome, respectively. Bubbling carbon monoxide through solutions of the oxygenated form shifted the absorption maxima to 566, 535, and 419 nm, which are the absorption maxima characteristic of the reduced cytochrome-carbon monoxide complex. Cyanide, which can bind to the oxidized form of cytochrome o, had no effect on the spectrum of the oxygenated form, but the formation of this form from oxidized cytochrome o and NADH was inhibited in the presence of cyanide. Hydrogen peroxide forms a complex with cytochrome o that has a spectrum similar to the spectrum of the oxygenated form."
https://openalex.org/W1551342273,"Abstract Apolipoprotein-serine (apoLP-Ser) is one of the protein constituents of human plasma very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). The protein has 57 amino acids with 1 residue each of methionine and tryptophan. Cleavage of apoLP-Ser with cyanogen bromide yields the NH2-terminal fragment (CNBr I) and COOH-terminal fragment (CNBr II) having 38 and 19 residues, respectively. CNBr II contains the single residue of tryptophan. We have studied the interaction of egg phosphatidylcholine with apoLP-Ser and its cyanogen bromide fragments. The binding of phospholipid was studied in the following ways: (a) by inhibition of the reactivation of defatted β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from beef heart mitochondria; (b) by changes in circular dichroic and fluorescence spectra; (c) by isolation of complexes of the protein and peptide fragments with phospholipid, using density gradients of KBr; and (d) by rouleaux formation by phospholipid vesicles as determined by electron microscopy after negative staining with phosphotungstic acid. ApoLP-Ser strongly inhibited the reactivation of defatted β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; 10 µg of the apoprotein inhibited reactivation by 85%. CNBr I and CNBr II inhibited reactivation to a lesser extent than did the intact apoprotein. The α helical content of apoLP-Ser was about 56%, as determined by circular dichroism. Mixing the apoprotein with bilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylcholine resulted in an estimated increase in the α helical content to about 73%. The apparent helicity of CNBr I was increased from 34 to 65% and of CNBr II from 15 to 25% in the presence of phosphatidylcholine. The addition of phospholipid vesicles to apoLP-Ser produced a blue shift (6.0 nm) in the fluorescence maximum, indicating a shift of the tryptophan to a more hydrophobic environment. A similar finding was made with CNBr II in the presence of phospholipid. In ultracentrifugal flotation experiments, complexes of the phospholipid with apoLP-Ser, CNBr I, and CNBr II, each floated at a density less than 1.08 g per ml, whereas apoLP-Ser in the absence of phospholipid sedimented to a density greater than 1.18 g per ml. Finally, when the phosphatidylcholine vesicles were titrated with increasing amounts of the protein or cyanogen bromide fragments and negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid, the vesicles exhibited a series of morphological changes from free vesicles to linear arrays of stacked discs as determined by electron microscopy. These findings are interpreted in light of a theory of phospholipid-binding involving amphipathic helical regions that contain positively and negatively charged amino acids and are consistent with the localization of such regions in the primary chemical structure of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1593557350,"A cell-free enzyme preparation obtained from bramble tissues (Rubus fruticosus) grown in vitro was found to be capable of opening the cyclopropane ring of cycloeucalenol, producing obtusifoliol. The identification of this substance was based on the use of radiochromatography, formation of functional derivatives, and crystallization to constant specific radioactivity. A boiled preparation failed to mediate the reaction, proving that the opening of the 9β,19β-cyclopropane ring is enzymatic. Enzymatic activity was bound to the microsomal fraction and was not dependent upon the addition of exogenous ATP or NADH. Microsomes from other higher plant species (germinating peas and tobacco tissue cultures) were found to be active in transforming cycloeucalenol into obtusifoliol, but microsomes from rabbit liver were unable to perform this reaction. 24-Methylene cycloartanol, cycloartenol, and cycloeucalenol, which are ubiquitous constituents of higher plants, were tested as substrates for the enzymatic reaction. The 4,4-dimethyl sterols are very poor substrates, whereas cycloeucalenol is efficiently converted. In a second group of experiments, three substrates differing only by the number of methyl substituents in position 4 were incubated with the microsomal fraction. Cycloeucalenol (a 4α-methyl sterol) and 24-methylene pollinastanol (a 4-desmethyl sterol) were converted to obtusifoliol and 4-desmethyl obtusifoliol, respectively. But 24-methylene cycloartanol (a 4,4-di-methyl sterol) was not transformed, which suggests that the 4β-methyl group hinders this reaction. On the basis of the results obtained, a tentative mechanism for the opening of the cyclopropane ring is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1607767367,"Abstract The content of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in guinea pig cerebral cortical slices increases approximately 40-fold during a 10-min incubation and 80-fold during a 20-min incubation in a medium containing 10mm l-glutamate. A similar increase was observed in levels of radioactive cyclic AMP derived from intracellular adenine nucleotides, labeled by a prior incubation with radioactive adenine. The stimulatory effect of l-glutamate on formation of radioactive cyclic AMP was found with a concentration as low as 0.05 mm, and concentrations of l-glutamate required for the half-maximal and maximal effects were about 1.5 and 10 mm, respectively. At 10 mm concentration, l-aspartate was as good as, and d-aspartate, d-glutamate, dl-α-aminoadipate, and l-alanine were weaker than, l-glutamate as a stimulant for the cyclic AMP formation. All other amino acids and metabolites of glutamic acid tested were virtually ineffective. Mutual potentiation of effects was observed when aspartate was added together with either adenosine or histamine, but not with glutamate, veratridine, or ouabain. The effect of the two amino acids were completely blocked by theophylline, but not by omission of Ca2+ or by addition of cocain, the conditions known to inhibit the depolarization-elicited formation of cyclic AMP. The formation of radioactive cyclic AMP stimulated by l-glutamate was allowed to return to a half of the stimulated levels within 20 min after removal of the glutamate by washing, and then was restimulated either by adenosine, l-aspartate, or l-glutamate. These properties of the amino acids suggest that the amino acids may be a new class of stimulants which is different from biogenic amines, adenosine, and depolarizing agents as stimulants for cyclic AMP formation in incubated brain slices."
https://openalex.org/W1598187616,"Abstract Cytochrome o, purified from Vitreoscilla sp., Murray strain 389, has a carbon monoxide difference spectrum with absorption maxima at 569, 535, and 419 nm. This spectrum resembles closely the carbon monoxide difference spectrum of whole cell suspensions of Vitreoscilla. The reduction of cytochrome o by NADH is catalyzed by a component(s) present in purified preparations of the cytochrome, and this NADH-cytochrome o reductase activity could be assayed in these preparations aerobically by following the absorbancy increase at 420 nm on the addition of NADH. Aerobic difference spectra of cytochrome o solutions, (NADH) minus (untreated), have absorption maxima at 577, 544, and 420 nm, and this spectrum is believed to represent the formation of an oxygenated form of reduced cytochrome o. Difference spectra of cytochrome o, that has been chemically reduced by excess sodium dithionite, have absorption maxima at 560 and 435 nm, which presumably are the absorption maxima characteristic of the reduced, but not oxygenated, form of cytochrome o. Chromatography of cytochrome o on Sephadex G-100 and DEAE-cellulose resulted in purification of cytochrome o and NADH-cytochrome o reductase, but separation of the reductase activity from the cytochrome was not achieved. Reductase activity with cytochrome o as acceptor was separated chromatographically from reductase activity with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as acceptor. Oxygen uptake of purified fractions on the addition of NADH was associated primarily with NADH-cytochrome o reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2153831512,"Abstract Quiescent baby hamster kidney cells in 0.5% serum synthesize little DNA and have low levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis. After adding serum to 5%, ODC activity is increased 30 fold, reaching a maximum at 6 hr, whereas DNA synthesis is reinitiated at 12 hr. Five μg/ml insulin also increases ODC activity 3 fold by 4 hr. In quiescent 3T3 cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts, serum and insulin may trigger many metabolic events by causing a transient drop in intracellular cyclic AMP and a rise in cyclic GMP. To test this hypothesis in BHK cells, cAMP levels were raised by adding dibutyryl cAMP and/or theophylline, or by stimulating adenylate cyclase with Prostaglandin E 1 . cAMP blocks the serum stimulation of DNA synthesis, but increases ODC activity, both in quiescent cells and in cells treated with serum and insulin. These results suggest that serum and insulin control ODC activity through a mechanism independent of a drop in cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1558629405,"Abstract The template requirements of yeast RNA polymerases A (or I) and B (or II) and the nature of the product formed have been investigated. The template activity of native DNA is lost after treatment with endonuclease S1, an enzyme highly specific for single-stranded DNA. Intact double helical DNA does not support RNA synthesis. This activity is not improved by low levels of deoxyribonuclease I. An excellent template is produced by successive treatment of T7 DNA by pancreatic DNase and exonuclease II, indicating that RNA polymerases A (or I) and B (or II) can transcribe a duplex structure containing unpaired gaps. The requirement for single strandedness of the template applies only for the initiation step: internal single-strand gaps of 20 to 50 nucleotides long promote RNA chain initiation, and very long RNA chains susceptible to RNase A are synthesized. During synthesis, the 5'-terminus of the RNA chain is degraded by ribonuclease H, indicating that initiation occurs on unpaired DNA with the transient formation of a short RNA-DNA hybrid. Such a transcription complex is very labile and release of RNA chains occurs continuously during transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1569005373,"Abstract The soluble fractions from both rat liver and an established hepatoma cell line (HTC cells) contain protein kinases and proteins which bind adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Liver cytosol exhibits somewhat more binding activity and less protein kinase activity than HTC cells. Protein kinase activity from both sources is stimulated by cyclic AMP. Scatchard plots for the binding of cyclic AMP have been compared at pH 4 and 6.5. At both pH values, liver shows nonlinear plots which are increased in curvature and apparent affinities by prior dialysis of the samples, mostly because of the removal of endogenous cyclic AMP. For HTC cells the Scatchard plot at pH 4 is also nonlinear and exhibits high binding affinity (Kd l 0.5 nm), but prior dialysis is unnecessary and the shape of the curve differs from that of liver. At pH 6.5, the binding affinity observed in HTC extracts (Kd g 10 nm) is lower than seen with liver and is insensitive to dialysis for a day or 2. However, this binding can be partially converted to higher affinity by aging or by overnight treatment at pH 4. The binding activity present in liver extracts is considerably less stable than that from HTC cells at pH 4 in the absence of cyclic AMP. Increasing the pH and adding cyclic AMP stabilize the binding activities from both sources. Much of the nonlinearity observed in the Scatchard binding plots is in the opposite direction from that caused by the instability of binding components at low concentrations of cyclic AMP. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose shows that HTC extracts lack one of two major cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase fractions which are present in liver. The deficiency seems to be due primarily to the absence of a cyclic AMP-binding fraction. Chromatographically analogous protein kinase peaks are present in both HTC and liver extracts, although their proportions differ. The cyclic AMP-binding fraction which is present only in liver is very labile at pH 4 and accounts for the greater instability of binding activity in liver extracts compared with HTC samples. HTC cells and liver also differ in the properties of the cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase fraction which is common to both. The activity of this chromatographic fraction from HTC cells is less responsive to cyclic AMP and has a lower binding affinity than that from liver. This lower HTC binding affinity can be increased by the same treatments which are effective with unfractionated extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1521361967,"Abstract Specific binding of the synthetic glucocorticoids [1,2,4-3H]dexamethasone (9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methyl-1,4-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione) and [1,2,4-3H]triamcinolone acetonide (9α-fluoro-11β,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione-16,17-acetonide) by the cytoplasmic fraction of rat gastrocnemius muscle was studied. The cytosol binding reaction displayed stereospecificity and high affinity of binding. Biologically active glucocorticoids, administered to adrenalectomized rats or present during the in vitro binding reaction markedly depressed the binding of [3H]dexamethasone and [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. The biologically inactive stereoisomer, epicortisol, had no effect on the binding of the labeled hormones. The binding component displayed high affinity for [3H]dexamethasone and [3H]triamcinolone acetonide (Kd = 1.9 and 1.2 x 10-8 m, respectively). The number of binding sites was limited (0.1 pmoles per mg of cytosol protein), and Scatchard analysis suggests that only a single class of binding sites exists for both [3H]dexamethasone and [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Competition studies indicated that the two glucocorticoids interact with the same binding site. The binding macromolecule appears to be a protein since binding is prevented by nagarse treatment and is dependent on the integrity of —SH groups. The glucocorticoid-protein complexes were characterized on 5 to 20 % sucrose gradients. Both complexes sedimented at ∼ 4 S in 0.3 m KCl, but only the [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex sedimented at 7 S in the absence of salt. Since the specific binding component has the properties of a physiological glucocorticoid receptor, a direct effect of these hormones on skeletal muscle is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1602041200,"Abstract Specific glucocorticoid receptors from chick embryonic neural retina are demonstratable as early as 6 days in ovo. The receptor also binds progesterone with high affinity. Despite marked increases in glucocorticoid-provoked glutamine synthetase activity after Day 6, no increase in cytoplasmic receptor concentration occurs. Thus control of enzyme induction does not seem to depend simply on the presence of cytoplasmic steroid receptors but seems to be mediated by steps subsequent to the initial binding of hormone to receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1537622507,"Abstract The highest specific activity of prolyl hydroxylase in lung tissue was localized in a particulate fraction which was isolated from tissue homogenates by density gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopic studies showed this fraction to be predominantly vesicles with ribosomes studding their surface. Enzymic hydroxylation by this fraction of exogenous substrate prepared from chick embryos required addition of detergent to the enzyme assay mixture. When hydroxylation was inhibited this subcellular fraction also contained proline-rich, hydroxyproline-deficient substrate which could be hydroxylated in the absence of detergent. These studies indicate a vesicular localization of prolyl hydroxylation and will facilitate future investigations of the intracellular events and regulatory mechanisms involved in collagen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2005679600,"Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP concentrations were measured in cultures of normal chick embryo fibroblasts and those transformed by Rous sarcoma virus under different growth conditions. No significant and reproducible correlation between the nucleotide levels and the rate of proliferation was observed. Neither release of normal cells from density dependent inhibition of growth nor transformation of the cultures by different strains of Rous sarcoma virus affected the concentrations of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP. Activities of cellular cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, enzymes involved in regulating the level of the nucleotides, were not directly affected by growth-stimulating concentrations of insulin or neuraminidase. Growth stimulation by insulin did not alter the activities of cellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These results do not support the hypothesis that cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP has a specific role in the growth control of chick embryo fibroblasts."

SV80, a human cell line, contains superior levels of this antigen. The SV80 T antigen has been partially purified by salt fractionation and adsorbent chromatography; it exists in the form of a high molecular weight aggregate in nondenaturing solvents. The antigen binds to phosphocellulose but not carboxymethylcellulose at pH 6.2, suggesting that it may have specific affinity for phosphate ligands but is not a basic protein. This property may reflect an underlying function of this protein in the cell."

This enzymatic defect accounts for the biochemical abnormalities in type 2 hyperprolinemia.
https://openalex.org/W1621213247,Abstract Iodinated derivatives of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were prepared with the use of NaI and chloramine-T and isolated by isoelectric focusing. The monoiodinated derivative (pI 7.6) was resolved into [monoiodoTyr2]ACTH and [monoiodoTyr23]ACTH by chromatography on columns of carboxymethylcellulose. Both monoiodo-ACTH species exhibited only 30 % of the maximum hormonal activity when assayed in an ACTH-sensitive adenylate cyclase system from adrenal tumor cells. The loss of hormonal activity was a consequence of oxidation rather than iodination. Iodination with lactoperoxidase instead of chloramine-T did not preserve hormonal activity. The monoiodinated derivatives of ACTH prepared with chloramine-T as oxidant were restored to full hormonal activity following reduction with cysteine in acetic acid. Mild acid hydrolysis accompanying the reduction reaction resulted in the conversion of the iodinated derivatives to products identified as [monoiodoTyr2]α1–24-ACTH and [mono-iodoTyr23]α1–24-ACTH.
https://openalex.org/W1653999539,"Abstract Poly(dT) with the average chain length of 80 nucleotides and containing 3'-phosphate end groups was condensed with cellulose by the use of a water soluble carbodiimide. The product, which contained free 5'-hydroxyl groups at the terminal thymidine residues, was phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP and the polynucleotide kinase. A synthetic deoxyribo-oligonucleotide segment corresponding to a portion of the Escherichia coli tyrosine tRNA gene (dC-C-C-CA-C-C) was extended at its 3'-OH end by growing a polythymidylate chain using deoxypolynucleotidyltransferase. The thymidine at the 3' end of this product was covalently linked to the 5'-phosphate end (32P-labeled) of the cellulose-linked polythymidylate by using polynucleotide ligase and poly(dA) as the template. Replication of the specific sequence dC-C-C-C-A-C-C in the above cellulose-linked polynucleotide was investigated by using a short (rA)n or poly(dA) as primers suitably hybridized to the poly(dT) region. The product of replication was readily separated from the template after denaturation and was characterized by nearest neighbor frequency analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2100358511,"The activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, purified from a line of rat hepatoma cells in continuous culture, is maximally stimulated (2–4 fold) by less than 10−7M cyclic GMP. Half maximal stimulation occurs at 2 × 10−9M. Cyclic GMP stimulates phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase by decreasing the Km of the enzyme for ATP from 50 μM to 10 μM without affecting the Vmax; it has no effect on the Km for ribose 5-phosphate, the other substrate. Cyclic AMP alone has no effect on the enzyme activity, but at micromolar concentrations it antagonizes the stimulation by cyclic GMP. GMP, GDP, and GTP do not stimulate enzyme activity; and AMP and ADP at micromolar concentrations do not antagonize the effect of cyclic GMP. There is no detectable cyclic nucleotide-activated protein kinase in the enzyme preparation. Cyclic GMP significantly stabilizes the enzyme to heat inactivation. We conclude that cyclic GMP binds directly to the enzyme in an allosteric fashion, causing it to have an increased affinity for one of its substrates, and that cyclic AMP directly antagonizes this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2164273062,"A viral ribonucleoprotein complex has been isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus. The complex, which contains 60–80% of the cell-free viral transcriptase activity, shares many properties with subviral cores isolated from detergent-treated virus. It sediments at 140S; it contains the viral nucleocapsid protein, N, the L protein, and a 42S RNA. The complex synthesizes RNA that is of the message sense (complementary to the virion RNA). Approximately 30% of these RNA transcripts terminate in poly(A) tracts that are approximately 125 nucleotides long. Neither the synthesis of poly(A) nor mRNA is appreciably inhibited by cordycepin triphosphate. Like the virus core, the transcription complex can be separated into two fractions—both of which are inactive, but when mixed exhibit all of the original activity. The similarities of the transcription complex and the viral cores suggests to us that the transcription complex may be both a source of mRNA for protein synthesis and a precursor of the progeny virus cores."
https://openalex.org/W1650088739,"Abstract The binding of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) to proteins has been further characterized in postmitochondrial supernatant fractions from rat liver and cultured hepatoma (HTC) cells. Possible explanations for the high binding affinity (Kd l 0.5 nm) and nonlinear Scatchard binding plots are considered. Examination of the membrane filtration method used to measure the binding indicates that essentially all of the protein in the extracts is retained and that nonspecific adsorption of cyclic AMP is not a serious problem under the conditions used. At high concentrations of cyclic AMP, the amount of binding increases linearly over a range of protein concentrations. The binding studied is highly selective for cyclic AMP as shown by competition studies with related compounds. The time required to reach binding equilibrium at 0° varies with the pH, the nature of the sample, and the cyclic AMP concentration. The observation of nonlinear Scatchard binding plots requires a wide range of cyclic AMP concentrations, and this in turn necessitates binding times of several hours or more to achieve equilibrium at all points. The kinetics of release of bound cyclic AMP are heterogeneous for both liver and HTC extracts, showing a range of half times from minutes to days. An evaluation of the instability of binding activity under assay conditions shows that this instability cannot cause the upward curvature seen in Scatchard plots, but it could account for the additional plateau or region of downward curvature observed with liver samples. Prior exposure of a liver sample to pH 4 or to elevated temperatures eliminates the component(s) responsible for the plateau and transforms the Scatchard binding curve at pH 4 into one showing only the upward curvature characteristic of HTC samples. The high affinity portion of the heterogeneous Scatchard plots is markedly reduced by increasing the salt concentration in the binding reaction at pH 4, but not at pH 6.5. Treatment with HgCl2 in the cold also produces some selective elimination of the higher affinity portion of the HTC Scatchard binding curve. Although these selective effects on different regions of the HTC Scatchard plot are consistent with the presence of multiple components with differing affinities for cyclic AMP, other explanations cannot be ruled out. Negatively cooperative interactions among identical binding sites would also account for the curvature, and these interactions might be sensitive to some of the agents used. In addition, theoretical considerations show that the interaction between a single binding component and the catalytic subunit of a protein kinase can generate nonlinear Scatchard plots similar to those observed."

The effect of DMSO is relatively specific for gal and λ because there is less than a 2 fold effect on the synthesis of several other enzymes studied: UDP-glucose pyrophospholylase, phosphomannose isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, alkaline phosphatase, and β-galactosidse. DMSO also alleviates the functional defects caused by certain promoter mutations in gal and λ. These results are compared with our observations that DMSO and other DNA-denaturing reagents stimulate the synthesis of specific gal and λ RNA transcripts from wild-type and promoter-defective DNA templates in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1581625442,"Abstract Further studies on the specificity of RNA chain initiation by T3-induced RNA polymerase have been carried out. The nucleotide penultimate to the 5'-guanosine triphosphate end of RNA chains has been determined. GMP is found exclusively in this second position of a growing RNA chain. The 32PPi exchange reaction with ribonucleoside triphosphates catalyzed by T3 RNA polymerase on native T3 DNA template was also studied as a measure of the initiation reaction. It has been found that T3 RNA polymerase carries out an active exchange of 32PPi into ATP in the presence of GTP. In contrast, in reactions containing GTP alone or with GTP + CTP or GTP + UTP, an active exchange of 32PPi only occurs into GTP. No 32PPi incorporation was detected into either CTP or UTP. These results suggest that all RNA chains formed in T3 RNA polymerase reaction directed by native T3 DNA as template contain the sequence pppGp(Gp)n(Ap)m ...

ADH activity in control rats and in rats that have had daily injections of hCG from birth onwards indicates that the premature Leydig cell is insensitive to exogenous hCG and acquires its hormone sensitivity at the end of the 2nd week of life. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity can be enhanced by db-cyclic AMP or theophylline during the entire hCG insensitive period. 125 I-hCG is specifically bound to testicular tissue of 10, 15, and 20 day old rats. We therefore conclude that in spite of its hCG insensitivity, the infantile Leydig cell possesses both the specific hCG receptor and the enzyme adenyl cyclase, both of which are prerequisites for polypeptide hormone action."
