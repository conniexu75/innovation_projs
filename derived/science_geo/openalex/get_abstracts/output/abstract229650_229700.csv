https://openalex.org/W1970203053,"Angiotensin II (AII) increases production of reactive oxygen species from NAD(P)H oxidase, a response that contributes to vascular hypertrophy. Here we show in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells that S-glutathiolation of the redox-sensitive Cys118 on the small GTPase, Ras, plays a critical role in AII-induced hypertrophic signaling. AII simultaneously increased the Ras activity and the S-glutathiolation of Ras (GSS-Ras) detected by biotin-labeled GSH or mass spectrometry. Both the increase in activity and GSS-Ras was labile under reducing conditions, suggesting the essential nature of this thiol modification to Ras activation. Overexpression of catalase, a dominant-negative p47phox, or glutaredoxin-1 decreased GSS-Ras, Ras activation, p38, and Akt phosphorylation and the induction of protein synthesis by AII. Furthermore, expression of a Cys118 mutant Ras decreased AII-mediated p38 and Akt phosphorylation as well as protein synthesis. These results show that H2O2 from NAD(P)H oxidase forms GSS-Ras on Cys118 and increases its activity leading to p38 and Akt phosphorylation, which contributes to the induction of protein synthesis. This study suggests that GSS-Ras is a redox-sensitive signaling switch that participates in the cellular response to AII.

However, the molecular mechanism by which ROS alter cellular signaling is not established. Reactive thiols on Cys residues of select proteins are among the most sensitive sites to be modified by ROS. For example the reactive Cys on phosphatases (3Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) or protein kinase C (4Ward N.E. Stewart J.R. Ioannides C.G. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10319-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) can be modified by ROS and change their function. Oxidants react with these redox-sensitive thiols to form thiyl radicals that subsequently can react with other thiols to form mixed disulfide bonds (5Finkel T.

In mammalian cells GSH is the most abundant low molecular thiol, which as a result is most likely to bind to protein thiols to form mixed disulfides, a process termed S-glutathiolation. Many previous reports have demonstrated S-glutathiolation of (GSS-) isolated or purified proteins or in cells or tissues exposed to nonspecific thiol oxidants such as diamide or H2O2. A cellular regulatory role for GSS-protein adducts has only been rarely documented (8Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The small GTPase, Ras, modulates diverse signaling pathways, and a reactive thiol, Cys118, has been identified in the GTP-binding region of Ras. Previous work shows that Cys118 can be S-nitrosated, leading to an increase in Ras activity and to downstream signaling (9Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S.

A. 2003; 100: 6376-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that S-nitrosation itself may not directly change Ras conformation, thus questioning whether this modification could itself explain activation of Ras. S-Glutathiolation of the C-terminal Cys of Ras with diamide has been reported, but there have been no reports regarding S-glutathiolation of Cys118 on Ras affecting its activity. Angiotensin II (AII) induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hypertrophy, proliferation, and migration via ROS formation by stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidase, a process that may contribute to a variety of vascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and restenosis (13Wang H.D.

Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol.

They also showed that p38 and ERK pathways contribute synergistically to smooth muscle hypertrophy by showing that the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, and the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, each blocked ∼40% of the hypertrophic response, whereas together they additively blocked the response. Therefore, AII-induced hypertrophy may be mediated in part by redox-sensitive activation of p38 and Akt and redox-insensitive activation of ERK. In this study we employed AII-stimulated VSMC as a model for examining the relationship between GSS-Ras formation and redox-sensitive hypertrophic signaling with adenovirus-mediated genetic modulation of NAD(P)H oxidase, glutaredoxin-1 (GRX-1) and Cys118 mutation of Ras (C118S Ras). Our studies indicate that oxidant-induced thiol modification of Ras mediates activation of p38 and Akt but not the ERK activation that contributes to the increase in protein synthesis. Drugs and Antibodies—Sulfo-NHS biotin and an EZ-link Ras activation kit were obtained from Pierce. PD-10 desalting columns, protein A-Sepharose, and streptavidin-Sepharose were obtained from Amer-sham Biosciences.

Anti-GRX antibody was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Ras cDNA and adenoviral vector were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), pENTRD/Topo vector, and Gateway cassette were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Rat cultured VSMC were prepared as reported before (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol.

The cells were grown with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin and quiescent with 0.1% FBS for 36-48 h before treating with AII. Virus Preparation—Adenoviral constructs were developed as previously described. The catalase (ATCC) and dominant-negative p47phox (DN-p47phox, S303A/S304A double mutant, gift from Dr. B. M. Babior (18Inanami O. Johnson J.L. McAdara J.K. Benna J.E. Faust L.R. Newburger P.E. Babior B.M. J. Biol.

This shuttle vector was co-transfected with pADEasy into Escherichia coli, the resultant cosmid was transfected with calcium phosphate into HEK 293 cells, and adenoviral plaques were selected. The adenovirus was propagated in HEK 293 cells and purified via a double cesium chloride gradient. Using the TCID50 method, the viral titer was determined. Similar methods were used for the creation of β-galactosidase. The adenoviral vector to express GRX-1 was previously reported (19Song J.J. Lee Y.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Adenovirus with C118S Ras was made as follows. Ras cDNA was subcloned from Ras expression vector to pENTRD/Topo vector by PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis of C118 was introduced by 18 cycles of PCR with forward primer 5′-TGCTGGTGGGGAACAAGTCTGACCTGGCTGCACGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCGTGCAGCCAGGTCAGACTTGTTCCCCACCAGCA-3′ followed by digestion of the template with Dpn-1. The entire Ras sequence and mutation were confirmed by sequence analysis. Then adenoviral vector expressing C118S Ras was made by LR clonase reaction (Invitrogen) with an adenoviral vector in which the Gateway cassette had previously been inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The cells at about 80% confluency were transfected with ∼50 multiplicity of infection of adenovirus with 10 μm polymer polyethylenimine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS for 36 h (20Dodds E. Piper T.A. Murphy S.J. Dickson G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After washing out the medium with adenovirus, the cells were quiescent in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% FBS for 36 h before the start of the experiments. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorscein Fluorescence Measurement in VSMC—The method was previously reported (21Dada L.A. Chandel N.S. Ridge K.M. Pedemonte C. Bertorello A.M. Sznajder J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Ras Activity Assay—Ras GTP binding activity was assessed by the association with GST-Raf. Cultured VSMC were scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 50 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged (10,000 × g for 15 min). Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. Some cells were scraped into lysis buffer with 20 mm DTT to test the thiol dependence of activation. After equilibration in lysis buffer, GST-Raf was passed over a Bio-6 spin column to eliminate DTT. In preliminary studies, by measuring the free thiols in bovine serum albumin by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) fluorescence (412 nm), we confirmed that less than 1% of DTT remained after passing through the Bio-6 column. Approximately 700-1000 μg of total cell protein was incubated for 1 h with GST-Raf (75 μg) coupled to 50 μl of immobilized GSH-resin. The samples were washed four times with nonreducing lysis buffer and incubated with Laemmli buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 100 °C for 5 min to dissociate Ras. Protein was run on SDS-PAGE, and Ras was quantified by immunoblotting with anti-Ras antibody (Upstate Biochemical, clone Ras10). Biotinylated GSH Ester and Detection of S-Glutathiolated Ras—The methods followed those previously reported with some modifications (6Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Biotinylated GSH ester was made by mixing 25 mm sulfo-NHS-biotin with 25 mm GSH ethyl ester in 50 mm NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 for 2 h followed by the addition of 125 mm NH4HCO3 at pH 8.5 for 1 h. Biotinylated GSH ester (250 μm) was preincubated with VSMC in culture for 1 h. At each time point the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate buffer and lysed in buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block further thiol reactions. Approximately 1 mg of protein was passed through a PD-10 Sephadex-G25 column to eliminate the excess low molecular weight biotin products. The proteins were mixed with streptavidin-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer with 0.1% SDS, and the final precipitate was incubated for 10 min with 40 μl of elution buffer (lysis buffer + 20 mm DTT) to release S-glutathiolated proteins. After adding Laemmli buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, GSS-Ras was detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-Ras antibody (UBI, clone Ras10). Leucine Incorporation—The method followed previous reports (2Pimentel D.R. Amin J.K. Xiao L. Miller T. Viereck J. Oliver-Krasinski J. Baliga R. Wang J. Siwik D.A. Singh K. Pagano P. Colucci W.S. Sawyer D.B. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). After quiescence, AII (0.1 μm) was added to VSMC. After 16 h 1 μCi/ml of [3H]leucine was added to each dish and incubated for 8 h. The cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with ice-cold water once, protein was isolated with 0.5 m NaOH for 90 min, and radioactivity was counted with a scintillation counter. The values for cells treated with AII are normalized to the value obtained in untreated cells (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Ras Purification for MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The cells were scraped into lysis buffer containing iodoacetic acid (10 mm), and the proteins were separated with centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min). After 1 h the proteins were passed through a PD-10 Sephadex-G25 column to eliminate excess iodoacetic acid. The lysate (2-3 mg of protein) was prewashed with protein A-Sepharose and incubated overnight with monoclonal anti-Ras antibody (25 μg). Thereafter, protein A (≈100 μl) was added with rabbit anti-mouse Ig G antibody (30 μg). The immunoprecipitate was released with nonreducing Laemmli buffer (50 μl), and 40 μl of sample was separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Approximately 10 μl of sample was used for immunoblotting Ras to identify the major band. The Ras protein band was cut from the gel, and protein was digested in the gel with trypsin (Sequencing grade; Sigma) and dried with a Speedvac (Savant, Albertville, MI). GSS-Cys containing peptides of Ras were detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and analyzed with the SWISS-PROT data base found on the Profound Web Site (prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgibin/ProFound). Reduced Cys- and GSS-Cys-containing peptides were identified on the basis of the predicted increase in mass (RSSG: +C10H15N3O6S). Accepted fit parameters for peptide mass were <100 ppm for monoisotopic mass, <200 ppm for average mass, and up to four tryptic miscleavages. The data fit well with the protein identified in the data base as gi 131873 sp P20171 RASH RAT TRANSFORMING PROTEIN P21/H-RAS-1 (C-H-RAS). Data Analysis—For all of the experiments employing immunoblots, similar results were obtained in at least three or four separate experiments. The increase in GSS-Ras and Ras activity caused by AII was confirmed by densitometry (Molecular Analyzer, Hercules, CA), and differences in band densities were analyzed with Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Differences in the percentage of increase in [3H]leucine incorporation between untreated and AII-treated cells were analyzed with Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. AII-induced S-glutathiolation and Thiol-redox-sensitive Activation of Ras in VSMC—AII (0.1 μm) increased ROS formation in VSMC as detected by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorscein fluorescence (data not shown) as shown previously (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar). As detected by biotinylated GSH, AII (0.1 μm) increased GSS-Ras formation (3.6 ± 0.4-fold at 15 min p < 0.05, n = 5; Fig. 1A). GSS-Ras was increased by AII in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). H2O2 (250 μm) also increased GSS-Ras (Fig. 1B). Increased GSS-Ras was noted as early as 5 min, peaked at 30 min, and decreased at 60 min (Fig. 1C). Formation of GSS-Ras preceded the phosphorylation of p38 or Akt but not ERK (Supplemental Fig. 1). This suggests temporal correlation of GSS-Ras formation with activation of p38 and Akt, two downstream mediators previously shown to be involved in AII-induced protein synthesis in VSMC (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the thiol modification of Ras, Ras GTP binding activity was assessed with a GST-Raf pull-down assay. Ras activity was increased 2-fold at 15 min. Importantly, the increase in Ras activity was eliminated by DTT (Fig. 1D), suggesting that, like GSS-Ras formation, activation of Ras by AII is dependent on thiol-redox status. AII-induced GSS-Ras and Ras Activation Were Mediated by ROS from NAD(P)H Oxidase—A NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI; 10 μm, 30 min) decreased GSS-Ras as well as the activation of Ras by AII at 15 min (Fig. 2A). Previous reports showed that phosphorylation of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit, p47phox, by AII triggers release of ROS, including H2O2, which has been implicated in hypertrophic signaling (18Inanami O.

Schiffrin E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, either catalase (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9539-9543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was overexpressed in VSMC to decrease the contribution of ROS to AII signaling. Either catalase or DN-p47phox decreased GSS-Ras and Ras activation (Fig. 2B). We also assessed downstream signaling events affected by ROS from NAD(P)H oxidase. DPI, catalase, or DN-p47phox decreased phosphorylation of p38 and Akt with lesser effects on ERK phosphorylation (Supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, compatible with previous results regarding redox-sensitive hypertrophic signaling by AII (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), catalase or DN-p47phox inhibited the induction of protein synthesis by AII as indicated by the incorporation of [3H]leucine (Fig. 2, C and D). Overexpression of GRX-1 Inhibits GSS-Ras, Ras Activation, and Redox-sensitive Hypertrophic Signaling by AII—The time course (Fig. 1D) indicated that GSS-Ras formation is reversible, suggesting that an enzymatic process may be involved in the reduction of S-glutathiolated Ras. Thiol-disulfide exchange of GSS-protein mixed disulfides is specifically regulated by the enzyme GRX, which in turn is regulated by GSH and GSH reductase (5Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 19Song J.J. Lee Y.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of S-glutathiolation for the activation of Ras, GRX-1 was overexpressed in VSMC. Overexpression of GRX-1 inhibited the increase in Ras activity and GSS-Ras formation caused by AII, indicating the requirement of GSS-Ras formation for the increase in activity (Fig. 3A). Similar to the effects of inhibiting ROS production, overexpression of GRX-1 markedly decreased phosphorylation of p38 and Akt but was without effect on ERK (Fig. 3B). GRX-1 overexpression also inhibited the induction of protein synthesis (Fig. 3C). The Identification of GSS-Cys on Ras by AII with MALDITOF Mass Spectrometry—To confirm that GSS-Ras is formed by endogenous GSH pools and to identify GSS-Cys sites, Ras was immunopurified from AII-treated VSMC, separated by SDS-PAGE, and trypsinized in gel. The peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and reduced HS-Cys and GSS-Cys on Ras were analyzed (Table I). Approximately 60% coverage of the sequence of H-Ras was achieved, and three GSS-Cys sites were identified (Cys80, Cys118, and one of the C-terminal Cys181, Cys184, or Cys186).Table IMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of GSS-Cys modified peptides of Ras from AII-treated VSMCMeasured massComputed massErrorStartEndMetOIAASequenceppmReduced Cys (-SH, IAA-SH)Cys512886.42886.2804368+QVVIDGETCLLDILDTAGQEEYSAMRCys1182876.32876.3−4103128+VKDSDDVPMVLVGNKCDLAARTVESR2833.82834.2−161103128+VKDSDDVPMVLVGNKCDLAARTVESRCys181, Cys1842872.22872.3−46162185+++EIRQHKLRLNPPDESGLGCMSCKCys181, Cys184, Cys1862876.32876.4−35165189++QHKLRLNPPDESGLGCMSCKCVLSS-Glutathiolated Cys (GSS-Cys)GSS-Cys804303.04303.8−1169101+DQYMRTGEGFLCVFAINNTKSFEDIHQYREQIKGSS-Cys1182707.32707.172102123RVKDSDDVPMVLVGNKCDLAARGSS-Cys181, -Cys184, or -Cys1862386.82386.813170189KLNPPDESGLGCMSCKCVLS2708.52708.1143170189+KLNPPDESGLGCMSCKCVLS Open table in a new tab Effects of C118S Ras Expression on AII-induced Redox-sensitive Signaling—To test the functional importance of S-glutathiolation, Cys118 on Ras was mutated to serine (C118S Ras), incorporated into an adenoviral vector, and overexpressed in VSMC. Overexpression of the C118S Ras mutant decreased phosphorylation of p38 and Akt but not ERK (Fig. 4A). p70S6 kinase modulates protein synthesis in response to AII (23Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H.

Overexpression of C118S Ras modestly decreased phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase by AII (Fig. 4B). The C118S mutant also significantly inhibited the induction of protein synthesis by AII (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that the modification of Cys118, which was shown to be S-glutathiolated by mass spectrometry, plays a critical role in the redox-sensitive signaling, which leads to VSMC hypertrophy caused by AII. GSS-Ras Is Not Downstream of EGF Receptor Transactivation by AII—EGF receptor transactivation participates in the AII signaling cascade and is known to contribute to phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. Therefore, we tested whether EGF receptor transactivation is involved in GSS-Ras formation caused by AII. A selective inhibitor of EGF receptor activity, AG1478 (1 μm, 30 min), completely blocked phosphorylation of ERK and Akt caused by EGF, and partially inhibited phosphorylation of ERK and Akt by AII (Fig. 5A). However, AG1478 had no significant effect on GSS-Ras formation by AII (Fig. 5B), indicating that GSS-Ras formation is not mediated through EGF receptor transactivation. It is now well recognized that AII increases production of oxidants derived from NAD(P)H oxidase, which play an important role in vascular hypertrophy and the pathogenesis of vascular diseases (13Wang H.D.

Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Previous reports indicate that the increased oxidants activate p38 and Akt, accounting for the redox-sensitive component of signaling leading to hypertrophy caused by AII (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar); however, an upstream direct molecular target for ROS has not been identified. In this study the activation of Ras by S-glutathiolation at Cys118 was identified to be a critical step in redox-sensitive signaling leading to AII-induced hypertrophy. Overexpression of GRX-1 confirmed the specificity of the activation of Ras by S-glutathiolation as well as its involvement in activating downstream signaling by AII. GSS-Cys118 was identified with mass spectrometry and overexpression of C118S mutant Ras strikingly inhibited p38 and Akt phosphorylation and protein synthesis (Fig. 6). NAD(P)H oxidase is activated at the plasma membrane where we hypothesize it is well situated for ROS generated by it to attack Cys118 and activate membrane-bound Ras. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that H2O2 increased formation of GSS-Ras (Fig. 1B), and either DPI or overexpression of catalase inhibited GSS-Ras formation and Ras activation (Fig. 2). These agents also inhibited p38 and Akt phosphorylation and the increase in protein synthesis by AII as shown previously (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and we further confirmed this by showing similar effects of overexpressing DN-p47phox. Collectively, our data show that ROS from NAD(P)H oxidase are responsible for GSS-Ras formation and activation of Ras by AII, which is responsible for redox-sensitive signaling (p38, Akt) and induction of protein synthesis. To identify the GSS-Cys site on Ras, we employed mass spectrometry, and three sites were identified (Cys80, Cys118, and one of the C-terminal Cys181, Cys184, or Cys186). Among them, Cys118 is located in the GTP-binding region, and S-nitrosation of this Cys is associated with an increase in activity of purified Ras (9Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quillam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 10Teng K.K. Esposito D.K. Schwartz G.D. Lander H.M.

J. 2001; 355: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We did not detect S-nitrosated Cys118 by mass spectrometry, nor is nitric oxide thought to be involved in AII signaling in VSMC. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that GSS-Ras formation on this Cys is responsible for the increase in Ras activity and for redox-sensitive signaling by AII. The specificity of the involvement of GSS-Ras for redox-sensitive hypertrophic signaling was tested with the overexpression of GRX-1, a cytosolic protein of the thioredoxin superfamily. GRX-1 inhibited Ras activation, p38 and Akt phosphorylation, and induction of protein synthesis by AII (Fig. 3), emphasizing the importance of the GSS-adduct of Ras in mediating redox-sensitive signaling. It is controversial whether or not ERK activation by AII is redox-sensitive (16Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biochem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 25Frank G.D. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Tanaka S. Inagami T. Motley E.D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and our data show that AII-induced ERK phosphorylation is much less sensitive to overexpression of catalase, DN-p47phox, and GRX-1, as well as the C118S Ras mutant compared with their effects on phosphorylation of p38 or Akt. Although Ras/Raf/MEK1/ERK has been widely regarded as a major pathway, it is not clear that AII exclusively activates ERK via this pathway in VSMC. Takahashi et al. (26Takahashi T. Kawahara Y. Okuda M. Ueno H. Takeshita A. Yokoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16018-16022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that Ras may not be involved in ERK activation by AII in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Others showed that Raf activation by AII is not mediated by Ras but rather by protein kinase C (27Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These reports may help to explain our findings that GSS-Ras is not required for ERK activation but plays a role in phosphorylation of p38 and Akt. Recent studies showed that transactivation of the EGF receptor may mediate ERK activation by AII (23Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi K. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36843-36851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the EGF receptor/Grb/mSOS/Ras is the major pathway by which EGF activates ERK. Therefore, we tested the effects of AG1478, an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on formation of GSS-Ras and phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. Compatible with previous reports (23Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi K. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36843-36851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Becker P.L. Hilenski L. Halleran S. Alexander R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), AG1478 partially inhibited ERK and Akt phosphorylation by AII but had no effect on GSS-Ras formation. Therefore, GSS-Ras formation by AII-stimulated ROS apparently is not a consequence of EGF receptor transactivation. Previously, the Ras C118S mutant was shown to have about 75% basal activity (9Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quillam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and preserved ability to mediate growth factor-dependent mSOS-induced activation (10Teng K.K. Esposito D.K. Schwartz G.D. Lander H.M. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37315-37320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the mutant prevented redox-dependent PI3 kinase activation. Therefore, GSS-Ras-mediated Akt and p38 phosphorylation and mSOS-dependent activation of Ras via EGF receptor transactivation may be separate signaling pathways and be localized in different cellular compartments. AG 1478 also decreased AII-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that both GSS-Ras and EGF receptor transactivation by AII may contribute to Akt activation. In previous reports, ischemia-reperfusion increased S-thiolation labeling of Ras in heart (29Eaton P. Byers H.L. Leeds N. Ward M.A. Shattock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9806-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and diamide increased GSS-Cys181 and Cys184 in recombinant Ras (11Mallis R.J. Buss J.E. Thomas J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These reports did not assess the changes in Ras activity caused by GSS modification. A recent report suggests that S-nitrosation of Ras Cys118 itself may not change the structure of Ras but that the increased activity of recombinant Ras was associated rather with the chemical process of S-nitrosation (12Williams J.G. Pappu K. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6376-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This suggests that redox cycling of this critical thiol, possibly via either S-nitrosation or sulfenilation could be an intermediate in S-glutathiolation, which would be favored because of the abundance of intracellular GSH. Because the glutamate residue of GSH has an extra carboxyl group, S-glutathiolation (but not S-nitrosation or sulfenilation) adds a negative charge to modified proteins that together with the steric effects of the tripeptide might directly change enzyme activity analogous to protein phosphorylation. Although many studies have shown that thiol antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine inhibit redox-sensitive signaling, they could do so by increasing intracellular GSH levels, enhancing the activity of GRX, and affecting S-glutathiolation of key signaling proteins including Ras. A recent report showed that fluid shear stress up-regulated GSH reductase activity in endothelial cells, inhibiting JNK activation by ROS (24Hojo Y. Saito Y. Tanimoto T. Hoefen R.J. Baines C.P. Yamamoto K. Haendeler J. Asmis R. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This result could be explained by the fact that GSH reductase activity couples with GRX for reducing the mixed disulfide. Thus, proteins in various signaling cascades could be reversibly regulated by S-glutathiolation, GRX, and GSH reductase to mediate redox-sensitive signaling in various cell types. In summary, this study clearly shows, 1) that the ROS-mediated modification of a critical thiol of Ras is important in mediating the actions of AII, 2) that intracellular GSS-Ras formation increases following AII, 3) that GSS-Ras is responsible for a portion of increased Raf-binding activity, 4) that p38 and Akt activation are most affected by GSS-Ras, and 5) that these events contribute to hypertrophic signaling induced by AII.

Reduced frataxin expression, a causative agent of the neurological disorder Friedreich ataxia, results in mitochondrial iron accumulation.

We have reported earlier that frataxin serves as an iron donor to ISU, the iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence quenching experiments demonstrated human frataxin to bind 6 or 7 iron ions with KD ∼10–50 μm for the isolated protein (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Holofrataxin was further shown to bind to ISU with a KD ∼0.15 μm, and the functional viability of frataxin as an iron donor for assembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ISU in the presence of a sulfur donor was demonstrated through kinetic and spectroscopic studies (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Iron release by frataxin appeared to be the rate-limiting step. Overall these results correlate well with other published observations concerning a possible role for frataxin in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis (2Chen O.S. Hemenwa S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 3Puccio H. Simon D. Cossee M. Criqui-Filipe P. Tiziano F. Melki J. Hindelang C. Matyas R. Rustin P. Koenig M. Nat.

To further characterize potential roles for frataxin as a mitochondrial iron donor, we have investigated the involvement of Hs frataxin in cellular heme biosynthesis as an iron donor to Hs ferrochelatase. Although the identity of the iron donor protein in heme biosynthesis has not been established, involvement by frataxin has been suggested on the basis of yeast studies that demonstrated mitochondrial iron to be unavailable for heme biosynthesis in cells lacking frataxin (6Lesuisse E.

Herein we characterize the interaction of human frataxin and ferrochelatase and demonstrate holofrataxin to serve as a potential iron donor to ferrochelatase for insertion into the protoporphyrin ring during heme synthesis. Protein Production and Purification—Human ferrochelatase was expressed and purified as described previously (9Burden A.E. Wu C. Dailey T.A. Busch J.L. Dhawan I.K. Rose J.P. Wang B. Dailey H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Human frataxin was also obtained as described previously (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem.

The expressed protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and the mature truncated form of frataxin, encompassing residues 81–210, was obtained by an autocleavage reaction following incubation at 4 °C for 2 weeks (as observed previously (10Cavadini P.

The purity of the truncated protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, which demonstrated a single protein band with a molecular mass of ∼14 kDa, consistent with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis that yielded a mass of 14,661 Da. Samples were either used immediately following purification or stored in their final elution buffers at –80 °C. Holofrataxin was prepared under strictly anaerobic conditions as described previously (9Burden A.E. Wu C. Dailey T.A. Busch J.L. Dhawan I.K. Rose J.P. Wang B. Dailey H.A. Biochim. Biophys.

ITC Measurements of Binding—ITC 1The abbreviation used is: ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a MicroCal Omega ultrasensitive titration calorimeter. The sample solutions were made from the stock buffer solution (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1% sodium cholate, pH 8), and the titrant solution was made up in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 8. Both experimental solutions were argon-purged and then thoroughly degassed before each titration. The solution in the cell (an 0.06 mm solution of ferrochelatase) was stirred at 300 rpm by syringe to ensure rapid mixing. Typically, from 3 to 7 μl of titrant (a 1.3 mm solution of holofrataxin) was delivered over 10 s with an adequate interval (8 min) between injections to allow complete equilibration. Excess titrant was added to ensure saturation binding. At the end of the experiment, added iron was found to remain in the ferrous state. A background titration, consisting of the identical titrant solution but with only the buffer solution in the sample cell, was subtracted from each experimental titration to account for heat of dilution. The data were collected automatically and subsequently analyzed with a one-site binding model by the Windows-based Origin software package supplied by MicroCal. Origin software uses a nonlinear least-squares algorithm (minimization of χ2) and the concentrations of the titrant and the sample to fit the heat flow per injection to an equilibrium binding equation, providing best fit values of the stoichiometry (n), change in enthalpy (ΔH), and binding constant (K). A set of titration experiments was carried out for apofrataxin binding to apoISU using similar buffer conditions (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1% sodium cholate, pH 8), with 30 μm ISU (the D37A mutant was used as described previously (1Yoon T.

Stoichiometric Titration by Fluorescence Quenching—The tryptophan fluorescence of human ferrochelatase solution was measured in 1-ml quartz cuvettes at room temperature with a Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The excitation and monitoring wavelengths were 280 and 341 nm, respectively. Corrections for the inner filter effect were considered but were negligible as a result of the weak absorbance at the emission wavelength. Intensity data from a control titration, consisting of a similar titrant solution but containing only the buffer solution in the sample cell, were subtracted from the experimental data obtained from the ferrochelatase titration to account for the minimal background fluorescence from the titrant solution. For holofrataxin binding, spectra were obtained on a 6 μm solution of ferrochelatase before and after titration with a 0.15 mm stock solution of holofrataxin. Both proteins were prepared in argon-purged 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1% sodium cholate. All experiments were performed under strictly anaerobic conditions. Kinetics Measurements of Ferrochelatase Activity—The disodium salt of protoporphyrin IX was obtained from Aldrich. A protoporphyrin stock solution was prepared in 2 m NH4OH (0.1 ml) followed by the addition of 1.9 ml of a buffered solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1% sodium cholate, pH 8.0. Stock solutions were diluted with the same Tris-HCl buffer to make a desirable concentration of protoporphyrin before each experiment. Ferrochelatase activity was measured anaerobically at 20 °C by monitoring the rate of disappearance of the protoporphyrin IX band at 506 nm. A 2-ml solution containing 11.8 μm protoporphyrin, 200 nm ferrochelatase, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and various concentrations of apofrataxin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1% sodium cholate, pH 8.0, was degassed and argon-purged for at least 20 min. To trigger the activity of ferrochelatase, buffered solutions of ferrous ion and citrate were added by injection to the reaction mixture in the cuvette to achieve a final ferrous concentration of 5.8 μm and a citrate concentration of 2 mm. To demonstrate the potential involvement of frataxin in heme biosynthesis, we have quantitatively investigated complex formation between human holofrataxin and human ferrochelatase. The cloned frataxin gene incorporated a His6 tag and residues following the second mitochondrial processing peptidase cleavage site (11Cavadini P. Adamec J. Taroni F. Gakh O. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41469-41475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (residues 47–210 were included). Cloned His6-tagged frataxin was expressed and purified as described (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar); however, over a period of several days this autocleaves to a truncated protein (residues 81–210) that lacks the N-terminal His6 tag. The formation of a truncated protein has been documented previously (10Cavadini P. O'Neill H.A. Benada O. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 217-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cavadini P.

Frenkiel T. Gibson T. Pastore A.

Stier G. Kolmerer B. Adinolfi S. Martin S. Frenkiel T. Gibson T. Pastore A. Structure. 2000; 8: 695-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have demonstrated this truncated human holofrataxin to be monomeric (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry provided a measured KD ∼17 nm, with binding both enthalpically (ΔH ≃ –3.7 kcal/mol) and entropically (ΔS ≃ 23 cal/K·mol) favorable (Fig. 1A), and parameters are defined per mol of either frataxin or ferrochelatase dimer. No detectable binding response was measured in the absence of iron ion, consistent with observations made in binding studies of apofrataxin and apoISU (1Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For the latter study it was deduced that iron ion might mediate a bridging contact between the two proteins rather than a structural transition, because iron binding does not influence frataxin structure. Certainly the proposed frataxin (13Dhe-Paganon S. Shigeta R. Chi Y.I. Ristow M. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30753-30756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ferrochelatase (14Wu C.K. Dailey H.A. Rose J.P. Burden A. Sellers V.M. Wang B.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Sellers V.M. Wu C.K. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9821-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) binding sites show a number of acidic residues that might coordinate to bridging iron ions. High affinity binding of holofrataxin and ferrochelatase was also confirmed by fluorescence quenching experiments (Fig. 1C). Although binding was too tight for accurate quantitation, both data sets are consistent with the nm affinity of one frataxin to a ferrochelatase dimer. Holofrataxin was previously shown to bind to the iron-sulfur scaffold protein, ISU, with a KD ∼0.15 μm. To allow a comparison with holofrataxin binding to ferrochelatase, the former was determined under similar solution conditions to that reported here for frataxin binding to ferrochelatase, including the presence of 1% sodium cholate. Under similar solution conditions to those used for ferrochelatase binding (Fig. 1A), ITC experiments provided a measured KD ∼0.48 μm for frataxin binding to human apoISU, with a binding stoichiometry of 0.95, ΔH ≃ –2.1 kcal/mol, and ΔS ≃ 22 cal/K·mol (Fig. 1B). To understand the role of frataxin in heme biosynthesis, we performed additional experiments to measure ferrochelatase activity as a function of frataxin concentration at fixed ferrous ion concentration. Ferrochelatase activity was measured by following the absorbance change at 506 nm that results from heme production. Activity was found to increase with frataxin concentration and was optimal at a ratio of 1 frataxin molecule/ferrochelatase dimer (Fig. 2). These results support the hypothesis that frataxin recruits iron ion and mediates delivery to ferrochelatase. Free ferrous iron can also be delivered to ferrochelatase by nonspecific collision; however, free iron is not a bioavailable species. The sharply defined optimal frataxin/ferrochelatase ratio reflects the high affinity interaction and stoichiometric complex formation. The observed decrease in ferrochelatase activity with increasing frataxin concentration may be explained in several ways. Excess frataxin might bind elsewhere on ferrochelatase and inhibit its function. However, our previous ITC and fluorescence experiments show no evidence for binding of additional frataxin molecules in the concentration range used. A more likely explanation stems from the iron binding properties of frataxin that removes “free” iron from solution, lowering the available iron concentration and inhibiting ferrochelatase activity. The three-dimensional structure of human ferrochelatase (14Wu C.K. Dailey H.A. Rose J.P. Burden A. Sellers V.M. Wang B.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Sellers V.M. Wu C.K. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9821-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) demonstrates the active form of human ferrochelatase to be a homodimer, similar to that for Saccharomyces cerevisiae ferrochelatase (16Grzybowska E. Gora M. Plochocka D. Rytka J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These studies show that the binding and release pathways for protoporphyrin IX and heme, respectively, are located on the inner membrane side of a homodimeric form of ferrochelatase. However, the putative iron-binding site is found on the opposite side of the protein, which is exposed to the mitochondrial matrix (15Sellers V.M. Wu C.K. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9821-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and forms an appropriate domain for docking of an iron donor protein. The reaction stoichiometry observed by ITC and fluorescence quenching experiments is consistent with this hypothesis. The possibility that iron delivery from holofrataxin to ferrochelatase occurs via a specific intermolecular interaction was discussed, because heme levels from ferrochelatase activity did not significantly change with excess of the iron chelator, citrate. These results are consistent with findings for copper delivery from the carrier protein (Atx1) to a target protein (Ccc2) (17Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a process that was not influenced by the presence of the copper chelator, glutathione. Finally, although deletion of frataxin does not eliminate cluster or heme synthesis (low molecular weight cellular iron species or other donor proteins might serve) (18Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the evidence reported here does support a direct role for frataxin in the biosynthesis of hemes. It is significant that holofrataxin functions as an iron donor in both heme and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, since this allows for a simple control mechanism for utilization of holofrataxin. Thus, in the case of a hemedeficient condition, holofrataxin should be used mainly for heme synthesis, although in the case of iron-sulfur cluster deficiency the majority of holofrataxin should be utilized for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. Data from a recently published study of erythroid differentiation (7Becker E.M. Greer J.M. Ponka P. Richardson D.R. Blood. 2002; 99: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which requires elevated levels of heme production, show the levels of frataxin mRNA and protein product to be down-regulated. Similar observations were made in the case of Friend cells at the same developmental stage with increasing concentration of protoporphyrin (7Becker E.M. Greer J.M. Ponka P. Richardson D.R. Blood. 2002; 99: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The published data can be explained in terms of a general model for iron utilization in mitochondria (Fig. 3). The binding affinity between holofrataxin and ferrochelatase (KD ∼17 nm) is ∼28 times greater than the affinity between holofrataxin and ISU (KD ∼0.48 μm), and so reduced frataxin levels will have a more significant impact on iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. Although the complete details of the molecular mechanism of iron regulation in mitochondria remain unknown, Fig. 3 shows a plausible model from the perspective of iron utilization. We thank Dr. H. A. Dailey for the generous gift of an expression vector for human ferrochelatase and Dr. Sheref S. Mansy for assistance with plasmid transformations, initial sample purification, and valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2071027109,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to iron deprivation by increased transcription of the iron regulon, including the high affinity cell-surface transport system encoded by FET3 and FTR1. Here we demonstrate that transcription of these genes does not respond directly to cytosolic iron but rather to the mitochondrial utilization of iron for the synthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. We took advantage of a mutant form of an iron-dependent enzyme in the sterol pathway (Erg25-2p) to assess cytosolic iron levels. We showed that disruption of mitochondrial Fe-S biosynthesis, which results in excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation, leads to transcription of the iron transport system independent of the cytosolic iron level. There is an inverse correlation between the activity of the mitochondrial Fe-S-containing enzyme aconitase and the induction of FET3. Regulation of transcription by Fe-S biosynthesis represents a mechanism by which cellular iron acquisition is integrated with mitochondrial iron metabolism.

There is an inverse correlation between the activity of the mitochondrial Fe-S-containing enzyme aconitase and the induction of FET3. Regulation of transcription by Fe-S biosynthesis represents a mechanism by which cellular iron acquisition is integrated with mitochondrial iron metabolism. High affinity iron uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a transport system comprising the multicopper oxidase Fet3p and the transmembrane permease Ftr1p (1Van Ho A. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Genes that encode these proteins are part of an iron regulon in which transcription is activated by Aft1p. Aft1p is cytosolic when iron is replete and translocates to the nucleus when iron is limited (2Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that Aft1p responds to cytosolic levels of elemental iron, as conditions that lower cytosolic iron result in increased transcription of the iron regulon. Binding of iron to Aft1p, however, has not been demonstrated. Mutations that affect mitochondrial Fe-S biosynthesis or export result in increased cellular and mitochondrial iron as a result of decreased mitochondrial iron efflux (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been thought that the increase in mitochondrial iron occurs at the expense of cytosolic iron, and the decrease in cytosolic iron is responsible for the increase in Aft1p-mediated transcription of the iron regulon (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that activation of Aft1p does not directly respond to cytosolic iron. Using a novel measure of cytosolic iron, we showed that activation of the iron regulon can occur when cytosolic iron levels are high. We further demonstrated that activation of the iron regulon is controlled by the synthesis of Fe-S clusters, which in yeast is localized within mitochondria. Our studies revealed that cellular iron acquisition is coordinated with the mitochondrial use of iron. Yeast Strains—All yeast strains used in this study were derived from a W303 background strain. The following yeast strains have been described previously: DY150 (Mata ade2-1 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc)), METYFH1 (Matα ade2-1 his3-11 Δyfh1::HIS3 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc), pMET3YFH1 [URA3]) (5Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), METNFS1 (Matα ade2-1 his3-11 Δnfs1::HIS3 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc), pMET3NFS1 [URA3]) (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and erg25-2 (Matα erg25-2 ade2-1 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc)) (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DNA transformations of Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae were performed by standard procedures (7Sambrook J. Fritisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An erg25-2 METCCC1 strain was generated by transforming pMET3CCC1 (5Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) into the erg25-2 strain. An erg25-2 METYFH1 strain was generated by crossing the METYFH1 strain with an erg25-2 strain. The erg25-2 METNSF1 strain was generated by crossing the METNSF1 strain with an erg25-2 strain. Sporulation and dissection of diploids generated the haploid strains erg25-2 METYFH1 and erg25-2 METNFS1. To generate methionine-regulated genes, the promoter region of MET3 was fused in-frame to the indicated open reading frame (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Gene expression was achieved by incubating the strain that contained the construct in methionine-free medium. To turn the methionine-regulated gene off, 10-fold normal medium methionine was supplemented to the medium (final concentration 0.56 mg/ml). To generate strains carrying a FET3-LacZ reporter construct, a plasmid containing the FET3-LacZ reporter was integrated at the HO locus (8Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamiguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Strains carrying a PGK1-regulated FET3/FTR1 were generated by integrating a plasmid (pFET3/FTR1) at the ade2-1 locus (9Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene. 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Media—Yeast strains were grown in rich medium (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or in synthetic complete medium (CM; 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, and 0.12% amino acid drop-out mix). The media were made iron-limited by the addition of 80 μm bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS) 1The abbreviations used are: BPS, bathophenanthroline disulfonate; 4,4-DMZ, 4,4-dimethylzymosterol. to YPD and 40 μm BPS to the CM. To vary the concentration of media iron, FeSO4 (50 mm stock in 0.1 m HCl) was added back to the media at the indicated concentrations. Experimental Protocols—Cells were iron-loaded by the addition of 50 μm FeSO4 in the presence of 1 mm ascorbate for 30 min. Ascorbate-reduced iron is the substrate for Fet3p/Ftr1p and bypasses the rate-limiting cell-surface reductases. β-Galactosidase was assayed as described by Li et al. (10Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), sterols were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography as described by Kennedy and Bard (11Kennedy M.A. Bard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and aconitase was assayed as described by Chen et al. (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Decreased Cytosolic Iron Levels Induce the Iron Regulon—We developed a system in which we could determine the effect of cytosolic iron on induction of the iron transport system. To increase cellular iron, we utilized an integrating plasmid that contains FET3/FTR1 under the control of a constitutive iron-independent promoter (PGK1) (9Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene. 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For these and other experiments, ascorbate-reduced iron was employed to bypass the need for a ferrireductase to provide reduced iron, which is the substrate for the Fet3p/Ftr1p transport system. Increased expression of FET3/FTR1 led to a >3-fold increase in cellular iron uptake above that seen in cells where the endogenous FET3/FTR1 is maximally induced (8Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamiguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increase in iron due to the integrated FET3/FTR1 plasmid was detrimental to cell survival (i.e. increased oxidative damage), we examined cell growth in response to iron loading. Cells containing the integrated FET3/FTR1 plasmid that had been incubated with iron grew as well as cells without the plasmid or cells with the plasmid not exposed to iron (data not shown). To determine the effect of iron loading on induction of the iron regulon, cells (containing a FET3-LacZ reporter construct) both with and without the integrated FET3/FTR1 plasmid were exposed to ascorbate-reduced iron for 10 min and then incubated in media without bioavailable iron. As might be expected from the increased cytosolic iron, the cells that were exposed to iron and expressing higher levels of FET3/FTR1 showed a lag in the induction of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of the vacuolar iron transporter Ccc1p leads to the increased expression of FET3 mRNA, even in cells grown in iron-replete media (5Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We examined whether increased cytosolic iron could attenuate induction of a FET3 reporter construct in cells with increased vacuolar iron storage. Increased expression of the vacuolar iron storage transporter Ccc1p was accomplished through the use of a methionine-regulated plasmid. Strains were engineered that contained a methionine-regulated CCC1 plasmid and a FET3-LacZ reporter construct but differed in that one of the two contained the integrated FET3/FTR1 plasmid. Cells with and without the integrated FET3/FTR1 plasmid were exposed to ascorbate-reduced iron 30 min before induction of CCC1. Overexpression of CCC1 in the strain lacking the integrated FET3/FTR1 construct resulted in immediate activation of FET3-LacZ (Fig. 1B). However, there was a delay in the induction of FET3-LacZ when CCC1 was overexpressed in cells containing the integrated FET3/FTR1 construct. Western analysis showed that Ccc1p was expressed with similar kinetics in both strains (data not shown). Control experiments have shown that the addition or subtraction of methionine does not affect the induction of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct in response to low iron. These results indicate that increased cytosolic iron can affect the rate of induction of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct when cytosolic iron is depleted by storage in the vacuole. Expression of the iron transport system has often been used as a measure of cytosolic iron. We developed an alternative method of measuring cytosolic iron. To examine the relationship between iron and the expression of iron transport genes, we utilized strains that contained a mutant allele of ERG25, erg25-2, which is responsive to cytosolic iron (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ERG25 encodes C-4 methyl sterol oxidase, an enzyme essential for ergosterol biosynthesis. Erg25p has been shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and contains histidine motifs thought to coordinate oxo-diiron as a catalytic group (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ERG25-2 has a point mutation that appears to result in an enzyme with a lower affinity for iron. When cytosolic iron levels are low, iron is released from the mutant enzyme abolishing its catalytic activity. Thus, enzyme activity is a reflection of cytosolic iron concentration. Under low iron conditions, the erg25-2 strain does not synthesize ergosterol and accumulates the ergosterol intermediate 4,4-dimethylzymosterol (4,4-DMZ). Initially, we constructed a standard curve where we assayed both FET3-LacZ induction and the sterol profile in erg25-2 cells with respect to varying concentrations of media iron. Decreased media iron resulted in an induction in β-galactosidase activity, a decrease in ergosterol biosynthesis, and an increase in 4,4-DMZ (Fig. 2). This result confirms previous work (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showing that ergosterol synthesis in cells with the erg25-2 allele responds to cytosolic iron. Consequently, the levels of the sterol intermediate 4,4-DMZ can be used as a measure of cytosolic iron, as the concentration of 4,4-DMZ varies inversely with cytosolic iron. We utilized the erg25-2 strain to confirm that constitutive expression of FET3/FTR1 results in increased cytosolic iron and that induction of Ccc1p can deplete cytosolic iron. We constructed two strains that contained the erg25-2 allele and a regulated CCC1 plasmid. One of the two strains also contained the integrated FET3/FTR1 construct. The two strains were incubated with ascorbate iron for 30 min before the induction of CCC1. At the indicated times, the cells were harvested, and the sterol profile was determined. As expected, the induction of CCC1 in cells containing the erg25-2 allele resulted in an increase in 4,4-DMZ (Fig. 3). No increase in 4,4-DMZ was seen in cells with a wild-type ERG25 allele (data not shown). In cells containing the integrated FET3/FTR1 plasmid, there was approximately a 2-h delay before the level of 4,4-DMZ increased. These results support the data utilizing the FET3-LacZ reporter construct and demonstrate that reduction in cytosolic iron, either through decreased external iron or increased vacuolar iron transport, induces the iron regulon. Decreased Fe-S Cluster Synthesis Increases the Iron Regulon in Iron-replete Cells—To determine whether increased cytosolic iron would affect expression of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct when Fe-S biosynthesis is disrupted, a yeast strain was constructed that permitted the regulated expression of YFH1, the yeast orthologue of the mammalian gene frataxin (responsible for the human disease Friedreich ataxia (12Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar)). Loss of YFH1 expression results in decreased Fe-S biosynthesis and increased cellular and mitochondrial iron accumulation (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We examined whether increased cytosolic iron would affect the kinetics of the expression of a FET3 reporter construct in cells that did not express YFH1. Cells containing a chromosomal deletion of YFH1 (a plasmid containing a methionine-regulated YFH1 gene) and an integrated FET3-LacZ reporter construct were incubated with iron ascorbate for 30 min to allow the accumulation of intracellular iron. The cultures were then supplemented with methionine to repress the expression of YFH1. As expected, the inhibition of YFH1 expression resulted in activation of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct (Fig. 4). Despite the increase in cytosolic iron, similar kinetics were observed for activation of FET3-LacZ in the strain carrying the integrated FET3/FTR1 construct. This is in contrast to the delay observed when iron levels are decreased by either low media iron or by CCC1 overexpression. Induction of FET3-LacZ independent of cellular iron content was also seen when expression of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct was assayed after cells had been incubated for 6 h with a range of media iron. In the absence of Yfh1p, there was a significant activation of β-galactosidase, even in the presence of 250 μm iron (data not shown). These results suggest that activation of the iron regulon in the absence of Yfh1p is independent of cytosolic iron levels and appears to be dependent on a mitochondrial product. This result was confirmed by measuring the sterol levels in cells carrying the erg25-2 allele and a regulated YFH1 construct, erg25-2 METYFH1. The absence of Yfh1p in iron-replete media results in the induction of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct comparable with that seen in severely iron-starved cells. Compared with wild-type cells, however, there was no change in sterol profile (ergosterol was high and 4,4-DMZ was low), suggesting that cytosolic iron levels are sufficient to iron load Erg25-2p (Fig. 5). Although studies suggest that the primary function of Yfh1p/frataxin is involvement in Fe-S biosynthesis (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Muhlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Ristow M. Kispal G. Lill R. Hum. Mol.

Matzanke B.F. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The deletion of other genes that affect Fe-S biosynthesis also leads to increased mitochondrial iron accumulation and increased expression of the iron regulon. NFS1 encodes a cysteine desulferase, which generates sulfide for Fe-S biosynthesis (17Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of reduced expression of NFS1 on both FET3-LacZ induction and the sterol profile in an erg25-2 METNFS1 strain. Similar to the loss of Yfh1p, the inhibition of NFS1 expression resulted in high levels of β-galactosidase activity with a wild-type sterol profile (Fig. 5). This result confirms the conclusion that defects in Fe-S cluster synthesis can induce the iron regulon even when cytosolic iron is high. Growth of erg25-2 cells can also be used to monitor cytosolic iron levels in cells depleted of Yfh1p. In the absence of Yfh1p, if iron accumulates in mitochondria at the expense of cytosolic iron, then depletion of cytosolic iron should exacerbate the low iron growth defect of the erg25-2 allele. In iron-replete media, erg25-2 METYFH1 grew as well as wild-type or erg25-2 cells independent of YFH1 expression (Fig. 6). On iron-limited plates, erg25-2 cells showed the expected growth defect as did erg25-2 METYFH1 cells that expressed YFH1. In the absence of YFH1 expression, erg25-2 METYFH1 cells grew better than erg25-2, suggesting that cytosolic iron was sufficient to iron-load Erg25-2p and maintain ergosterol biosynthesis. Although overexpression of CCC1 also leads to induction of FET3, the erg25-2 METCCC1 strain failed to grow on iron-limited media. These results indicate that although deletion of YFH1 increases mitochondrial iron, it does not deplete the pool of cytosolic iron. Our data suggest that cellular iron acquisition is regulated by the availability of iron for the metabolic needs of Fe-S biosynthesis. We hypothesized that decreases in cytosolic iron, resulting from media iron deprivation or overexpression of the vacuolar iron transporter, should lead to a decrease in the activity of the Fe-S cluster containing the enzyme aconitase and also to a subsequent induction of FET3 expression. We measured aconitase activity and FET3-LacZ induction in cells incubated under varying media iron concentrations (Fig. 7A). We performed a linear regression analysis on the FET3-LacZ and aconitase activity data from Fig. 7A (Fig. 7B, closed circles). There was a strong inverse correlation between FET3 induction and aconitase activity (r2 = 0.90). We next examined FET3-LacZ induction and aconitase activity in METCCC1, METYFH1, and METNFS1 strains under conditions in which the MET3-regulated gene was either turned on or off (Fig. 7B, open squares). Again, there was a strong inverse correlation between aconitase activity and FET3 induction. Including these points in the linear regression analysis increased the r2 value to 0.94. Together, these data suggest that expression of FET3 is largely regulated by mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis and not directly through the cytosolic iron pool. The control of cellular iron acquisition by mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis is a mechanism that would sense both cytosolic iron levels and mitochondrial iron metabolism. Our data strongly suggest that Aft1p may not directly sense elemental iron but rather senses Fe-S clusters or a signal arising from an Fe-S-containing enzyme. This conclusion is based on the observation that induction of the iron regulon by the inhibition of Fe-S cluster synthesis occurs when cytosolic iron levels are high. Measurement of cytosolic iron has been problematic for organisms as diverse as yeast and man. The major problem is that cell homogenization destroys organelles, thus preventing accurate assessment of cytosolic iron. The cytosolic metal-binding chelator calcein has been used to estimate cytosolic iron in cultured vertebrate cells (19Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik I.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, calcein has not been of use in yeast. We took advantage of a mutant enzyme in the sterol biosynthetic pathway to provide a measure of cytosolic iron. Erg25p is an enzyme localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on sequence, Erg25p is an oxo-diiron-containing enzyme, and iron is essential for enzymatic activity. The erg25-2 allele was identified because the activity of the enzyme, and consequently cell growth, was dependent on cytosolic iron. Reduction in cytosolic iron led to decreased growth as a consequence of decreased ergosterol biosynthesis (6Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have shown that changes in sterol profile are responsive to media iron. Thus, although we do not know the location of the active site of the enzyme (facing the lumen or facing the cytosol), the activity of the mutant enzyme is responsive to cytosolic iron. We utilized the erg25-2 allele to show that reduction in Fe-S cluster synthesis, which induces transcription of the iron regulon, does not lead to a reduction in cytosolic iron; the sterol profile of the erg25-2 cell appeared normal. Further, using iron-limited plates, we have shown that induction of the iron regulon by decreased Fe-S cluster synthesis can permit cells to acquire iron, which can allow erg25-2 cells to grow. Although cytosolic iron is the substrate for mitochondrial Fe-S biosynthesis, conditions that lead to cytosolic iron deprivation (e.g. reduced media iron level, defective iron transport, or increased vacuolar iron storage) result in decreased Fe-S biosynthesis and increased expression of the iron regulon (3Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activation of the iron regulon by impaired mitochondrial Fe-S biosynthesis can explain the apparent conundrum in which loss of Fe-S leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation but only when the cytosolic iron level is high (12Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 20Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Conditions that result in cytosolic iron starvation will prevent mitochondrial iron accumulation in strains defective in Fe-S biosynthesis. Our results suggest that in the absence of Fe-S biosynthesis, the cytosolic iron level is high, thus permitting mitochondrial iron accumulation. The prediction from our data is that Aft1p, or a protein that associates with Aft1p, may be an Fe-S-containing protein and that the status of the Fe-S may regulate transcription of genes required for iron acquisition. Aft1p contains a CXC motif that could potentially participate in binding Fe-S. Further, mutation in one of the cysteines (C293F), which might prevent Aft1p from binding an Fe-S, results in a constitutively active allele (21Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Expression of Aft1p in bacteria under conditions in which the Fe-S cluster operon was overexpressed did not provide evidence that Aft1p contains Fe-S clusters. 2D. R. Winge, unpublished data. It is worth noting that although Aft1p transitions between cytosol and the nucleus, the metal-sensing transcription factors for the copper regulon (Mac1p) and zinc regulon (Zap1p) are always nuclear (1Van Ho A. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We speculate that the difference in the localization of metal-sensing transcription factors is because of the binding of elemental metals by Mac1p and Zap1p in contrast to Aft1p, which senses a mitochondrial product rather than elemental iron. A precedent for Fe-S regulation of gene expression is demonstrated by mammalian IRP1, in which the status of an Fe-S cluster regulates the turnover and expression of mRNA involved in iron transport and storage (22Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the Fe-S state of FNR and IscR regulates the transcription of genes required for anaerobiosis and the Isc operon, respectively (23Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 24Schwartz C.J. Giel J.L. Patschkowski T. Luther C. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It may well be that Aft1p binds to other proteins that contain Fe-S clusters or that Aft1p senses the product of an Fe-S cluster-containing protein. Cells respond to defective Fe-S cluster synthesis by increasing the amount of iron in the mitochondria and in the cell. By increasing iron in the mitochondria, the concentration of one of the essential substrates for Fe-S cluster synthesis is also increased. Recently, we demonstrated that transcription of the cell-surface iron transport system requires heme (8Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamiguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the absence of heme, transcription is inhibited even though Aft1p occupies the promoters of genes such as FET3. This observation suggests that transactivation of Aft1p is regulated by other gene products. In yeast, however, heme synthesis is dispensable, as yeast can live anaerobically without heme. Fe-S cluster synthesis, however, is essential. Coupling transcription of the iron transport system to the presence of heme or the synthesis of Fe-S clusters provides mechanisms for integrating mitochondrial iron usage with cellular iron acquisition."

In this report, we determined the role of carboxyl termini (CTs) of α2B-adrenergic receptor (AR) and angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1R) in their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. The α2B-AR and AT1R mutants lacking the CTs were completely unable to transport to the cell surface and were trapped in the ER. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that residues Phe436 and Ile443-Leu444 in the CT were required for α2B-AR export. Insertion or deletion between Phe436 and Ile443-Leu444 as well as Ile443-Leu444 mutation to FF severely disrupted α2B-AR transport, indicating there is a defined spatial requirement, which is essential for their function as a single motif regulating receptor transport from the ER. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminally truncated as well as Phe436 and Ile443-Leu444 mutants were unable to bind ligand and the α2B-AR CT conferred its transport properties to the AT1R mutant without the CT in a Phe436-Ile443-Leu444-dependent manner. These data suggest that the Phe436 and Ile443-Leu444 may be involved in both proper folding and export from the ER of the receptor. Similarly, residues Phe309 and Leu316-Leu317 in the CT were identified as essential for AT1R export.

G protein-coupled receptors constitute a superfamily of membrane proteins that respond to a vast array of sensory and chemical stimuli and share a common topology with a hydrophobic core of seven transmembrane-spanning α-helices within the plasma membrane, three intracellular loops, and three extracellular loops with amino terminus outside the cell and carboxyl terminus (CT) 1The abbreviations used are: CT, carboxyl terminus; CTs, carboxyl termini; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ang II, angiotensin II; AT1R, angiotensin II type 1A receptor; AR, adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor. inside the cell (1Premont R.T.

To precisely perform their functions, the newly synthesized G protein-coupled receptors transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are synthesized, folded, and assembled, to the plasma membrane, the functional destination. The receptors at the plasma membrane may undergo internalization upon stimulation with agonists. The internalized receptors are then transported to the lysosomes for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. Therefore, intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors is a highly regulated and dynamic process. Because most studies of receptor trafficking have focused on the events involved in receptor internalization, recycling, and degradation (9Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 10Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor export from the ER and subsequent transport to the cell surface and regulation of receptor signaling by these processes remain poorly understood. ER exportation represents the first step of intracellular trafficking of the receptors and, most certainly, regulates receptor expression at the cell surface and function. Indeed, export from the ER is the rate-limiting step for δ opioid receptor expression at the cell surface (11Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

However, structural determinants involved in the transport of G protein-coupled receptors from the ER to the cell surface remain poorly defined. Our previous studies have demonstrated that, whereas α2B-adrenergic receptor (AR) transport from the ER to the cell surface is independent of Rab1, angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1R) and β2-AR transport to the cell surface is dependent on Rab1 (23Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Rab1 is a Ras-related small GTPase involved in antegrade protein transport specifically from the ER to the Golgi and between Golgi compartments (24Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J.

These data indicate that different G protein-coupled receptors may use distinct pathways for their export trafficking. The α2B-AR, β2-AR, and AT1R couple to different G proteins and differ in their glycosylation. Whereas α2B-AR couples to Gi/o proteins and does not contain glycosylation signals, AT1R and β2-AR mainly couple to Gs and Gq proteins, respectively, and have putative N-linked glycosylation sites at the amino termini (26Sayeski P.P.

Whereas α2B-AR contains a larger third intracellular loop and a small CT, AT1R contains a small third intracellular loop and a larger CT (28Zeng D.W. Harrison J.K. D'Angelo D.D. Barber C.M.

We have identified a novel motif consisting of a phenylalanine and double leucine spaced by 6 residues (F(X)6LL) in the CTs of α2B-AR and AT1R that is required for the exit of the receptors from the ER. This motif is highly conserved in the membrane-proximal CTs of many G protein-coupled receptors and may provide a common mechanism directing the transport of the receptors from the ER to the cell surface.

A similar strategy was employed to construct the AT1R-ct in which the carboxyl-terminal 63 amino acid residues (Leu297-Gln359) was truncated (forward primer, 5′-GATCAAGCTTGTCTGGATAAATCACAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GATCGTCGACGCGCAGTTGTTAAAATAC-3′) and other carboxyl-terminally truncated AT1R constructs, including AT1R1–349, AT1R1–320, and AT1R1–306 in which carboxyl-terminal 10, 39, and 53 residues were removed, respectively. For generation of chimeric receptor AT1α2R in which the AT1R CT was substituted with the α2B-AR CT, two complementary oligonucleotides (5′-TCGACGCAGGACTTCCGCCGTGCCTTTCGAAGGATCCTTTGCCGGCCGTGGACCCAGACTGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCAGCCAGTCTGGGTCCACGGCCGGCAAAGGATCCTTCGAAAGGCACGGCGGAAGTCCTGCG-3′) coding the α2B-AR CT (Gln434-Trp453) and carrying the sticky ends of SalI and BamHI were annealed and ligated into the AT1R-ct-GFP in the pEGFP-N1, which was cleaved with SalI and BamHI. A similar strategy was employed to construct the chimeric receptor AT1α2mR in which the AT1R CT was replaced with mutated α2B-AR CT (Gln434-Trp453) in which Phe436, Ile443, and Leu444 were mutated to alanines (sense, 5′-TCGACGCAGGACGCCCGCCGTGCCTTTCGAAGGGCCGCTTGCCGGCCGTGGACCCAGACTGGCTGG-3′; antisense, GATCCCAGCCAGTCTGGGTCCACGGCCGGCAAGCGGCCCTTCGAAAGGCACGGCGGGCGTCCTGCG-3′). Therefore, the resulting chimera contained three extra residues (AST) between the AT1R-ct and the α2B-AR CT. Receptor mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and GFP-tagged receptors as templates. The sequence of each construct used in this study was verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis (Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center DNA Sequence Core). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of the HEK293T cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For measurement of total and cell-surface receptor expression and ERK1/2 activation, HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well dishes. For each transfection, 0.8 μg of GFP- or HA-tagged receptors were diluted into 125 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM in a tube. In another tube, 2 μl of LipofectAMINE was diluted into 125 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM. The two solutions were combined and mixed gently. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was added to each well containing 750 μl of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For radioligand binding studies, HEK293T cells were cultured on 100-mm dishes and transfected with 8 μg of GFP-tagged receptor. The transfection efficiency was estimated to be about 80% based on the GFP fluorescence. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Receptor Expression—For measurement of total receptor expression, HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-tagged receptors were collected and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% fetal calf serum at a density of 8 × 106 cells/ml. Total receptor expression was determined by measuring total GFP fluorescence on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences FACSCalibur) as described previously (23Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For measurement of receptor expression at the cell surface, HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged receptors. The transfected cells were collected, suspended in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated with high affinity fluorescein conjugated anti-HA antibody 3F10 at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with 0.5 ml of PBS and 1% fetal calf serum, the cells were resuspended, and the fluorescence was analyzed as described above. Because the staining with the anti-HA antibodies was carried out in the unpermeabilized cells and only those receptors expressed at the cell surface were accessible to the anti-HA antibodies, the fluorescence measurement reflected the amount of AT1R expressed at the cell surface. Radioligand Binding—Membrane preparation and radioligand binding studies were carried out essentially as described (33Hamamdzic D. Duzic E. Sherlock J.D. Lanier S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E162-E171PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were cultured on 100-mm dishes and transiently transfected with α2B-AR WT or mutant plasmids as described above. The cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested, and homogenized in 3 ml per plate of buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA and 5 mm EDTA supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl per plate of membrane buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. The membrane suspension (15 μg of membrane protein) was incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]RX-821002 (1.25–160 nm) in a total volume of 100 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of the selective α2B-AR antagonist rauwolscine (10 μm). Duplicate samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with constant shaking, and the reaction was terminated by vacuum filtration. After washing with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (4 × 4 ml), the retained radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 8 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation solution (National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). The Bmax values were calculated using PRISM software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293T cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-4% sucrose mixture in PBS for 15 min. For localization of receptor expression, the cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. The coverslips were mounted, and fluorescence was detected with a Leica DMRA2 epifluorescent microscope. Images were deconvolved using SlideBook software and the nearest neighbors deconvolution algorithm (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). For co-localization of the receptor with calregulin, an ER marker, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with antibodies against calregulin for 1 h. After washing with PBS (3 × 5 min), the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-labled secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, and the fluorescence was analyzed as described above. Measurement of ERK1/2 Activation—HEK293T cells were cultured on 6-well dishes and transfected as described above. At 36–48 h after transient transfection, HEK293T cells were starved for at least 3 h and then stimulated with individual agonists as indicated in the figure legends. Stimulation was terminated by addition of 1 × SDS gel loading buffer as described previously (23Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After solubilizing the cells, 20 μl of total cell lysates was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and ERK1/2 activation was determined by Western blotting by measuring the levels of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibodies. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK2 antibodies to determine the total amount of ERK2 and to confirm equal loading of proteins. Immunoblotting—Western blotting was carried out as described previously (23Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HEK293T cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The signal was detected using ECL Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a Fuji Film luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000 Plus). Statistical Analysis—Differences were evaluated using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. A Requirement of the Carboxyl Termini of α2B-AR and AT1R for the Transport from the ER to the Cell Surface—We have recently demonstrated that the transport from the ER to the cell surface of α2B-AR and AT1R is mediated through distinct pathways (23Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In an attempt to define structural determinants for the selection of specific transport pathways, we determined the role of the CTs of α2B-AR and AT1R in their transport from the ER to the cell surface. We first determined the effect of deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 20 (Gln434-Trp453) and 63 (Leu297-Glu359) amino acid residues from α2B-AR and AT1R, respectively (Fig. 1A), on receptor expression at the cell surface. α2B-AR WT, AT1R WT, and their mutants lacking the CTs (α2B-AR-ct and AT1R-ct) were conjugated with the HA at the amino termini (HA-α2B-AR, HA-α2B-AR-ct, HA-AT1R, and HA-AT1R-ct) or with the GFP at the carboxyl termini (α2B-AR-GFP, α2B-AR-ct-GFP, AT1R-GFP, and AT1R-ct-GFP), and transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. Total receptor expression was quantitated in cells expressing α2B-AR-GFP, α2B-AR-ct-GFP, AT1R-GFP, or AT1R-ct-GFP by flow cytometry measuring total GFP fluorescence. Cell-surface receptor expression was measured in cells expressing HA-α2B-AR, HA-α2B-AR-ct, HA-AT1R, or HA-AT1R-ct following staining with HA antibodies. Total expression levels of α2B-AR-ct-GFP and AT1R-ct-GFP were almost the same as compared with α2B-AR-GFP and AT1R-GFP, respectively (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cell-surface expression levels of HA-α2B-AR-ct and HA-AT1R-ct were markedly reduced by 96 and 97%, respectively, compared with their HA-tagged WT receptors (Fig. 1B). These data indicated that the CTs of α2B-AR and AT1R are required for their expression at the cell surface. In the second series of experiments, we determined the functional consequence of deleting the CTs of α2B-AR and AT1R by measuring ERK1/2 activation in response to agonist stimulation in HEK293T cells. ERK1/2 activation was stimulated by UK14304 or Ang II in a dose-dependent manner in cells transiently transfected with α2B-AR-GFP or AT1R-GFP, respectively (Fig. 1C). In contrast, ERK1/2 activation by the agonists was completely lost in cells transfected with α2B-AR-ct-GFP or AT1R-ct-GFP (Fig. 1C). These data are consistent with the lack of cell-surface expression of α2B-AR-ct and AT1R-ct as measured by flow cytometry. We then sought to visualize the differential localization of WT and mutated receptors. α2B-AR-GFP, α2B-AR-ct-GFP, AT1R-GFP, or AT1R-ct-GFP was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, and their subcellular distribution at steady state was revealed by microscopy. As anticipated, α2B-AR and AT1R were mainly localized at the cell surface (Fig. 1D), which was confirmed by co-localization with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A, a plasma membrane marker (not shown). In contrast, α2B-AR-ct and AT1R-ct completely lost their cell-surface expression pattern exhibiting a marked localization to the perinuclear region of the transfected cells (Fig. 1D). The α2B-AR-ct and AT1R-ct were extensively co-localized with calregulin, an ER marker (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the CTs of α2B-AR and AT1R play an obligatory role in receptor transport from the ER to the cell surface. Identification of Amino Acid Residues Required for the Exit of α2B-AR from the ER—To identify key amino acid residues required for receptor transport from the ER to the cell surface, we first focused on the α2B-AR CT, because it is relatively shorter. We generated a series of mutants in which each amino acid residues in the α2B-AR CT (432FNQDFRRAFRRILCRPWTQTGW453) was substituted with alanine individually or in combination (Fig. 3A). α2B-AR WT and mutants conjugated with GFP at their CTs were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and their subcellular localization was revealed by microscopy. Mutation of the residues Phe432, Gln434, Asp435, Arg437Arg438, Phe440, Arg441Arg442, Ile443, Leu444, Cys445, Arg446, Pro447, Trp448, Thr449-Thr451, Gln450, or Trp453 did not significantly influence the subcellular localization of α2B-AR (Fig. 3B). In contrast, single mutation of Phe436 abolished cell-surface expression of α2B-AR resulting in substantial ER accumulation (Fig. 3B). Because the LL motif together with an upstream acidic residue (E) have been demonstrated to be essential for cell-surface expression of the vasopressin V2 receptor (34Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of double mutation of Ile443-Leu444 on α2B-AR transport. Our results indicated that, although individual mutation of Ile443 and Leu444 had no obvious effect on receptor export from the ER, double mutation of Ile443-Leu444 clearly inhibited α2B-AR transport from the ER (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, triple mutation of Phe436, Ile443, and Leu444 completely blocked α2B-AR transport out of the ER to the cell surface (Fig. 3B). We then compared radioligand binding abilities of α2B-AR WT and mutants utilizing the selective α2B-AR antagonist [3H]RX-821002. Radioligand binding results indicated that the membrane fraction prepared from the cells transfected with α2B-AR-GFP bound to [3H]RX-821002 similar to that of non-tagged α2B-AR. In contrast, the membrane fractions prepared from the cells transfected with mutants α2B-AR-ct, Phe436, Ile443-Leu444,orPhe436-Ile443-Leu444 were completely unable to bind the ligand (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that residues Phe436-Ile443-Leu444 may be involved in correct folding of α2B-AR. Furthermore, cells expressing the mutant Phe436-Ile443-Leu444 were unable to stimulate ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3D), consistent with the lack of cell-surface expression of the receptor (Fig. 3C). Spatial Requirement of the Phe436 and Ile443-Leu444 in the Motif F(X)6IL—To determine if Phe43"
https://openalex.org/W2004962395,"The ability of the closely related beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenergic receptors (AR) to form hetero-oligomers was assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Quantitative bioluminescence resonance energy transfer titration curves revealed that the beta(2)AR has identical propensity to hetero-oligomerize with the beta(3)AR than to form homo-oligomers. To determine the influence of heterooligomerization, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing an excess of beta(3)AR over beta(2)AR was generated so that all beta(2)AR are engaged in hetero-oligomerization with beta(3)AR, providing a tool to study the effect of hetero-oligomerization on beta(2)AR function in the absence of any beta(2)AR homooligomer. The hetero-oligomerization had no effect on the ligand binding properties of various beta(2)AR ligands and did not affect the potency of isoproterenol to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Despite the unaltered ligand binding properties of the beta(2/3)AR hetero-oligomer, the stable association of the beta(2)AR with the beta(3)AR completely blocked agonist-stimulated internalization of the beta(2)AR. Given that the beta(3)AR is resistant to agonist-promoted endocytosis, the results indicate that the beta(3)AR acted as a dominant negative of the beta(2)AR endocytosis process. Consistent with this notion, the beta(2/3)AR hetero-oligomer displayed a lower propensity to recruit beta-arrestin-2 than the beta(2)AR. The hetero-oligomerization also led to a change in G protein coupling selectivity. Indeed, in contrast to beta(2)AR and beta(3)AR, which regulate adenylyl cyclase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity through a coupling to G(s) and G(i/o), no G(i/o) coupling was observed for the beta(2/3)AR hetero-oligomer. Together, these results demonstrate that hetero-oligomerization between beta(2)AR and beta(3)AR forms a beta-adrenergic signaling unit that possesses unique functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2087753442,"Cyclooxygenase (COX) and its prostanoid metabolites have been implicated in the control of cell survival; however, their role as mitogens remains undefined. To better understand the role of prostanoids on cell growth, we used mouse colon adenocarcinoma (CT26) cells to investigate the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in cell proliferation. CT26 cells express both COX1 and COX2 and metabolize arachidonic acid to PGE2. Treatment with indomethacin, or COX-selective inhibitors, prevents PGE2 biosynthesis and CT26 cell proliferation. The anti-proliferative effects of COX inhibition are rescued specifically by treatment with PGE2 or the EP4 receptor-selective agonist PGE1-OH via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, thus providing a functional link between PGE2-induced cell proliferation and EP4-mediated ERK signaling. Indomethacin or COX2 inhibitors, but not COX1 inhibitors, reduced the size and number of CT26-derived tumors in vivo. These inhibitory effects are paralleled by marked declines in the levels of tumor PGE2, suggesting that their anti-tumor effects are directly associated with the inhibition of COX2 enzymatic activity. The described anti-tumor effects of indomethacin are evident whether it is administered at the time of, or 7 days after, tumor cell injection, suggesting that it has tumor preventive and therapeutic actions. Furthermore, the observation that indomethacin increases the survival rates of tumor-bearing mice, even after withdrawal of the drug, indicates that its effects are long lasting and that it may be potentially useful for the prevention and the clinical management of human cancers.

During studies of arachidonic acid metabolism in mouse colon carcinoma (CT26) cells, we observed the rapid biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This, and the powerful tumorigenic activity of CT26 cells, prompted us to characterize the role of PGE2 in tumor growth and development. We show here a direct correlation between COX inhibition, reduced PGE2 biosynthesis, and marked reductions in CT26 cell growth in vitro, as well as tumorigenicity in vivo. These data, together with the finding that the anti-proliferative effects of NSAIDs treatment can be selectively reverted by PGE2 via the Prostaglandin Receptor EP4-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, provide a direct functional link between PGE2-induced cell growth and EP4-mediated ERK signaling.

Whitehead, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) were incubated with [1-14C]AA (30 μm, final concentration) at 37 °C.

The eluted products with the retention time of PGE2 were collected and characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (10Capdevila J.H. Morrow J.D. Belosludtsev Y.Y. Beauchamp D.R.

Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Proliferation Assays—CT26 cells (5 × 103/96-well plates) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum with or without 10 μm indomethacin, 5 μm SC560, or 5 μm NS398. To determine the mitogenic activity of PGE2, cells were incubated with or without COX inhibitors in the presence of PGE2 (0-5 μm). To determine the major prostanoid and the receptor involved in the control of CT26 cell proliferation, cells were cultured with or without 10 μm indomethacin added alone or in combination with butaprost, sulprostone, PGE1-OH, cicaprost, PGD2, PGF2α, or PGJ2 (1 μm each) (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). To determine the intracellular pathways involved in the control of CT26 cell proliferation, cells were cultured with 10 μm indomethacin and 1 μm PGE2 or PGE1-OH in the presence or absence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 (5 μm), the P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor (1 μm), and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) (all from Calbiochem). Two days after, the medium was replaced with fresh media containing [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml), and the cells were incubated for another 48 h. Cells were then processed as described (12Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Three to four independent experiments with quadruplicate samples were performed. Manual cell counts paralleled the results of [3H]thymidine incorporation (not shown). Primary Tumor Growth—Experiments were performed according to institutional animal care guidelines. Male BALB/c mice (5 weeks old; 18-20 g of body weight) were given four dorsal subcutaneous injections of CT26 cells (5 × 105/site injection) as described (13Pozzi A. LeVine W.F. Gardner H.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In some experiments, mice injected with CT26 cells were treated with indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection daily), NS398 (2.5 mg/kg/body weight, intraperitoneal injection every other day), or SC560 (30 μg/ml in drinking water) starting at the time of, or 1 week after, cell injection; tumors were harvested after 14 days of growth (see Fig. 4A). For recovery experiments (see Fig. 5A), mice received indomethacin at the time of, or 1 week after, cell injection. Two weeks after cell injection, indomethacin treatment was stopped, and the animals were kept for an additional 10 days. Tumors (24 days total growth) were then harvested, and their volumes were measured and expressed as mm3 of total tumor volume/mouse.Fig. 5Effects of COX inhibitors on tumor uptake and development. A, schematic representation of the in vivo experimental protocol. CT26 cells (5 × 105 cells/mice) were injected into BALB/c mice (10 mice/group), and the animals were sacrificed 2 weeks after injection. Tumor-bearing mice were divided into three groups: untreated (c, control); treated for 1 week with COX inhibitors starting 1 week after cell injection (a, 1 week); and treated for 2 weeks with COX inhibitors starting at the time of cell injection (b, 2 weeks). B, gross appearance of tumors derived from CT26 cells injected as described in A. C, total tumor volume was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values represent the average of total tumor volume/mouse calculated from three experiments, using 10 mice/experiment. D, PGE2 levels in tumor extracts. PGE2 levels were determined as described under “Materials and Methods” and expressed as ng/mg total protein. Values are the average of 10 tumors/treatment. Differences between mice untreated and treated with COX inhibitors (*) or between mice treated with COX inhibitors for 1 (a) versus 2 (b) weeks (**) were significant with p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Measurement of PGE2 and cAMP Levels—Tumors or cells were homogenized and lipids were extracted with methanol containing 4 ng of [2H4]PGE2 (Cayman Chemicals). PGE2 levels were then quantified as described (14DuBois R.N. Awad J. Morrow J. Roberts II, L.J. Bishop P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 15Reese J.

CT26 cells were incubated for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μm indomethacin, followed by serum-free medium containing 10 μm indomethacin and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min. Cells were then incubated for 10 min with PGE2, PGE1-OH, butaprost, or forskolin (1 μm each), washed with PBS, and after adding HCl (0.1 m final concentration), the cells were scraped and lysed; cAMP levels (ng/mg total protein) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cAMP kit, Cayman Chemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions (16Hata A.N. Zent R. Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was purified from CT26 cells or mouse kidneys using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript II™ kit and oligo(dT) (12-18 bp). cDNAs were amplified using the following EP-subtype selective primers: EP1 (710 bp) sense, 5′-cacccaggctccccaatacatctg-3′, anti-sense, 5′-ggagggtggctgtggctgaag3′; EP2 (507 bp) sense, 5′-ccggggttctggggaatc-3′, antisense, 5′-gtgcatgcgaatgaggttgag-3′; EP3α (617 bp) and β (528 bp) sense, 5′-cgccgtctcgcagtc-3′, antisense, 5′-tgtgtcgtcttgcccccg-3′; EP3γ (690 bp) sense, 5′-cgccgtctcgcagtc-3′, antisense, 5′-tgtggcttcattccttgccca-3′; EP4 (407 bp) sense, 5′-actgaccttctgggcaccttg-3′, antisense, 5′-tccttcctcatccttgccacc-3′. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry on frozen tumor sections (7 μm each) was done using rat anti-mouse CD31 (1:100, PharMingen) or rabbit anti-mouse PCNA (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibody to rat or rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Sigma Fast diaminobenzidine chromogenic tablets (Sigma). CD31-positive structures were then imaged and processed as described (12Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Tumor vascularity was expressed as a percentage of area occupied by CD-31-positive structures per microscopic field. The proliferation index within tumors was expressed as (number of PCNA-positive cells/total number of cells per microscopic field) × 100. Apoptosis within tumors was evaluated by staining frozen sections with the Dead End™ colorimetric terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) system (Promega) using diaminobenzidine as the chromogenic substrate. The apoptotic index was expressed as (number of TUNEL-positive cells/total number of cells per microscopic field) × 100. Five images/tumor were evaluated, with a total of 10 tumors/treatment. Western Blot Analysis—To evaluate ERK and Akt phosphorylation, CT26 cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium before treatment with PGE2, PGE1-OH, or butaprost (1 μm each) for 15 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, scraped, suspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS/PAGE (50 μg of total protein/lane) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were incubated with a rabbit anti-phospho ERK or rabbit anti-phospho Akt antibody (both from Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and an ECL kit (Pierce). Total ERK and Akt content was verified by stripping the membranes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, containing 2% SDS and 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 55 °C and re-probing them with a rabbit anti-ERK or rabbit anti-Akt antibody (both from Cell Signaling Technology). To evaluate the effects of PD98059, p38 MAPK inhibitor, or wortmannin (all from Calbiochem) upon the phosphorylation levels of ERK, p38, and PI3K/Akt, respectively, cells were cultured in the presence of 2% fetal calf serum (to mimic the conditions used for proliferation; see above) with 10 μm indomethacin and the different inhibitors mentioned above in the presence or absence of PGE2 or PGE1-OH. Four days later, cells lysates were prepared and analyzed as indicated above. Levels of p38 phosphorylation were detected by using a rabbit anti-phospho p38 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). COX expression in the CT26 or YAMC cell lysates (50 μg of protein/lane) was analyzed as above by using either a rabbit anti-COX2 (Cayman Chemicals) or a goat anti-COX1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CT26 Cells Biosynthesize PGE2—To explore the enzymology of AA metabolism by CT26 cells, we incubated the cells with radiolabeled AA and compared their AA metabolite profiles with those generated by cultured YAMC cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, although YAMC do not metabolize exogenous AA, CT26 cells actively oxidized the fatty acid to a product (98% of total metabolism) with the high performance liquid chromatography retention time of authentic PGE2 (16.5 min). Subsequent chromatographic and GC/MS analyses confirmed that CT26 cells metabolized AA to PGE2 (19 ± 5 nmol/min/mg of cell protein) as the only detectable product (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of both COX1 and COX2 in lysates isolated from CT26 cells, whereas only COX1 was clearly evident in YAMC cells (Fig. 1B). It is interesting that despite similar levels of COX1 expression in these two cell types, YAMC are unable to support prostanoid biosynthesis (Fig. 1B). The fact that most of the AA is recovered (Fig. 1A) indicates that in non-tumorigenic YAMC cells, COX activity is under the control of additional, yet to be characterized regulatory mechanisms. To dissect the roles of COX1 and COX2 in PGE2 formation by CT26 cells, we incubated them with AA in the presence of either a nonspecific COX inhibitor (indomethacin) or a COX1-specific (SC560) or COX2-specific (NS398) inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 1C, 10 μm indomethacin blocked all cellular AA oxidation and PGE2 biosynthesis almost completely. On the other hand, only partial inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis was achieved at 5 μm SC560 and 10 μm NS398 (70 and 85% inhibition, respectively), and the extent of inhibition did not increase with higher doses. All three inhibitors blocked AA metabolism and PGE2 formation without changing the metabolite profile of the enzyme (Fig. 1C). These results show that in CT26 cells, COX1 and COX2 are capable of metabolizing added AA to PGE2. To determine whether CT26 cells metabolize endogenous pools of AA and the role of the COX isoforms in PGE2 formation, we quantified (by GC/MS) the levels of endogenous PGE2 in CT26 cells. In the absence of external stimuli, CT26 cells produce significant amounts of PGE2 (58.54 ± 2.9 ng/mg of total protein, n = 10), most of which is secreted into the media (>90% of the total). Endogenous PGE2 synthesis is inhibited by 10 μm indomethacin (7.5 ± 0.9 ng/mg total protein, n = 8), 5 μm NS398 (14.95 ± 1.5 ng/mg total protein, n = 5), or 5 μm SC560 (16.1 ± 3.3 ng/mg total protein, n = 5). PGE2 Induces CT26 Cell Growth—Because PGE2 has been implicated in cell survival (17Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hwang H.J. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and CT26 cells generate high levels of PGE2 (Fig. 1A), we determined the effect of COX inhibitors on cell proliferation. All three COX inhibitors decreased CT26 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A-C), with maximal inhibition obtained between 5-10 μm SC560 or NS398 and 5-20 μm indomethacin, all doses shown to block PGE2 formation (Fig. 1C). Thus, growth of CT26 cells is equally sensitive to COX1 or COX2 inhibition, and the source of PGE2 is not a determining factor for its mitogenic activity. To determine whether exogenous PGE2 could rescue the cells from COX inhibition, CT26 cells were grown in the presence of 10 μm indomethacin, 5 μm SC560, or 5 μm NS398 added alone or in combination with PGE2 (ranging from 0 to 5 μm) (Fig. 2, D-F). Exogenous PGE2 rescued the growth of cells treated with the COX inhibitors to the levels observed in cells exposed to PGE2 alone, demonstrating that PGE2 formation was sufficient to rescue cell proliferation and that COX was the target for the inhibitors. The lack of a PGE2 effect upon the growth of cells incubated in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 2, D-F) suggested that its endogenous levels are sufficient to support growth under steady-state conditions. To determine the selectivity of the PGE2 mitogenic activity, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm indomethacin together with PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, PGJ2, or cicaprost (a prostacyclin receptor agonist) (1 μm each), and their ability to rescue cell growth from COX inhibition was evaluated. Only PGE2 restored proliferation in indomethacin-treated cells to levels similar to those of untreated controls (Fig. 3A), showing that its effects were selective. CT26 Cell Growth Is Associated with EP4 Receptor-mediated Akt/ERK Activation—Many of the cellular functions of PGE2 are mediated by a family of G protein-coupled receptors, namely EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (18Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), of which CT26 cells express the EP1, EP2, and EP4 subtypes (Fig. 3B). To characterize the role of these receptors in PGE2-induced mitogenesis, cells were incubated with 10 μm indomethacin, and the ability of PGE2, sulprostone (an EP1 and EP3 agonist), butaprost (an EP2 agonist), or PGE1-OH (an EP4 agonist) (1 μm each) to rescue proliferation from COX inhibition was evaluated. Only PGE1-OH mimicked PGE2 in restoring cell growth to levels similar to those of indomethacin-free controls (Fig. 3C), indicating that the EP4 receptor mediates the effects of PGE2. To characterize the EP4-mediated signaling pathways involved in the PGE2 mitogenic activity, we determined the effects of PGE2 on intracellular levels of cAMP, known to increase after EP2 and/or EP4 activation (18Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, caused nearly 3-fold increases in cAMP levels when compared with untreated cells, but no significant changes were observed with PGE2, PGE1-OH, or butaprost (Fig. 4A). It has been proposed that PGE2 stimulation of the EP4 receptors leads to phosphorylation of ERK through a PI3K-dependent mechanism (19Fujino H. Xu W. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12151-12156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For this reason, we determined the ability of PGE2 and PGE1-OH to activate these two kinases in CT26 cells. Incubation of cells with PGE2 (1 μm) markedly increased ERK and Akt (a PI3K substrate) phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Similarly, phosphorylation of these two kinases was also observed after treatment with PGE1-OH, but not butaprost (used as the negative control), indicating that the EP4 receptor mediates the effects of PGE2. In addition, our data parallels the finding that phosphorylation of Akt is observed in CT26 cells after PGE2 stimulation (20Yasumaru M. Tsuji S. Tsujii M. Irie T. Komori M. Kimura A. Nishida T. Kakiuchi Y. Kawai N. Murata H. Horimoto M. Sasaki Y. Hayashi N. Kawano S. Hori M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6726-6734PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the EP4-mediated phosphorylation of PI3K/ERK was necessary to support CT26 cell proliferation, cells were incubated with 10 μm indomethacin in the presence of PD98059 (a MEK1/ERK inhibitor), wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor), and a p38 MAPK inhibitor (used as the negative control), and the ability of PGE2 or PGE1-OH (1 μm each) to rescue cell proliferation was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4C, neither PGE2 nor PGE1-OH was able to rescue the proliferation of indomethacin-treated CT26 cells when the ERK or PI3K pathways were inhibited. In contrast, both prostanoids were able to rescue indomethacin-treated cells cultured in the presence of a p38 kinase inhibitor (Fig. 4C) or PKA or PKC inhibitors (not shown), suggesting that these kinases are not involved in the EP4-mediated cell proliferation. Cell lysates derived from cells incubated as described above were analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4D, phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, or p38 was completely inhibited after the addition of the specific inhibitors, and no changes in phosphorylation were observed after the addition of PGE2 or PGE1-OH. Effects of COX Inhibition on Tumor Growth—It has been shown recently that CT26-derived tumors express both COX1 and COX2 (20Yasumaru M. Tsuji S. Tsujii M. Irie T. Komori M. Kimura A. Nishida T. Kakiuchi Y. Kawai N. Murata H. Horimoto M. Sasaki Y. Hayashi N. Kawano S. Hori M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6726-6734PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they could be sensitive to both COX1- and/or COX2-specific inhibition. For this reason, we determined the effects of COX inhibition on the size and number of tumors derived from the injection of CT26 cells in BALB/c mice (13Pozzi A. LeVine W.F. Gardner H.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mice were treated at the time of cell injection or 1 week after cell injection with indomethacin (Fig. 5A), and tumor growth was compared with untreated control mice. Mice were sacrificed 14 days after cell injection, and tumor number and volume were evaluated. Indomethacin caused dramatic decreases in tumor number (Fig. 5B) and volume (Fig. 5C), and its anti-tumorigenic effects appeared to be independent of the time of treatment initiation (Fig. 5, B and C). Indomethacin, administered 1 week after tumor cell injection, arrested tumor growth at levels similar to those observed in control mice sacrificed 1 week after tumor cell injection (not shown). Thus, depending upon the time of treatment initiation, indomethacin can both prevent tumor uptake and development and inhibit tumor growth. To determine whether the effects of indomethacin on tumor growth correlated with COX inhibition and a resultant decrease in PGE2 levels, endogenous PGE2 levels in tumors from untreated or indomethacin-treated mice were evaluated by GC/MS. Indomethacin treatment caused dramatic reductions in tumor PGE2 levels, thus providing a strong demonstration of a direct link between the biological response to the inhibitor, reductions in COX activity, and PGE2 biosynthesis (Fig. 5D). To identify the COX isoform involved in tumor growth, tumor-bearing mice were treated with SC560 or NS398 using a protoc"

Regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel by Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 is mediated via interactions between the PY motifs of the epithelial sodium channel subunits and the Nedd4/Nedd4-2 WW domains. This example serves as a model for the regulation of other PY motif-containing ion channels by Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. We found that the carboxyl termini of the six voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels contain typical PY motifs (PPXY), and a further Nav contains a PY motif variant (LPXY). Not only did we demonstrate by Far-Western analysis that Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 interact with the PY motif-containing Nav channels, but we also showed that these channels have conserved WW domain binding specificity. We further showed that the carboxyl termini fusion proteins of one central nervous system and one peripheral nervous system-derived Na+ channel (Nav1.2 and Nav1.7, respectively) are readily ubiquitinated by Nedd4-2. In Xenopus oocytes, Nedd4-2 strongly inhibited the activities of all three Navs (Nav1.2, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8) tested. Interestingly, Nedd4 suppressed the activity of Nav1.2 and Nav1.7 but was a poor inhibitor of Nav1.8.

Voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) 1The abbreviations used are: Nav(s), voltage-gated sodium channel(s); ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; PY motif, PPXY sequence; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride.1The abbreviations used are: Nav(s), voltage-gated sodium channel(s); ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; PY motif, PPXY sequence; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride. are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials in electrically excitable cells. These channels mediate the influx of Na+ ions in response to local depolarizing stimuli and thus play key roles in regulating excitation, secretion, and contraction (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Nav channel activity is crucial for the plasticity and development of the nervous system and the maintenance of excitability following nerve and tissue injury (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Nav channels are composed of a pore-forming α-subunit (∼260 kDa) associated with one or more auxiliary β-subunits (∼35 kDa) (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). The α-subunits are able to form functional channels, whereas the β-subunits modulate the biophysical properties of the α-subunit (2Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; (http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/3/207)Google Scholar). Nine mammalian Nav channel α-subunit genes have been characterized with distinct tissue-specific expression and electrophysiological properties (3Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L. Caldwell J.H. Hofmann F.

Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 are primarily found in the central nervous system; Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 are predominant in the peripheral nervous system, and skeletal and cardiac muscle cells express Nav1.4 and Nav1.5, respectively (3Goldin A.L.

The importance of normal Nav channel activity is evident from hereditary channel mutations that result in epilepsy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and many other diseases (2Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; (http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/3/207)Google Scholar).Although it is known that trafficking and recycling is critical for the regulation of numerous ion channels, little is known about the regulation of Nav channels by this mechanism. It is well established that members of the Nedd4-family of ubiquitin-protein ligases (4Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The Nedd4 family of proteins is composed of an amino-terminal Ca2+/phospholipid binding domain, a carboxyl-terminal catalytic HECT domain, and multiple WW domains (protein-protein interaction modules) (6Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Specific WW domains of Nedd4 proteins interact with PY motifs in the carboxyl termini of ENaC subunits to facilitate channel ubiquitination and down-regulation (10Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P.

In Liddle's syndrome, a hereditary form of hypertension, deletions/mutations in ENaC PY motifs preclude normal interactions with Nedd4 family WW domains, thereby resulting in elevated Na+ channel activity (7Staub O.

Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Interestingly, several Nav channel family members have a highly conserved PY motif in the carboxyl termini of their α-subunits. There has, however, been only one report on the regulation ofaNav channel (the cardiac channel Nav1.5) by Nedd4 (14Abriel H. Kamynina E. Horisberger J.-D. Staub O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This study, performed in Xenopus oocytes, showed that Nedd4 reduced Na+ currents mediated by Nav1.5, an effect that was not observed when the PY motif was mutated (14Abriel H. Kamynina E. Horisberger J.-D. Staub O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, a direct physical interaction of Nedd4 and Nav1.5 was not demonstrated. To date, there are no reports of the regulation of neuronal Nav channels by the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. In the present study, we identify Nav channel α-subunits that contain intracellular PY motifs and examine their ability to interact with Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. We show that all PY motifs containing Nav channels can bind specific WW domains in Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. Furthermore, two representative Nav channels were tested and found to be ubiquitinated in vitro by Nedd4-2. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes with Nav channel α-subunits, Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 were found to down-regulate the depolarization-activated Na+ currents.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Expression Plasmids—The Nav channel carboxyl-terminal region-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs were generated as follows. The carboxyl termini were PCR-amplified from mouse brain cDNA (Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6), mouse day 18 embryo cDNA (Nav1.5 and Nav1.7), and mouse dorsal root ganglion cDNA (Nav1.8) (donated by A. Stokowski) and cloned into either the BamHI or BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). The number of carboxyl-terminal residues present in the various Nav-GST fusion proteins are as follows: Nav1.1, 64; Nav1.2, 66; Nav1.3, 62; Nav1.5, 72; Nav1.6, 57; Nav1.7, 64; and Nav1.8, 81. A construct containing mouse Nedd4-2 (ΔC2,WW1,WW2) was generated by PCR amplification from mouse Nedd4-2 cDNA followed by cloning into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2TK. A catalytically inactive Cys mutant of Nedd4-2 (ΔC2,WW1,WW2) was produced by PCR mutagenesis. Constructs containing mouse Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 WW domains and carboxyl termini of α, β, and γENaC in pGEX2TK have been described previously (10Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N.

Weissman (NCI, National Institutes of Health).Production of GST Fusion Proteins—Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 star (DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) harboring the Nedd4-2 (ΔC2,WW1,WW2) or Nedd4-2 (ΔC2,WW1,WW2) Cys mutant GST expression plasmids were diluted 1:25, grown to log phase at 22 °C, and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 22 °C. All other GST fusion proteins were grown similarly but at 37 °C. Following induction, GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (10Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were measured using a BCA kit (Pierce) and Coomassie Blue staining following separation by SDS-PAGE.SDS-PAGE and Far-Western Analysis—32P-labeled protein probes were produced by directly labeling the appropriate GST fusion protein using protein kinase A (New England Biolabs) as described previously (15Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For Far-Western analysis, ∼2 μg of each GST fusion protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked in Hyb75 and then hybridized with the appropriate 32P-labeled protein probes for 4 h at 4 °C in Hyb75 as described (15Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed four times in Hyb75 and visualized by autoradiography. Band intensities were analyzed semi-quantitatively using ImageQuant Version 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Far-Western binding intensities were measured against background probe hybridization levels except for bands representing the wild type individual WW domains, which were measured relative to the nonspecific binding of the corresponding mutant WW domains. To normalize binding intensities within individual Far-Western blots, these values were divided by the intensity of corresponding Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands and expressed in arbitrary units.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Carboxyl-terminal Nav1.2 and Nav1.7 GST fusion proteins and GST alone were 32P-labeled by protein kinase A as described above. 32P-labeled proteins were incubated with 750 ng of purified Nedd4 (amino acids 52–777), GST, Nedd4-2 (ΔC2,WW1,WW2), or the Nedd4-2 (ΔC2,WW1,WW2) Cys mutant in the presence of rabbit E1 (150 ng) and UbcH5b (300 ng) (both from Boston Biochem Inc.) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 500 μm dithiothreitol, and 500 ng/μl bovine ubiquitin (Sigma) for 2 h at 30 °C. 15-μl reactions were stopped by the addition of a reducing sample buffer containing SDS, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography.Electrophysiological Recording of Nav Channel α-Subunit-mediated Currents in Xenopus Oocytes—Capped RNA transcripts encoding full-length α-subunits of human Nav1.8 (a gift of R. Lewis, University of Queensland, and R. Drinkwater, Xenome Inc., Brisbane, Australia), the human Nav1.8 PY mutant, rat Nav1.7 (a gift of G. Mandel, State University of New York), rat Nav1.2 (a gift of A. Goldin, University of California), Nedd4, and Nedd4-2 and the ligase-defective Cys mutants of these ligases were synthesized using a mMESSAGE mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). To disrupt the PY motif of Nav1.8 (PPSY), Tyr-1921 was mutated to an Ala (Y1921A) using standard PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). Xenopus laevis stage V-VI oocytes were removed and treated with collagenase (Sigma type I) for defolliculation. The oocytes were then injected with combinations of the cRNA of the Nav channel (2 ng/cell) with the Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 cRNAs (10 ng/oocyte). The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm pyruvic acid, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.5) prior to recording. Three days after cRNA injection, whole cell Na+ channel currents were recorded from oocytes using the two-electrode (virtual ground circuit) voltage clamp technique. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and typically had resistances of 0.3–1.5 megohms. All recordings were made at room temperature (20–23 °C) using bath solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with NaOH. During recording, oocytes were perfused continuously at a rate of ∼1.5 ml/min. Using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments Inc, Union City, CA), data were low pass filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and leak-subtracted on-line using a -P/6 protocol and analyzed off-line. Initially, inward Na+ currents were generated by holding the cells at –70 mV and applying step depolarizations to membrane potentials from –50 mV to +50 mV. Inward Na+ currents were evoked with 100-ms depolarizing pulses at 10-s intervals to +20 mV (Nav1.8) and 0 mV (Nav1.7 and Nav1.2) from a holding potential of –70 mV.RESULTSSeveral Nav Channels Contain PY motifs in Their Carboxylterminal Regions—We analyzed amino acid sequences of mouse Nav channel α-subunits to identify PY motif-containing channels. Conserved PY motifs conforming to the PPXY consensus were identified in both human and mouse Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.5, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8. Nav1.6 was found to contain a PY motif variant (LPXY) that has been shown to act as a ligand for Nedd4 WW domains (16Kasanov J. Pirozzi G. Uveges A.J. Kay B.K. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and represents a previously unidentified PY motif-containing Nav channel. Nav1.4 and Nav1.9 do not contain PY motifs. An alignment of Nav channel PY motif regions revealed a high degree of homology (Fig. 1A), suggesting that they may share similar WW domain binding specificity. Outside the PY motif itself, the homology between the PY motif-containing regions of the three ENaC subunits and the various Nav α-subunits was limited (Fig. 1A).Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 WW Domains Interact With the Carboxyl Termini of Seven Nav Channels—To investigate whether interactions occur between PY motif-containing Nav channels and Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 WW domains, a Far-Western approach was employed. The carboxyl termini of PY motif-containing Nav channels were cloned from mouse cDNA and expressed as GST fusion proteins. Equal amounts of affinity-purified GST-Nav proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, immobilized on PVDF membranes, and then probed with 32P-labeled Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 proteins containing their entire WW domain regions. Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 proteins interacted with all of the seven Nav proteins tested to varying degrees but not with GST alone (Fig. 1B). Differences in affinity toward individual Nav proteins were similar for both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 probes; in each case the binding of Nav1.1, Nav1.6, or Nav1.7 was 30–50% weaker than that of the other Nav proteins (Fig. 1B). This was reproducible and was verified by semi-quantitative binding analysis. 2A. B. Fotia and S. Kumar, unpublished data. As expected, both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 WW domain-GST fusion proteins bound the PY motif containing ENaC subunits. It has been suggested that an extended PY motif containing a leucine residue three positions carboxyl to the tyrosine residue (PPXYXXL) is a requirement for ENaC subunits to interact properly with Nedd4 WW domains (17Henry P.C. Kanelis V. O'Brien M.C. Kim B. Gautschi I. Forman-Kay J. Schild L. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20019-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present work, we found that Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 WW domains interact with Nav PY motifs that each have a valine residue in this position. This discovery, taken together with the finding that Nav1.6, which has an LPXY motif (Fig. 1A), can bind Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 WW domains suggests that an extended consensus sequence of (L/P)PXYXX(L/V) in Na+ channels is recognized by Nedd4 family WW domains.The Nav Channel PY Motifs Have Conserved WW Domain Binding Specificity—Previous studies have shown that interactions between ENaC and Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 are mediated by specific WW domains (10Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Fotia A.B.

WW2 and WW3 of mouse Nedd4 (WW2, WW3, and WW4 of human Nedd4) and WW3 and WW4 of Nedd4-2 interact with each ENaC subunit in a PY motif-WW domain-specific manner in vitro (10Harvey K.F. Dinudom A.

To test which Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 WW domains mediate interactions with Nav proteins, GST fusion proteins containing wild type and mutated individual WW domains of mouse Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 were generated. Equal amounts of the affinity-purified GST-WW domain proteins were immobilized on PVDF membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE and then probed with the 32P-labeled carboxyl termini of PY motif-containing Nav proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, proteins containing the entire WW domain region of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 both interacted with each Nav protein tested. However, binding was consistently stronger between the Nav protein and Nedd4-2 than with Nedd4. Semiquantitative binding analysis using ImageQuant software indicated that Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8 binding to Nedd4-2 WW domains was at least 2-fold stronger than to Nedd4 WW domains, whereas binding differences were less pronounced for Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3 (data not shown).Fig. 2All PY motif-containing Nav carboxyl termini interact with WW2 and WW3 of Nedd4 and WW3 and WW4 of Nedd4-2. Far-Western analysis of binding between individual WW domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 and Nav carboxyl termini is shown. Approximately 2 μg of each affinity-purified GST-WW fusion protein was separated by SDS-PAGE.

Molecular mass markers in kilodaltons are indicated on the left-hand side of gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Strikingly, all seven Nav proteins were repeatedly found to bind the same WW domains, namely WW2 and WW3 of mouse Nedd4 and WW3 and WW4 of Nedd4-2, but did not bind the inactive mutants of each of these domains (Fig. 2). This binding pattern is not restricted to the Nav proteins tested but is also seen with ENaC subunits (10Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting a strong conservation of mechanism for Nedd4- and Nedd4-2-mediated regulation of sodium and perhaps other ion channels. Further analysis of the binding data showed that the Nedd4 WW2 domain binding was slightly stronger than the Nedd4 WW3 binding with all Nav channel α-subunits except Nav1.6, which showed stronger binding to WW3. The Nedd4-2 WW3 and WW4 domains bound to essentially the same degree with Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.3; however, for Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8 the Nedd4-2 WW3 domain showed 20–45% stronger binding than did the Nedd4-2 WW4 domain (data not shown).Nedd4-2 Ubiquitinates Nav1.2 and Nav1.7 Carboxyl Termini in Vitro—The regulation of Nav channels by Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 potentially occurs by ubiquitination followed by degradation. PY motif-containing Nav channel α-subunits are generally lysine-rich at their intracellular carboxyl termini, indicating possible targets for ubiquitin conjugation. An in vitro ubiquitination assay was used to test this possibility. We incubated 32P-labeled carboxyl-terminal GST fusions of Nav1.2, a central nervous system-specific channel, and Nav1.7, a peripheral nervous system-specific channel, with catalytically active recombinant Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 proteins in a ubiquitination buffer. Because of difficulties in expressing full-length Nedd4-2, a truncated form of protein containing the WW3, WW4, and HECT domains was used. This protein contains the ligand (Nav and ENaC) and E2 binding regions and the catalytic domain. In the presence of Nedd4-2, higher molecular mass bands representing ubiquitinated forms were observed for both Nav proteins (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of Nedd4 the ubiquitinated forms of Nav1.2 and Nav1.7 were barely detectable (Fig. 3). GST alone or a mutated Nedd4-2 protein lacking ubiquitin-protein ligase activity had no effect (Fig. 3). These data indicate that Nedd4-2-mediated regulation of Navs may occur via ubiquitination at the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region. Given that Nedd4 had only a weak ubiquitination effect on Nav1.2 or Nav1.7, Nedd4-mediated regulation of Nav channels may occur by either ubiquitination elsewhere within the Nav channel α-subunit or by some other mechanism. In separate assays with a known Nedd4 substrate, purified Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 proteins had equivalent ubiquitin-protein ligase activities.2 Other lysine-rich regions exist in some Nav channels, which may serve as targets of ubiquitination by Nedd4. Because of the inherent difficulties in expressing full-length Nav channel α-subunits, attempts to produce larger Nav proteins containing additional lysine-rich regions for ubiquitination assays were unsuccessful.Fig. 3Nedd4-2 ubiquitinates GST-Nav 1.2 and GST-Nav1.7 carboxyl termini in vitro. 32P-labeled Nav1.2 and Nav1.7 carboxyl-terminal GST fusion were incubated in reactions proteins containing E1, E2 (UbcH5b), ubiquitin, and ATP with or without Nedd4, GST, Nedd4-2, or the Nedd4-2 Cys mutant (mut), as indicated, followed by SDS-PAGE. In the presence of Nedd4-2, higher molecular weight bands (indicated) accompany Nav1.2 and Nav1.7 proteins representing ubiquitinated species. In the presence of Nedd4, at least one higher molecular weight band (arrow) is observed above the Nav1.2 and Nav1.7 proteins. No ubiquitination of the Nav1.2 or Nav1.7 channel occurs when GST or the Nedd4-2 Cys mutant are used in place of Nedd4 or Nedd4-2, nor does ubiquitination of GST alone occur under any condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of Nedd4/4–2 on Nav Channel α-Subunit-mediated Na+ Currents in Oocytes—Xenopus oocytes were used to investigate the effects of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 on depolarization-activated Na+ currents mediated by representative central nervous system and peripheral nervous system Nav channels. Control oocytes expressed only the cRNA for the corresponding Nav α-subunits. We observed that the expression of Nedd4 had differential effects on the Na+ currents mediated by the various Nav channel α-subunits. Nedd4 had no effect on the peak Na+ current amplitudes mediated by Nav1.8 (105.4 ± 10.7%; n = 20) (Figs. 4 and 5). Increasing the amount of Nedd4 cRNA injected per oocyte to 50 ng also had no effect on Na+ current amplitude (data not shown). However, when Nedd4 was coexpressed with Nav1.7, we observed a significant reduction in the peak Na+ current amplitudes to 35.8 ± 6.2% (n = 20; p < 0.001) of control current. Furthermore, Nedd4 had an equally pronounced effect on Nav1.2, reducing the Na+ current amplitude to 36.2 ± 3.9% (n = 22; p < 0.001) of control current (Figs. 4 and 5). A catalytically inactive Cys mutant of Nedd4 had no significant effect on Na+ current amplitudes mediated by Nav1.2 (100.9 ± 4.5%; n = 20), Nav1.7 (100.4 ± 4.3%; n = 20), or Nav1.8 (102.3 ± 9.9%; n = 15) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effects of Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Nedd4/Nedd4-2 Cys mutants on peak Na+ current amplitude.

The monoclonal antibody (clone L4) that binds to the extracellular domain of wild type P2X7 and blocks P2X7 function failed to bind to the R307Q mutant receptor. Differentiation of monocytes to macrophages up-regulated P2X7 function in cells heterozygous for the R307Q to a value 10–40% of that for wild type macrophages. However, macrophages from a subject who was double heterozygous for R307Q/I568N remained totally non-functional for P2X7, and lymphocytes from the same subject also lacked ATP-stimulated phospholipase D activity. These data identify a third loss-of-function polymorphism affecting the human P2X7 receptor, and since the affected Arg307 is homologous to those amino acids essential for ATP binding to P2X1 and P2X2, it is likely that this polymorphism abolishes the binding of ATP to the extracellular domain of P2X7.

The P2X7 ionic channel opened by extracellular ATP shows strong selectivity for the divalent cations Ca2+ and Ba2+ over monovalent cations (6Bretschneider F. Klapperstuck M. Lohn M. Markwardt F. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 691-698Google Scholar, 7Naumov A.P. Kaznacheyeva E.V. Kiselyov K.I. Kuryshev Y.A. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. J. Physiol. 1995; 486: 323-337Google Scholar). After immediate (<1s) channel opening, in the presence of agonist, a second permeability state develops that allows larger organic cations to pass, a process termed “pore” formation (8Tatham P.E. Lindau M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 459-476Google Scholar, 9Wiley J.S. Gargett C.E. Zhang W. Snook M.B. Jamieson G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 44: C1224-C1231Google Scholar, 10Nuttle L.C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13988-13996Google Scholar). This larger permeability state allows permeation by the ethidium+ cation (314 Da) or YO-PRO-12+ (375 Da) but excludes passage of propidium2+ (414 Da) into lymphocytes (11Wiley J.S. Chen R. Jamieson G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 54-60Google Scholar) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (12Sluyter R. Wiley J.S. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 1415-1421Google Scholar).

Physiol. 1996; 166: 637-642Google Scholar, 19Gu B. Bendall L.J. Wiley J.S. Blood. 1998; 92: 946-951Google Scholar). P2X receptors have an oligomeric structure in the plasma membrane based on trimeric or larger complexes of identical subunits (20Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Google Scholar, 21Kim M. Spelta V. Sim J. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23262-23267Google Scholar). Moreover the values of Hill coefficients derived from the sigmoid ATP dose-response curves of the P2X7(P2Z) receptor are consistent with multiple ATP-binding sites in each P2X7 trimer (8Tatham P.E. Lindau M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 459-476Google Scholar, 22Wiley J.S. Chen R. Wiley M.J. Jamieson G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 411-418Google Scholar, 23Klapperstuck M. Buttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 25-35Google Scholar). All seven members of the P2X receptor family have two transmembrane domains with intracellular amino and carboxyl termini. Little is known of the conformation of the extracellular domain containing the ATP-binding site(s). An analysis of the P2X subtype sequence homology has shown that the two transmembrane domains M1 and M2 are separated by an extracellular sequence containing a cysteine-rich region (residues 110–170) followed by a segment from Phe188–Val321 that may form six antiparallel β-pleated sheets homologous with members of the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (24Freist W. Verhey J.F. Stuhmer W. Gauss D.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 61-65Google Scholar). The ATP-binding site is very likely to lie in this β-sheet region since two positively charged residues, Lys193 and Lys311, have been identified as being associated with the ATP-binding site (25Worthington R.A. Smart M.L. Gu B.J. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Wiley J.S. Barden J.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 43-46Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that genetic factors play a role in the functional phenotype of the P2X7 receptor. In around 20% of the population, a Glu496 to Ala polymorphism (1513A→C), which is located in an ankyrin repeat motif of the carboxyl terminus of P2X7 receptor (26Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Sommer J.A. Watters J.J. Prabhu U. Dubyak G.R. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1871-1876Google Scholar), leads to loss of function in homozygous individuals and ∼50% reduction in heterozygous individuals (27Gu B.J. Zhang W. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Google Scholar). A second polymorphism, Ile568 to Asn (1729T→A), lies in a trafficking motif of the carboxyl terminus (28Smart M.L. Gu B. Panchal R.G. Wiley J. Cromer B. Williams D.A. Petrou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8853-8860Google Scholar) and prevents normal trafficking and surface expression of this receptor (29Wiley J.S. Dao-Ung L.-P. Li C. Shemon A.N. Gu B.J. Smart M.L. Fuller S.J. Barden J.A. Petrou S. Sluyter R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17108-17113Google Scholar). In this study, we report a third polymorphism within exon 9 of the human P2RX7 gene that changes Arg307 to an uncharged glutamine at the homologous position to Arg305 in P2X1 and Arg304 in P2X2, both of which are essential for the binding of ATP and activation of these receptors (30Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Google Scholar, 31Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Google Scholar). Cells carrying the Arg307 to Gln polymorphism have reduced or absent P2X7 function due to the failure of ATP binding to the extracellular domain of P2X7.

Sheep anti-human P2X7 polyclonal antibody against a non-homologous extracellular epitope of the human P2X7 receptor has been described previously (29Wiley J.S. Dao-Ung L.-P. Li C. Shemon A.N. Gu B.J. Smart M.L. Fuller S.J. Barden J.A. Petrou S. Sluyter R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17108-17113Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-rat P2X7 polyclonal antibody cross-reacting with human P2X7 has also been described previously (34Sluyter R. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 231-236Google Scholar). The Mini-Complete protease inhibitor mixture and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Roche Applied Science. The SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit was from Pierce. Source of Human Leukocytes—Peripheral blood was collected and diluted with an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium. Mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque, washed once in RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended in HEPES-buffered NaCl medium (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mmd-glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2 or RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml gentamycin (complete RPMI 1640 medium). For the generation of macrophages, the mononuclear cell preparation in complete RPMI 1640 medium was incubated for 2 h in plastic flasks and then gently washed to remove non-adherent cells. The plastic-adherent monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by culturing for 7 days in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Macrophages were activated by adding 100 units/ml interferon-γ in the final 24 h of culture before harvesting by mechanical scraping for flow cytometric analysis. 86Rb+ Efflux Measurements—Lymphocytes (2.5 × 107/ml) were loaded with 86RbCl (5 μCi/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered NaCl medium containing 10 μm CaCl2. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold, isotope-free NaCl medium. Cells were resuspended at 5 × 106/ml in HEPES-buffered KCl medium (150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm d-glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5); 1 ml was lysed with 20 μl of Triton X-100 and used to determine the total amount of cellular 86Rb+. 86Rb+-loaded cells (4.5 ml) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before the addition of 1.0 mm ATP for 4 min. Samples (1.0 ml) were removed at 1-min intervals, overlaid onto 0.3 ml of phthalate oil mixture, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 40 s. The upper layer (0.7 ml) from each tube and 0.7 ml from lysates were removed, and the amount of radioactivity was detected by Cerenkov counting. Ba2+ Influx Measurements—Mononuclear cells (4 × 106) were incubated with Fura Red (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered NaCl medium. Cells were then washed once and labeled with appropriate FITC-conjugated anti-CD mAbs for 15 min. Cells were washed once and resuspended in 1.0 ml of HEPES-buffered KCl medium at 37 °C. All samples were stirred and temperature-controlled at 37 °C using a Time Zero module (Cytek, Fremont, CA). BaCl2 (1.0 mm) was added followed 40 s later by addition of 1.0 mm ATP. Cells were analyzed at 2,000 events/s on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and were gated by forward and side scatter and by cell type-specific antibodies. The linear mean channel of fluorescence intensity (0–1023 channel) for each gated subpopulation over successive 2-s intervals was analyzed by WinMDI software (Joseph Trotter, version 2.7) and plotted against time. Ethidium+ Influx Measurement—Cells (2 × 106) prelabeled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD mAb were washed once and resuspended in 1.0 ml of HEPES-buffered KCl medium at 37 °C. All samples were stirred and temperature-controlled at 37 °C using a Time Zero module. Ethidium+ (25 μm) was added followed 40 s later by addition of 1.0 mm ATP. Cells were analyzed at 1,000 events/s on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and were gated by forward and side scatter and by cell type-specific antibodies. The linear mean channel of fluorescence intensity (0–255 channel) for each gated subpopulation over successive 5-s intervals was analyzed by WinMDI software and plotted against time. Due to the increased P2X7 function on macrophages, ethidium+ uptake in these cells (see Fig. 11) was acquired at a reduced voltage setting for FL-2 (ethidium+ fluorescence) as described previously (29Wiley J.S. Dao-Ung L.-P. Li C. Shemon A.N. Gu B.J. Smart M.L. Fuller S.J. Barden J.A. Petrou S. Sluyter R. J. Biol.

Monocyte-derived macrophages (activated with interferon-γ) from a wild type subject or R307Q heterozygotes (see Table II) were labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 mAb and suspended in KCl medium at 37 °C. Ethidium+ (25 μm) was added followed 40 s later by the addition of 1 mm ATP (arrow). The mean channel of cell-associated fluorescence was measured by time-resolved flow cytometry. The voltage setting for ethidium was reduced to gain full scale of uptake increase. Basal ethidium+ uptake measured in the absence of ATP is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PLD Assay—B lymphocytes (1 × 107 cells/ml) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing [3H]oleic acid (2–5 μCi/ml). Labeled cells were resuspended in KCl medium and preincubated for 5 min in the presence of the primary alcohol 1-butanol (30 mm), which yields a stable phosphatidylalcohol end product following PLD stimulation. The cells were then incubated in the presence of ATP (0.5 mm) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.1 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Membrane lipids were extracted, and the level of phosphatidylbutanol was determined as described previously (17Gargett C.E. Cornish E.J. Wiley J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 529-535Google Scholar). DNA Extraction—Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR and DNA Sequencing of PCR Products—Twelve primer pairs were designed to amplify the 13 exons of human P2RX7 gene from genomic DNA (GenBank™ accession number NT_009775.8) (Table I). These oligonucleotides were designed by using Primer3 2See www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi. and synthesized by PROLIGO (Sydney, Australia). PCR amplifications (39 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 or 55 °C for 20 or 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s) produced 12 fragments of the expected size. PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Amplified PCR products were purified using the GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit. Using the AmpliTaq FS dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), a fluorescence-based cycle sequencing reaction was performed to sequence the PCR products of P2X7 directly from both ends using specific primers. Sequencing electrophoresis was carried out on the ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer and analyzed using ABI PRISM sequencing analysis software (version 3.0) at the SUPAMAC Facility, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney, Australia).Table IPrimers used to screen the P2RX7 gene (GenBank™ accession NT_009775.8)RegionForward primer (5′ → 3′)Reverse primer (5′ → 3′)Product sizebpExon 1tcagaatgtgcacctgaagcccagtacgtttcattttgcag315Exon 2ggctgtagatcctaggggaagagtcacacggaagcaagtca379Exon 3gtccgcatttctgcttcttccccagcaagctggattatta230Exon 4tgacctgggcatcacaaatgtgtgcacattctggtggat241Exon 5taggacccaggactttgcagcgggttgagttaatgatgtcc299Exon 6ttcaggcttctgaggtttggagaagcctctggtcccactg239Exon 7gcctcttggctgtttgacattggaacctctccaccacact300Exon 8gttgccttggaaaccaaaatctatgcagggagatgtctgg300Exon 9gccccacagcagtaattagggctgcagtgagtggtaatcct279Exons 10 and 11tagaacccagcgacgtatccccaacaattgcacgttgaag499Exon 12ggggcataaaagggactccttgagccagcttgttcaatagtc399Exon 13cagacgtgagccacggtgcgaacctagaacctgagggct579 Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis—The full-length clone of human P2X7 (GenBank™ accession number Y09561) was used in these studies. hP2X7 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Gary Buell as a NotI-NotI insert in pcDNA3. hP2X7 was removed from pcDNA3 using a NotI-NotI digest and ligated into pCI, which is a cytomegalovirus-driven mammalian expression vector. Mutated 946G→A was introduced using overlap PCR (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit) and the expression vector pCI-hP2X7 as a template. The P2RX7 point mutation was constructed using a pair of complementary mutagenic primers described below consisting of the mutagenic codon flanked by sequences homologous to the wild type strand of the template. After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI, intact mutation-containing synthesized DNA was transformed into competent Blue XL cells. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The base change is in bold and underlined: G946A forward, C AAT GTT GAG AAA CAG ACT CTG ATA AAA GTC TTC GGG; G946A reverse, CCC GAA GAC TTT TAT CAG AGT CTG TTT CTC AAC ATT G. Transfection of HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium. The culture was negative for Mycoplasma as monitored by PCR every 2–3 months of culture. Full-length P2X7 (30 μg) or mutated P2X7 cDNA in pCI vector were incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium for 5 min followed by incubation with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (30 μl, diluted with Opti-MEM I medium) for 20 min at room temperature. The solution was transfected into a nearly confluent monolayer of HEK-293 cells (∼5 × 106 in 9 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium without antibiotics). After 40–44 h, cells were collected by mechanical scraping in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Immunofluorescent Staining and Flow Cytometry—Mononuclear cell preparations (1 × 107/ml) from healthy or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) subjects or HEK-293 cells were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C with FITC-conjugated P2X7 mAb (clone L4) plus PE-conjugated CD3 and PE-Cy5-conjugated CD19 mAbs in HEPES-buffered saline containing 10% group AB human serum. Cells were washed once and analyzed for P2X7 expression on lymphocyte subpopulations gated for B lymphocytes (CD19+) or T lymphocytes (CD3+) or on HEK-293 cells gated by forward and side scatter. Dead cells were excluded by 7-aminoactinomycin D staining. For intracellular staining, HEK-293 cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and labeled with FITC-P2X7 mAb for 15 min in the presence of 0.1% saponin and 10% group AB human serum. Isotype control values for lymphocytes ranged from 2 ± 1 mean channels of fluorescence intensity and were subtracted from the values for each type. Immunofluorescent Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Non-transfected, mock-transfected, and transfected HEK-293 cells were harvested and cultured on collagen-coated (50 μg/ml) glass coverslips in 48-well plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/well for 120 min. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were blocked with 20% normal horse serum in PBS for 20 min before incubation with sheep anti-human or rabbit anti-rat P2X7 polyclonal antibodies or preimmune serum diluted in PBS for 120 min. Cells were washed and incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-sheep or Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted in PBS for 60 min. Washed cells were mounted on glass slides in glycerol gelatin mounting medium and visualized with a Leica TCS NT UV laser confocal microscope system. Western Blotting—HEK-293 cells (5 × 106) transfected with wild type or R307Q mutant human P2RX7 cDNA were resuspended in digestion buffer containing Mini-Complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 750 mm ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid, and 50 mm Bistris (pH 7.0). Cells were lysed with 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and separated by 8–16% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked overnight in TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) containing 5% skim milk powder. The membrane was washed and incubated with a sheep anti-human or a rabbit anti-rat P2X7 receptor polyclonal antibody (1:1,000) in TTBS buffer for 2 h. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep or swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (1:5,000) for another 1 h. The horseradish peroxidase was then detected with the SuperSignal kit. Electrophysiology—Oocytes from adult female Xenopus laevis were surgically removed and prepared as outlined previously (28Smart M.L. Gu B. Panchal R.G. Wiley J. Cromer B. Williams D.A. Petrou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8853-8860Google Scholar). Stage 5 or 6 oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA encoding wild type P2RX7 or mutant P2RX7 R307Q receptors (∼1 μg/μl) and were stored at 18 °C for 2 days prior to experimentation. For two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, oocytes were impaled with two glass electrodes containing 3 m KCl and held at a membrane potential of –70 mV with an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Oocytes were continually perfused with ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) using a pump perfusion system. 100 μm ATP dissolved in bath solution was applied to the oocyte at 18 °C until the response reached a plateau or alternatively, if no response was observed, for ∼1 min. Following ATP application, the oocyte was again perfused with bath solution, and the inward current trace was monitored until full recovery was observed. A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism at Position 946 of the P2RX7 Gene—Both loss-of-function polymorphisms identified to date in the human P2RX7 gene result from single base substitutions in exon 13. A search was made for other single nucleotide polymorphisms by sequencing the other 12 exons of P2RX7 gene from genomic DNA of healthy and leukemic subjects. In two of 110 CLL patients and 10 of 310 healthy subjects, a heterozygous nucleotide substitution (946G→A) was found in exon 9, but no homozygous substitutions were observed (Table II). This substitution predicts a change of Arg307 to glutamine (R307Q) in the extracellular domain of the P2X7 receptor. The overall allele frequency of this single nucleotide polymorphism was 0.014 in the Caucasian population when healthy subjects and CLL patients were considered as a single group (n = 420). Thus this mutant allele falls within the definition of a single nucleotide polymorphism since its prevalence is greater than 0.01 (1%) in the population. Of the total 12 subjects who were heterozygous for 946G→A, two were also heterozygous for other loss-of-function polymorphisms: one for 1513A→C and one for 1729T→A (Table II).Table IIP2X7 expression and function in leukocytes with R307Q (946G→A) polymorphismGenotypeP2X7 expression (mean channels of fluorescence intensity)P2X7 function (arbitrary units of area under ATP-induced ethidium+ uptake at 5 min)94615131729B lymphocyteT lymphocyteB lymphocyteT lymphocyteMonocyteHealthy subjectsN1G/AA/AT/T6.14.36150319N2G/AA/AT/T2.11.5194219149N3G/AA/CT/T2.53.8212058N4G/AA/AT/T1.01.846561913N5G/AA/AT/T3.04.81,07597844CLL subjectsC1G/AA/AT/A2.11.770680C2G/AA/AT/T3.65.15211290Healthy wild type subjects (mean ± S.D.)

Such a regulation has yet to be documented, especially because there has been no biochemical characterization of T-channels. To monitor total protein levels and plasma membrane expression of T-channels in living cells, external epitopes (hemagglutinin, FLAG) were introduced into human recombinant CaV3 channels that were also N-terminally fused to green fluorescent protein. Utilizing Western blot techniques, fluorescence flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, luminometry, and electrophysiology, we describe here that β1b and α2-δ1 subunits enhance the level of CaV3 proteins as well as their plasma membrane expression in various expression systems. We also report that, in both Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells, the α2-δ1 subunits increase by at least and β1b 2-fold the current density of CaV3 channels with no change in the electrophysiological properties. Altogether, these data indicate that HVA auxiliary subunits modulate CaV3 channel surface expression, suggesting that the membrane targeting of HVA and LVA α1 subunits is regulated dynamically through the expression of a common set of regulatory subunits.

Indeed, high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium channel complexes include a core of auxiliary subunits, α2/δ, β, and γ subunits, that regulate biophysical, pharmacological, and biochemical properties of the pore-forming α1 subunit. By contrast, with the HVA calcium channels that function at best as multimeric complexes, the recombinant CaV3 subunits express by themselves as typical T-type, LVA calcium channels in a variety of heterologous expression systems (1Perez-Reyes E.

To date, no auxiliary subunit, which would associate to T-type channels and modulate their trafficking or surface expression, has been identified. However, a few studies have suggested that α2-δ, β, or γ2 subunits might modulate CaV3 channels (6Dolphin A.C. Wyatt C.N. Richards J. Beattie R.E. Craig P. Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Volsen S.G.

(Lond.). 1999; 519: 35-45Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but this description remains controversial because there are several other studies reporting no effects (7Kang M.G. Campbell K.P. J.

In recent years, it has been proven useful to monitor protein expression, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and temporal/spatial imaging using fusion with highly specific epitope tags as well as fluorescent proteins (for review see Ref. 8Zhang J.

More specifically, the construction of externally epitope-tagged ion channels has emerged as a powerful means of monitoring surface expression in a variety of cell systems. This technique has been applied to the study of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (9Howard M. Jilling T. DuVall M. Frizzell R.A.

Here, we describe the construction of an equivalent set of tools for the study of CaV3 T-type channel expression. These tagged channels preserve their electrophysiological hallmarks and can be detected and assayed by various immunotechniques. Therefore, by directly measuring plasma membrane expression of CaV3-tagged channels, we demonstrate that both α2-δ1 subunit and β1 subunit can modulate the cell surface expression of T-type channels in various heterologous expression systems. Recombinant cDNAs Used in Experiments—The following cDNA sequences inserted into expression vectors have been used followed by the GenBank™ accession numbers: β1b, NM017346; α2-δ1, AF286488; CaV3.1b, AF126965; CaV3.2, NM021098; and CaV3.3, AF211189. The FLAG-NaV1.5 was a kind gift from Dr. Mohamed Chanine (Laval University). It is tagged with a single FLAG epitope in the extracellular loop, SS1-SS2, of domain I (14Baroudi G. Pouliot V. Denjoy I. Guicheney P. Shrier A. Chahine M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E78-E83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HA-Kir2.1 construct was a kind gift of Dr. Caroline Dart. Construction of CaV3.1-GFP—Using PCR mutagenesis, a unique BssHII/EcoRI site was introduced into the 5′ end of CaV3.1b and the removal of the start codon was achieved with the following primers: forward, 5′-GCTGCGCGCGAATTCTGACGAGGAGGAGGATGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTCTCCAGCAGCTTGTG-3′. This modified BssHII/SpeI fragment was subcloned back into the original CaV3.1b construct using the BssHII/SpeI sites. Subsequently, the EcoRI/KpnI fragment comprising the entire coding region of CaV3.1b was cloned of into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Finally, this CaV3.1b-GFP construct was checked by sequencing. It was expressed in TSA201 cells and found to be electrophysiologically similar to CaV3.1b. Construction of CaV3.2-HA and CaV3.2-GFP—A unique SbfI site was introduced into the extracellular SS1-SS2 loop of domain I of the CaV3.2 cDNA by overlapping PCR strategy at position 972 bp to insert a HA epitope. The two oligonucleotide pairs used to introduce the SbfI site were as follows H-SbfI-F1 (5′-CTGGCCCTGCGGCGTTGGTG-3′) and H-Sbf-R1 (5′-GCCTGCAGGTTGCGTGTAGGCCTC-3′); and H-SbfI-F2 (5′-TACACGCACCTGCAGGCCGAGGG-3′) and H-SbfI-R2 (5′-TGGGGAAGGTGGCGAGGGGG-3′). The PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen gel purification kit), and equimolar concentrations were used to perform a PCR on the 1.7-kb fragment using H-SbfI-F1 and H-SbfI-R2 primers. This product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His Topo TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Complementary oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope flanked with extra amino acids to enlarge the loop (SbfI-HA-F, 5′-GGAACCACTATCCATATGACGTTCCGGACTACGCAGTCACGTTCGTCGACCTGCA-3′, and SbfI-HA-R, 5′-GGTCGACGAACGTGACTGCGTAGTCCGGAACGTCATATGGATAGTGTTCCTGCA-3′) were annealed to form SbfI adaptors and ligated into the SbfI site. A single clone, the CaV3.2-HA clone, was digested with AscI, and the 1.65-kb fragment was subcloned into CaV3.2-GFP. Each step of this procedure was confirmed by sequencing. The CaV3.2-GFP clone was generated as follows. The CaV3.2 pcDNA3 clone was modified by PCR mutagenesis to introduce an XhoI restriction site in its 5′ end (5′-CTCGAGCCATGACCGAGGG-3′) and a reverse oligonucleotide (5′-CAGTTGAGCATGATTACCAGCATG-3′). This fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His Topo TA, sequenced, and further subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), generating pEGFPC1G1. Subsequently, a NotI/KpnI fragment (∼7 kb) excised from the CaV3.2-pcDNA3 construct was subcloned into the NotI/KpnI-cut pEGFPC1G1 construct. The amino acid sequence of the HA-tagged CaV3.2-GFP construct reads EHYPYDVPDYAVTFVD with the boldface letters corresponding to the HA epitope. Construction CaV3.3-HA, CaV3.3–4× FLAG, and CaV3.3-GFPHA—The CaV3.3 cDNA sequence (originally subcloned into pBK-CMV) contains a unique SbfI site in the SS1-SS2 loop of domain I. The clone was digested with SbfI and dephosphorylated, and subsequently, the same oligonucleotide pair as used for the construction of CaV3.3-HA (see above for the oligonucleotide sequence) was ligated into the SbfI site. To generate FLAG-tagged CaV3.3 clones, complementary oligonucleotides (phosphorylated) encoding the FLAG epitope were annealed to form SbfI adaptors and ligated into the SbfI site using the following primers: I-FlagF, 5′-GGACTATAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGCGATCGACCTCCA-3′, and FlagR, GGTCGATCGCCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTATAGTCCTGCA-3′. The boldface letters indicate PvuI sites that were introduced in order to identify clones with the modified sequence. Restriction digests using PvuI and sequencing were performed to confirm the presence of FLAG epitope(s) in CaV3.3 cDNAs (i.e. CaV3.3–4× FLAG construct). Flow Cytometry of Transfected TSA201 Cells—Cells were harvested by washing once in PBS followed by an incubation in 500 μl of 50 mm EDTA-PBS buffer to resuspend the cells. The mixture was analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. Settings were established to detect the fluorescence of cells above background levels caused by autofluorescence. In general, a minimum of 104 cells was analyzed (**, p > 0.001; ***, p < 0.0001, n = 4). Western Blotting of Tagged CaV3 Channels—TSA201 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in PBS in the presence of a protease mixture. Cells were lysed and sonicated. An equal quantity of protein was loaded onto an 8% gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose for 1 h at 200 mA. The gel was blocked utilizing 3% milk powder. Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight with a rat anti-HA antibody (1:1000, Jackson Laboratories) for HA constructs or with a mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1000, Sigma) for FLAG constructs and was followed by three washes in PBS (15, 5, and 5). A 45-min incubation at room temperature was carried out with either a goat anti-rat-horseradish peroxidase secondary (1:5000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or a goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase secondary (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences), followed by 3 washes 1X PBS (15min, 5 min, 5 min). Visualization of the bands was carried out using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Surface Expression Measurements in Xenopus Oocytes—Isolation, injection, two-electrode voltage clamp, and surface expression of CaV3.2-HA-GFP were performed as described previously (15Altier C. Dubel S.J. Barrere C. Jarvis S.E. Stotz S.C. Spaetgens R.L. Scott J.D. Cornet V. De Waard M. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33598-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After electrophysiological recordings, individual non-permeabilized oocytes were processed with the primary and secondary antibodies. Surface expression was measured using enzymatic amplification of HA epitope recognition with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rat Fab fragments, Jackson ImmunoResearch). CaV3.2-HA-GFP surface expression was quantified on individual oocytes with a Victor 2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A HA-tagged Kir2.1 potassium channel and the wild-type CaV3.2 calcium channel were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (data not shown). Surface and Total Expression Measurements of CaV Subunits in HEK293 Cells—Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 with a constant amount of DNA (2 μg) in 35-mm dishes. Each transfection then was split into 4 wells of a 12-well plate. Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by 2 × 5-min washes with PBS. Two wells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (PBS + 1% serum). The expression of CaV1.2-HA and CaV3.2-HA channels was measured using a mouse anti-HA directly coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1/2000, monoclonal antibody clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science). For the 4× FLAG-CaV3.3- and FLAG-tagged NaV1.5 channels, a mouse anti-FLAG directly coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1/1000; Sigma) was used. Incubation of the primary antibody was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washes (4 × 5 min in PBS + 1% fetal calf Serum, 5 × 5 min in PBS alone), SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) was added, and the luminescence was measured with a Victor 2 luminometer. Patch Clamp Experiments in Transfected HEK293 and CHO-Cav3.1 Cell Lines—HEK293 cells as well as a CHO cell line stably expressing the CaV3.1b isoform (CHO-CaV3.1) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Glutamax, and 10% fetal calf serum. The clonal CHO-CaV3.1 cell line was established with the CaV3.1b isoform (GenBank™ accession number AF126965) using standard protocols. The transfection of the α2-δ1 and/or β1b subunits was performed using Jet-PEI (QBiogen) following standard protocols. Cells were cotransfected with a CD8 expression plasmid (1/10 ratio) to allow optimized identification of the transfected cells using CD8 Dynabeads (Dynal) applied prior to electrophysiological recordings. Whole cell calcium currents were recorded at room temperature 2–3 days after transfection using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, CA). Extracellular solution contained (in mm): 2 CaCl2, 135 TEACl, and 10 HEPES (pH to 7.4 with TEAOH). Borosilicate glass pipettes that had a typical resistance of 1–2 megohms were filled with an internal solution containing (in mm): 110 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, and 0.6 GTP (pH to 7.2 with CsOH). β1b and α2-δ1 Subunits Enhance CaV3 Current Density—We have studied the effect of transient transfection of β1b and α2-δ1 subunits in a CHO line stably transfected with the human CaV3.1 subunit to overcome any difficulty from the electrophysiological analysis of transiently expressed T-type channels in mammalian cells. The cell line has a mean T-current density of 11.7 pA/pF, which showed a 2-fold increase in its current density, when transfected with both the rat β1b and α2-δ1 subunits (Fig. 1A). No change in the current-voltage (I/V) curve parameters, steady-state activation, or inactivation properties could be detected (Fig. 1B), indicating that unlike for HVA channels, there was no modulation of electrophysiological properties of CaV3.1 channels caused by β and α2-δ subunits. Functional expression of CaV3.2 channels was measured in Xenopus oocytes. Using barium as charge carrier, the current was typical of LVA channels with strong voltage-dependent activation and fast inactivation kinetics (inactivation τ of 10.5 ± 1.2 ms, n = 10 at the peak of the IV curve). When CaV3.2 cDNA was injected along with β1b and α2-δ1 cDNAs, the T-current amplitude was 3-fold larger (Fig. 1C) without any modification in activation or inactivation kinetics as seen in typical current traces (Fig. 1C). As for the CaV3.1 current in CHO cells (Fig. 1B), the increase in the CaV3.2 current was not accompanied by a change of the activation threshold as seen on the I/V curve (Fig. 1D) or a change of the voltage dependence of the activation (half-activation potentials (V0.5) for CaV3.2 alone (–35.7 ± 0.4 mV, n = 12) and for CaV3.2 + α2-δ1/β1b (–36.5 ± 0.4 mV, n = 14)). Construction of Epitope- and GFP-tagged CaV3 Subunits— Recently, the antibodies generated against both CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 were used to monitor total protein expression either on Western blots and immunostaining (16Yunker A.M. Sharp A.H. Sundarraj S. Ranganathan V. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the availability of antibodies that would recognize epitope at the extracellular side of a T-type calcium channel, allowing us to monitor surface expression, does not exist. In a first series of experiments, a FLAG epitope was inserted into the extracellular S1-S2 loop of domain I of CaV3.3. To optimize recognition by the antibody, extra flanking residues were introduced. The site was chosen both because of a unique and convenient SbfI restriction site and the absence of surrounding putative glycosylation sites. A series of FLAG-tagged CaV3.3 constructs were made, which contained 1, 2, or 4 FLAG epitopes. Only the 4× FLAG was detected on Western blots, and this construct could be used in chemiluminescent assays. To improve a further detection of tagged CaV3 channels, we inserted a HA epitope at this same Sbf1 site. The HA epitope detection has been used successfully to analyze potassium channel expression (12Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). In addition, a series of T-type calcium channels (CaV3.1, CaV3.2, CaV3.2-HA, and CaV3.3) N-terminally tagged with GFP were constructed to allow the monitoring of CaV channels using fluorescence techniques (see Fig. 2A for schematic representation of CaV3 constructs). All of these various constructs were assayed functionally in patch clamp studies and proven to function adequately as T-type channels (see Fig. 2B for typical current traces obtained with these recombinant clones), indicating that the insertion of these additional sequence did not alter channel properties. Biochemical Analysis of CaV3-tagged Proteins as Expressed in TSA201 Cells—The expression of CaV3-GFP-tagged clones in HEK293 could be detected easily by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2C). The CaV3.3 4× FLAG construct exhibited electrophysiological properties similar to those of wild type CaV3.3, although the currents on average were of smaller amplitudes (data not shown). The FLAG-tagged CaV3.3 proteins containing either a single or double FLAG epitope failed to be detected on Western blots. The presence of four FLAG sequences was necessary for Western blot detection (Fig. 2D). By contrast, both CaV3.2-HA and CaV3.3-HA-GFP, which contained a single HA epitope, could be detected using Western blot (Fig. 2D). β1b and α2-δ1 Subunits Enhance the Level of Expression GFP-tagged CaV3 Channels—CaV3.1, CaV3.2, CaV3.2-HA, and CaV3.3-HA tagged with GFP were expressed in TSA201 cells. When both β1b and α2-δ1 were coexpressed together with any of the GFP-tagged CaV3 channels, an increase in the number and intensity of cells expressing the GFP was observable using fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 3A). To further study the expression of the GFP-tagged CaV3 subunits, fluorescent cell cytometry was used as a quantitative, high throughput detection method. When the CaV3 channels were coexpressed with both of the subunits, a significant increase in the mean average GFP fluorescence of 180 (CaV3.1-GFP), 320 (CaV3.2-HA-GFP), and 80% (CaV3.3-HA-GFP) was measured (Fig. 3B). These results were confirmed using Western blot analysis, which shows a significant increase in protein levels when both subunits are coexpressed (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that HVA auxiliary subunits augment CaV3 subunit expression at the protein level. β1b and α2-δ1 Subunits Promote CaV3.2 Surface Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—To combine T-current and cell surface expression measurements, the CaV3.2-HA-GFP construct was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The plasma membrane expression of CaV3.2-HA-GFP was measured directly using an immunoassay developed in the laboratory for the CaV1.2 channels (16Yunker A.M. Sharp A.H. Sundarraj S. Ranganathan V. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The T-currents generated by the CaV3.2-HA-GFP construct were augmented significantly following β1b and α2-δ1 coexpression (Fig. 4A). The surface expression of CaV3.2-HA-GFP was increased by ∼2-fold upon coexpression with α2-δ1 and β1b, consistent with the increase in current density (Fig. 4B). This set of experiments, based on the combined use of electrophysiological and surface protein measurements, demonstrates that the α2-δ1 and β1b subunits increased the concomitant expression of CaV3.2 at the plasma membrane and T-current density in Xenopus oocytes. β1b and α2-δ1 Subunits Enhance the Level of Expression of Tagged CaV3 Channels in HEK293 Cells—Using mammalian cells, flow cytometry experiments of GFP-tagged CaV3 channels (Fig. 3) did not allow any quantification of surface expression. To extend the observations reported above, the cell surface measurement assay then was developed for mammalian cells. This chemiluminescence technique allows us to quantitatively examine both surface and total expression of epitope-tagged CaV channels in a rather large population of cells (>250,000 cells). HEK293 cells were transfected with various combinations of β1b and α2-δ1 subunits. 48 h later, the cells were fixed and the surface expression of CaV3.2-HA- and CaV1.2-HA-tagged channels as well as CaV3.3–4× FLAG- and NaV1.5-FLAG-tagged channels was determined (Fig. 5). We found that the β1b and α2-δ1 subunits, individually and together, were able to enhance significantly the surface expression of the CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 subunits. CaV3.2-HA expression was augmented when β1b and α2-δ1 were coexpressed individually, with an increase of 148 ± 2% and 151 ± 19% (total) and 237 ± 35% and 201 ± 12% (surface) for β1b and α2-δ1, respectively. When both subunits were expressed together, a 437 ± 65% increase in Cav3.2-HA surface expression was measured, whereas only a 181 ± 18% increase was found in total expression. For Cav3.3–4× FLAG, when β1b and α2-δ1 were coexpressed the membrane expression was increased by 143 ± 1% and 171 ± 15%, respectively, whereas the total expression was increased by 192 ± 13% and 153 ± 9%, respectively. The expression of both auxiliary subunits with Cav3.3–4× FLAG led to a further 231 ± 7% (surface) and 264 ± 11% (total) increase in expression as compared with each of the subunits expressed separately (p < 0.05); however, the relative amount of membrane expression was not modified significantly. For CaV1.2 HA-tagged channels, a 268 ± 11% increase in surface expression was measured when both subunits were coexpressed with a 430 ± 11% increase in total expression. Finally, we have performed similar experiments with NaV1.5, a sodium channel that shares a similar overall homology with CaV channel subunits (17Perez-Reyes E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using a NaV1.5 channel tagged with an external FLAG epitope, no change in surface expression was observed with the β1b and α2-δ1 subunits (Fig. 5), indicating that the reported effects of β1b and α2-δ1 subunits on CaV3 channels expression are specific for voltage-gated calcium channels. The main finding of the this study is that the HVA auxiliary subunits α2-δ1 and β1b modulate the amount of CaV3 channel protein at the plasma membrane. We also report that the increase in plasma membrane expression is accompanied by an increase in the T-type current density. Interestingly, we have observed no alteration in current properties with any of the LVA channels when coexpressed with β1b and α2-δ1 subunits regardless of the expression system. Overall, this study also validates the use of epitope-tagged CaV3 channels to probe T-channel modulation. The effect of any regulatory subunits on T-type channels has yet to be determined. A few studies have reported some changes in both current density and electrophysiological properties when HVA α2-δ auxiliary subunits were expressed with T-type channel CaV3 subunits (6Dolphin A.C.

We report here that the α2-δ1 subunit is able to increase total and surface expression of both CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 channels in HEK293 cells. Therefore, we have confirmed previous data suggesting a α2-δ subunit modulation of T-type channels by demonstrating that the α2-δ1 subunit is able to up-regulate the surface expression of CaV3 channels as well as significantly increase T-type current density. Indeed, other studies have suggested that a functional association of α2-δ1 subunit with a T-type could occur based on the use of the anti-epileptic drug Gabapentin, which has been shown to bind onto the α2-δ1 subunit and to modulate T-currents (22Gee N.S.

Overall, these data indicate that α2-δ subunits could be considered as a regulatory subunit of T-type calcium channels and that the α2-δ subunits may interact with CaV3 channels. In this study, we also have demonstrated that β1b has a significant effect on augmenting the surface expression and total expression of both CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 channels. We also have found that the CaV3.3 total protein expression is affected by all of the β subunit family members, indicating that β subunits share their ability to modulate T-type channels. 2S. J. Dubel, unpublished data. To date, whether or not the β subunits regulate the CaV3 channels is controversial. A few studies have suggested that β subunits do not regulate the T-type current density, i.e. the T-type channel expression. Antisense depletion of β subunits failed to decrease T-type channel expression in NG108-15 cells (24Leuranguer V. Bourinet E. Lory P. Nargeot J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as in nodose ganglion neurons (25Lambert R.C. Maulet Y. Mouton J. Beattie R. Volsen S. De Waard M. Feltz A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the overexpression of the β1b subunit did not affect either the T-type current density or the kinetic properties of native T-currents in NG108-15 cells (19Wyatt C.N. Page K.M. Berrow N.S. Brice N.L. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 347-360Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In good agreement with these data, we have failed to identify any significant electrophysiological alteration of recombinant CaV3 channels when the β1b subunit was expressed and we have failed to identify a clear change in T-current density in regular transient cotransfection experiments in mammalian cells. Indeed, the use of tagged CaV3 channels was instrumental to describe an ∼2-fold increase in cell surface expression and in T-current density caused by the β1b subunit. The β subunit roles in modulation of biophysical properties of HVA channels have been well studied (for review see Ref. 26Jones S.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It also has been demonstrated that the β subunits tightly bind onto a retention motif located within the intracellular I-II loop of HVA pore channel subunits (CaV) and facilitate HVA channel trafficking and cell surface expression (27Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is tempting to suggest that the CaV3 channels also may possess β subunit interaction site(s). A consensus sequence (QQE(D/E)LGY... WI... E) present in the I-II intracellular loop of every HVA CaV subunit is the primary interaction site of the β subunits (28De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 29Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the CaV3.1 protein may be sufficiently homologous to provide a similar binding site (GSCYEELLKYLVYILRKA) (for review, see Ref. 6Dolphin A.C. Wyatt C.N. Richards J. Beattie R.E. Craig P. Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Volsen S.G. Perez-Reyes E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 35-45Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, a sequence comparison of this region for all of the CaV3 channels identified to date revealed a conserved consensus sequence that reads EPCYE... Y... R... RR. In addition, we were unable to identify any interaction between either the full-length rat β1b subunit or the β subunit interacting domain site and the I-II loop of the CaV3.3 channel using the two-yeast hybrid assay (data not shown). Furthermore, by attaching the I-II loop of CaV3.1 channels to a reporter CD8 construct, Cornet et al. (30Cornet V. Bichet D. Sandoz G. Marty I. Brocard J. Bourinet E. Mori Y. Villaz M. De Waard M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) demonstrate that this sequence does not possess a retention motif as found on HVA channels. These various observations would argue that the I-II loop of the CaV3 channels does not interact with the β subunits. If there are other regions of CaV3 channels that are able to interact with β subunits to promote the regulation, they are likely to very weak since β1b failed to be immunoprecipitated with the CaV3–4× FLAG-tagged channel, whereas this was not the case with the CaV1.2-HA-tagged channel. 2S. J. Dubel, unpublished data. An alternative explanation would be that the CaV3 channels expressed in the various cell systems used in this study may be guided or stabilized by the β subunits as well as the other HVA auxiliary subunits on their way to the membrane without the need for a tight association. Indeed, it has been suggested recently that β subunit modulation of HVA current density may also rely on a labile interaction that can be mimicked with purified β subunits applied in patch clamp experiments (31Garcia R. Carrillo E. Rebolledo S. Garcia M.C. Sanchez J.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 545: 407-419Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Yamaguchi H. Hara M. Strobeck M. Fukasawa K. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19348-19356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further electrophysiological studies using purified β subunits applied intracellularly on recombinant CaV3 channels might be useful to determine whether a similar modulation occurs for T-type calcium channels. In summary, we have demonstrated that the β1b and α2-δ1 subunits are able to induce both a global increase in protein level and an enhanced surface expression of CaV3 channels, which is correlated to an increase in current density both in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. An augmentation of CaV1.2 plasma membrane expression was observed with the coexpression of the auxiliary subunits as expected based on previous reports of increased current density (33Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Bourinet E. Charnet P. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Welling A. Bosse E. Cavalie A. Bottlender R. Ludwig A. Nastainczyk W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 471: 749-765Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), immunostaining (35Gao T. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2137-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and membrane expression using external epitope tags (15Altier C. Dubel S.J. Barrere C. Jarvis S.E. Stotz S.C. Spaetgens R.L. Scott J.D. Cornet V. De Waard M. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33598-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There is no modification in the relative level (surface/total expression) of CaV1.2-HA expression at the cell surface when both of the auxiliary subunits are expressed. This is also evident with CaV3.3-tagged channels, whereas for the Cav3.2 channels, the auxiliary subunits significantly increase the relative surface expression of the channels. It is not known whether this is attributed to an increase in the rate of trafficking to the cell surface or stabilization of the protein at the plasma membrane, but it should be noted that the surface expression level of CaV3.2 channels (13%) is lower compared with either CaV3.3 (30%) or CaV1.2 channels (20%) without auxiliary subunits, thus suggesting that CaV3.2 channels may be more sensitive to the effects of the auxiliary subunits. Utilizing HA-tagged CaV3.2 and FLAG-tagged CaV3.3 channels, we were able to demonstrate that exogenously expressed β1b and α2-δ1 subunits are able to increase both total and surface expression in mammalian cells not only together but also individually. These subunits are likely to act synergistically to enhance the effects observed with each separate subunit. The mechanism of this additional augmentation has yet to be documented. One possible explanation would be that these auxiliary subunits modulate the expression/stabilization of each other, which would result ultimately in a significant increase in the CaV3 subunit expression/stabilization. Although the synthesis, assembly, and trafficking of CaV3 channels is undoubtedly a complex process governed by a wide range of regulatory proteins, the fact that HVA auxiliary subunits act on all of the three members of the T-type channel family suggests either a common site of interaction or a general mechanism by which these CaV3 channels are modulated. The observed increase in the surface expression of calcium channels by the coexpression of β1b and α2-δ1 subunits also may involve channel recycling or degradation of voltage-dependent calcium channels at the cell surface. Although calcium channel endocytosis still is documented poorly, it has been shown recently that endophilin, a key regulator of clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis, is able to interact with CaV1.2, CaV2.1, and CaV2.2 calcium channels (36Chen Y. Deng L. Maeno-Hikichi Y. Lai M. Chang S. Chen G. Zhang J. Cell. 2003; 115: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could account for the β1b and α2-δ1 subunit stabilization of CaV3 channels at the cell surface. The construction of T-type CaV3 subunits with exogenous epitopes in the extracellular domains should be useful in evaluating a wide range of protein trafficking, processing, and modulation of these channels and will open up new avenues in exploring the T-type channel physiological and pathophysiological functions. For example, whether the γ subunits modulate T-type channel function and trafficking can be now addressed. Indeed, it has been reported recently that the γ2 subunit modulates the biophysical properties of CaV3.3 channels (37Green P.J. Warre R. Hayes P.D. McNaughton N.C. Medhurst A.D. Pangalos M. Duckworth D.M. Randall A.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 467-478Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that LVA current density is enhanced in the thalamic neurons of the “stargazer” mice, which is deficient in the γ2/stargazin protein (38Zhang Y. Mori M. Burgess D.L. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6362-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of externally tagged CaV3 channels combined with a virus delivery strategy should make it possible to analyze cell surface expression of T-channels in a wide variety of cell types, including cardiac myocytes and neurons (39Wei S.K.

Furthermore, with the recent identification of mutations within the human gene CACNA1H (that codes for CaV3.2 channels) in patients with childhood absence epilepsy (40Chen Y. Lu J. Pan H. Zhang Y.

The Coronaviridae exhibit a broad host range, infecting many mammalian and avian species and causing upper respiratory, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system diseases. Coronaviruses in humans and fowl primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections, whereas porcine and bovine coronaviruses establish enteric infections that result in severe economic loss (3Siddell S.

The surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses play essential roles in viral entry into cells by mediating virion attachment to cells and the virus-cell membrane fusion, the initial events of the viral infections. The spike (S) protein is the sole viral enveloped glycoprotein responsible for cell entry in coronaviruses. It binds to the cell surface receptor and mediates subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (5Gallagher T.M. Buchmeier M.J. Virology. 2001; 279: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Under the electron microscope, the spike proteins can be clearly seen as 20-nm-long surface projections on the virion membrane (6Davies H.A. Macnaughton M.R. Arch. Virol. 1979; 59: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The spike proteins of coronaviruses share several features with other viral glycoproteins mediating viral entry, including the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza virus, gp160 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), GP of Ebola virus, and fusion protein of paramyxovirus (7Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 8Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These glycoproteins are all synthesized as single polypeptide precursors that oligomerize in the endoplasmic reticulum to form trimers. Most of the enveloped proteins with fusion activity contain two noncovalently associated subunits: S1 + S2 in coronaviruses, HA1 + HA2 in influenza viruses, gp120 + gp41 in HIV/SIV, GP1 + GP2 in Ebola virus, and F1 + F2 in paramyxoviruses, all of which are generated by proteolytic cleavage. Nevertheless, some enveloped proteins have no cleavage in their precursors and yet still maintain fusion activity, such as the S proteins of some coronaviruses (9Yamada Y.K. Takimoto K. Yabe M. Taguchi F. Virology. 1997; 227: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and GP of Ebola virus (10Wool-Lewis R.J. Bates P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hydrophobic region in the membrane-anchored subunit of enveloped proteins, termed the fusion peptide in class I fusion proteins, has been shown to insert into the cellular membranes during the fusion process (11Hernandez L.D.

The regions following the fusion peptide have a 4-3 heptad repeat (HR) of hydrophobic residues, a sequence feature characteristic of coiled coils. The first heptad repeat, termed HR1 (HRA or N peptide), is followed by a short spacer domain and a second heptad repeat, termed HR2 (HRB or C-peptide), followed by another short spacer and the transmembrane (TM) anchor (13Chambers P.

The N-terminal heptad repeat forms a central coiled coil, which is surrounded by three HR2 helices in an oblique, antiparallel manner. Among all enveloped glycoproteins, the membrane fusion mechanism of the HA of influenza viruses has been studied in greater detail (7Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 8Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

HA is proteolytically cleaved to generate a receptor binding subunit (HA1) and an anchored subunit (HA2) containing the fusion peptide. Numerous evidences suggest that the HA of influenza undergoes a conformational change, from a native (nonfusogenic) to fusion-active (fusogenic) state during the viral fusion process. In the native HA, part of the heptad repeat region of HA2 forms a nonhelical loop (26Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar) but converts into a coiled coil when exposed to low pH (14Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The later conformation is generally regarded to be a fusogenic state because the low pH also activates influenza membrane fusion. This conformation change is also the basis of the “spring-loaded mechanism” for activation of viral fusion (27Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The spike protein of MHV A59 has been identified as a class I fusion protein and shares common features with other viral fusion proteins (28Bosch B.J. van der Zee R. de Haan C.A. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8801-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). However, there are several significant differences between the membrane-anchored subunits of coronavirus spike proteins and HA2, gp41, GP2, and SV5F1. First, the ectodomain is much larger (550 residues versus 120–380 residues) in size in S protein. Second, the HR1 region is predicted to be much larger (more than 100 residues versus 30–60 residues) in size by the learn-coil VMF program (29Singh M. Berger B. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and also verified by proteinase K-resistant experiments (28Bosch B.J. van der Zee R. de Haan C.A. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8801-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Third, the putative fusion peptides of all other viral fusion proteins are located at the N terminus of the membrane-proximal subunits, whereas the S protein features an internal fusion peptide. Highly conserved HR1 and HR2 regions in coronavirus spike proteins suggest that they share similar three-dimensional fusion core structures and a common mechanism for viral fusion. The binding region of the HR1·HR2 complex of other coronaviruses and likely structures of their fusion cores can be proposed based on MHV fusion core structure and sequence alignment. Analogous to HIV C-peptides, HR2 peptides of coronaviruses are likely to act in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit hairpin formation, thereby inhibiting viral entry. Thus, drug discovery strategies aimed at inhibiting viral entry by blocking hairpin formation may also be applied to the inhibition of emerging infectious diseases such as SARS. Although previous biochemical and electron microscopic analyses have shown that the HR1·HR2 complex in the S protein of MHV forms a fusion core (28Bosch B.J. van der Zee R. de Haan C.A. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8801-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), the exact binding region of the HR1·HR2 complex and the detailed structure of the fusion core remain unknown. Here we report the determination of the crystal structure of the fusion core of MHV A59 spike protein to 2.5 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography and discuss the implications of the structure for coronavirus membrane fusion. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The expression, purification, and preliminary crystallographic studies of the MHV 2-Helix protein have been described elsewhere. 2Y. Xu, Z. Bai, L. Qin, X. Li, G. F. Gao, and Z. Rao, submitted for publication. The PCR-directed gene was inserted into pET22b (Novagen) vector, and the selenomethionine MHV 2-Helix derivative was expressed in M9 medium containing 60 mg liter-1 selenomethionine in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The product was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. The purified MHV 2-Helix derivative was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl and concentrated to 8 mg ml-1. Crystals with good diffracting quality could be obtained in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 10% PEG 4000 (v/v), 8% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v), 5 mm hexaminecobalt trichloride after 3 days. The expression, purification, and crystallization of nMHV is the same as for MHV 2-Helix. Crystals with good diffracting quality could be obtained in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 13% PEG 4000 (v/v), 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v). Data Collection and Processing—The MHV 2-Helix crystal was mounted on nylon loops and flash-frozen in an Oxford Cryosystems cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected by a rotation method using a MarCCD detector with synchrotron radiation on beamline 3W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Data were collected from a single selenomethionyl derivative crystal at peak (0.9799 Å), inflection (0.9801 Å), and remote (0.9000 Å) wavelengths to 2.5 Å. Data collection from the nMHV 2-Helix crystal was performed in-house on a Rigaku RU2000 rotating anode x-ray generator operated at 48 kV and 98 mA (Cu Kα; λ = 1.5418 Å) with a MAR 345 image plate detector. The crystal was mounted on nylon loops and flash-frozen at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems cold nitrogen gas stream. Data were indexed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and followed by density modification by RESOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) was used for viewing electron density maps and manual building. The initial structure was subsequently refined to a final R-value of 22.4% and free R-value of 29.1%. The quality of the structure was verified by PRO-CHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). None of the main chain torsion angles is located in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The statistics for the structure determination and refinement are summarized in Table I. The figures were generated with the programs GRASP (35Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar), SPDBView (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar), and MOLSCRIPT (37Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Two peptides (HR1 and HR2, Fig. 1, A and B) encompassing the N-terminal and C-terminal heptad repeats of the MHV spike protein assemble into a stable trimer of heterodimers (28Bosch B.J. van der Zee R. de Haan C.A. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8801-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The HR1 and HR2 regions of the MHV S protein consist of residues 968–1027 and residues 1216–1254, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The fusion core of the MHV spike protein was prepared as a single chain by linking the HR1 and HR2 domains via an eight-amino acid linker (GGSGGSGG, single amino acid abbreviation used here). The constructs and the encoded proteins were also called MHV 2-Helix (Fig. 1A). The preparation and characterization of the 2-Helix proteins will be reported elsewhere. 2Y. Xu, Z. Bai, L. Qin, X. Li, G. F. Gao, and Z. Rao, submitted for publication. The MHV 2-Helix forms crystals that have unit cell parameters a = b = 48.3 Å, c = 199.6Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120° and belong to the space group R3. The crystals contain two MHV 2-Helix molecules/asymmetric unit, and the diffraction pattern extends to 2.5 Å resolution. 2Y. Xu, Z. Bai, L. Qin, X. Li, G. F. Gao, and Z. Rao, submitted for publication. The crystal structure of the MHV 2-Helix was solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion from a single selenomethionyl derivative crystal. Four selenium sites could be located in one asymmetric unit from Patterson maps calculated using the program CNS 1.0 (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The experimental electron density map was easily interpretable in the helical regions. The model was improved further by cycles of manual building and refinement using the programs O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and CNS (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The structure was subsequently refined to a final resolution of 2.5 Å with an R-value of 22.4% and free R-value of 29.1%. The final model statistics are summarized in Table I. Description of the Structure—In the three-dimensional structure of the MHV 2-Helix, the fusion core has a rod-shaped structure ∼80 Å in length and a maximum diameter of 28 Å. The complex is a six-helix bundle comprising a trimer of MHV 2-Helix. The center of this bundle consists of a parallel trimeric coiled coil of three HR1 helices that were packed by three antiparallel HR2 helices (Fig. 2, A and B). The N terminus of HR1 and the C terminus of HR2 are located at the same end of the six-helix bundles, placing the fusion peptide and TM domains close together. A region of about 190 amino acids would be located at the other end of the six-helix bundle between HR1 and HR2. The linker and several terminal residues were disordered in both molecules. In one asymmetric unit, one molecule includes residues 970–1023 in HR1 and 1216–1252 in HR2, and the other molecule includes residues 969–1022 in HR1 and 1216–1254 in HR2. The two trimers are created by the same 3-fold axis of the crystallographic unit cells and are both parallel with the 3-fold axis of the crystallographic unit cells, and there is about 30 degrees rotation in the orientation parallel with the 3-fold axis between the two trimers. The root mean square deviation of the two molecules in one asymmetric unit is 0.36 Å. There is only one weak hydrogen bond between the two parallel trimers, from OH (Tyr1233) to O (Glu1254) with a distance of 3.34 Å. Residues 969–1022 of HR1 fold into a 15-turn α-helix stretching the entire length of the coiled coil. As in other naturally occurring coiled coils of the fusion core, the residues in the a and d positions of HR1 are predominantly hydrophobic (Fig. 1B). A sequence alignment of MHV with other representative coronavirus spike proteins shows that the residues at these two heptad repeat positions are highly conserved (Fig. 1B). Residues 1232–1247 of HR2 form a 5-turn amphipathic α-helix, whereas residues 1216–1231 and 1248–1254 form two extended chains at the N and C terminus of HR2, respectively. Each HR2 fits into the long grooves formed by the interface of the three HR1 helices, and no interaction is observed between individual HR2 helices (Fig. 2, A and B). The C terminus of HR2 ends with Glu1254, which is aligned with Gln970 of HR1; Gln970 is also the N terminus of the HR1 domain. The N terminus of HR2 starts with Asp1216, which is aligned with Ile1023 of HR1 (Fig. 2C). Linker between HR1 and HR2 and nMHV 2-Helix Structure—To verify whether the linker (GGSGGSGG) between HR1 and HR2 affects the natural structure of the MHV 2-Helix, we made a new construct (termed nMHV 2-Helix) that includes a shorter HR1 and longer linker. In the nMHV 2-Helix construct, the HR1 consists of residues 968–1017, the HR2 consists of residues 1216–1254, and the new fusion core was prepared as a single chain by linking the HR1 and HR2 domains via a 22-amino acid linker (LVPRGSGGSGGSGGLEVLFQGP), which is flexible and long enough to allow the HR1 and HR2 to form a natural interaction (Fig. 1A). The nMHV 2-Helix forms crystals in space group R3 with lattice dimensions of a = b = 51.6 Å, c = 198.2 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. The crystals contain two 2-Helix molecules/asymmetric unit and diffract x-rays to a resolution of at least 2.1 Å. The crystal structure of nMHV 2-Helix was determined by molecular replacement with the MHV 2-Helix structure as a search model. Rotation and translation function searches were performed in CNS (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The model was improved further by cycles of manual building and refinement using the programs O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and CNS (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The final R-value and free R-value for the refinement are 26.2 and 29.8%, respectively. The final model statistics are listed in Table I. The nMHV 2-Helix structure is largely similar to the MHV 2-Helix structure, with the exception of several residues at the N terminus of HR2 (Fig. 2C). The overall root mean square deviation between the two structures is 0.48 Å, which is calculated using the CCP4 program LSQKAB. The nMHV 2-Helix structure also contains two molecules/asymmetric unit. One molecule includes residues 968–1017 in HR1 and 1224–1254 in HR2, whereas the other molecule includes residues 970–1017 in HR1 and 1229–1254 in HR2. The linker is also disordered and cannot be traced in the structure. The N terminus of HR2 cannot be seen in the structure because the C terminus of HR1, which is important for binding the N terminus of HR2, has been discarded in the new construct. The linker is long and flexible enough, so we can conclude that both structures surely represent the natural structure of the complex of HR1 and HR2 because the choice of linker does not affect the real interaction between the two heptad repeat regions. We will focus our following structural analysis on MHV 2-Helix structure. Interactions between HR1 and HR2—Three HR2 helices pack obliquely against the outside of the HR1 coiled coil trimer in an antiparallel orientation. The HR2 helices interact with HR1 mainly through hydrophobic residues in three grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil trimer (see Fig. 4A). Sequence comparison between MHV and other coronavirus spike proteins shows that residues contributing to the HR1/HR2 interaction (e and g positions in HR1, a and d positions in HR2) are highly conserved (Fig. 1B). This pattern of sequence conservation can also be shown by a helical wheel representation of three HR1 helices and one HR2 helix (Fig. 1C). In this diagram, residues in the a and d positions of HR2 pack against residues in the e and g positions of HR1, mainly through hydrophobic interactions. Sequence comparison between MHV and HcoV-OC43 spike proteins shows that no nonconservative changes exist at the e and g positions of HR1, and only three such changes (L to I, L to F and I to L) occur in HR2 at the a and d positions. In contrast, 7 of 26 nonconservative changes occur at the outside f, b, and c positions in HR1, and 5 of 12 nonconservative changes occur at positions other than a and d in the helical region (1232–1248) of HR2 (Fig. 1B). Comparison with Other Fusion Protein Structures—The structure of the MHV fusion core was compared with the known structures of other viral fusion proteins (Fig. 3A). Although there are significant differences in the sequences, sizes, and structural properties of these viral fusion proteins, the similarities in their overall structures suggest a common mechanism for membrane fusion. These fusion core proteins are all trimeric coiled coils with the putative fusion peptides located at the N-terminal end of HR1 and the TM domains located at the C-terminal end of HR2 (7Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The three HR2 polypeptides that form the outer layer of the central core vary in conformation among these structures, but they always form α-helices and always pack antiparallel to the interior coiled coil. In this pattern, which has been proposed to be a fusogenic conformation, all of these fusion proteins would have their fusion peptides and TM anchors aligned at the same end of the coiled coil. There are three major differences between the MHV and other viral fusion core structures and their relevant regions, indicating unique features of fusion core structure in cor"

Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in several of these immune functions, and specifically it enhances the clearance of the pulmonary pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa secretes a variety of virulence factors including elastase, a zinc-metalloprotease, which degrades both SP-A and SP-D. Here we show that SP-D is cleaved by elastase to produce a stable 35-kDa fragment in a time-, temperature-, and dose-dependent manner. Degradation is inhibited by divalent metal cations, a metal chelator, and the elastase inhibitor, phosphoramidon. Sequencing the SP-D degradation products localized the major cleavage sites to the C-terminal lectin domain. The SP-D fragment fails to bind or aggregate bacteria that are aggregated by intact SP-D. SP-D fragment is observed when normal rat bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is treated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase, and SP-D fragments are present in the BAL of CF lung allograft patients. These data show that degradation of SP-D occurs in the BAL environment and that degradation eliminates many normal immune functions of SP-D.

Surfactant protein D (SP-D) 1The abbreviations used are: SP, surfactant protein; CF, cystic fibrosis; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; cfu, colony-forming units; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain. is one of the four surfactant proteins that is synthesized by alveolar type II epithelial cells as a component of the lipoprotein complex known as pulmonary surfactant. Although SP-D has not been shown to participate in the surface tension-reducing properties of surfactant, it has been demonstrated to participate in the host defense functions of surfactant (1Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). SP-D as well as SP-A belong to the collectin family of proteins, named for their N-terminal collagen region and C-terminal lectin domain. Intact SP-D consists of four trimers, which interact in their N-terminal region to form a cruciform structure (2Crouch E. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The collectins are pattern recognition molecules that bind, in a calcium-dependent manner, to non-self oligosaccharides presented on the surface of many bacteria and viruses. SP-D binds to several pathogens and in many cases enhances their phagocytosis by innate immune cells. For example, SP-D binds to Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, rough strains of Escherichia coli, and Salmonella minnesota (3Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Additionally, SP-D has been shown to bind other pathogens including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Pneumocystis carinii (4Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. White M.R. Eggleton P. Tauber A.I. Chang D. Sastry K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 5Hickling T.P. Bright H. Wing K. Gower D. Martin S.L. Sim R.B. Malhotra R. Eur. J.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2699-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Binding is mediated by interaction of the SP-D lectin domain with core oligosaccharides of lipopolysaccharide on Gram-negative bacteria or with surface glycoproteins on fungi and viruses. Binding of SP-D often results in organism aggregation, although SP-D does not aggregate P. aeruginosa (7Restrepo C.I. Dong Q. Savov J. Mariencheck W.I. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SP-D increases uptake of P. aeruginosa and a variety of other pathogens by alveolar macrophages in vitro (7Restrepo C.I. Dong Q. Savov J. Mariencheck W.I. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, infection of SP-D null mice with either Group B Streptococcus or Haemophilus influenzae results in decreased bacterial uptake by alveolar macrophages versus wild-type controls (8LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Gwozdz J.A. Richardson T.R. Fisher J.H. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SP-D null mice fail to clear influenza virus as effectively as controls (9LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5868-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (10Lyczak J.B. Cannon C.L. Pier G.B. Microb. Infect. 2000; 2: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa infections are characterized by a mucoid biofilm consisting mainly of secreted oligosaccharides. The lipopolysaccharide expressed by mucoid P. aeruginosa is of the rough phenotype and is less cytotoxic than that of other Gram-negative bacteria (11Liu P.V. J. Infect. Dis. 1974; 130: S94-S99Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Virulence is induced by P. aeruginosa via secretion of several enzymes, the most cytotoxic of which is exotoxin A, which directly inhibits protein synthesis (12Iglewski B.H. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition to this toxin, P. aeruginosa secretes several proteases including elastase (Las B), protease IV, Las A protease, and alkaline protease (13Lazdunski A. Guzzo J. Filloux A. Bally M. Murgier M. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Caballero A.R. Green L.C. O'Callaghan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Surfactant protein composition is altered in cystic fibrosis patients. Several reports have shown that whereas phospholipids levels are largely unchanged, the levels of both intact SP-A and SP-D are decreased (15Postle A.D. Mander A. Reid K.B. Wang J.Y. Wright S.M. Moustaki M. Warner J.O. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16Meyer K.C. Sharma A. Brown R. Weatherly M. Moya F.R. Lewandoski J. Zimmerman J.J.

J. 1997; 10: 1983-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Surfactant protein levels have also been shown to be altered in a rat model of P. aeruginosa infection, although SP-D levels were not measured (18Vanderzwan J. McCraig L. Mehta S. Joseph M. Whitsett J. McCormack D.G. Lewis J.F. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 1388-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously shown P. aeruginosa elastase degrades both SP-A and SP-D and that SP-A degradation fragments are present in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of cystic fibrosis patients after lung transplant (19Mariencheck W.I. Alcorn J.F. Palmer S.M. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Detectable levels of P. aeruginosa elastase have been found in the BAL and serum of CF patients (20Doring G. Obernesser H.J. Botzenhart K. Flehmig B. Hoiby N. Hofmann A. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 147: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, histologic studies have detected abnormal elastin fibers in lung alveoli of CF patients on autopsy (21Bruce M.C. Poncz L. Klinger J.D. Stern R.C. Tomashefski J.F. Dearborn D.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar), and P. aeruginosa elastase activity was detectable in sputum samples. These data suggest that SP-D is probably cleaved by elastase in vivo during the progression of CF. We propose that P. aeruginosa elastase cleaves SP-D to a stable 35-kDa fragment, which has impaired immune regulatory function. To test this hypothesis, we purified both P. aeruginosa elastase by ion exchange chromatography and its 35-kDa SP-D cleavage product by gel filtration chromatography. The cleavage site was mapped by Edman degradation. Purified SP-D fragment failed to aggregate, bind, or enhance the phagocytosis of several Gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. These studies demonstrate that the stable, 35-kDa fragment of SP-D, produced by degradation by P. aeruginosa elastase, has altered ability to regulate innate immunity. Animals and Reagents—All experiments utilizing primary culture cells were conducted with pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, Germantown, NY) ranging from 2 to 4 months of age. P. aeruginosa isolated from the sputum of CF patients was obtained from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratories at Duke University (S470); PA01 was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Phibbs (Eastern Carolina University, Greenville, NC); PA01 and PA01-B1 isolates were obtained from Dr. Barbara Iglewski (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). S. typhimurium was obtained from Dr. Ken Sanderson (University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta). E. coli HB101 was obtained from Dr. Clifford Harding (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where noted. Purification of P. aeruginosa Elastase—Proteases secreted by P. aeruginosa were isolated following the protocol of Coin et al. (22Coin D. Louis D. Bernillon J. Guinand M. Wallach J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 18: 175-184PubMed Google Scholar). A mucoid clinical isolate (S470) of P. aeruginosa that was found to degrade SP-A was grown in a 2-liter culture in nutrient broth (Difco) for 18 h at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Alginate was precipitated from the cell-free culture supernatant with 0.25 m CaCl2 for 2 h at 4 °C and removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then concentrated by ultrafiltration with tangential flow using the Minitan system (Millipore Corp., Marlborough, MA) with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane to a volume of 150 ml. The culture was then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.6 × 50 cm) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and bound proteins were eluted with a continuous linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m) in the same buffer. Pooled fractions were then analyzed by Western blot with a polyclonal anti-elastase antibody. The polyclonal rabbit anti-elastase antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Efrat Kessler (Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel). Pooled fractions containing elastase were then analyzed for purity by Coomassie stain and silver stain (data not shown). The elastase preparations contained only 1 band (38 kDa) by Coomassie staining and three bands (65, 38, and 25 kDa) by silver stain; however, the predominant band was the 38-kDa elastase as determined by densitometry. Purification of Rat Recombinant SP-D—Recombinant rat SP-D was purified by maltose affinity chromatography from the media of a stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line (23Dong Q. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 18: L97-L105Google Scholar). Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in serum-free medium for 10–12 days, and the culture supernatant was collected and dialyzed to remove glucose against maltose loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 pH 7.8. The dialyzed supernatant was then incubated with maltose-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The maltose-Sepharose beads were then poured into a column and washed with maltose loading buffer to remove unbound proteins. SP-D was then eluted from the column with maltose elution buffer, 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, and stored at 4 °C. Alveolar Macrophage Isolation—Alveolar macrophages were obtained by BAL of pathogen-free rats. Rats were killed by intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal (Abbott) followed by exsanguination; the trachea was cannulated, and the lungs were isolated and removed from the rats. The lungs were then lavaged six times to total lung capacity with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm EGTA previously warmed to 37 °C. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 230 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, low endotoxin (Sigma). Average cell yields were ∼6–8 × 106 cells/rat, and greater than 95% of the cells were macrophages. Degradation of Surfactant Proteins with P. aeruginosa Elastase—Rat recombinant SP-D in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus 2 mm EDTA was incubated with purified elastase in 30 mm TBS at varying concentrations, times, and temperatures as noted in the figure legends. Volumes used in these assays resulted in a 4–15-fold final dilution of the EDTA containing SP-D buffer. The resulting products were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot using a well characterized anti-SP-D antibody (24McIntosh J.C. Swyers A.H. Fisher J.H. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SP-A was obtained from the lavage of alveolar proteinosis patients as previously reported (25Tino M.J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L677-L688Google Scholar). Detection of SP-A degradation fragments was determined using anti-human SP-A antibody as previously reported (19Mariencheck W.I. Alcorn J.F. Palmer S.M. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cell-free, normal rat BAL was concentrated using an Apollo spin concentrator (Orbital Biosciences, Topsfield, MA), with a molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa. Aliquots of rat BAL were then incubated with purified elastase as indicated, and degradation fragments were detected by Western blot. Analysis of Lung Transplant BAL—BAL from CF patients who had received bilateral lung allografts were analyzed for the presence of SP-D and possible degradation fragments. Samples from the CF lung transplant recipients were separated under nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoreactive SP-D was detected using an anti-human SP-D antibody provided by Dr. Erika Crouch (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). SP-D Fragment Purification—SP-D (227 μg/ml) was incubated with P. aeruginosa elastase (150 μg/ml) for at least 24 h at 37 °C. The resulting solution was then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min to remove any large debris and applied to a Superose 6 high pressure liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). The sample volume was 200 μl, and the column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using TBS containing 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.60. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored throughout the run. Fractions were collected every minute and were analyzed by Western blot for intact SP-D, SP-D fragment, and elastase. Elastase was shown to separate from SP-D fragment (data not shown). SP-D fragment-containing fractions were then pooled and concentrated using the Apollo spin concentrator (Orbital Biosciences) to a final volume of ∼1 ml. Protein concentration was determined by the Nano-orange protein assay (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Sequence Analysis of SP-D Fragments—Recombinant rat SP-D (10 μg) was incubated with P. aeruginosa elastase (Elastin Products Co., Owensville, MO) (10 μg). The resulting solution was then analyzed via Edman degradation performed by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA). Aggregation of Bacteria by SP-D and SP-D Fragment—Bacteria were grown overnight on Nutrient Agar plates (Difco) and collected into 1 ml of L-broth. Colony-forming units (cfu) were determined by multiplication of absorbance at 660 nm times the calculated extinction coefficients for each isolate. The extinction coefficients were determined by serial dilution and counting of live bacterial colonies. A volume equal to 108 cfu of bacteria was suspended in 1 ml of TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.60. SP-D and SP-D fragment were added to the bacteria at the indicated concentrations, and absorbance at 660 nm was measured every 30 min for 180 min. Aggregation is observed as a decrease in absorbance as bacterial aggregates precipitate out of solution. Binding Assays with Intact SP-D and SP-D Fragment—Bacteria (108 cfu) were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 250 μl of TBS containing either 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.60. SP-D and SP-D fragment were added at concentrations of 1 and 2 μg/ml, and binding was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4 °C. The bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and washed twice with TBS. Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-rat SP-D IgG was then utilized to measure SP-D binding. Anti-rat SP-D IgG was purified from rabbit serum using a Protein A-Sepharose column (Pierce). Purified IgG was then dialyzed into Na2CO3, pH 9.0. FITC labeling of the antibody was then performed by adding 10 μl of FITC (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in dimethylformamide for 6 h at 4 °C. Excess FITC was removed by dialysis versus PBS. Labeled anti-rat SP-D was added to bacteria at a volume of 25 μl per 500 μl of bacteria in TBS plus 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.60, for 30 min at 4 °C. Bacteria were then washed twice with TBS, and fluorescence was measured at 495-nm excitation, 530-nm emission. Binding of SP-D was expressed as the relative fluorescence units above background levels. Phagocytosis of Bacteria as Measured by FACS Analysis—Bacteria were collected from nutrient agar plates and were resuspended in Na2CO3, pH 9.0. FITC labeling of the bacteria was then performed by adding 10 μl of FITC (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in dimethylformamide for 1 h at room temperature. Excess dye was then removed by washing of the bacteria three times with PBS. Bacterial concentration was determined by measurement of absorbance at 660 nm, utilizing known extinction coefficients. FITC-labeled bacteria were then frozen in aliquots with 10% glycerol or stored at 4 °C. Labeled bacteria were later thawed and then added to alveolar macrophages at a ratio of 5 × 107 bacteria to 5 × 105 macrophages in 250 μl of PBS plus 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Assay tubes were precoated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Phagocytosis was allowed to occur for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the cells were washed twice with PBS buffer. Finally, macrophages were fixed in 300 μl of 1% formaldehyde in PBS and analyzed for fluorescence by FACS. Data Analysis—All of the data presented in the figures were subjected to unpaired Student's t test analysis assuming unequal variances. All statistics were performed using the Microsoft Excel software package. Analyses with a resultant p < 0.05 were determined significant. P. aeruginosa Elastase Degrades SP-D Dose-, Time-, and Temperature-dependently—Our laboratory has previously reported that P. aeruginosa elastase degrades SP-D (19Mariencheck W.I. Alcorn J.F. Palmer S.M. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In order to characterize further the kinetics of degradation, we examined the effects of dosage, time, and temperature on elastase activity. SP-D (14 μg/ml) was incubated with increasing concentrations of elastase for 3 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). At the lowest dose tested, 7 μg/ml, elastase produced fragments, whereas greater degradation was observed with concentrations up to 140 μg/ml elastase. SP-D, 60 μg/ml, was then incubated with 112.5 μg/ml of elastase at 37 °C for various time points (Fig. 1B). Immunoreactive fragment was detected as early as 10 min after the addition of elastase. Finally, elastase at either 37.5 or 112.5 μg/ml was added to SP-D (60 μg/ml) for 3 h at 4, 25, and 37 °C (Fig. 1C). SP-D was poorly degraded by elastase at both 4 and 25 °C. These data show that P. aeruginosa elastase degrades SP-D dose-, time-, and temperature-dependently. P. aeruginosa Elastase Degradation of SP-A and SP-D Is Inhibited by Phosphoramidon—In order to confirm that the degradative activity observed in our elastase preparations was indeed due to elastase, we incubated SP-D (20 μg/ml) or SP-A (40 μg/ml) with elastase (75 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations (0.05–5 mm) of phosphoramidon, an elastase inhibitor, for 18 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2). Phosphoramidon inhibited SP-D and SP-A degradation dose-dependently. In addition, a colorometric assay (chromozym PL) specific for the P. aeruginosa serine protease, protease IV was performed to test the purity of our elastase preparations. The P. aeruginosa elastase utilized in these studies was negative for serine protease activity (data not shown). Furthermore, a commercial preparation of elastase resulted in production of an identical SP-D fragment. Degradation by commercial elastase was also inhibited by phosphoramidon at the same concentrations described above (data not shown). Divalent Metal Cations and EDTA Inhibit Degradation of SP-D and SP-A by P. aeruginosa Elastase—SP-A has been shown to bind to divalent cations via its C-terminal lectin domain (26Haagsman H.P. Sargeant T. Hauschka P.V. Benson B.J. Hawgood S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8894-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding of SP-A and SP-D to oligosaccharides has been shown to be calcium-dependent (27Haagsman H.P. Hawgood S. Sargeant T. Buckley D. White R.T. Drickamer K. Benson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13877-13880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Persson A. Chang D. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5755-5760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-D binding to oligosacchrides requires either calcium, magnesium, or manganese, whereas SP-A lectin binding requires either calcium or manganese. We examined the effects of calcium, magnesium, and manganese on degradation of SP-D and SP-A by elastase. SP-D or SP-A at 20 μg/ml were incubated with 40 μg/ml elastase in the presence or absence of either 2 or 10 mm divalent metal cations (Fig. 3A). Degradation of SP-D by elastase was inhibited by manganese > calcium > magnesium. Contrastingly, SP-A degradation was inhibited by calcium and manganese but only slightly by magnesium. We then tested the ability of the metal chelator, EDTA, to inhibit elastase degradation of SP-A and SP-D. SP-D (10 μg/ml) was incubated with 30 μg/ml elastase, or SP-A (40 μg/ml) was incubated with 75 μg/ml elastase in the presence or absence of increasing EDTA concentrations for 18 h at 37 °C (Fig. 3B). Degradation of SP-A and SP-D was inhibited by the metal chelator, EDTA. However, much higher concentrations of EDTA were required to inhibit SP-D degradation as compared with SP-A degradation. Purification of SP-D Fragment by Gel Filtration Chromatography—In order to examine the functional characteristics of the SP-D 35-kDa degradation fragment, we purified the fragment by gel filtration chromatography. SP-D (230 μg/ml) was incubated with 150 μg/ml P. aeruginosa elastase for greater than 24 h at 37 °C. The degradation solution was then applied to a Superose-6 fast protein liquid chromatography column in sequential 200-μl aliquots followed by successive elutions. SP-D fragment eluted from the column at an approximate mass of 400 kDa, suggesting a multimer. As shown by the Western blot under reducing conditions in Fig. 4, the degradation assay resulted in nearly 100% conversion of intact SP-D to the 35-kDa fragment monomer which was collected, pooled, and concentrated for use in functional protein assays. Sequence Analysis of the SP-D Fragments—Previous work in our laboratory has suggested that elastase cleaves SP-D in the C-terminal lectin domain (19Mariencheck W.I. Alcorn J.F. Palmer S.M. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To map the cleavage site, the SP-D degradation products were identified by Edman degradation. Sequencing identified five novel N termini generated by elastase cleavage of SP-D (Fig. 5). Cleavage of SP-D occurred at two alternate sites at the beginning of the lectin domain, Val-259 and Ala-267. In addition, two alternate cleavage sites were identified in the middle region of the lectin domain, Phe-323 and Trp-336. A fifth cleavage site was identified in the collagen domain of SP-D, Ile-112. The relevance of this cleavage was not determined. The SP-D Fragment Does Not Aggregate S. typhimurium or E. coli—Aggregation of bacteria has been shown to be an important immune function of SP-D that is mediated by the lectin domain of SP-D. In order to test the hypothesis that SP-D fragment would fail to aggregate bacteria, we incubated a clinical isolate (S470) and a laboratory strain (PA01) of P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, and E. coli with intact SP-D and SP-D fragment. Consistent with prior observations from our laboratory (7Restrepo C.I. Dong Q. Savov J. Mariencheck W.I. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), SP-D (2 μg/ml) did not aggregate P. aeruginosa (data not shown). SP-D at 1 μg/ml was effective at aggregating both S. typhimurium and E. coli, whereas the SP-D degradation fragment had no effect on either bacteria (Fig. 6). These data show that SP-D fragment no longer retains the lectin-dependent ability to aggregate bacteria. SP-D Fragment Fails to Bind to P. aeruginosa or S. typhimurium—The inability to aggregate bacteria suggests that the SP-D fragment may exhibit impaired binding to bacteria. To examine bacterial binding, we incubated SP-D or SP-D fragment at 1 or 2 μg/ml with bacteria. Binding was determined by detection of SP-D by fluorescently labeled antibody. Intact SP-D bound dose-dependently to both S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa (Fig. 7). The SP-D fragment at 1 or 2 μg/ml failed to bind to either bacteria. Due to the fact that SP-D fragment preparations contain EDTA and are more dilute than intact SP-D stocks, we confirmed that the lack of binding was not due to EDTA inhibition by adding SP-D fragment to bacteria in 10 mm CaCl2 buffer. SP-D fragment still showed impaired binding to bacteria in high calcium buffer. These results confirm that the SP-D degradation fragment does not have a functional lectin domain. SP-D Fragment Does Not Stimulate Phagocytosis of E. coli by Alveolar Macrophages—As a consequence of deficient aggregation and binding activity by SP-D fragment, we proposed that SP-D fragment does not enhance phagocytosis of bacteria by alveolar macrophages as does intact SP-D. Alveolar macrophages were incubated with FITC-labeled E. coli for 1 h at 37 °C. Uptake of bacteria was then measured by FACS. Intact SP-D dose-dependently increased uptake of E. coli as measured by mean fluorescence and percentage of positive cells (Fig. 8). SP-D fragment had no effect on uptake of bacteria by alveolar macrophages at either dose tested. These data combined with earlier results show that degradation of SP-D by P. aeruginosa elastase abrogates SP-D immune function. SP-D Fragment Increases Uptake of P. aeruginosa Deficient in Elastase Production by Alveolar Macrophages—In order to examine the potential contribution of elastase in abrogating SP-D-mediated uptake of P. aeruginosa, we tested the effects of intact SP-D on alveolar macrophage uptake of wild-type (PA01) and elastase deficient (PA01-B1) P. aeruginosa. Alveolar macrophages were incubated with FITC-labeled P. aeruginosa for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of SP-D. Intact SP-D had no effect on the uptake of wild-type PA01; however, SP-D dose-dependently enhanced the uptake of elastase-deficient P. aeruginosa (Fig. 9). These data suggest that the absence of elastase production by isolates of P. aeruginosa may alter the ability of SP-D to enhance phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W1978798271,"Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine that is required for T cell development and survival. The anti-apoptotic function of IL-7 is partly through induction of Bcl-2 synthesis and cytosolic retention of Bax. Here we show that the Bcl-2 homology 3 domain-only protein, Bad, is involved in cell death following IL-7 withdrawal from D1 cells, an IL-7-dependent murine thymocyte cell line. IL-7 stimulation resulted in the inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation at Ser-112, -136, and -155. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been implicated previously in Bad phosphorylation. In response to IL-7, the PI3K/Akt pathway induced phosphorylation at Ser-136 and -155, but Ser-112 was partly independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway, indicating an as yet unknown pathway in this response. Following IL-7 withdrawal, dephosphorylated Bad translocated from cytosol to mitochondria, bound to Bcl-2, and accelerated cell death. Thus, the inactivation of Bad contributes to the survival function of IL-7. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine that is required for T cell development and survival.

In humans, genetic defects in either IL-7Rα or γc or Jak3 are a major cause of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. More recently, studies in mice show that IL-7 is also required for mature T cell homeostatic survival and proliferation (6Schluns K.S. Kieper W.C. Jameson S.C. Lefrancois L. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 7Tan J.T. Dudl E. LeRoy E. Murray R. Sprent J. Weinberg K.I. Surh C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism of the survival effect of IL-7 has been partly attributed to the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which affects mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (9Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 782-790PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting other actions of IL-7 beyond the induction of Bcl-2. The pro-apoptotic protein Bax is a death inducer expressed in thymocytes (15Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), and overexpression of a bax transgene in the thymus inhibits thymopoiesis (16Williams O. Norton T. Halligey M. Kioussis D. Brady H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bax was implicated as a death-promoting factor in IL-7 signaling based on our observation that IL-7 inactivates Bax by preventing its translocation from cytoplasm to mitochondria (17Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and Bax deficiency rescues thymocyte development in IL-7Rα-deficient mice early in life (18Khaled A.R. Li W.Q. Huang J. Fry T.J.

However, beyond 8 weeks of life, Bax deletion no longer protects thymocytes from IL-7Rα deficiency (18Khaled A.R. Li W.Q. Huang J. Fry T.J. Khaled A.S. Mackall C.L. Muegge K. Young H.A. Durum S.K.

This suggests that another death mediator in addition to Bax counters Bcl-2 later in life following the loss of an IL-7 signal. Bad is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and belongs to the group of “BH3 domain-only” proteins that bind to Bcl-2 and block its function. Growth factors such as IL-3 can induce the phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112, -136, and -155 to promote cell survival (19Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol.

In the absence of survival signals, Bad is dephosphorylated, translocates to mitochondria, and blocks the survival function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in the outer mitochondrial membrane (19Datta S.R.

Bad is a potential apoptotic factor in T lymphocyte development because T cells from bad transgenic mice are highly sensitive to apoptotic stimuli (24Mok C.L. Gil-Gomez G. Williams O. Coles M.

A constitutively active form, Bad3SA/3SA (introduced as a transgene), induces lower thymic weight and reduces thymic cellularity (25Datta S.R. Ranger A.M. Lin M.Z. Sturgill J.F. Ma Y.C. Cowan C.W.

Bad null mice develop B cell lymphoma and show an increased incidence of pre-T cell lymphoblastic lymphomas after γ irradiation (26Ranger A.M. Zha J. Harada H. Datta S.R. Danial N.N. Gilmore A.P.

IL-7 has been reported to activate PI3K through its p85 regulatory subunit, which is recruited to the Tyr-449 residue of the IL-7Rα chain in murine B cells (27Venkitaraman A.R. Cowling R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This pathway could activate Akt and therefore inactivate Bad following IL-7 stimulation. Although the knockout of p85 does not reduce T cell development (28Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L. Yu J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), the knockout of the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ shows somewhat reduced thymic cellularity (29Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J.

We reported previously that a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K, which blocks multiple isoforms, induces apoptosis in pro-T cells (18Khaled A.R. Li W.Q. Huang J. Fry T.J. Khaled A.S. Mackall C.L. Muegge K. Young H.A. Durum S.K. Immunity. 2002; 17: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated the roles of PI3K and Bad in IL-7 signaling using D1 cells, a murine thymocyte cell line that depends on IL-7 for survival and proliferation. We observed that Bad was inactivated by IL-7, that it was capable of mediating apoptosis in these cells, and that its inactivation was partly through PI3K. Cell Culture—The IL-7-dependent thymocyte cell line D1 was generated from a p53 knock-out mouse (30Kim K. Khaled A.R. Reynolds D. Young H.A. Lee C.K. Durum S.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 274: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). D1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), l-glutamine (2 mm), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, β-mercaptoethanol (50 μm, Invitrogen), and murine-recombinant IL-7 (50 μg/ml, Peprotech). The retrovirus packaging cell line phoenix-Eco (31Nolan G.P. Shatzman A.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and cell-permeable Bad peptide were purchased from Calbiochem. Thymocytes from 6-week-old Rag-1-deficient mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were isolated by mechanical dissociation, and red blood cells were removed with treatment by ACK lysing buffer (BioSource). The isolated thymocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid and DNA Constructions—Retroviral expression vector pMIG was obtained from Dr. J. R. Keller, NCI, National Institutes of Health. The active murine Akt1 form was amplified by PCR from pcDNA-Lck(m/p)-Akt (a gift from Dr. H. G. Wang) (32Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and inserted into the pMIG vector. The dominant negative (DN)-Akt1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR strategies and cloned into pMIG. Bad expression vectors pcDNA-Bad WT and pcDNA-Bad3SA were generously provided by Dr. M. E. Greenberg (19Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The complete coding sequences of murine Bad WT or Bad3SA were amplified and cloned into the BglII/XhoI sites of the retroviral expression vector pMIG. The Bcl-2 retroviral expression vector was created by inserting human Bcl-2 cDNA into the EcoRI site of pMIG. Retroviral Infection—Retroviral constructs were transfected into the phoenix-Eco package cell line using FuGENE 6 reagent (31Nolan G.P. Shatzman A.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The retrovirus-containing supernatant was collected and loaded onto a Retro-Nectin (TaKaRa)-coated plate, and then the D1 cells were added and infected overnight. Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted after culture for 1 week, and the cell lines were established and analyzed. For an activated Bad construct (3SA) that eventually kills cells, green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted and analyzed 24 h after infection. Mitochondrial Protein Preparation—Cells were lysed in isotonic buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6.9) by Dounce homogenization. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and heavy membranes were spun down at about 1000 × g and discarded. The mitochondrial fraction was produced by pelleting at 12,000 × g for 20 min and washing the pellets once in isotonic buffer followed by a final resuspension in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl at pH. 6.8, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol) with 2% SDS. The recovered supernatant from the high speed centrifugation represented the cytosolic fraction (17Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates from 5 × 106 D1 cells were prepared in Triton X-100 lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The sample lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies specific for Akt, phospho-Akt-Ser-473, Bad, phospho-Bad-Ser-112, -136, and -155, secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and the Akt kinase assay kit were from Cell Signaling Technology. Hamster anti-mouse-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. Blots were probed with specific primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and then visualized by chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescent Western detection kit was purchased from Roche Applied Science. For immunoprecipitation, ∼2 × 107 D1 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium-deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) with protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of anti-mouse Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Cell Viability Assay—The MTT assay was performed to measure cell viability. D1 cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 105 cells/well and incubated for the indicated time. 8 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml, Sigma) was added and incubated for 4–6 h. Thereafter, 100 μl of solubilization solution (Promega) was added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The plates were read by spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 570 and 620 nm. Cell survival was also quantified by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with propidium iodide (33Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). At each time point, 106 cells were centrifuged at 1,200 × g, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 5 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma) in a hypotonic buffer (34Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar) at room temperature for 1 h, and then analyzed using flow cytometry. In Vitro Akt Kinase Assay—The Akt kinase assay was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol. Akt was immunoprecipitated with immobilized Akt1 monoclonal antibody from cell lysates. The Akt kinase activity was assayed by an in vitro kinase reaction containing ATP and GSK-3 fusion protein as substrate. The products of the reaction were analyzed by Western blotting with phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/Ser-9) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). IL-7 Activates Akt—Akt is the key downstream target of PI3K and is activated by phospholipid binding and dual phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473. To evaluate the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in IL-7 signaling, we first investigated whether Akt was activated by IL-7. D1 cells were deprived of IL-7 for 12 h and then stimulated with IL-7 for various times. Western blotting using anti-phospho-Akt-Ser-473 antibody revealed that Akt was activated by IL-7 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1A, IL-7 induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 within 5 min, and phosphorylation continually increased up to 2 h. We next examined the rate of dephosphorylation of Akt following IL-7 withdrawal. D1 cells were deprived of IL-7 for various times, and as shown in Fig. 1B, Akt phosphorylation sharply declined by 2 h after IL-7 withdrawal. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked IL-7-induced Akt activation in D1 cells (data not shown). Thus, IL-7 activates the PI3K-Akt pathway in D1 cells, suggesting this pathway could play a role in cell survival induced by IL-7. IL-7 Induces Bad Phosphorylation—We then examined the Akt substrate, Bad, to determine whether it could account for the survival effect of IL-7 via the inactivation of this proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Bad is inactivated by phosphorylation at three serine sites, Ser-112, -136, and -155, resulting in its sequestration by 14-3-3 (19Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 20Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). The Ser-112 and -136 sites are phosphorylated in response to IL-3 stimulation, and it has been proposed that this accounts for the survival signal generated by IL-3 (20Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). We examined whether IL-7 stimulation of D1 cells induced Bad phosphorylation at three serine residues identified by Western blotting using phospho-Bad antibodies against specific serine phosphorylation. It was necessary to overexpress Bad in D1 cells to visualize phosphorylation of Ser-136 or -155, whereas normal D1 cells were used to visualize Ser-112 phosphorylation. Overexpression of WT Bad did not kill D1 cells, and this result will be discussed further. As shown in Fig. 2, IL-7 induced Bad phosphorylation at all three serine residues, Ser-112, -136, and -155. After IL-7 stimulation, the phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112 started to increase within 5 min and reached a maximum in 1 h (Fig. 2A), whereas the phosphorylation at Ser-136 and -155 peaked an hour later (Fig. 2C). We then analyzed the rate of decline in Bad phosphorylation after IL-7 withdrawal. The level of Bad phosphorylation at Ser-112 was decreased by 2 h and was nearly undetectable by 6 h of IL-7 withdrawal (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation at Ser-136 and -155 showed a somewhat faster decline than at Ser-112, declining after 1 h and disappearing by 2 h (Fig. 2D). We assessed whether the Bad phosphorylation in response to IL-7 that we observed in the D1 thymocyte cell line also occurred in pro-T cells. Thymocytes from Rag-1-deficient mice are mainly pro-T2 and -T3 cells and are dependent on IL-7 for survival. Thymocytes from Rag-1-deficient mice were cultured in suspension for 8 h with or without IL-7. We observed that IL-7 promoted Bad phosphorylation in these pro-T cells in primary culture (Fig. 2E), verifying that Bad is phosphorylated by IL-7 signaling and could therefore regulate T cell survival. IL-7-induced Bad Phosphorylation Partially Depends on the PI3K/Akt Pathway—Akt is a principle kinase capable of phosphorylating Bad at Ser-136 in vitro and in vivo (21Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 35del-Peso L. Gonzalez G.M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). However, the kinases responsible for Ser-112 and -155 phosphorylation can differ between different cell types and stimuli. We assessed the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on Bad phosphorylation induced by IL-7 in D1 cells. After overnight deprivation of IL-7, the D1 cells were stimulated with IL-7 for various times in the presence or absence of LY294002. We observed that LY294002 blocked IL-7-induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser-136 and -155 (Fig. 3B). LY294002 only inhibited Ser-112 phosphorylation at the early time point (1 h) but not at the late time point (8 h) (Fig. 3A), suggesting that an additional pathway is involved for Ser-112. As an additional approach to determine whether the PI3K/Akt pathway could induce Bad phosphorylation at Ser-112, we stably expressed a constitutively active form of murine Akt1 containing the myristoylation/palmitoylation motif from the tyrosine kinase Lck (32Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The activity of this overexpressed Akt was verified by immunoprecipitation from the cell lysates and an in vitro kinase assay using the recombinant GSK fusion protein as a substrate (Fig. 4A). We compared the level of Bad phosphorylation at Ser-112 in D1 with that in active Akt-transfected D1. The status of Ser-112 phosphorylation did not increase in D1 cells expressing active Akt in the presence or absence of IL-7 (Fig. 4B), and thus active Akt could not replace IL-7 to induce Bad phosphorylation at Ser-112. Taken together, our findings suggest that IL-7-induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser-136 and -155 is PI3K/Akt-dependent, but Ser-112 phosphorylation is largely PI3K/Akt-independent.Fig. 4IL-7-induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser-112 is Akt-independent. D1 cells were stably transfected with the constitutively active Akt and cultured in the presence (+) or absence (–) of IL-7 for 12 h. Akt kinase activity was analyzed by kinase assay from D1 or the transfected D1 cells (A). Bad phosphorylation at Ser-112 was examined by immunoblotting from different dilutions of the cell lysates (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) IL-7 Withdrawal Triggers Bad Translocation to Mitochondria and Binding to Bcl-2—In healthy cells, phospho-Bad is associated with 14-3-3 and thus sequestered in cytoplasm. To initiate apoptosis, dephosphorylated Bad is released from 14-3-3 and translocates to mitochondria (20Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). After observing that IL-7 induced Bad phosphorylation, we measured Bad protein levels in cytoplasm versus mitochondria in D1 cells after IL-7 withdrawal. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the presence of IL-7, Bad was found mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas little was seen in the mitochondrial fraction. Withdrawal of IL-7 induced a rise in the Bad protein level in mitochondria by 2 h, and a large increase was observed by 6 h. Bcl-2 was constitutively present in the mitochondrial membrane fractions. We then investigated the effect of LY294002 on the intracellular location of Bad. LY294002 induced Bad translocation from cytoplasm to mitochondria (Fig. 5B), which could result from inhibition of phosphorylation of Bad Ser-136 and -155. Next, we evaluated Bad association with Bcl-2 after IL-7 withdrawal by immunoprecipitating Bcl-2 and immunoblotting for Bad. Indeed, we found that the binding of Bad to Bcl-2 increased in the absence of IL-7 (Fig. 5C). Therefore, on the loss of the IL-7 signal in D1 cells, Bad translocates to mitochondria and binds to Bcl-2. Bad Promotes the Death of D1 Cells—To determine whether Bad contributed to the death of D1 cells following IL-7 withdrawal, we first tested the effect of a cell-permeable Bad peptide on D1 cell survival. This peptide contains the BH3 domain of Bad and binds to Bcl-2 (36Wang J.L. Zhang Z.J. Choksi S. Shan S. Lu Z. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Korngold R. Huang Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1498-1502PubMed Google Scholar). D1 cells were treated with the Bad peptide or the control peptide in the presence of IL-7, and then after 48 h, cell viability was measured by the MTT colorimetric assay. The D1 cells treated with the Bad peptide displayed a 50% loss of viability, whereas the cells treated with the control peptide showed no survival effect (Fig. 6A). We first stably overexpressed WT Bad in D1 cells using retroviral transfection and measured cell survival by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis (34Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). We observed that WT Bad did not alter D1 survival in the presence of IL-7 but accelerated the death of D1 after IL-7 removal (Fig. 6B). D1 cells were next transfected with the constitutively active Bad, Bad3SA, in which the three serine phosphorylation sites had been mutated to alanine (19Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Fig. 6C shows that 66% of D1 cells bearing Bad3SA died 48 h after transfection even in the presence of IL-7, and more than 81% died after 72 h. These data indicate that activation of Bad could contribute to cell death following the loss of the IL-7 signal. Bcl-2 Blocks the Bad-induced Death of D1 Cells—Bad exerts its death-promoting effects in part by binding the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (37Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Because IL-7 induces bcl-2 (but not bcl-XL) transcripts in pro-T cells (11Kim K. Lee C.K. Sayers T.J. Muegge K. Durum S.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5735-5741PubMed Google Scholar) and in D1 cells (30Kim K. Khaled A.R. Reynolds D. Young H.A. Lee C.K. Durum S.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 274: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we therefore evaluated whether overexpression of Bcl-2 could replace the IL-7 signal. Stably transfecting D1 cells with a Bcl-2 retroviral expression vector indefinitely protected D1 cells from death induced by IL-7 deprivation for the long term. Only 2% of D1 cells expressing Bcl-2 died compared with 88% of normal D1 cells when deprived of IL-7 for 72 h (Fig. 7A). We then co-transfected Bcl-2 and Bad3SA into D1 cells, and as shown in Fig. 7B, Bcl-2 clearly rescued D1 cells from death induced by Bad3SA. Thus, IL-7 induces the synthesis of Bcl-2, which is sufficient to protect cells from activated Bad and IL-7 withdrawal. PI3K/Akt Pathway Prolongs D1 Cell Survival following IL-7 Withdrawal—The PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to promote the survival of a wide range of cell types (19Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Having shown that IL-7 stimulation activates Akt and inactivates Bad, we verified the overall survival effect of blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway. D1 cells were treated with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and cell survival was quantified by propidium iodid"

As expected for an Hsp70-substrate interaction, the formation of a stable complex between Isu and Ssq1 requires Jac1 in the presence of ATP. Here we report that a conserved tripeptide, PVK, of Isu is critical for interaction with Ssq1 because amino acid substitutions in this tripeptide inhibit both the formation of the Isu-Ssq1 complex and the ability of Isu to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssq1. These biochemical defects correlate well with the growth defects of cells expressing mutant Isu proteins. We conclude that the Ssq1-Isu substrate interaction is critical for Fe-S cluster biogenesis in vivo. The ability of Jac1 and mutant Isu proteins to cooperatively stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssq1 was also measured. Increasing the concentration of Jac1 and mutant Isu together but not individually partially overcame the effect of the reduced affinity of the Isu mutant proteins for Ssq1. These results, along with the observation that overexpression of Jac1 was able to suppress the growth defect of an ISU mutant, support the hypothesis that Isu is “targeted” to Ssq1 by Jac1, with a preformed Jac1-Isu complex interacting with Ssq1.

Hsp70 is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is well known for the ability to interact with a wide variety of partially folded proteins, although it functions in many different physiological processes (1Bukau B.

Like other Hsp70s, Ssq1 and Hsc66 do not work alone but in collaboration with a J-type co-chaperone, Jac1 and Hsc20, respectively (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results of in vivo and in organelle studies support the idea that Ssq1 and Jac1 function in Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Reduction of the activity of either Ssq1 or its J-protein partner Jac1 results in a dramatic decrease in the activity of enzymes containing a Fe-S cluster, an increased accumulation of mitochondrial iron (11Knight S.A.B.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of Ssq1 function in the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters is unknown, evidence indicates that Ssq1 (and Hsc66) uses the same basic biochemical properties as other members of the Hsp70 family to bind short peptide segments (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar, 5Craig E.A. Marszalek J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This substrate interaction is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis and modulated by J-protein co-chaperones that stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP, thus increasing the stability of the Hsp70-substrate interaction. Both Ssq1 and Hsc66 and their respective co-chaperones Jac1 and Hsc20 interact independently with Isu/IscU. In addition, Isu/IscU and Jac1/Hsc20 cooperatively stimulate Ssq1/Hsc66 ATPase activity, a strong indication that Isu/IscU is a substrate for the chaperone systems (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As expected of an Hsp70-J-protein-substrate interaction, Jac1 interacts with Isu independently of adenine nucleotide, although the interaction of Isu with Ssq1 is nucleotide-dependent (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Typical of an Hsp70-substrate interaction, Isu binds stably to Ssq1 in the presence of ADP, whereas no direct interaction between Isu and Ssq1 has been detected in vitro in the presence of ATP. Jac1, however, facilitates the formation of a stable Ssq1-Isu complex in the presence of ATP, suggesting that under physiological conditions when ATP concentrations are typically high, Jac1 may “target” Isu for Ssq1 binding. Such targeting of a protein substrate by J-type co-chaperone has been proposed for other Hsp70-J-protein systems (17Liberek K. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the basic biochemical characteristics of the Ssq1-Jac1-Isu interactions are similar to other Hsp70-J-protein-substrate interactions, the system is unusual in that Isu, as a folded protein, is a substrate for the chaperone system. Recent biochemical studies have identified LPPVK as a unique sequence within bacterial IscU, responsible for the specific interaction between IscU and Hsc66 (22Hoff K.G. Ta D.T.L.T.T. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

Single amino acid alterations within this sequence had profound affects on the ability of Hsc66 to interact with IscU. Moreover, the LPPVK sequence is conserved among members of the IscU/Isu protein family in both bacteria and eukaryotes, including yeast and human, suggesting that it might function as a conserved recognition signal for Hsp70s involved in the biogenesis of Fe-S centers. Although IscU/Isu proteins are clearly able to interact with their respective chaperone systems (6Silberg J. Hoff K. Tapley T. Vickery L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the biological importance of these interactions has not been tested. In E. coli, in which these interactions were first observed, redundant systems of Fe-S cluster assembly exist (24Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, it may not be surprising that inactivation of the Hsc66-Hsc20-IscU system has rather modest effects on cell growth (25Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In contrast, in yeast, in which redundant systems do not exist, cells lacking Isu are inviable. In addition, inactivation of the Ssq1-Jac1 system in yeast has strong phenotypic effects, a strain deleted for SSQ1 grows very poorly (27Schilke B. Forster J. Davis J. James P. Walter W. Laloraya S. Johnson J. Miao B. Craig E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and JAC1 is essential in most genetic backgrounds (28Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17524-17532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because both Isu and the Ssq1-Jac1 chaperone system are critical, mutations that lead to disruption of Isu-Ssq1 interactions would be expected to have strong phenotypic effects, if, in fact, this interaction is important for in vivo functions. Because of the identification of LPPVK as a sequence required for the IscU-Hsc66 interaction (22Hoff K.G. Ta D.T.L.T.T. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37582-37589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we tested ISU mutants encoding single amino acid alterations of this sequence. We found a positive correlation between the ability of LPPVK mutant proteins to functionally interact with Ssq1-Jac1 in vitro and the ability of the proteins to support growth in the absence of wild-type Isu. Moreover, our results provide evidence that Jac1-dependent targeting of Isu for Ssq1 binding requires direct interactions between Jac1 and Ssq1 as well as specific recognition of the three C-terminal residues of the Isu LPPVK motif by Ssq1. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Chemicals—Two proteins of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial matrix, Isu and Isu2, are related to bacterial IscU (12Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 30Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Isu1 and Isu2 are more than 80% identical and carry out very similar if not identical functions. A double isu1 isu2 deletion mutant is inviable, although the individual mutants are not; in particular, the isu2 mutant grows nearly as well as wild-type cells. In this study the double mutant having deletions of both ISU1 and ISU2 is referred to as Δisu and is isogenic to W303 (12Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mutations of ISU1 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange protocol, Stratagene), using wild-type ISU1 (–330 to +755) cloned in pRS314 that has a TRP1 marker (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. For overexpression studies, the mutants were subcloned to the TRP1-marked 2μ vector pRS424. Wild-type JAC1 (–350 to +840) was subcloned to the 2μ vector pRS426 that carries the URA3 marker. Null mutations in ISU1 were isolated by the following procedure. A mutagenized library of ISU1 was created by cloning PCR-amplified DNA using Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) with 0.5 mm manganese sulfate added to the reaction mixture into pRS314. The library was transformed into Δisu carrying a wild-type ISU1 gene encoding a six-residue histidine tag on pRS316. Individual transformants were tested for the ability to grow in the absence of the wild-type copy of ISU1 by patching them onto plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). 1The abbreviation used is: 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. Extracts were made from transformants unable to grow on 5-FOA, and Western analysis was performed to determine whether the mutagenized ISU1 expressed a stable, full-length protein product. The wild-type Isu migrated more slowly on SDS polyacrylamide gels because of the presence of the His tag. DNA was isolated from transformants expressing stable full-length protein using the MasterPure yeast DNA purification kit from Epicenter (Madison, WI). Plasmids, rescued by electroporating the DNA into E. coli (Bio-Rad), were transformed into yeast to verify the null phenotype. The sequence of candidate DNAs that retested as null mutants was determined (University of Wisconsin, Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI). Yeast were grown on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or on synthetic media prepared as described (32Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). All chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma.

Protein concentrations, determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay system with bovine serum albumin as a standard, are expressed as the concentration of monomers. All wild-type His-tagged proteins used in this study were able to functionally replace untagged protein. Functionality was tested by constructing strains in which the only copy of a gene encoding a particular protein was a His-tagged version harbored on the low copy plasmid pRS316 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of such strains was indistinguishable from their wild-type derivatives in medium containing different carbon sources at different temperatures (data not shown). Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—Glycerol gradient centrifugation was carried out as described previously (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Purified proteins (Isu, Jac1, and Ssq1) alone or in combinations were placed in reaction mixtures (70 μl) containing 2 mm ATP or 2 mm ADP and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Then, 70 μl of this mixture was loaded onto a 3-ml linear 15–35% (v/v) glycerol gradient prepared with 2 mm ATP or 2 mm ADP, as indicated, and centrifuged at 2 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor for 28 h at 46,000 rpm. Fractions (130 μl each) were collected from the top of the tube, and their protein contents were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Plots representing quantification of protein content were obtained by densitometry analysis using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Steady-state ATPase Activity of Ssq1—The release of radioactive inorganic phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP was measured as described (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures contained Ssq1 and other proteins, when indicated, in buffer A (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (2 μCi, Dupont NEG-003H, 3000 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 118 μm. Incubation was carried out at 25 °C and terminated at the indicated time points by the removal of 20-μl aliquots to an Eppendorf tube containing 175 μl of 1 m perchloric acid and 1 mm sodium phosphate. After the addition of 20 mm ammonium molybdate (400 μl) and isopropyl acetate (400 μl), samples were vigorously mixed, and the phases were separated by a short centrifugation. An aliquot of the organic phase (150 μl) containing the radioactive orthophosphate-molybdate complex was removed, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Control reactions lacking protein were included in all experiments. Alterations in the LPPVK Motif of Isu Protein Affect Cell Growth—To study the biological importance of the LPPVK motif of Isu (residues 132–136), we constructed mutant genes encoding amino acid substitutions in this region, such that each of the residues was replaced individually with alanine. In addition, a mutant encoding a triple amino acid substitution, replacing the three C-terminal residues of LPPVK with alanines (PVK-AAA), was constructed. To test function, a Δisu strain harboring a wild-type copy of the ISU gene and the URA3 marker on a centromeric plasmid was transformed with plasmids carrying a second selectable marker and a mutant ISU gene. Growth of cells containing both wild-type and mutant copies of ISU were indistinguishable from that of cells harboring only a wild-type copy of ISU (Fig. 1A), indicating that none of the mutant ISU genes displayed a dominant-negative phenotype under the conditions tested. To test the ability of the ISU mutants to support growth, the strains were plated on media containing 5-FOA. Only cells having lost the plasmid containing the URA3 gene, and therefore the wild-type copy of ISU, were able to survive on such media, thus allowing the growth phenotype of cells harboring only a mutant copy of ISU to be scored. Neither the triple mutant Isu(PVK-AAA) nor the single amino acid substitution mutants Isu(L132A) or Isu(K136A) was able to grow on 5-FOA medium (Fig. 1B). Isu(P134A) displayed a slow growth phenotype, whereas the Isu(P133A) and the Isu(V135A) mutants grew like the wild-type control. To ensure that any growth defects observed were caused by altered protein function rather than the level of expression, mutant ISU protein levels were measured using cellular extracts prepared from cells expressing wild-type Isu tagged with six histidine residues in addition to a mutant Isu. Because His-tagged Isu migrates more slowly than the untagged protein on SDS polyacrylamide gels, a direct comparison of protein levels of wild-type with mutant Isu was possible. All mutant proteins were present at levels comparable with the wild-type Isu (data not shown). Alterations in the LPPVK Motif Affect Isu Binding to Ssq1— To determine whether the growth phenotypes displayed by cells expressing mutant Isu proteins could be correlated with the biochemical properties of the proteins, we purified the mutant Isu proteins and tested their ability to bind Ssq1 using glycerol gradient centrifugation. Consistent with previous results (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), ∼23% of wild-type Isu co-fractionated in the gradient with Ssq1 (fractions 13–17) in the presence of ADP, indicating the formation of a stable Isu-Ssq1 complex (Fig. 2). Mutant Isu(L132A) and Isu(P133A) showed similar patterns of co-migration, with approximately 35 and 16% of Isu protein, respectively, bound to Ssq1. In contrast, mutant Isu(P134A), Isu(V135A), and Isu(K136A), as well as Isu(PVK-AAA), migrated exclusively at a position characteristic of Isu alone (fractions 4–8), suggesting that the three residues Pro134, Val135, and Lys136 in the LPPVK motif might play key roles in forming a stable interaction with Ssq1. To further address this question, we analyzed the interaction of the mutant Isu proteins in the presence of the J-protein co-chaperone Jac1 and ATP. Consistent with known Hsp70 biochemical properties, no stable interaction between Isu and Ssq1 was detected in the presence of ATP. As previously reported (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), however, the addition of Jac1 in the presence of ATP resulted in the formation of a stable Isu-Ssq1 complex that could be separated by glycerol gradient centrifugation from the Isu-Jac1 complex (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, ∼52% of wild-type Isu co-localized with Ssq1 in fractions 12–17. The rest of Isu co-migrated with Jac1 in fractions 7–10, indicating the formation of a stable Isu-Jac1 complex. A similar pattern was observed for Isu(L132A) and Isu(P133A), with approximately 42 and 54%, respectively, of Isu co-migrating with Ssq1. Thus, mutant Isu proteins having a substitution of either of the first two residues of the LPPVK motif were able to form a stable complex with Ssq1 in the presence of either ADP or ATP and Jac1, just like wild-type protein. A very different distribution of proteins was observed following glycerol gradient centrifugation of mutant proteins with changes in the last three residues (Isu(P134A), Isu(V135A), Isu(K136A), and Isu(PVK-AAA)) of the LPPVK motif (Fig. 2). In these cases only one peak, which co-localized with Jac1 protein, was observed, indicating formation of an Isu-Jac1 (fractions 7–10) but not an Isu-Ssq1 complex. Thus, consistent with the results obtained for the Isu-Ssq1 interaction in the presence of ADP, the formation of an Isu-Ssq1 complex in the presence of ATP and Jac1 was strictly dependent on the sequence of the last three amino acids in the LPPVK motif. Alterations in the LPPVK Motif Affect the Ability of Isu to Stimulate Ssq1 ATPase Activity—As an alternative measure of Ssq1-Isu interaction, we tested the ability of the mutant Isu proteins to stimulate Ssq1 ATPase. As shown previously, efficient stimulation of Ssq1 ATPase activity requires the presence of the co-chaperone Jac1 and the nucleotide release factor Mge1 as well as the substrate protein Isu (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Like wild-type Isu, Isu(L132A) and Isu(P133A) stimulated Ssq1 ATPase activity 5–6-fold under these conditions (Fig. 3). Moreover, increasing the mutant protein concentrations by 10–20-fold did not result in further stimulation of Ssq1 ATPase activity as was the case with wild-type protein. Thus, the ability of these mutant proteins to effectively stimulate ATPase activity was consistent with their ability to form stable complexes with Ssq1 (Fig. 2). All alterations of the last three residues of LPPVK affected ATPase stimulation but not to the same extent. No stimulation was observed in the case of Isu(PVK-AAA), whereas Isu(K136A) and Isu(P134A) stimulated ATPase activity 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively (Fig. 3), consistent with their inability to support robust growth. On the other hand, Isu(V135A), which is able to support robust growth, stimulated ATPase activity 5-fold when present at high concentration, equivalent to wild-type stimulation. Isu(P134S) and Isu(V135E) Are Strongly Impaired in Binding to Ssq1 As Well As in Stimulation of Ssq1 ATPase Activity— At first glance the behavior of the mutant proteins containing alanine substitutions for the last three residues of the LPPVK motif was consistent with a defect in binding Ssq1 because both their physical interaction with Ssq1 and their ability to stimulate Ssq1 ATPase activity were affected. The ability of Isu(V135A) to substantially stimulate Ssq1, however, albeit at a reduced level at least at low concentrations, was surprising because a stable complex with Ssq1 was not observed (Fig. 2). Yet, the substantial stimulation of Ssq1 ATPase by Isu(V135A) protein correlated well with the ability of Isu(V135A) to support rather robust cellular growth (Fig. 1). In addition, Isu(P134A), which showed a strong defect in both physical interaction and ATPase stimulation, could maintain viability of a Δisu mutant, although growth was severely compromised. To address these issues, we analyzed additional mutant genes Isu(P134S) and Isu(V135E) containing substitutions of Pro134 or Val135. Isu(P134S) was isolated in a genetic screen selecting for null mutations in ISU. Isu(V135E) construction was based on the sequence homology between known Isu/IscU proteins and NifU from Azotobacter vinelandii, an Fe-S cluster scaffold protein that functions in the assembly of the nitrogenase protein (34Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Although all known Isu homologues contain a valine at this position, NifU contains the sequence LPPEK. An analogous mutant of E. coli iscU was recently analyzed as well (23Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37582-37589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Neither Isu(P134S) nor Isu(V135E) was able to support cell growth (Fig. 1B). Moreover, neither of the mutant Isu proteins was able to form a stable complex with Ssq1, either in the presence of ADP or in the presence of ATP and Jac1 (Fig. 4A), but both mutant proteins were able to bind Jac1 as they co-migrated with it during glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4A). Neither mutant protein was able to stimulate ATPase activity even when it was present at 20-fold higher concentrations than the other proteins in the ATPase assay. Thus, results obtained in both in vivo and in vitro experiments for these two additional ISU mutants substantiated the importance of the last three residues of the LPPVK motif for proper functioning of the Isu protein. Therefore, we propose that the biochemical properties of the Isu mutant proteins having alterations in the tripeptide PVK, the last three residues of the LPPVK motif, explain the defective growth phenotypes displayed by cells harboring these mutant alleles. Presence of Jac1 Partially Compensates for the Lower Affinity of Isu Mutants for Ssq1—Stimulation of Ssq1 ATPase activity as well as stable binding of Isu to Ssq1 in the presence of ATP requires the presence of the co-chaperone Jac1. Because Jac1 forms a stable complex with Isu, it is quite possible that, similar to other known J-type co-chaperones, Jac1 is able to target substrate protein (Isu) for Ssq1 binding (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Jac1 is able to compensate for the"
https://openalex.org/W2042341745,"Cross-talk between Rho GTPase family members (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) plays important roles in modulating and coordinating downstream cellular responses resulting from Rho GTPase signaling. The NADPH oxidase of phagocytes and nonphagocytic cells is a Rac GTPase-regulated system that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) for the purposes of innate immunity and intracellular signaling. We recently demonstrated that NADPH oxidase activation involves sequential interactions between Rac and the flavocytochrome b558 and p67phox oxidase components to regulate electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen. Here we identify an antagonistic interaction between Rac and the closely related GTPase Cdc42 at the level of flavocytochrome b558 that regulates the formation of ROS. Cdc42 is unable to stimulate ROS formation by NADPH oxidase, but Cdc42, like Rac1 and Rac2, was able to specifically bind to flavocytochrome b558in vitro. Cdc42 acted as a competitive inhibitor of Rac1- and Rac2-mediated ROS formation in a recombinant cell-free oxidase system. Inhibition was dependent on the Cdc42 insert domain but not the Switch I region. Transient expression of Cdc42Q61L inhibited ROS formation induced by constitutively active Rac1 in an NADPH oxidase-expressing Cos7 cell line. Inhibition of Cdc42 activity by transduction of the Cdc42-binding domain of Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein into human neutrophils resulted in an enhanced fMetLeuPhe-induced oxidative response, consistent with inhibitory cross-talk between Rac and Cdc42 in activated neutrophils. We propose here a novel antagonism between Rac and Cdc42 GTPases at the level of the Nox proteins that modulates the generation of ROS used for host defense, cell signaling, and transformation. Cross-talk between Rho GTPase family members (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) plays important roles in modulating and coordinating downstream cellular responses resulting from Rho GTPase signaling. The NADPH oxidase of phagocytes and nonphagocytic cells is a Rac GTPase-regulated system that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) for the purposes of innate immunity and intracellular signaling. We recently demonstrated that NADPH oxidase activation involves sequential interactions between Rac and the flavocytochrome b558 and p67phox oxidase components to regulate electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen. Here we identify an antagonistic interaction between Rac and the closely related GTPase Cdc42 at the level of flavocytochrome b558 that regulates the formation of ROS. Cdc42 is unable to stimulate ROS formation by NADPH oxidase, but Cdc42, like Rac1 and Rac2, was able to specifically bind to flavocytochrome b558in vitro. Cdc42 acted as a competitive inhibitor of Rac1- and Rac2-mediated ROS formation in a recombinant cell-free oxidase system. Inhibition was dependent on the Cdc42 insert domain but not the Switch I region. Transient expression of Cdc42Q61L inhibited ROS formation induced by constitutively active Rac1 in an NADPH oxidase-expressing Cos7 cell line. Inhibition of Cdc42 activity by transduction of the Cdc42-binding domain of Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein into human neutrophils resulted in an enhanced fMetLeuPhe-induced oxidative response, consistent with inhibitory cross-talk between Rac and Cdc42 in activated neutrophils. We propose here a novel antagonism between Rac and Cdc42 GTPases at the level of the Nox proteins that modulates the generation of ROS used for host defense, cell signaling, and transformation. The process by which cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; cyt b558, flavocytochrome b558; WASP, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein; PBD, p21 Rho GTPase-binding domain of p21-activated kinase; CRIB, Cdc42 and Rac-interactive binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; fMLF, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; cyt b558, flavocytochrome b558; WASP, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein; PBD, p21 Rho GTPase-binding domain of p21-activated kinase; CRIB, Cdc42 and Rac-interactive binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; fMLF, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine. has gained much interest because of the diverse functions attributed to this class of molecules. In nonphagocytic cells, oxidants affect a variety of cellular processes, including transcription factor activation, proliferation, transformation, and apoptosis. In neutrophils and other phagocytes, oxidants play an important role in cellular innate immune responses. A critical component of the bactericidal activity of phagocytes is the NADPH oxidase, also referred to as “phox” (phagocytic oxidase) (1Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 15: 342-344Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 2Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem.

Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), which generates superoxide anion and, subsequently, a number of other ROS. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a multiprotein system whose activity is regulated by the RhoGTPase Rac2 in human cells (4Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2001; 100: 2692-2696Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Kim C. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Electrons are transferred from NADPH to molecular oxygen through the action of an integral membrane flavocytochrome b558 (cyt b558), composed of subunits gp91phox and p22phox. In addition to Rac2, the activity of the NADPH oxidase is regulated by the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox, which exist as a heterotrimeric complex in the cytosol of unstimulated neutrophils (7Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10121-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In a separate cytosolic complex are Rac2 (or Rac1 in certain species) and GDP dissociation inhibitor (8Chuang T.H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When neutrophils are activated, a series of interrelated regulatory events take place. p47phox becomes phosphorylated and mediates translocation of the p47phox/p67phox/p40phox complex to the plasma membrane (3Vignais P.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Rac2 and GDP dissociation inhibitor dissociate, followed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor-mediated exchange of GTP for GDP and membrane localization of Rac2 (9Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the membrane, p67phox and Rac2 interact with cyt b558 to form the functional NADPH oxidase complex. We have recently shown that Rac2 regulates NADPH oxidase activity via a two-step mechanism involving an initial functional interaction with cyt b558 to catalyze electron transfer to bound FAD, followed by a subsequent interaction with p67phox that results in electron transfer to the cyt b558-bound heme (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The formation of ROS in nonphagocytic cells also involves Nox (NADPH oxidase) enzymes (11Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Nox enzymes are a group of homologues of gp91, the large subunit of the cyt b558 in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (also referred to as Nox2). Recent studies on the Nox proteins indicate that the regulation of ROS production in nonphagocytic cells may parallel in many ways that of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system, including regulation by p22phox and by p47phox and p67phox or their homologues (14Geiszt M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Another similarity of ROS production by phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells is regulation by the Rac GTPase. The involvement of Rac2 in the NADPH oxidase of phagocytic cells has been confirmed by the generation of Rac2 and Bcr (a Rac GTPase-activating protein) null-mice (6Kim C. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Roberts A.W. Kim C. Zhen L. Lowe J.B. Kapur R. Petryniak B. Spaetti A. Pollock J.D. Borneo J.B. Bradford G.B. Atkinson S.J.

Pattengale P. Dorseuil O. Bokoch G.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Cell. 1995; 80: 719-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and through the use of Rac antisense oligonucleotides (18Dorseuil O. Vazquez A. Lang P. Bertoglio J. Gacon G. Leca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20540-20542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also substantial evidence that Rac1 is involved in controlling ROS production in nonphagocytic cells, although a direct link to Nox has not been reported (2Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For example, transient expression of constitutively active Rac1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts increased (O2·¯) production in Ras-transformed cells (19Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Rac1 and, specifically, the insert domain of Rac1 (amino acids 124–135), was necessary for (O2·¯) production and mitogenesis in fibroblasts (20Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Rac1 expression in NIH3T3 cells also led to increased (O2·¯) production in response to various growth factors and hormones (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor and angiotensin II) (21Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). A direct regulation of Nox function by Rac GTPase has been proposed (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between members of the Rho GTPase family (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) plays an important role in modulating and coordinating downstream cellular responses resulting from Rho GTPase signaling. Many such regulatory interactions between Cdc42, Rac, and Rho have been described in the context of cytoskeletal remodeling during motility, presumably resulting in the coordinated functioning of the cellular cytoskeletal elements to promote smooth, continuous motion (22Matozaki T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Burridge K. Science. 1999; 283: 2028-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Ridley A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-talk in Rho GTPase signaling occurs through a number of mechanisms. Individual Rho GTPase family members can modulate the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and/or GTPase-activating proteins that control the activity of other Rho GTPases. In addition, the ability of multiple RhoGTPase family members to interact with common effectors also allows for cross-talk. In motile fibroblasts, Rac1 prevents the phosphorylation of myosin light chain through its effector p21-activated kinase, which phosphorylates and decreases the activity of myosin light chain kinase, thus decreasing the contractile force exerted by Rho action (25Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This process serves to balance the protrusive forces generated by Rac and Cdc42, and the contractile forces initiated by Rho, a critical requirement for directional cell movement. To date, such complex interplay between Rho GTPases has not been described for Rac-mediated formation of ROS. In this paper, we identify cross-talk between Rac2 (and Rac1) and Cdc42 in regulation of ROS production by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. We show that this inhibitory interaction results from a competition between the active Rac2 (or Rac1) oxidase-regulatory component and the oxidase-inactive Cdc42 for binding to flavocytochrome b558. This antagonistic cross-talk between these Rho GTPase family members provides a novel mechanism by which oxidant production may be regulated in neutrophils and in other nonphagocytic cells. Proteins—Recombinant p47phox and nonprenylated Rho GTPases were expressed and purified as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). p67phox and prenylated Rho GTPases were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as previously described (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Uhlinger D.J. Inge K.L. Kreck M.L. Tyagi S.R. Neckelmann N. Lambeth J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin for use in enzyme assays. Rho GTPases were quantified and preloaded with guanine nucleotides as reported (27Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b558 was purified from human neutrophil membranes, relipidated, and reflavinated as reported to generate flavocytochrome b558, abbreviated as cyt b558 throughout (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—The deletion mutant, Cdc42 Δ124–135 P136A, was prepared using standard overlapping PCR and site-directed mutagenesis. Proline 136 was mutated to Ala, as was previously done for Rac2 Δ124–135 (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to avoid possible structural perturbations. Cdc42 K27A,G30S and Rac2 A27K,G30S were prepared using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In Vitro Binding Assay Using Purified Proteins—30–50 pmol of GST-Rac1, GST-Rac2, GST-Cdc42, or GST-RhoA (preloaded with either GTPγS or GDP) or an equivalent amount of GST were incubated with 5 pmol of cyt b558 and 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in 0.5 ml of Relax buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2) for 18 h with constant inversion at 4 °C. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed with Relax buffer before the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti gp91phox antibody that was kindly supplied by Dr. Mark Quinn (Montana State University). Cell-free Assay for Superoxide Production—Superoxide production was determined as the rate of superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochrome c reduction (29Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as in Ref. 10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar. Cell-free assays typically contained cyt b558 (2 nm), p47phox (140 nm), p67phox (50 nm), prenylated Rac1 or Rac2-GTPγS (15 nm), FAD (200 nm), cytochrome c (100 μm), and SDS (60 μm). Nonprenylated Rac1-GTPγS was used at a concentration of 130 nm when substituted for prenylated Rac1-GTPγS. The mixture (145 μl) was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C before the addition of NADPH (0.2 mm). An extinction coefficient at 550 nm of 21 mm–1 cm–1 was used to calculate the rate of cytochrome c reduction. Whole Cell Assay for Superoxide Production—Neutrophils were isolated from human venous blood donated by healthy donors as previously described (27Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 4 × 105 neutrophils were incubated with 100 μm cytochrome c in 200 μl of KRGH buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm dextrose) for 5 min at 37 °C. Superoxide production was induced with fMetLeuPhe (10–7m). For Cos-phox cells (a Cos-7 cell line that stably expresses the phagocytic NADPH oxidase components), 2.5 × 105 cells were incubated with 100 μm cytochrome c in 250 μl of PBSG buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 7.5 mm glucose). Cos-phox Cell Culture and Transfection—Cos-7 cells stably transfected with cDNA for p47phox, p67phox, gp91phox, and p22phox were maintained as previously described (30Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) was used to transfect 6 μg of total cDNA (pRK5m-RhoGTPases)/10-cm plate. Transfection efficiency (50%) was determined by transfecting cDNA containing green fluorescent protein and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The cells were harvested 21–24 h after transfection, and Western blot analysis was used to verify protein expression as described previously (30Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and a Cdc42 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Delivery of Proteins into Neutrophils Using Bioporter—pET23-wild type WASP-CRIB (amino acids 201–321) and non-Cdc42-binding mutant-WASP CRIB (F271C,H246D,H249D) were expressed as C-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins. These constructs were kindly supplied by Dr. Klaus Hahn (The Scripps Research Institute). The proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli and quantified by BCA protein assay (Pierce). The proteins were delivered into neutrophils as previously described (31Gardiner E.M. Pestonjamasp K.N. Bohl B.P. Chamberlain C. Hahn K.M. Bokoch G.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2029-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, Bioporter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, La Jolla, CA) was reconstituted with chloroform according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 2–3 μl was aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes and evaporated overnight. 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 30 μg of WASP-CBIB protein was used to rehydrate the Bioporter reagent. Neutrophils (3.0 × 106) in 900 μl of KRGH buffer were added, and the mixture was inverted for 1 h at 25 °C. Triplicate tubes were prepared for each protein, and bovine serum albumin was used in place of WASP CRIB as a reference for 100% activity. An aliquot (200 μl) of cells was removed after the incubation period, and cytochrome c (100 μm) and fMLF (10–7m) were added to measure the rate of superoxide production as described above. Transduction of Tat Fusion Proteins into Neutrophils—The pHis-Tat-HA-WASP-CRIB and pHis-Tat-HA-mutant WASP-CRIB (H246A, H249A,V250A,G251A,D253A) vectors were a kind gift from Dr. Jacques Bertoglio (INSERM, France). The proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni2+-agarose chromatography as described (32Haddad E. Zugaza J.L. Louache F. Debili N. Crouin C. Schwarz K. Fischer A. Vainchenker W. Bertoglio J. Blood. 2001; 97: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33Han H. Fuortes M. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) under nondenaturing conditions. The proteins were used immediately after removing imidazole by dialysis. Neutrophils (2 × 106) were incubated with 100 μg of Tat-WASP-CRIB or Tat-mutWASP-CRIB protein in 1 ml of KRGH buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. After 30 min, 0.2 ml of the cells were assayed for superoxide production. Cdc42 and Rac2 Interact with Cyt b558 from Human Neutrophils—We previously reported that recombinant Rac2 interacted with cyt b558in vitro as determined using changes in the fluorescence of Rac-bound mant-GppNHp (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In support of this result, we observed that cyt b558 binds to prenylated GST-Rac2 in pull-down assays (Fig. 1A). The interaction of cyt b558 with Rac2 was only slightly enhanced when Rac2 was loaded with GTP versus GDP. Binding did not occur to GST alone or to GST-RhoA. Prenylated GST-Rac1 behaved similarly when substituted for Rac2 (data not shown). Interestingly, however, we observed that cyt b558 bound to prenylated GST-Cdc42 in a manner that was also insensitive to the nucleotide state of Cdc42. This was unexpected, because Cdc42 has been shown to be unable to activate the NADPH oxidase (27Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Kwong C.H. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. Leto T.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19868-19872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both GST-Rac2 and GST-Cdc42 pulled down the intact cyt b558 heterodimer (Fig. 1B). Cyt b558 could be detected in these assays using GST-Rac2:cyt b558 ratios in the range of 2–10. In the cell-free assays a Rac:cyt b558 ratio of 5 was required for maximal activity using prenylated Rac2 or Rac1 (Fig. 1C). Mutation of the Switch 1 Region of Cdc42 Enables Activation of the NADPH Oxidase—Kwong et al. (35Kwong C.H. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19868-19872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported that by mutating Cdc42 at two residues (K27A and S30G) in the Switch I domain, Cdc42 could now mimic Rac1 in activating the NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system. The amino acids at positions 27 and 30 have been shown to be critical for the interaction between Rac and p67phox in the derived crystal structure (36Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and these residues are conserved in Rac1 and Rac2 but not Cdc42 or RhoA. We verified that the K27A,S30G Cdc42 mutant was as effective as Rac2 in supporting NADPH oxidase activity in our system (Fig. 2). This result implies that if any other domain(s) of Rac are important for NADPH oxidase function, then those domains must be functionally conserved in Cdc42, because mutating only the two Switch I residues enables Cdc42 to be fully active in the oxidase system. One such oxidase regulatory region is the insert domain of Rac. As noted previously, this region is involved in regulation of NADPH oxidase activity (10Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates that the insert region (amino acids 124–135) of prenylated Rac2 and Cdc42 was necessary for their interaction with cyt b558. We therefore hypothesized that Cdc42 might compete with Rac for binding to cyt b558 through this region and thus inhibit superoxide production through the formation of a nonfunctional NADPH oxidase complex.Fig. 3The insert domain of Rac2 and Cdc42 is required for their interaction with cytochrome b558. Prenylated GST-Rho GTPases (50 pmol) were preloaded with either GTPγS or GDP and incubated with cyt b558 (5 pmol) purified from human neutrophil membranes. The GST fusion proteins were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose, and the precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using an anti-gp91phox antibody.

Purified cyt b558 from neutrophil membranes, reconstituted with FAD, was incubated with recombinant p47phox, p67phox, Rac2-GTP, and varying concentrations of Cdc42 in the presence of SDS as activator. As shown in Fig. 4A (curve a), using prenylated Rho GTPases, inclusion of Cdc42-GTP in this system inhibited the rate of superoxide production. Cdc42 in the GDP-bound form was also inhibitory but to a slightly lesser degree (curve b), consistent with somewhat decreased binding to cyt b558. When a 5-fold higher concentration of Rac was used in the assay, the degree of inhibition by Cdc42-GTP was decreased (curve c). In contrast to Cdc42, RhoA-GTP over the same concentration range was not inhibitory (curve d). To test the role of the Cdc42 insert domain in this inhibitory effect, we made a deletion mutant of prenylated Cdc42 (Cdc42 Δins) that lacks the insert domain (amino acids 124–135) and used this in place of wild type Cdc42 in our assays. Cdc42 Δins in the GTP bound form was not inhibitory at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. 4B), indicating that the cyt b558-binding insert domain of Cdc42 is required for competition with Rac2 for cyt b558 binding. Prenylated Cdc42WT was also inhibitory when either prenylated Rac1-GTPγS (Fig. 4C) or nonprenylated Rac1-GTPγS (Fig. 4D) was substituted for prenylated Rac2, indicating that Cdc42 also competes with Rac1. The insert domain of prenylated Cdc42 was also required for its ability to inhibit Rac1-dependent superoxide production by the cell-free system (Fig. 4, C and D) Nonprenylated Cdc42 was not inhibitory in any of the cell-free assays. This may reflect the need for the strong association of Cdc42 with the plasma membrane afforded by the additional prenyl group to effectively compete with the higher affinity Rac binding to cyt b558. Rac and Cdc42 Antagonize Each Other at the Level of Cyt b558 Binding—To determine whether the competition between Rac and Cdc42 in the cell-free system occurs because of competition for cyt b558 binding, we included increasing amounts of untagged, prenylated Cdc42 in a GST-Rac2 pull-down of cyt b558. As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of cyt b558 pulled down by GST-Rac2 decreased as the amount of Cdc42 in the assay increased. A similar result was observed when untagged, prenylated Rac2 was included in the pull-down of cyt b558 by GST-Cdc42 and when Rac1 (prenylated or nonprenylated) was substituted for Rac2. Cdc42 Inhibits Rac-induced Oxidant Production in Cos7-phox Cells—To assess whether Cdc42 was capable of inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity in vivo, we used a genetically engineered Cos7 cell line (Cos-phox cells) (30Price M.O.

This cell line expresses endogenous Rac1 and generates little or no superoxide under nonstimulated conditions (Fig. 6, bar A). However, as reported (30Price M.O. McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C.H. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), transfection of constitutively active Rac1Q61L into these cells resulted in superoxide production without any additional stimulation (bar B). Co-transfection of Rac1Q61L plus Cdc42Q61L into these cells resulted in ∼50% inhibition of the superoxide formation observed with Rac1Q61L alone (bar C). This level of inhibition is consistent with the efficiency of transfection of both of these Rho GTPases in the Cos-phox cells, which we determined to be ∼50%. The hypothesis that the insert domain of Cdc42 is involved in the inhibition of oxidase activity was further supported by the observation that transfection of Cdc42Q61LΔins along with Rac1Q61 L resulted in only ∼10% inhib"

The AR conveys both trans-activation and trans-repression functions, which together contribute to prostate cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Like histone H3, the AR is post-translationally modified by both acetylation and phosphorylation. The histone acetyltransferase p300 transactivates the AR and directly acetylates the AR in vitro at a conserved motif. Point mutations of the AR acetylation motif that abrogate acetylation reduce trans-activation by p300 without affecting the trans-repression function of the AR. The current studies assessed the functional relationship between acetylation and phosphorylation of the AR. Herein trans-activation of the AR acetylation site mutants were enhanced by the p42/p44 MAPK pathway but were defective in regulation by protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. PKA inhibition augmented ARwt activity but not AR acetylation mutant gene reporter activity and association at an androgen response element in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Mutations of the lysine residues at the AR acetylation site reduced trichostatin A (TSA) responsiveness and ligand-induced phosphorylation of the AR. The AR acetylation site mutant formed ligand-induced phosphorylation-dependent isoforms with distinguishable characteristics from wild type AR as determined with two-dimensional electrophoresis.

O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, interactions with corepressors maintain the receptor in an inactive state. The AR is expressed in a variety of cell types and plays an important role in development, male sexual differentiation, and prostate cellular proliferation. The functional domains of the AR (termed A-F) are conserved with other members of the “classic” receptor subclass. The C-terminal region of the AR, including the hinge region and ligand-binding domain (LBD) is responsible for ligand binding and dimerization. The well conserved DNA binding domain consists of 68 amino acids with two zinc finger structures. The N-terminal region contributes to transcriptional activation through its activation function 1 (2Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast to several other hormone-regulated nuclear receptors, the AR lacks an intrinsic activation function 2 function in the LBD. The LBD, which consists of twelve α-helices, projects away from the hormone-binding pocket in the absence of ligand and undergoes substantial conformational changes in the presence of ligand (3Marhefka C.A.

The folding of the most C-terminal helix 12 (H12) over the ligand-binding pocket in turn creates new structural surfaces that bind coactivators required for efficient trans-activation. The AR conveys both trans-repression and trans-activation function. Coactivators, including the p160 proteins, the p300/CBP family, Ubc-9, ARA 70, ARA 55, BRCA1, and TIP60 (2Alen P. Claessens F.

The efficient recruitment of coactivators to the AR involves an association between both the AR N terminus and the LBD, suggesting that substantial folding of the AR occurs to form the transcriptionally competent receptor (2Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The CREB-binding protein (CBP), and the orthologue p300 (CBP/p300), form a physical bridging function between the DNA-bound transcription factor and the basal apparatus and contribute to the assembly of high molecular weight “enhanceosomes” (reviewed in Ref. 9Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). p300/CBP convey enzymatic activity toward histones, with the relative activity correlating under certain circumstances with their transcriptional coactivator function. Acetylation facilitates binding of transcription factors to specific target DNA sequences by destabilizing nucleosomes bound to the promoter region of a target gene. Direct acetylation of nonhistone proteins, including transcription factors, regulates AR activity (reviewed in Refs. 10Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Together these studies suggested the lysine motif of the AR may serve as an important regulator of coactivator/corepressor binding and acetylation of the AR may be involved in regulating ligand-dependent activity. Activity of the steroid receptors is also regulated by direct phosphorylation through distinct kinases. The estrogen receptor (ERα) is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways (19Martin L.A. Farmer I. Johnston S.R. Ali S. Marshall C. Dowsett M.

Post-translational modification by acetylation and phosphorylation under several circumstances may be integrated processes (29Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J.Y. Allis C.D.

Evidence supporting a model that these two post-translational processes may be convergent includes studies of the immediate early (IE) genes such as ternary complex factor (TCF) and histone H3. Contemporaneous with IE gene induction, histone acetylation spanning several nucleosomes is observed. Almost invariably a second nucleosomal modification that occurs upon IE gene induction is the phosphorylation of histone H3 (32Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol.

Histone H3 is itself both acetylated and phosphorylated, and phosphorylated H3 is more sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) than nonphosphorylated H3 (34Zhong S. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), providing strong evidence that these two events can be convergent. CREB phosphorylation is augmented indirectly upon activation of the PKA pathway through histone acetylase-regulated alterations in the local chromatin (35Lu Q. Hutchins A.E. Doyle C.M. Lundblad J.R.

The possibility that nuclear receptors themselves may be the direct target of interdependent acetylation/phosphorylation events remained to be determined. In previous studies, AR acetylation site alanine substitution mutants conveyed wild type trans-repression of SP-1 and NFκB activity, bound ligand with wild type affinity, and were sumoylated like the wild type receptors. However, induction by the HDAC inhibitor TSA and activation by the p300 coactivator binding was reduced in cultured cells (4Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L.

In view of previous studies suggesting H3 phosphorylation and acetylation may be linked events, we investigated the functional significance of the AR lysine residue motif in signaling by the kinases MAPKK, AKT, and PKA. Mutation of the AR acetylation site did not affect MAPK signaling to the AR. However, the AR acetylation site mutants were defective in regulation by the HDAC inhibitor TSA and by cAMP and AKT signaling. Inhibition of cAMP signaling augmented recruitment of the ARwt to the ARE of the PSA promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays but failed to induce recruitment of the AR acetylation site mutant. Point mutations of six distinct AR phosphorylation sites identified one phosphorylation site regulating HDAC responsiveness. In contrast to the three phosphorylation-dependent isoforms of the wild type AR (110, 112, and 114 kDa), the acetylation mutations lacked the 114-kDa hyper-phosphorylated form, suggesting acetylation and phosphorylation of the AR are functionally convergent events. These studies suggest that the conserved AR lysine residues that are acetylated in vitro and in cultured cells may play a role in coordinating a subset of kinase modules signaling to the AR.

The prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP and the HEK293T cell line were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells in a 24-well plate on the day prior to transfection with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The DNA/LipofectAMINE mix was added to the cells in Opti-Mem. Cells were incubated in media containing 10% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum prior to experimentation using dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (4Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H.

The 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, N-2-(p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89), and PD98059 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem International) were reconstituted and stored as recommended by the manufacturer. At least two different plasmid preparations of each construct were used. In cotransfection experiments, a dose response was determined in each experiment with 150 and 300 ng of expression vector and the promoter reporter plasmids (1.2 μg). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection using β-galactosidase reporters as an internal control. Luciferase assays were performed at room temperature using an Autolumat LB 953 (EG&G Berthold). The -fold effect was determined for 150-300 ng of expression vector with comparison made to the effect of the empty expression vector cassette and statistical analyses was performed using the Mann Whitney U test. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Western Blots—Preparation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from the transfected cells was performed essentially as described previously (40Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.W. Karnezis A.N. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12861-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in Western blot analysis were to the AR (N-20, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and to the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (a generous gift from Dr. Perry Bickel, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), which was used as an internal control for protein abundance. For detection of protein, the membrane was incubated with anti-AR (N-20, 1:2000) at room temperature for 2 h. The blots were then washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. Proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The abundance of immunoreactive protein was quantified by phosphorimaging using an ImageQuaNT version 1.11 computing densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Two-dimensional Gradient Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional PAGE was performed as described by O'Farrell (42O'Farrell P.H. O'Farrell P.Z. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3ARwt and pcDNA3-ARK630A plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method. Five hours after transfection, the medium was changed to phenol-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and cells were treated either with DHT (100 nm) or vehicle for 24 h. Cell lysate containing 0.5 mg of total protein was pre-cleared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-AR antibody and protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with the protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science, catalog #1836145)) and were washed twice with ddH2O. The immunoprecipitated AR protein was eluted from the bead with 280 μl of rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% (W/V) CHAPS, 2% IPG buffer (carrier ampholyte mixture) (pH 4.7), 7 mg/2.5 ml DTT, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue), and 250 μl was applied to the Immobiline DryStrip (Amersham Biosciences, pH 4-7, 13 cm). The gel strip was then overlaid with 2.5 ml of IPG Cover Fluid, and rehydration was allowed to occur overnight at room temperature in the Immobiline DryStrip Reswelling Tray. The first dimension isoelectric focusing was run on a Multiphor II (Amersham Biosciences) flat bed electrophoresis tank equipped with the Immobiline DryStrip kit as described by the manufacturer. The gel strip was then equilibrated and secured with 0.5% agarose in SDS-PAGE sample buffer on top of the stacking gel of a 1.5-mm-thick, 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP Assay)—ChIP analysis was performed following a protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology under modified conditions. HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped serum for 3 days prior to treatment. After stimulation, the cells were cross-linked by adding 1.0% formaldehyde buffer containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA-Na (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EGTA-Na, Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) directly to culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, the cells were washed twice using ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm DTT and protease inhibitors. The cells were then lysed with 1% SDS lysis buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp, and the samples were diluted to 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). To reduce nonspecific background, cell pellet suspension was pre-cleared with 60 μl of Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein-A-agarose-50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Chromatin solutions were precipitated overnight at 4 °C using 4 μg of anti-FLAG (M2 antibody, Sigma), (Upstate Biotechnology) with rotation. For a negative control, mouse IgG was immunoprecipitated by incubating the supernatant fraction for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. 60 μl of Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein-A-agarose slurry was added for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation to collect the antibody-histone complex and washed extensively following the manufacturer's protocol. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-linking. After proteinase K digestion for 1 h, DNA was extracted using a Qiagen spin column kit. Precipitated DNAs were analyzed by PCR of 30 cycles. The following primers were used for PCR to identify the androgen-responsive element in the human PSA promoter: 5′-ACAGACCTACTCTGGAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-AAGACAGCAACACCTTTTT-3′. Immunofluorescence Staining—Expression vectors for pcMV10FLAG-ARwt, FLAG-ARK630A, FLAG-ARK632/633A, or FLAG-ARK630Q were transfected into LNCaP cells using Genejuice transfection reagents (Novagen). The cells were then treated with vehicle or 100 nm DHT for 24 h, washed with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Anti-FLAG (rabbit M2, Sigma, 1:100) or anti-PSA monoclonal antibody were applied for detection of FLAG-AR and PSA expression after brief permeabiliz"

TRESK-2 mRNA was also expressed in mouse and human tissues. In COS-7 cells transfected with TRESK-2 DNA, a time-independent and noninactivating K+-selective current was recorded. TRESK-2 was insensitive to 1 mm tetraethylammonium, 100 nm apamin, 1 mm 4-aminopyridine, and 10 μm glybenclamide. TRESK-2 was inhibited by 10 μm quinidine, 20 μm arachidonate and acid (pH 6.3) at 49, 43, and 23%, respectively. Single channel openings of TRESK-2 showed marked open channel noise. In symmetrical 150 mm KCl, the current-voltage relationship of TRESK-2 was slightly inwardly rectifying, with the single channel conductance 13 picosiemens (pS) at +60 mV and 16 pS at –60 mV. In inside-out patches, TRESK-2 was unaffected by the intracellular application of 10 μm guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).

Searching the DNA data base for sequences homologous to previously cloned K+ channels led to identification of the class now referred to as tandem-pore or two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels (1Ketchum K.A.

Many of these K2P channel are able to form functional K+ channels when expressed in oocytes or mammalian cells. Those K2P channels that form functional K+ channels exhibit interesting electrophysiological and pharmacological properties. For example, TASK-1 and TASK-3 are active at rest, highly sensitive to extracellular pH and oxygen concentration (22Buckler K.J. Williams B.A. Honore E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 135-142Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and activated by volatile anesthetics (23Patel A.J. Honore E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat.

TREK-1 and TREK-2 are activated by free fatty acids, protons, increased membrane tension, heat, and volatile anesthetics (25Patel A. Honore E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 26Kim D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 648-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These channels are functionally expressed in many regions of the brain and in certain peripheral tissues, suggesting that they may be involved in a variety of biological functions including transduction of metabolic changes into electrical events. TALK-1 and TALK-2 are expressed in human pancreas and are active at rest, suggesting that they may regulate membrane-potential sensitive secretion of pancreatic hormones (15Girard C. Duprat F.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C529-C538Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The most recently identified member of the K2P channel family is TRESK-1 (TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel), named so because its mRNA was expressed solely in the human spinal cord (21Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When expressed in L929 cells, TRESK-1 has been reported to form a functional K+ channel that has properties of a background (or leak) K+ channel. Thus, TRESK-1 shows basal activity at physiological membrane potentials, activates rapidly upon depolarization (and shows little inactivation), and is likely to contribute to the resting membrane potential in those cells that express it. As each K2P channel subfamily has at least two members, we hypothesized that there may exist other genes that encode TRESK isoforms. When the GenBank™ data base was searched for sequences homologous to TRESK-1, we found within mouse chromosome 19 (accession number AC139040) a DNA sequence that shared 65% amino acid identity with TRESK-1 and two K+ channel signature sequences (TVGYG and TIGFG) in the two poreforming regions. We named this potentially novel K2P channel TRESK-2. The aim of this work was therefore to clone TRESK-2, which could be a new member of the TRESK subfamily, and study its tissue expression and electrophysiological properties. Our results show that TRESK-2 is a functional member of the K2P channel family. TRESK-2 mRNA was expressed in many tissues and was particularly in abundance in rat spleen and thymus. Transfection of TRESK-2 DNA into COS-7 cells produced functional K+ channels that were active at rest and did not inactivate or desensitize. Thus, TRESK-2 possesses properties of a background K+ channel that serves to set the resting membrane potential in those cells that express it. cDNA Cloning—A BLASTN search using the TRESK-1 K+ channel sequence revealed a homologous sequence present in mouse chromosome 19 (GenBank™ accession number AC139040) and a mouse sequence (accession number XM285304) that was similar to that in chromosome 19. The mouse DNA sequence was not obtained from cDNA derived from mRNA but was predicted by automated computational analysis from an annotated genomic sequence (NT-039692) using the gene prediction method GNOMON. Therefore, it was not known whether the DNA sequence represented by the two accession numbers encoded a functional protein. To obtain the full-length TRESK-2 cDNA, we used several sets of primers complementary to the start and end of the coding sequences. The first strand cDNA from mouse testis was prepared and used for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using the Superscript system (Invitrogen). We were successful in obtaining two overlapping DNA fragments using two sets of primer pairs. The first primer pair (5′-ATGGAGGCTGAGGAGCCACCTGAG-3′ and 5′-AAAGGAGAGCCTGGAACCGACTGT-3′) yielded a 544-bp fragment, and the second primer pair (5′-CCCTCTAATGTTCCTGGTCCTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GTAGGTCACGGAAATGCCGGAAACCTCTCCATTTACCAAGG-3′) yielded a 725-bp DNA fragment. PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and finally at 72 °C for 10 min with Taq polymerase. The two overlapping DNA fragments were amplified by PCR to obtain the full-length TRESK-2 sequence. One DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame could also be obtained using a pair of primers (5′-ATGGAGGCTGAGGAGCCACCTGAG-3′ and 5′-GCCGGAACCCTCTCCATTTACCAAG-3′). The final amplified DNA product that contained the full open reading frame was subcloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector by TA cloning and sequenced on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—Rat multiple tissue Northern blots consisting of 13 different tissues were purchased from Seegene, Inc. (Seoul, Korea). The membrane was pre-hybridized for 30 min at 60 °C and then hybridized for 1 h at 60 °C in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with 32P-labeled TRESK-2 cDNA following the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was rinsed with solution containing 2× SSC (3.0 m sodium chloride and 0.3 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at room temperature. A second washing was performed in solution containing 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for ∼30 min at 55 °C. The membrane was exposed to an x-ray film and developed 16 h later. The membrane was probed again with 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA. For RT-PCR, total RNAs from mouse, rat, and human tissues were isolated and reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primer using the Superscript preamplification system. The first strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification using TRESK-2-specific primers that encompass bases 1–544. PCR amplification was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min; 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The expected 544-bp fragments were eluted from the gel, subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector by TA cloning, and sequenced on both strands for confirmation. Transfection in COS-7 Cells—TRESK-2 DNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for mammalian expression. COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish 24 h prior to transfection in 10% bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1/TRESK-2 and pcDNA3.1/GFP (green fluorescent light protein) using LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). Green fluorescence from cells expressing GFP was detected with the aid of a Nikon microscope equipped with a mercury lamp light source. The cells were used 1–3 days after transfection. Electrophysiological Studies—Electrophysiological recording was performed using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). All recordings were performed at room temperature (∼24 °C). Channel currents were digitized with a digital data recorder (VR10, Instrutech, Great Neck, NY) and stored on videotape. The recorded signal was filtered at 2 KHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter and transferred to a computer using the Digital 1320 interface at a sampling rate of 20 KHz. Whole-cell currents were recorded after canceling the capacitive transients. In whole-cell recordings, the bath solution contained (mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES. The pH was adjusted using HCl or NaOH to desired values. In experiments using cell-attached, inside-out, and outside-out patches, the pipette and bath solutions contained (mm): 150 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). The pH was adjusted using HCl or KOH to the desired values when necessary. Single channel currents were analyzed with the pCLAMP program (version 8) to obtain mean open times, open time duration, and channel activity (version 7). Channel activity was determined from ∼10,000 openings. Current tracings shown in figures were filtered at 2 KHz. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. The concentration of Me2SO used for dissolving certain chemicals was less than 0.1% in the final perfusion solution and had no effect on the TRESK-2 current. Arachidonic acid was dissolved in perfusion solution and ultrasonicated for 5 min in ice just before use. For statistics, the Student's t test was used with p < 0.05 as the criterion for significance. The data are represented as means ± S.D. Cloning of Mouse TRESK-2—A DNA sequence homologous to TRESK-1 was identified in mouse chromosome 19 (GenBank™ accession number AC139040). We named the new sequence TRESK-2 and cloned its cDNA from mouse testis by RT-PCR. The open reading frame of mouse TRESK-2 contains 1182 nucleotides and encodes a 394-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kDa (Fig. 1A). Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence shows that TRESK-2 belongs to the K2P family because it reveals four putative TM domains and two pore-forming domains (Fig. 1B). The predicted membrane topology of TRESK-2 is similar to other K2P channels, with amino and carboxyl termini located at the intracellular side of the membrane. Like TRESK-1, TRESK-2 has a short amino-terminal region, an extended intracellular loop between M2 and M3, and a short carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1C). One N-glycosylation site in the M1–P1 linker region (Asn-83) and four potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A in the cytoplasmic region are present. Three protein kinase A consensus sites are located in the intracellular loop between M2 and M3 (Ser-175, Ser-192, Ser-264), and one is located near the carboxyl tail (Ser-391). A putative phosphorylation site for protein kinase C is also located at the carboxyl tail (Thr-377). Alignment of amino acid sequences of TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 is shown in Fig. 2A. TRESK-2 shares 63% overall amino acid identity and 75% similarity with TRESK-1. The amino acid sequences within the TM and pore regions are nearly identical between TRESK-1 and TRESK-2. The major differences can be found in the amino terminus, the extracellular loop between M1 and P1, the proximal half of the long intracellular loop, and the carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl terminus of TRESK-2 is 14 amino acids longer than that of TRESK-1 in which the carboxyl terminus is only ∼14 amino acids long. TRESK-2 shares low amino acid identity (<25%) with other members of the K2P family, such as TREK and TASK. Comparison of the full coding sequence of TRESK-2 with that of mouse chromosome 19 shows that TRESK-2 is made up of three exons (801, 134, and 256 bp) and two intervening sequences of 9.3 and 5.4 kb (Fig. 2B). This is similar to human TRESK-1, which also consists of three exons and two introns located in human chromosome 10 (21Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the mouse expressed sequence tag data base, seven cDNA fragments with amino acid sequences identical to those of TRESK-2 were identified. Thus, TRESK-2 is a new member of the K2P channel family and a second member of the TRESK subfamily. Fig. 2C shows a phylogenetic tree consisting of 16 mammalian K2P channels that have been cloned so far. Tissue Distribution of TRESK-2—To determine the tissue expression of TRESK-2 mRNA in the rat, Northern blot analysis was performed using rat multiple tissue blots. Northern blot data show that TRESK-2 mRNA is expressed predominantly in the spleen and thymus (Fig. 3A). The strongest signals are observed at ∼4.2 and ∼7.5 kb, and a weak signal is observed at ∼1.6 kb. The three bands are also present in other tissues (heart, lung, small intestine, skeletal muscle, uterus, and placenta), although at much lower levels. As expected, RT-PCR yielded a TRESK-2 DNA fragment (544 bp) from the first strand cDNA prepared from rat spleen, thymus, pancreas, and kidney. To determine whether TRESK-2 mRNA is also expressed in mouse and human tissues, we performed RT-PCR on cDNAs prepared from spleen, thymus, and testis from mouse tissue and spinal cord, testis, placenta, and pancreas from human tissue. Sequencing of the DNA products of RT-PCR obtained using the same TRESK-2-specific primers confirmed that TRESK-2 mRNA was also expressed in these mouse and human tissues (Fig. 3B). Clearly, these results show that in human, TRESK-2 mRNA is more widely expressed than TRESK-1 mRNA, which was detected only in the spinal cord among the 23 tissues examined (21Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Whole-cell Current Recordings—To determine whether TRESK-2 forms a functional K+ channel, we first recorded whole-cell currents from COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids containing TRESK-2 and GFP DNA fragments. In physiological bath solution containing 5 mm KCl (pHo 7.3), the membrane potential of cells under the whole-cell configuration was held at –80 mV, and then voltage steps (–120 to +60 mV; 2-s duration) or a ramp pulse (–120 to +60 mV; 1-s duration) was applied. In control cells transfected with plasmid containing GFP alone, voltage steps from a holding potential of –80 mV to various potentials (–120 to +60 mV) elicited very small currents (<0.2 nA at +60 mV; n = 10; Fig. 4A). In cells transfected with TRESK-2/GFP DNA, the same voltage step produced large currents (2–3 nA at +60 mV; n = 20; Fig. 4A) with reversal potentials near –85 mV, indicating that TRESK-2 formed a functional K+ channel in the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells. The activation of current by step depolarization was nearly instantaneous, and very little or no inactivation was observed. Ramp pulses of 1-s durations applied from –120 mV to +60 mV showed a mildly outwardly rectifying K+ current (Fig. 4A). Thus, TRESK-2 exhibits properties of a background/leak K+ current similar to those of other K2P channels. Ion selectivity of TRESK-2 was studied further in large outside-out patches by recording the reversal potentials at various external [K+] after applying voltage ramps from –120 mV to +20 mV (Fig. 4B). The reversal potential shifted to the right as [K+] in the bath solution increased, as was expected of an ion channel that is permeable to K+ but not to Cl–. A plot of the reversal potential as a function of [K+]out showed a slope of 58 ± 2 mV/10-fold change in [K+]out, close to the calculated Nernst value of 59 mV at 22 °C shown as a dotted line in Fig. 4C. These results show that TRESK-2 is a K+-selective channel similar to other two-pore domain K+ channels. Single Channel Recordings—To study the single channel properties of TRESK-2, cell-attached patches were formed on COS-7 cells in a 150 mm KCl bath solution. The openings of channels with properties different from those of endogenous channels normally found in COS-7 cells were observed in nearly all cells transfected with TRESK-2/GFP DNAs but never in cells transfected with GFP DNA alone. Therefore, identifying the functional expression of TRESK-2 in the plasma membrane was unambiguous. The openings and closings of several channels in a typical cell-attached patch is shown in Fig. 5A. The channels were active at all membrane potentials tested (–100 mV to +100 mV) and showed no inactivation or desensitization in cell-attached and inside-out patches. Using cells with lower expression levels and therefore showing only one level of opening, we recorded channel currents at different membrane potentials (–80 mV to +80 mV) from an inside-out patch (Fig. 5B). Under the recording conditions of our study, the single channel conductances calculated from the amplitude histograms were 13 ± 2 pS at +60 mV and 16 ± 2pSat –60 mV (Fig. 5C). The mean open time determined from the duration histogram was 0.4 ± 0.1 ms at –60 mV (Fig. 5D). The mean open time determined at +60 mV was 0.9 ± 0.2 mV. As can be seen from these current tracings, the channel opened in short bursts with many closings within each burst when the current was in the inward direction and when the membrane was hyperpolarized. Therefore, the kinetic parameters obtained here could be slightly underestimated because of the inadequate resolution of channel currents. The outward currents recorded during the depolarized state showed less noisy openings. The current-voltage relationship, plotted using values obtained from amplitude histograms obtained at each membrane potential, was slightly inwardly rectifying in symmetrical 150 mm KCl (Fig. 5E). The open probability of TRESK-2 was relatively insensitive to changes in membrane potential. These findings show that TRESK-2 is a relatively small conductance background K+ channel with single channel properties that are distinct from those other K2P channel subfamilies. These single channel characteristics should help to identify the native K+ channel encoded by TRESK-2. Modulation by Pharmacological Agents—We examined the effects of various pharmacological agents and changes in pH on TRESK-2 expressed in COS-7 cells. Under whole-cell conditions, extracellular application of 3 mm Ba2+ produced a 38 ± 4% decrease in outward current, typical of the low sensitivity observed with nearly all K2P channels to this divalent cation (Fig. 6A). K+ channel blockers, such as tetraethylammonium (1 mm), 4-aminopyridine (1 mm), and apamin (100 nm), caused no significant effects on TRESK-2 current (n = 5 each, p > 0.05). Quinidine (100 μm) produced a near complete block of TRESK-2. At 10 μm, quinidine blocked TRESK-2 current by 49 ± 6%. In inside-out patches, the application of arachidonic acid (20 μm) produced a 43 ± 6% reduction of TRESK-2 current (Fig. 6B). Bupivacaine (100 μm) produced a strong inhibition of TRESK-2 (Fig. 6C). Glybenclamide (10 μm), which blocks ATP-sensitive K+ channels, showed no significant effect (p > 0.05; n = 4). In inside-out patches, bath application of GTPγS (10 μm) or 10 μm Ca2+ resulted in an insignificant change in TRESK-2 currents (n = 4; p > 0,05), suggesting that G proteins or Ca2+ does not directly modulate TRESK-2. In whole-cell recordings, changing the pHo from 7.3 to 6.3 and 8.3 produced a 23 ± 5% decrease and a 15 ± 5% increase, respectively, in TRESK-2 current (Fig. 6D). In inside-out patches, changing the pHi from 7.3 to 6.3 and 8.3 caused a 36 ± 10% decrease and a 31 ± 6% increase, respectively, in TRESK-2 current. These effects of pH show that TRESK-2 is rather too insensitive to changes in pH to be physiologically important. TRESK-2 was not affected by the application of negative pressure (–60 mm Hg below atmospheric pressure) to the membrane patch in cell-attached or inside-out conditions (n = 5, p > 0.05). TRESK-2 possesses several potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinases A and C (see Fig. 1). To test the possibility that TRESK-2 is modulated via phosphorylation, specific activators of protein kinase A or protein kinase C were applied to the bath solution containing 5 mm KCl and 1 mm Ca2+ in whole-cell configuration. Extracellular application of phorbol myristate acetate (100 nm) for 5 min produced no effect on the TRESK-2 current (n = 5; p > 0.05). Application of dibutyryl cAMP (100 μm) or 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (100 μm), which elevates intracellular [cAMP] also failed to alter TRESK-2 current (n = 5; p > 0.05). An increase in temperature of the perfusion solution from 24 °C to 37 °C produced no significant change in TRESK-2 activity (n = 3; p > 0.05). Thus, TRESK-2 does not appear to be modulated by phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C or heat. We have cloned a new member of the K2p channel family and studied its tissue expression and electrophysiological properties. We named it TRESK-2 because it shares 63% amino acid identity with TRESK-1, which was cloned recently (21Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cloning of TRESK-2 brings the number of mammalian K2P channels to a total of 16. These 16 members can be divided into six subfamilies based on the amino acid identities of the K2P channels. Although division into subfamilies is not based on function, certain members within each subfamily possess similar functional properties, such as those in the TASK and TREK subfamilies. TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 also appear to possess similar electrophysiological and pharmacological properties. TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 are structurally unique among members of the K2P channels in that both contain extended intracellular loops between TM2 and TM3 and have short carboxyl-terminal segments. All other K2P channels have short intracellular loops and long carboxyl termini. TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 are also kinetically unique in that they possess single channel properties that are distinct from those of other K2P channels described so far. TRESK-1 was expressed solely in the spinal cord in human tissue; hence its coined name, TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel (21Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TRESK-1 mRNA expression in rat or mouse tissues has not yet been reported. In human spinal cord, TRESK-1 mRNA could not be detected by Northern blot analysis and only a very faint band was detected by RT-PCR. This indicated that TRESK-1 mRNA expression in the spinal cord was very low or that only a small subset of cells express it (21Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, TRESK-2 mRNA transcript was expressed abundantly in rat thymus and spleen and could be detected in many other tissues by Northern blot analyses. Although we have not performed Northern blot analysis on mouse tissues, TRESK-2 could be detected by RT-PCR in several mouse tissues that we have tested (testis, spleen, and thymus). Searching the GenBank™ DNA data base for the TRESK-1 sequence did not identify any expressed sequence tags, whereas searching for the TRESK-2 sequence showed seven expressed sequences tags. This also suggests that TRESK-2 is probably more abundantly and widely expressed than TRESK-1. Interestingly, we were unable to find a human ortholog of TRESK-2 in the GenBank™ data base. This was surprising because human, rat, and mouse orthologs of all other K2P channels could be identified in the DNA data base. This prompted us to determine whether the mouse TRESK-2 that we cloned is a novel member of the K2P channel family or an ortholog of human TRESK-1. Our RT-PCR studies using human tissues (spinal cord, pancreas, placenta, and testis) and sequencing of the DNA fragments clearly showed that TRESK-2 mRNA is expressed in these human tissues. Therefore, both TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 mRNA transcripts are expressed in human tissue, indicating that they are different members of the K2P channel family sharing 65% amino acid identity. TRESK-2, similar to TRESK-1, forms a functional K+ channel in COS-7 cells. As with many other K2P channels, TRESK-2 is insensitive to inhibition by typical K+ channel blockers (triethanolamine, Cs+, 4-aminopyrine) and is blocked only at millimolar concentrations of Ba2+. Quinidine, a nonspecific blocker of many K+ channels (including those of K2P channels), strongly inhibits TRESK-1 and TRESK-2. The inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid on TRESK-2 is similar to those observed with TASK-1 and TASK-3, although the physiological significance of such inhibition is not yet known (12Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is clear from these findings that the pore properties of many K2P channels, including TRESK-2, are different from those of voltage-gated (Kv) and inwardly rectifying (Kir) K+ channels that are highly sensitive to Ba2+ and tetraethylammonium, which block the channels by entering the permeation pathway. From the effects observed with 13 different molecules, it appears that the pharmacological profiles of TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 are somewhat similar to those of other K2P channels, particularly with respect to K+ channel blockers. We observed no striking effects of any agents on TRESK-2 that might help us to distinguish between TRESK-2 and other K+ channels. In a recent report, human TRESK was found to be modulated by calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, and this effect was inhibited by FK506, an inhibitor of calcineurin (29Czirjak G. Toth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Whether other K2P channels are also regulated by such a mechanism needs to be studied in the future. To be able to identity TRESK-2 from other K+ channels, it is therefore crucial to determine its single channel characteristics. Our results show that TRESK-2 is a small conductance K+ channel (∼16 pS), which opens in short bursts and exhibits rapid kinetics of openings and closings. The apparent single channel conductance and mean open times of TRESK-2 that we report here are likely to be slight underestimates of the true values because of highly noisy openings, which are difficult to resolve adequately, particularly in the inward current direction. Nevertheless, the single channel properties of TRESK-2 are unique among K+ channels and should help to identify native K+ channels that are functional correlates of TRESK-2. Although the single channel properties of TRESK-1 are not described in the earlier study (21Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Kitada C. Yokoi H. Nozawa K. Okada H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27406-27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a current tracing shown in one figure suggests that TRESK-1 may behave like TRESK-2 and is also a relatively low conductance K+ channel (∼15 pS in symmetrical 150 mm KCl). Therefore, it may be difficult to distinguish between TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 if they are expressed in the same cell. Our Northern blot studies show that TRESK-2 mRNA is expressed in many tissues in the rat. Therefore, a native K+ channel with the single channel kinetics described above is most likely to be encoded by TRESK-2. However, the single channel properties of TRESK-1 and TRESK-2 and their tissue distribution in mouse and rat need to be studied further to determine their similarities and differences. Based on electrophysiological studies, TRESK-2 exhibits all the hallmarks of a background or leak K+ channel. Thus, TRESK-2 is active across the physiological range of membrane potential and activates and deactivates rapidly with little or no inactivation with voltage changes, and the reversal potential is critically dependent on [K+]o. These qualities of TRESK-2 should help to contribute to the regulation of resting membrane potential that normally determines various aspects of cell function, such as excitability, Ca2+ permeability, and hormone secretion. It is interesting that TRESK-2 mRNA is highly expressed in the thymus and spleen, both of which are well known for being involved in cell-mediated immunity. Both tissues contain T- and B-lymphocytes, which are important in the defense mechanism against parasites and foreign antigens. Another main function of the spleen is to filter circulating blood and remove unwanted elements by phagocytosis. TRESK-2 may be expressed in these immune cells and help in their function. A rise in the intracellular [Ca2+] signal is a critical event that leads to the activation of lymphocytes and their phagocytic activity (30Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Several voltage-gated and Ca2+-activated K+ channels and their role in Ca2+ influx and lymphocyte activation have been reported (31Cahalan M.D. Wulff H. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 21: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). TRESK-2 could also be involved in these processes by opposing forces that tend to depolarize the cell. TRESK-2 could promote Ca2+ influx by helping to keep the resting membrane potential at negative potentials in nonexcitable cells."

We have previously demonstrated an interaction between the integrin α-subunit I domain and the catalytic domain of MMP-9. We now show that there is also an interaction between the integrin β subunit and MMP-9. Using phage display, we have developed MMP-9 inhibitors that bind either to the MMP-9 catalytic domain, the collagen binding domain, or the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain. The C-terminal domain-binding peptide mimics an activation epitope in the stalk of the integrin β chain and inhibits the association of MMP-9 C-terminal domain with αVβ5 integrin. Unlike other MMP-9 binding peptides, it does not directly inhibit catalytic activity of MMP-9, but still prevents proenzyme activation and cell migration in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo. We also find an association between MMP-9 and urokinase-plasminogen activator receptor and find that urokinase-plasminogen activator receptor is cleaved by MMP-9. Collectively, we have defined molecular details for several interactions mediated by the different MMP-9 domains.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). We have identified a highly selective peptide inhibitor of gelatinases, CTTHWGFTLC (CTT) by phage display (2Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Medina O.P. Heikkila P. Kantor C.

The unique structural feature of the gelatinases is the collagen-binding domain (CBD) within the catalytic domain (4Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CBD is composed of three fibronectin type II repeats and is an intriguing target to develop gelatinase-specific compounds. Like most MMPs, the gelatinases also contain a C-terminal hemopexin/vitronectin-like domain (C domain or PEX), which contains the binding site for tissue inhibitors for matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and is responsible for the dimerization of MMP-9 (5Cha H. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Lanzendorfer M. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although MMP-2 and MMP-9 are closely related enzymes, they do have differences in the regulation of expression, activation, and glycosylation and in substrate selectivity (1Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z.

Of these two enzymes, MMP-2 has been investigated in a more detail. For example, the activation of pro-MMP-2 has been thoroughly characterized and involves interactions of TIMP-2, MT1-MMP, and αVβ3 integrin on the cell surface (6Brooks P.C.

MMP-9 has not been found to be activated via the same mechanism, and several proteinases including the plasmin/MMP-3 cascade (8Ramos-DeSimone N. Hahn-Dantona E. Sipley J. Nagase H. French D.L.

Relatively little is known about the molecular details of the MMP-9 interactions on the cell surface and how these regulate cell migration.

We have recently identified the leukocyte specific β2-integrins as a binding partner for pro-MMP-9. The phage display peptide ADGACILWMDDGWCGAAG (DDGW) competed with pro-MMP-9 binding to the ligand-binding I domain of αM integrin subunit and inhibited migration of leukocytes (12Stefanidakis M.

Here we have isolated MMP-9 binding peptides, which inhibit either substrate binding or proenzyme activation, leading to an inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Using these peptides, we identify MMP-9 interaction sites in fibronectin, vitronectin, and αVβ5 integrin.

The phage were added in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2% BSA. After three rounds of selection, the phage sequences were determined (14Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A.

The phage were detected with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Peptide Synthesis—The phage peptides were initially prepared in a recombinant form using intein fusions (12Stefanidakis M. Bjorklund M. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. Koivunen E. J. Biol.

The TTPNSLLVSWQPPRARIT and ADIMINFGRWEHGDGYPF peptides were synthesized on a cellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with 0.2 μg/ml biotinylated CBD. Bound CBD was detected using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000 dilution; Pierce) and chemiluminescence detection. Expression of the MMP and Integrin Domains—CBD (amino acids Gly204-Gly373) was amplified from MMP-9 cDNA with the oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGGCCATATGGGAAACGCAGATGGCGCG-3′ and 5′-GGCTGCAGTTATCCTTGGTCGGGGCAGAAG-3′ incorporating NdeI and PstI restriction sites. The PCR product was ligated into pTWIN vector (New England Biolabs). CBD was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For some experiments, CBD was biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). The C-terminal domains of MMP-2 (Glu438-Cys631) and MMP-9 (Asp494-Asp688) were expressed as described (16Bjorklund M. Koivunen E. Lett. Drug Des. Discovery. 2004; 1: 163-167Crossref Google Scholar). The pro-MMP-9-ΔHC (Ala1-Gly424) was cloned with the oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGGCCATATGGCCCCCAGACAGCGCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTGCAGTCAACCATAGAGGTGCCGGATGC-3′, digested with NdeI and PstI, and ligated into the pTWIN vector. The protein was purified from inclusion bodies by solubilization with urea, refolded in the presence of arginine, and purified with gelatin-Sepharose. The β5 integrin-epidermal growth factor-like domain 2 + 3 (I-EGF2+3) fragment (Glu476-Asn563) was cloned from β5 integrin cDNA using oligonucleotides 5′-GGTGGTCTCGAGGAGTGCCAGGATGGGG-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTGCGGCCGCTTAAGCGTTACAGTTGTCCCCG-3′, digested with XhoI and NotI, and ligated into pHAT2 vector. The protein with an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli and purified in a soluble form using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The K542A and Y544A mutant β5 I-EGF2+3 constructs were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Gelatinase Inhibition Assay—Inhibition of aminophenylmercuric acetate-activated MMP-2 and trypsin-activated MMP-9 was performed using biotinylated gelatin as a substrate (15Bjorklund M. Valtanen H. Savilahti H. Koivunen E. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Gelatin and CBD Binding Assays—Recombinant CBD or human plasma fibronectin (Calbiochem) (0.2 μg/ml in TBS) was immobilized in microtiter wells. The wells were saturated with 1% BSA-PBST. Biotinylated gelatin (0.2 μg/ml in 1% BSA-PBST) was added with or without peptides at the concentrations indicated or with an excess of unlabeled gelatin (10 μg/ml) and allowed to bind for 1 h. Bound gelatin was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase. CBD binding to immobilized fibronectin, the 110-kDa fragment of fibronectin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or urea-denaturated human plasma vitronectin (17Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct.

Dimerization of the MMP-9 C Domain—Recombinant C domain or CBD at a 5 μg/ml concentration in PBS were coated on microtiter wells followed by blocking with 1% BSA-PBST. 125I-Labeled C domain was preincubated with the peptides for 30 min in 1% BSA-PBST and then added to the wells. After a 2-h incubation, the wells were washed. Bound radioactivity was eluted with 1% SDS and measured with a γ-counter.

Adhesion of THP-1 cells to immobilized KIM127 or control monoclonal antibodies (2 μg/ml) was done in the presence or absence of soluble proteins (50 μg/ml) or antibodies (25 μg/ml). Cell Migration and Invasion—The cell migration assay was conducted using transwell migration chambers (8-μm pore size; Costar) in 10% serum-containing medium (2Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H.

Briefly, the membranes were coated on both sides with 40 μg/ml GST or with the β2 integrin ligand peptide CPCFLLGCC-GST fusion (GST-LLG-C4) and blocked with complete medium. THP-1 cells (50,000 cells/100 μl) were preincubated with the peptides for 1 h in serum-containing medium. The cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h and were then stained with crystal violet and counted (14Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A. Taube S. Uppala A. Jokinen M. van Willigen G. Ihanus E.

The HT1080 (20,000 cells/100 μl) invasion assay was performed as the THP-1 migration, except that matrigel-coated transwells (BD Biosciences) were used. Pericellular Proteolysis—Microtiter wells were coated with a mixture of fibronectin (10 μg/ml) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled gelatin (100 μg/ml) followed by saturation with 1% BSA in PBS. HT1080 cells (50,000 in 100 μl of 0.1% BSA/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were incubated in the presence of 20 nm 4β-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (Sigma) and the peptides or the MMP-2/MMP-9-selective inhibitor InhI (Calbiochem). As a control, nonactivated cells and medium without the cells were used.

Pro-MMP-9 (100 ng/well) was incubated for 2 h, and the unbound pro-MMP-9 was washed away. Biotinylated gelatin (2.5 μg/ml) was allowed to bind for 30 min at room temperature. Bound gelatin was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase. Activation of MMP-9—THP-1 cells (40,000 cells/100 μl) or confluent HT1080 cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence or absence of 2.5 μg/ml plasminogen, 0.5 μg/ml pro-MMP-3 (Oncogene Research Products), 40 nm PDBu, and the peptides at a 200 μm concentration unless otherwise indicated. Aliquots of the conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin zymography (9Sorsa T. Salo T. Koivunen E. Tyynela J. Konttinen Y.T. Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Niemi E. Teronen O. Heikkila P. Tschesche H. Leinonen J. Osman S. Stenman U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21067-21074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). MMP-9 was activated in vitro with MMP-3 (1:5 enzyme to substrate) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2,1 μm ZnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.01% Tween 20 for 1 h at +37 °C in the presence or absence of 200 μm CRV or the scrambled peptide. The samples were analyzed by gelatin zymography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HT1080 cells were activated with 50 nm PDBu for 3 h in serum-free medium, washed with PBS, and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. One milligram of protein was immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-uPAR (399R; American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) or anti-MMP-9 (H-129; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or a control IgG. Integrins were immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of anti-integrin cytoplasmic domain antisera (20Vogel B.E. Lee S.J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbacher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted, and detected with anti-MMP-9 antibodies. Immunofluorescence—HT1080 cells were allowed to adhere on vitronectin (10 μg/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Directional migration of the cells was stimulated by overlaying the cells with 0.5% agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and adding 5 μl of fetal bovine serum with PDBu (20 nm final concentration) to the one end of the wells. Overnight cultured cells were washed with PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained with the monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody (Ab3937, 2 μg/ml; American Diagnostica) or anti-β5 integrin IA9 (2 μg/ml (21Pasqualini R. Bodorova J. Ye S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar)) and polyclonal MMP-9 antibodies (H-129; 10 μg/ml). The primary antibodies were detected with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 antibodies. uPAR Cleavage—0.5 μg of recombinant soluble human uPAR (R&D Systems) was digested with 50 ng of trypsin-activated MMP-9 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 10 μg/ml aprotinin with or without 10 mm EDTA. Chymotrypsin cleavage was done without aprotinin. The samples were incubated for 16 h in 37 °C and separated in a nonreducing 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-uPAR antibodies (399R; 1:1000 dilution). uPAR cleavage on the surface of HT1080 cells or THP-1 cells was studied in a serum-free medium with or without 20 nm PDBu for 48 h in the presence or absence of 20 μm InhI, 200 μm CTT or W→ A CTT control peptide, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, or 20 μm benzamidine. The cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with 50 mm glycine HCl (pH 3.0) plus 100 mm NaCl to extract cell surface-bound urokinase-plasminogen activator (uPA) and MMPs, and neutralized with 500 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) plus 100 mm NaCl. Membrane proteins were enriched by Triton X-114 extraction (22Behrendt N. Ploug M. Ronne E. Hoyer-Hansen G. Dano K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and 30 μg (HT1080 cells) or 10 μg (THP-1 cells) of protein was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed for uPAR as above. Gelatinases were analyzed from the acid eluates with gelatin zymography and uPA with plasminogen/milk powder zymography (23Myohanen H. Virtanen I. Vaheri A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). β5 I-EGF2+3 Binding Assay—MMP-9 C domain, MMP-2 C domain, CBD, β5 I-EGF2+3, or vitronectin (2 μg/ml) were immobilized in microtiter wells. Biotinylated β5 I-EGF2+3 fragment (2.5 μg/ml) was added to the wells, which were preincubated with the competitors for 30 min in 1% BSA-PBST and then incubated further for 1 h. Bound biotinylated protein was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase. 125I-C Domain Binding to Cells—The MMP-9 C domain was labeled with 125I to a specific activity of 0.06 μCi/pmol. The labeled domain retained 40% of the CRV peptide-binding activity, as shown by the phage-binding assay. The CS-1 cells were washed with 2.5 mm EDTA in PBS and suspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5)/150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5% BSA. After a preincubation of 1.5 × 106 cells in a 200-μl volume on ice for 30 min with the competitors, 125I-labeled C domain (1 × 106 cpm) was added and incubated for 3 h on ice. The cells were transferred to tubes containing 200 μl of dibutyl phthalate/cyclohexane mixture (23:2, v/v), centrifuged 7500 × g for 10 min, and snap-frozen (24Giordano R.J. Cardo-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The bottom of the tube containing the cells was cut and analyzed with a γ-counter. Tumor Growth in Vivo—The animal studies were approved by the ethical committee of Helsinki University. HSC-3 tumors were established by administering 5 × 106 tumor cells in a 100-μl volume in PBS in both flanks of the Hsd:Athymic Nude-nu mice. After 3 days, the mice received five daily injection of 0.8 mg/ml CRV or the scrambled peptide or the vehicle (PBS) via the tail vein in a 200-μl volume. Three-dimensional caliper measurements were taken twice a week, and the tumor volumes were calculated. Mice were sacrificed when the tumor volume reached 1000 mm3. For the staining of the tumor vasculature, 7-μm frozen tissue sections were stained with anti-CD31 antibody (MEC 13.3; BD Biosciences) and anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was calculated with the t test or with log rank test in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Identification of Peptide Probes to Different Domains of MMP-9—In order to understand gelatinase-mediated cell migration in depth, we searched for putative MMP-9-binding proteins by phage display of random peptide libraries. The pro-MMP-9 and its recombinant domains were used in biopanning, since the active MMP-9 primarily bound peptides with a WGF motif (2Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Medina O.P. Heikkila P. Kantor C. Gahmberg C.G. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T. Ruoslahti E. Pasqualini R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Two groups of pro-MMP-9 binding peptides were found (Table I). Group I had a motif, CGArGRAr(S/Q)PPC, where Ar represents an aromatic amino acid. These peptides show similarity to sequences found in the gelatinase substrates fibronectin and vitronectin (4Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Group II had a CRX- YGPXXXC motif. In this group, the CRVYGPYLLC peptide was obtained by biopanning with pro-MMP-9, whereas the other sequences were obtained with a recombinant C-terminal domain. The CGYGRFSPPC (PPC) and CRV peptides were chosen for further studies as representatives of the two groups.Table IPro-MMP-9 binding peptide sequencesGroup I: CBD-binding sequencesGroup II: C domain-binding sequencesCGYGRFSPPC (6)CRVYGPYLLCCGWGRYSPPCCRWYGPILWC (2)CGFGRWQPPCCRWYGPWALCFN TPNSLLVSWQPPRARITCRWYGPWVWCVN PETLHPGRPQPPAEEELCRFYGAWLLCCRHYGPFSICCRRYGPFMVCCRTYGWWVVCCRYYGWLTVCCKWYGLFQLCCHSYGPFVVCCNWYGWFRVC Open table in a new tab To identify the binding sites of these peptide motifs, we carried out phage binding experiments. Binding of PPC peptide-bearing phage to pro-MMP-9 was inhibited by a soluble recombinant 18-mer ADGACGYGRFSPPCGAAG (PPC) peptide and gelatin, but not with CTT or a recombinant ADGACRVYGPYLLCGAAG (CRV) peptide (Fig. 1A). Conversely, binding of the CRV-phage was inhibited by CRV and not by PPC, CTT, or gelatin, indicating nonoverlapping binding sites for these peptides. Inhibition of PPC phage binding by gelatin implied that that PPC binds to the CBD of MMP-9. Furthermore, phage selection with the MMP-2 CBD has also yielded a PPC-like peptide ACGYTYHPPCARLT (25Trexler M. Briknarova K. Gehrmann M. Llinas M. Patthy L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12241-12246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The PPC peptide, but not CTT or CRV, inhibited gelatin binding to immobilized CBD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B) but had no effect on gelatin binding to fibronectin (data not shown), suggesting that PPC is specific for the fibronectin type II repeats of gelatinases. In a gelatin degradation assay, PPC inhibited both MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity (Fig. 1C), the scrambled control peptide ADGACPSYGPRFGCGAAG (scr. PPC) having no effect. The CRV peptide did not inhibit gelatinase activity, consistent with the inability of gelatin to compete with CRV. The PPC peptide was a weaker gelatinase inhibitor than CTT, which completely inhibits gelatin degradation at a 100 μm concentration in this assay (15Bjorklund M. Valtanen H. Savilahti H. Koivunen E. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To study whether the PPC-like sequences of fibronectin and vitronectin bind MMP-9, we examined the binding of CBD to these proteins in a solid phase binding assay. CBD bound to both fibronectin and vitronectin, but not to the 110-kDa fragment of fibronectin lacking the C-terminal heparin-binding domain and thus the suspected gelatinase-binding site (Fig. 1D). PPC, but not the scrambled peptide, inhibited the CBD binding. Similar results were obtained in a pepspot membrane assay, where biotinylated CBD bound to the PPC-like fibronectin peptide TTPNSLLVSWQPPRARIT but not to an 18-mer control peptide (Fig. 1D, inset). When different MMPs were compared, the CRV phage showed a CRV peptide-inhibitable binding only to pro-MMP-9, and not to pro-MMP-2 or pro-MMP-3 (Fig. 2A). The scrambled CRV peptide CGYLPLRYVC had no effect. MMP-9 selectivity was also observed with the recombinant MMP-9 and MMP-2 C domains. The CRV phage recognized the MMP-9 C domain strongly in comparison with the MMP-2 C domain (Fig. 2B). TIMP-1 could not compete with the CRV phage binding to the MMP-9 C domain (Fig. 2C) or pro-MMP-9 (not shown). The CRV phage did not bind to the CBD (Fig. 2C) or a pro-MMP-9 lacking the hinge region and the C-terminal domain (pro-MMP-9-ΔHC; not shown). We next examined the effect of CRV on the dimerization of MMP-9 C domain. 125I-labeled C domain was preincubated with CRV or scrambled peptide and then added to wells coated with unlabeled C domain. Dimerization of the C domain was inhibited by CRV but not by the scrambled peptide (Fig. 2D). Cell Migration and Invasion Are Inhibited by Blocking the Domain-specific Interactions of the Gelatinases—We studied the role of the gelatinase domains in cell migration and invasion using the CTT, PPC, and CRV peptides. The binding site of CTT maps to the catalytic domain, but not to CBD (Fig. 1B (12Stefanidakis M. Bjorklund M. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. Koivunen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34674-34684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). 2M. Björklund and E. Koivunen, unpublished data. As indicated above, PPC and CRV are probes for the CBD and the C domain, respectively. All three peptides inhibited HT1080 fibrosarcoma invasion into matrigel. At a 200 μm concentration of CRV or CTT, 50% inhibition was observed. The PPC peptide required a 500 μ"
https://openalex.org/W2040364566,"During normal development Notch receptor signaling is important in regulating numerous cell fate decisions. Mutations that truncate the extracellular domain of Notch receptors can cause aberrant signaling and promote unregulated cell growth. We have examined two types of truncated Notch oncoproteins that arise from proviral insertion into the Notch4 gene (Notch4/int-3) or a chromosomal translocation involving the Notch1 gene (TAN-1). Both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 oncoproteins lack most or all of their ectodomain. Normal Notch signaling requires γ-secretase/presenilin-mediated proteolytic processing, but whether Notch oncoproteins are also dependent on γ-secretase/presenilin activity is not known. We demonstrate that Notch4/int-3-induced activation of the downstream transcription factor, CSL, is abrogated in cells deficient in presenilins or treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of γ-secretase/presenilins. Furthermore, we find that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 accumulate at the cell surface, where presenilin-dependent cleavage occurs, when γ-secretase/presenilin activity is inhibited. γ-Secretase/presenilin inhibition effectively blocks cellular responses to Notch4/int-3, but not TAN-1, apparently because some TAN-1 polypeptides lack transmembrane domains and do not require γ-secretase/presenilin activity for nuclear access. These studies highlight potential uses and limitations of γ-secretase/presenilin inhibitors in targeted therapy of Notch-related neoplasms.

In vertebrates, full-length Notch proteins are part of a family of four receptors (Notch1–4) and five ligands that include members of the Jagged and Delta families. Notch receptors have an extracellular (EC) domain consisting largely of multiple epidermal growth factor-like repeats within which are binding sites for ligands. The Notch receptors also have a cytoplasmic region containing the RAM domain, seven ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST domain. Newly synthesized Notch receptors are processed initially in the trans-Golgi by a furin-like convertase, generating a ligand binding ectodomain and a transmembrane signaling domain that remain associated during transport to the plasma membrane (6Blaumueller C.M.

Ligand binding to the ectodomain induces several successive proteolytic cleavage events in the transmembrane subunit that result in release of its intracellular domain from the cell membrane. An initial cleavage by ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloprotease)-type metalloproteases occurs just external to the transmembrane (TM) domain (9Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X.

Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). In the case of Notch, presenilin-mediated cleavage allows the Notch intracellular domain (IC) to gain access to the nucleus, where it binds the transcription factor CBF1/CSL. This binding event converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator, leading to expression of target genes (30Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Notch signaling is normally activated by the interaction of a Notch receptor with ligand expressed on an adjacent cell. Truncated forms of Notch containing deletions spanning most, or all, of the EC domain bypass the need for ligand binding and signal constitutively. Two such Notch deletions, involving mouse Notch4 and human Notch1 (initially named TAN-1 for translocation-associated Notch homolog-1), were originally identified as oncogenes. The int-3 oncogene, which we refer to as Notch4/int-3, arises from retroviral integration of the mouse mammary tumor virus into the Notch4 locus and causes murine mammary tumors (31Uyttendaele H. Marazzi G. Wu G. Yan Q. Sassoon D. Kitajewski J. Development. 1996; 122: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shirayoshi Y. Yuasa Y. Suzuki T. Sugaya K. Kawase E. Ikemura T. Nakatsuji N.

In all cases, viral integration results in the production of a truncated transcript that encodes both the TM and the IC domain of Notch4 (see Fig. 8). In a similar fashion, the TAN-1 oncogene associated with T-ALL is generated from a truncation in human Notch1 caused by a recurrent (7Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G.

West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). All breakpoints identified to date occur within the intron just prior to the exon encoding the 34th epidermal growth factor repeat and result in fusion of the 3′-end of Notch1 to T cell receptor β promoter/enhancer elements. The fusion gene drives expression of multiple truncated mRNAs that encode a series of N-terminally truncated TAN-1 polypeptides ranging in size from slightly larger to slightly smaller than the normal Notch1 transmembrane subunit (35Aster J.C. Pear W. Hasserjian R. Erba H. Davi F. Luo B. Scott M. Baltimore D. Sklar J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 49: 125-136Google Scholar). The precise structure and origin of these polypeptides have not been defined. To understand the mechanism of action and activities of Notch, engineered Notch proteins that are constitutively active have been studied. These engineered Notch proteins include forms either consisting of only the IC, or the IC linked to the TM domain, a small portion of the EC domain, and the leader peptide (NotchΔE). Both of these forms are active in a variety of assays and are oncogenic (36Jhappan C. Gallahan D. Stahle C. Chu E. Smith G.H. Merlino G. Callahan R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 37Pear W.S. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Hasserjian R.P. Soffer B. Sklar J. Baltimore D. J. Exp.

For instance, pharmacologic inhibition of presenilin suppresses the growth of Notch1ΔE-induced T-ALLs, but not T-ALLs induced by the Notch1 IC domain (N1IC) (40Weng A.P. Nam Y. Wolfe M.S. Pear W.S. Griffin J.D. Blacklow S.C. Aster J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1, oncogenic forms of Notch proteins, require presenilins for proper processing, signaling function, and activity. Based on the known sites of truncation within the Notch1 and Notch4 genes during their oncogenic conversion, both TAN-1 and Notch4/int-3 are predicted to encode proteins including TM domains, but lacking signal peptides. It was thus unclear whether these oncoproteins would insert into membranes and require presenilin activity for activation. Our results show that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 are targeted to the membrane and are subject to presenilin-mediated proteolytic processing. Notch4/int-3 requires presenilin activity for CSL-mediated signaling and biological activity in endothelial cells. TAN-1, however, demonstrates only partial dependence on presenilin activity. Although blockade of presenilin function alters TAN-1 processing, it does not affect the growth of T-ALL cells, apparently because some TAN-1 polypeptides bypass the requirement for presenilin processing for nuclear access. The finding that some oncogenic forms of Notch depend on presenilin activity for function suggests potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Reagents—Compound E (CpdE) was a gift from T. Golde. The antibodies PS-1-loop and PS-2-loop were provided by G. Thinakaran. The immortalized fibroblasts lacking PS-1 and PS-2 were provided by B. De Strooper. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Transient transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation. For assessment of activated Notch signaling in HeLa cells, cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection in 6-well plates at 1.0 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected in triplicate with 250 ng of pQNCN1IC-HA or 250 ng of pLNCNotch4/int-3-HA in combination with 500 ng of CSL luciferase reporter (pGA981-6) and 250 ng of pLNClacZ (control for transfection efficiency). Activated Notch signaling in MEFs (wild type or PS-1,2-/-) was assessed by plating cells 24 h prior to transfection in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. MEFs were transfected in triplicate with 1 μg of pQNCN1IC-HA or 1 μg of pLNCNotch4/int-3-HA in combination with 670 ng of pGA981-6 and 333 ng of pLNClacZ. To determine ligand-induced Notch signaling, coculture assays were performed using HeLa and 293-derived Bosc cells. HeLa cells plated 1 day earlier in 10-cm plates at 1.5 × 106 were transfected with 7.5 μg of pBOS Notch1 or pBOS Notch2, 4 μg pGA981-6, and 1 μg pLNC lacZ. Bosc cells plated 1 day prior in 10-cm plates at 4 × 106 were transfected with either 25 μg pHyTc-Jagged1, pHyTc-Delta-1, pHyTc-Delta-4, or pHyTc-x (empty vector). One day after transfection, the cells were cocultured in triplicate (HeLa:Bosc, 1:2) on 12-well plates for 24 h. In all cases, cultures were treated ± CpdE 16 h prior to harvest of cells. Cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined 2 days post-transfection using the Enhanced Luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen), and β-galactosidase activity was determined using the Galacto-Light Plus kit (PE Biosystems). All assays were performed in a Berthold dual injection luminometer. Reporter activation was normalized for transfection efficiency. Fold reduction by CpdE was calculated as the ratio of the normalized reporter activity from untreated cells to CpdE-treated cells. Biotinylation Assays—The membrane expression of TAN-1, Notch4/int-3, and N1IC-HA was determined by performing surface biotinylation experiments. Notch4/int-3 or N1IC was transiently transfected into HeLa cells by Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). SUPT1 cells (expressing TAN-1) and transfected HeLa cells were treated ± CpdE 16 h prior to harvest. SUPT1 cells and transfected HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then labeled with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Biotin was quenched with phosphate-buffered saline and glycine, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells cultured in 6-cm plates were lysed in TENT buffer, and after clearing lysates, a small aliquot was saved to load 50 ng of whole cell lysate. The remainder of the lysate was used to purify surface proteins by incubating with ImmunoPure-Immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Streptavidin-precipitated proteins and whole cell lysates were treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies: TC to detect TAN-1 (41Hasserjian R.P.

Analysis of Notch4/int-3 Expression in 293 Cells—293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Stable cell lines (dWt and dAsp) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in the presence of 250 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). For transient transfection, cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 10 μg of pLNCint-3-HA or Notch1ΔE plasmids using Superfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Cultures were treated with CpdE, L-685,458 (Calbiochem), AEBSF (Roche Applied Science), pepstatin A (Roche Applied Science), or Me2SO for 16 h prior to harvest of cells. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed using buffer IP (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Protein quantification, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analyses were carried out as described previously (27Lee H.J. Jung K.M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The primary anti-HA antibody (HA 11, Covance) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000, the anti-cleaved Notch1 (Val1744) antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000, and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) was used at 1:5,000. Culture of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)— HUVEC were isolated from human umbilical vein by the method described previously (45Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6008) Google Scholar). HUVEC were grown in EGM2 kit (Bio Whittaker, San Diego), containing vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, and 2% fetal bovine serum on type I collagen-coated 10-cm dishes and harvested at about 80% confluence with trypsin. Adenoviral Gene Transfer—7.5 × 105 cells of HUVEC at passage 3 were seeded into type I collagen-coated 6-well plates on the day before adenoviral infection. Adenoviral infection with Ad-lacZ or Ad-Notch4/int-3 virus (42Uyttendaele H. Closson V. Wu G. Roux F. Weinmaster G. Kitajewski J. Microvasc. Res. 2000; 60: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was performed at a multiplicity of infection of 60 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with occasional swirling of plates. Infected cells were harvested the day after infection for further experiments. Sprouting Assay—For making collagen gels, an ice-cold solution of porcine type I collagen (Nitta gelatin, Tokyo, Japan) was mixed with 10 × RPMI 1640 medium and neutralization buffer at the ratio of 8:1:1. Aliquots of collagen gel (400 μl) were then added to 24-well plates and allowed to gel for at least 1 h at 37 °C. After adenoviral infection (above), HUVEC were harvested and plated at 1.3 × 105 cells/well onto the top of the collagen gel in 24-well plates in 0.8 ml of EGM2 medium. HUVEC became nearly confluent 48 h after plating. After seeding, the medium was changed every 2 days for the next 3 weeks. Treatment with CpdE was started at day 2 and continued for 3 weeks. Sprouting was observed and photographs taken after 3 weeks with an Olympus digital camera mounted to a microscope. For quantification of the number of sprouts, five fields/each well were selected randomly, and sprouting was counted under microscopy in a blind manner by two investigators. Cell Cycle Analysis—SUPT1 cells were seeded at 1 × 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and the indicated concentrations of CpdE or carrier alone (Me2SO). Cells were split every 2 days into fresh medium and drug to maintain cell density between 0.5 and 1.5 × 106/ml. At day 4, cells were harvested, fixed in 70% EtOH, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA content. Cell cycle fractions were determined using MultiCycle software. Immunostaining—SUPT1 cells and Jurkat cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum ± 1 μm CpdE for 24 h were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min in 10% buffered formalin, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. After dewaxing in graded ethanols, the sections were subjected to “antigen retrieval” by heating in 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), in a steam pressure cooker (Decloaking Chamber, BioCare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washes in distilled water, slides were pretreated with Peroxidase Block (DAKO USA, Carpinteria, CA) for 5 min, followed by goat serum (1:5 in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) for 20 min. Sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-Notch1IC (TC) (1:5,000) (41Hasserjian R.P. Aster J.C. Davi F. Weinberg D.S. Sklar J. Blood. 1996; 88: 970-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 3% goat serum, followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Envision detection kit, DAKO). After further washing, immunoperoxidase staining was developed using a diaminobenzidine chromogen (DAKO), followed by an enhancing solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Spectral Imaging—Sections were stained with anti-Notch1IC (TC) antibody as above and subjected to analysis using a CRI Nuance spectral imaging system (CRI, Cambridge, MA). Briefly, conventional bright-field images (×400 magnification) were captured sequentially at 10-nm wavelength intervals from 420 nm (blue) to 680 nm (red), and the resultant image cube (the concatenated stack of images at each wavelength interval per pixel) was analyzed using CRI Nuance software. The diaminobenzidine spectral profile was applied across all image cubes to determine the intensity of diaminobenzidine staining per pixel after which the staining intensities were converted to composite false color images. Presenilin Activity Is Required for Ligand-induced Activation of Notch1 and Notch2—It is established through genetic analysis that presenilins function in ligand-dependent cleavage of cell surface Notch proteins and that processing of NotchΔE proteins is mediated by presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity. Use of specific γ-secretase inhibitors or dominant-negative forms of presenilin has established a requirement for γ-secretase/presenilin in processing of NotchΔE proteins and also in processing of the Notch1 receptor upon Delta-1 activation. We wanted to establish that γ-secretase/presenilin activity is a general requirement for ligand-induced Notch signaling; that is, we wanted to determine whether other Notch family proteins in addition to Notch1 depend on γ-secretase/presenilin. To address this issue, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of γ-secretase, CpdE (46Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E. Wang Q. Roach A.H. Thompson L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2089626188,"There are two common forms of prion protein (PrP) in humans, with either methionine or valine at position 129. This polymorphism is a powerful determinant of the genetic susceptibility of humans toward both sporadic and acquired forms of prion disease and restricts propagation of particular prion strains. Despite its key role, we have no information on the effect of this mutation on the structure, stability, folding, and dynamics of the cellular form of PrP (PrPC). Here, we show that the mutation has no measurable effect on the folding, dynamics, and stability of PrPC. Our data indicate that the 129M/V polymorphism does not affect prion propagation through its effect on PrPC; rather, its influence is likely to be downstream in the disease mechanism. We infer that the M/V effect is mediated through the conformation or stability of disease-related PrP (PrPSc) or intermediates or on the kinetics of their formation. There are two common forms of prion protein (PrP) in humans, with either methionine or valine at position 129. This polymorphism is a powerful determinant of the genetic susceptibility of humans toward both sporadic and acquired forms of prion disease and restricts propagation of particular prion strains. Despite its key role, we have no information on the effect of this mutation on the structure, stability, folding, and dynamics of the cellular form of PrP (PrPC). Here, we show that the mutation has no measurable effect on the folding, dynamics, and stability of PrPC.

The human diseases may be inherited, arise sporadically, or be acquired through exposure to infectious prions (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5051) Google Scholar, 2Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Although rare in humans, intense interest has focused on these diseases both because of their unique biology and because of the occurrence of variant CJD, a new form of human prion disease, and the experimental evidence that it is caused by a BSE-like prion strain (3Hill A.F.

Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). According to the “protein-only” hypothesis (6Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), prions are composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of host-encoded prion protein (PrP) (7Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4011) Google Scholar). The disease-related isoform, PrPSc, is derived from its normal cellular precursor, PrPC, by a post-translational process that involves conformational change. PrPSc can be distinguished biochemically from PrPC by its partial protease resistance and detergent insolubility. Although the precise molecular events involved in this conversion remain ill defined, molecular genetic and in vitro studies support the hypothesis that some sort of direct interaction between PrPSc and either PrPC or some less organized state occurs. This interaction results in the PrPSc conformation being imposed upon the substrate protein, and the process of conversion is favored by sequence complementarity (8Prusiner S.B. Scott M. Foster D.

Nature. 1995; 378: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A key piece of evidence supporting this and the protein-only hypothesis in general is the finding that the large majority of cases of sporadic CJD are homozygous with respect to a common polymorphism at position 129 in the human prion protein, in which either methionine or valine can be encoded (only ∼49% of the UK population are homozygous with respect to this polymorphism) (9Palmer M.S. Dryden A.J. Hughes J.T. Collinge J. Nature. 1991; 352: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Elderly survivors of the kuru epidemic (an acquired prion disease largely restricted to the Fore linguistic group of the Papua New Guinea Highlands, which was transmitted during endocannibalistic feasts) who had multiple exposures at mortuary feasts, are, in marked contrast to younger unexposed Fore, predominantly PRNP 129 heterozygotes. Kuru imposed strong balancing selection on the Fore, essentially eliminating PRNP 129 homozygotes. World-wide PRNP haplotype diversity and coding allele frequencies have suggested that strong balancing selection at this locus occurred during the evolution of modern humans (14Mead S. Stumpf M.P. Whitfield J. Beck J.A. Poulter M. Campbell T. Uphill J. Goldstein D. Alpers M. Fisher E.M. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 300: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This polymorphism is crucial to the etiology and neuropathology of prion disease; to date, only individuals homozygous for methionine (Met/Met) have succumbed to variant CJD (3Hill A.F. Desbruslais M. Joiner S. Sidle K.C.L. Gowland I. Collinge J. Nature. 1997; 389: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 15Collinge J. Beck J. Campbell T. Estibeiro K. Will R.G.

Palmer M.S. Dryden A.J. Lancet. 1991; 337: 1441-1442Abstract PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The importance of sequence homology is further emphasized by the observation that in some families with inherited prion diseases, the age of onset is significantly later in individuals heterozygous to this polymorphism (18Baker H.E. Poulter M. Crow T.J. Frith C.D. Lofthouse R. Ridley R.M. Collinge J. Lancet. 1991; 337: 1286Abstract PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Collinge J. Brown J. Hardy J. Mullan M. Rossor M.N. Baker H.

Ghetti B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, heterozygosity with respect to this polymorphism appears to confer substantial resistance to prion disease. Perhaps more fundamentally, this polymorphism is also associated with the propagation of distinct human prion “isolates” or strains seen in different CJD phenotypes. Prion strains can be distinguished by their biological properties: distinct incubation periods, clinical features, and pattern of neuropathological targeting in experimental animals. It is now apparent that human prion strains are associated with the different biochemical features of PrPSc, with differences in PrPSc conformation and glycosylation that can be serially propagated in transgenic mice expressing human PrP (3Hill A.F. Desbruslais M. Joiner S. Sidle K.C.L. Gowland I. Collinge J. Nature. 1997; 389: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 5Collinge J. Sidle K.C.L. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The residue 129 HuPrP polymorphism appears to be able to affect the generation of these strain-specific PrPSc conformers and by inference the phenotype of human prion disease (22Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Asante E.A. Linehan J.M. Desbruslais M. Joiner S. Gowland I. Wood A. Welch J. Hill A.F. Lloyd S.E. Wadsworth J.D.F. Collinge J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6358-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Such phenotypic effects of this polymorphism are also seen in inherited prion disease associated with the D178N mutation in PRNP, where this mutation may result in the phenotype of CJD or fatal familial insomnia, depending on the 129 genotype of the mutant allele (24Goldfarb L.G. Petersen R.B. Tabaton M. Brown P. LeBlanc A.C. Montagna P. Cortelli P. Julien J. Vital C. Pendelbury W.W. Haltia M. Wills P.R. Hauw J.J. McKeever P.E. Monari L. Schrank B. Swergold G.D. Autilio-Gambetti L. Gajdusek D.C. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Science. 1992; 258: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Further, there are multiple distinct molecular forms of human PrPSc identified by molecular strain-typing studies (5Collinge J. Sidle K.C.L. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 22Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat.

Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 669-680Crossref Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 26Hill A.F. Joiner S. Wadsworth J.D. Sidle K.C. Bell J.E. Budka H. Ironside J.W. Collinge J. Brain. 2003; 126: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These are thought to represent distinct conformational states of PrPSc that differ in either the fold of the individual polypeptide chains or in the manner in which the chains are packed in a multimolecular complex or both. These states are manifested at the molecular level by (a) their response to cleavage by proteinase K and subsequent sizing of the resistant segment of polypeptide chain by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and (b) the ratio of diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and unglycosylated forms found in the protease-resistant PrPSc material. These PrPSc types are associated with distinct clinico-pathological phenotypes in affected patients. Types 1–3 are associated with classical CJD, whereas variant CJD is only associated with the type 4 strain (5Collinge J. Sidle K.C.L. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The propagation of these strain types is highly dependent upon the codon 129 genotype and hence the primary structure of the prion protein. For instance, the type 1 strain is only seen in methionine homozygotes, whereas the type 3 strain has not been seen on this genetic background. Most strikingly, variant CJD has only been seen to date in homozygous MM individuals. This polymorphism is thus fundamental to prion disease in humans, and therefore an understanding of its influence on PrP folding may provide strong clues as to the molecular mechanisms that underlie prion propagation. Current theories concentrate on the differing abilities for methionine or valine to be accommodated within β-sheet structure or the thermodynamic stabilities of both forms of PrPC, both of which are thought to affect the propensity of PrPC to convert to PrPSc (17Collinge J. Palmer M.S. Dryden A.J. Lancet. 1991; 337: 1441-1442Abstract PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 27Kim C.A. Berg J.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 28Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As a first step in characterizing this polymorphism, its effect on the three-dimensional structure of the valine form of PrPC has been determined. Here we describe the influence of the polymorphism on the fold stability, solution dynamics, and unfolding characteristics of the normal cellular form of prion protein (PrPC). Plasmid Preparation, Protein Expression, and Purification—The open reading frame of the human PrP gene (PRNP), containing methionine at residue 129, was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers designed to create a unique N-terminal BamHI site and C-terminal HindIII site for directional cloning of the fragment into the expression vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen Corp.). The primer corresponding to the N-terminal region of PRNP to be expressed was designed to mutate a glycine at codon 90 to methionine and to incorporate a thrombin cleavage site, with the C-terminal primer replacing a methionine residue at 232 with a stop codon. Standard protocols for site-directed mutagenesis were used to create another construct with the valine at position 129. The ligated pTrcHisB/PRNP construct was used to transform the Escherichia coli host strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), genotype F′ ompT hsdSB (rB- mB-) gal dcm (DE3), which was then plated onto Luria-Bertoni (LB) agar plates containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. Following sequence verification that clones contained the correct construct, cultures were grown for purification using a modification of protocols previously described (29Jackson G.S. Hill A.F. Joseph C. Hosszu L.L.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For cleavage of the fusion protein, thrombin was used at 0.1 unit of thrombin (Novagene) per 1 mg of protein for 16 h at room temperature. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorption using a calculated molar extinction of 19893 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. NMR Sample Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy—Uniformly 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled HuPrP(129V) and HuPrP(129M) samples were expressed in E. coli using an EMBL minimal medium recipe with 13C6-glucose and (15NH4)2SO4 as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, and purified as described (29Jackson G.S. Hill A.F. Joseph C. Hosszu L.L.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To ensure that the proteins were free of paramagnetic metal ions, they were unfolded in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and then dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate-d3, 3 mm sodium azide, pH 5.55, prior to concentration. NMR spectra were acquired at 303 K on 0.6–1.2 mm15N- and 13C/15N-labeled samples in 20 mm sodium acetate-d3, 3 mm sodium azide, pH 5.55 (in either 90% H2O plus 10% D2O or 99.9% D2O) using Bruker DRX-500 and DRX-600 spectrometers equipped with 5-mm 13C/15N/1H triple resonance probes. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to TSP. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were calculated relative to TSP, using the gyromagnetic ratios of 15N, 13C, and 1H (15N/1H = 0.101329118, 13C/1H = 0.251449530). NMR data were processed and analyzed on Silicon Graphics Workstations using Felix 2000 software (kindly donated by Accelrys, San Diego). Assignments and Structure Calculations—Backbone resonances (HN, N, Cα, C′, Cβ) of HuPrP(129V) and HuPrP(129M) were assigned using a standard suite of triple resonance NMR experiments (30Bax A. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. Ser.

Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Almost complete backbone assignments were determined, the exceptions being the amide protons and nitrogens of residues 167, 169–171, and 175, for which no resonances were detected. (As discussed below, these residues occupy a loop region between strand II and helix II, which is undergoing conformational exchange, resulting in line-broadening of NMR signals). Side chain 13C and 1H resonances were determined through three-dimensional 15N-separated total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC (34Whitehead B. Tessari M. Dux P. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Vuister G.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), three-dimensional 13C-separated HCCH- and CCH-total correlation spectroscopy (35Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 425-431Google Scholar) experiments and confirmed using through-space connectivities in NOE spectroscopy spectra. Aromatic ring protons were determined by analysis of through-space connectivities in NOE spectroscopy spectra. NOE distance constraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N-/13C-separated NOE spectroscopy spectra with 100-ms mixing times (36Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 37Schleucher J. Schwendinger M. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O. Glaser S.J. Sorensen O.W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and assigned using in-house macros and UNIX scripts. NOEs were calibrated on the basis of a survey of covalently fixed distances and divided into three groups with upper bounds of 5, 3.8, and 2.8 Å. JHNHA coupling constants were obtained through three-dimensional HNHA spectra (38Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Backbone φ and Ψ angle constraints were obtained using the program TALOS (39Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Only residues classified by the program as “good” were included, and restraints were implemented with bounds of θ ± 1.5σ, where θ and σ are the average and S.D., respectively, of the dihedral angles, as predicted by TALOS. Hydrogen bond restraints were included for slowly exchanging backbone amide resonances (see below) and implemented as two NOE constraints, dN-O < 2.6–3.2 Å and dNH-O < 1.7–2.3 Å. Three hydrogen bond restraints were used for the short anti-parallel β-sheet. These hydrogen bonds were determined on the basis of the above slow amide exchange and observed interstrand NOE connectivities. Structure calculations were carried out for both the C-terminal domain (residues 125–231) and N- and C-terminal domains (residues 91–231) of HuPrP(129V) using the standard NMR anneal and refine scripts provided within CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). One hundred structures were calculated from randomized starting coordinates, with the lowest energy 20 structures being further refined and chosen to represent the available structural ensemble. Amide Exchange—Hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates (kex) were determined by diluting 1 mm15N- or 13C/15N-labeled HuPrP samples with an equal volume of 20 mm sodium acetate-d3, 3 mm sodium azide, pH 5.55, dissolved in 100% D2O, and acquiring a series of 1H15N HSQC spectra at 303 K. The decay curves of the 1H15N HSQC cross-peaks were fitted to single exponential decays with offset, and protection factors (kex/kint) for observable amides were determined using intrinsic exchange rates (kint) (41Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Acquisition of the first experiment began approximately 5 min after mixing, setting a lower limit on the detection of protection factors of approximately 50. Spin Relaxation Measurements—Spin relaxation measurements (T1, T2, and 15N{1H} NOEs) were acquired on 1 mm15N-labeled HuPrP(129V) and HuPrP(129M) samples as described in Ref. 42Tjandra N. Feller S.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12562-12566Crossref Scopus (663) Google Scholar. The T1 data were obtained using 15N relaxation delays of 31, 65, 144, 242, 373, 573, 731, and 1400 ms. The T2 data were obtained using 15N relaxation delays of 16, 31, 47, 62, 78, 94, 125, and 296 ms. For the 15N{1H} NOE measurement, two two-dimensional spectra were acquired in the interleaved manner with a relaxation delay of 3.3 s between scans. Spectra were collected with acquisition times of 164 (t2) and 87.3 ms (t1) using 24–64 scans per complex t1 increment. Equilibrium Denaturation Data—The amide CD absorption of 7 μm HuPrP dissolved in 20 mm sodium acetate-d3, 2 mm sodium azide, pH 5.55, 55% (v/v) D2O was recorded in varying concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride at 222 nm on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter through a 1-cm light path, with a bandwidth of 10 nm over a 4-s integration time. These sample conditions were chosen so as to match the conditions used in the amide exchange experiments described above. The ellipticity signal (θ) was converted to the proportion of molecules in the native state, αN, according to the relationship αN = (θ - θU)/(θN - θU), where θU and θN are the ellipticity signals for the unfolded and native states, respectively. Data were fitted to the function, αN=(K(N/U)·exp(m·D))/(1+K(N/U)·exp(m·D)) where m represents the sensitivity of the unfolding transition to denaturant, and D is the denaturant activity (43Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Structure of HuPrP(129V)—The molecule used in this paper comprises residues 91–231 of the protein (HuPrP(129V) and HuPrP(129M)). This length of construct was chosen, since it corresponds with the fragment of PrP that is associated with prion propagation (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5051) Google Scholar, 2Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 44Fischer M. Rulicke T. Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B. Brandner S. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The protein consists of an N-terminal, flexible and disordered tail (residues 91–124), which contains a high affinity transition metal-binding site (45Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L.P. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and a folded, globular domain consisting of residues 125–231. This domain consists of three α-helices encompassing residues 144–154 (helix I), 173–192 (helix II), and 200–226 (helix III) and a short, anti-parallel β-sheet made up of residues 129–131 and 161–163. A single disulfide bond that links helices II and III holds the core of the protein together. The polymorphism is situated within the first strand of the β-sheet (Fig. 1B). Structure calculations were carried out for both the C-terminal domain (residues 125–231) and N- and C-terminal domains (residues 91–231) of HuPrP(129V). A number of medium range NOE connectivities were observed within the N terminus of the protein (residues 91–124); however, these did not define any secondary structure, a point supported by the lack of 13C chemical shift perturbation away from random coil values. This result is consistent with the relatively slow spin relaxation of NMR signals in this region, which is indicative of a predominantly unstructured peptide. Within the C-terminal domain of the protein, the secondary structure elements are well defined, as reflected by the r.m.s. deviations from the mean structure of <0.70 Å for backbone heavy atoms and <1.0 Å for all heavy atoms (Table I). Regions where the level of definition falls are associated with the loop connecting strand 2 of the β-sheet and helix 2 (residues 167–171), the loop that connects helices II and III (residues 194–199), and the C terminus of helix 3 (residues 224–226) (Fig. 1A). The loop comprising residues 167–171 is characterized by extensive line broadening of NMR signals. This has been reported for a number of prion proteins from different species and is due to conformational exchange between two or more backbone conformations, on the millisecond time scale, which results in broadening of NMR signals. The lack of definition observed within the NMR ensemble for this region of the protein is thus due to lack of constraints, as well as conformational averaging. The increased disorder seen in the other less defined regions, however, appears to be due to conformational equilibria on a faster time scale and is discussed later.Table IHuPrP(129V) structural statistics Ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures of 100 calculated. r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths and bond or improper angles from the ideal CNS values were 0.00156 ± 0.000011 Å, 0.321 ± 0.0130°, and 0.196 ± 0.0212°, respectively.ParametersValuesExperimental restraintsNOE distancesIntraresidue504Sequential277Medium range166Long range (Δ ≥ 5)227Dihedral restraints136Hydrogen bond restraints34 × 23JHNHA-coupling constants49Deviations from the experimental restraintsar.m.s.

We have characterized an anti-β1 antibody, SG/19, that had been reported to inhibit the function of the β1 integrin on the cell surface. SG/19 recognized the wild type β1 subunit that exists in a conformational equilibrium between the high and low affinity states but bound poorly to a mutant β1 integrin that had been locked in a high affinity state. Epitope mapping of SG/19 revealed that Thr82 in the β1 subunit, located at the outer face of the boundary between the I-like and hybrid domains, was the key binding determinant for this antibody. Direct visualization of the α 5β1 headpiece fragment in complex with SG/19 Fab with electron microscopy confirmed the location of the binding surface and showed that the ligand binding site is not occluded by the bound Fab. Surface plasmon resonance showed that α 5β1 integrin bound by SG/19 maintained a low affinity toward its physiological ligand fibronectin (Fn) whereas binding by function-blocking anti-α5 antibodies resulted in a complete loss of fibronectin binding. Thus a class of the anti-β antibodies represented by SG/19 attenuate the ligand binding function by restricting the conformational shift to the high affinity state involving the swing-out of the hybrid domain without directly interfering with ligand docking.

Integrins are cell adhesion molecules that bind to ligands in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces and regulate many biological functions including cell migration. The affinity of integrins for ligands is conformationally regulated (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar, 2Liddington R.C.

On physiological cell surfaces, integrins can assume multiple conformations with distinct affinity states, with the low affinity state being predominant. Physiological “inside-out” signals that impinge on integrin cytoplasmic domains and activating or inhibitory mAbs 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; EM, electron microscopic; Fn, fibronectin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; EM, electron microscopic; Fn, fibronectin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. that bind to the integrin extracellular domain are thought to alter the equilibrium between different conformational states. Electron microscopic (EM) studies of the extracellular domain, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and NMR studies on the cytoplasmic domains, and disulfide cross-linking of the transmembrane domains have indicated that close apposition of the membrane-proximal region of each subunit and the overall bent structure are hallmarks for the low affinity state of integrins, whereas the extended conformation with separated legs represents the high affinity state (5Takagi J.

Monoclonal antibodies have been instrumental to studies on the structure and function of integrins (9Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin mAbs can be divided into three classes: (i) “inhibitory mAbs” that perturb biological function i.e. ligand binding, (ii) “stimulatory mAbs” that augment ligand binding, and (iii) “neutral mAbs” that do not have any impact on activity. Although some inhibitory mAbs directly recognize the ligand binding site on the integrin molecule and act as ligand-mimetic competitive inhibitors, another class of inhibitory mAbs bind outside the ligand binding site and seem to inhibit integrin function allosterically (10Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Mould A.P.

It is assumed that this class of mAbs exert their effect by stabilizing the unoccupied state of the receptor or by preventing a conformational change necessary for ligand occupancy, in a manner opposite from that of stimulating mAbs (12Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which these mAbs affect the conformational change in integrins has not been determined nor has the effect of these mAbs on the ligand binding kinetics of integrins been investigated. Here we present direct evidence that a class of allosteric anti-β1 mAbs, represented by SG/19, binds distal to the ligand binding site across the interface between the I-like and hybrid domains of the β1 subunit and prevents interconversion of the receptor conformation by blocking the hybrid domain swing-out. The restriction imposed by mAb binding maintains the integrin in a low, but not zero, affinity state.

Transfection and mAb Binding—Plasmids coding for full-length wild type or G429N mutant human β1 were subcloned into pEF1/V5-HisA and introduced into the CHO-K1 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. After selecting the transfected cells in a medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin G418 for 1 week, the surviving cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to obtain cell lines expressing the desired level of human β1 integrins. For epitope mapping, CHO-K1 cells transfected with a human β1 chain carrying single point mutation were cultured in a medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin G418 for 2 weeks, and the surviving cell population was tested for reactivity against various mAbs without further cloning. Bindings of mAbs were evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using either anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Fibronectin binding was evaluated by incubating human β1-expressing cells with 50 μg/ml bovine plasma fibronectin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate in the presence or absence of activating mAb TS2/16 (10 μg/ml) at room temperature for 30 min followed by flow cytometric analysis. Negative Stain EM of α5β1 Head Fragment—A soluble α5β1 head-piece fragment containing α5 residues 1–623 and β1 residues 1–445 was produced and purified as described previously (24Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The construct contained a disulfide-bonded C-terminal “clasp,” which was removed specifically by tobacco etch virus protease treatment prior to the analysis. Unclasped α5β1 fragment was incubated with a saturating concentration of SG/19 Fab fragment or Fn7–10 fragment and purified on a Superdex 200 HR column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, containing 1 mm MnCl2. The peak fraction was adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids, stained with uranyl formate, and inspected with an FEI Tecnai 12 electron microscope operated at 120 kV. Image processing was performed using the SPIDER image processing package (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar) as described previously (24Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding Assay—Interaction between the recombinant full-length α5β1 and recombinant fibronectin fragment was assessed by SPR analysis with a BIAcore 3000 (Biacore AB) as described previously (26Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.7 μg of α5β1 was incubated with 4.2 μg of purified IgG for >30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm MnCl2, diluted to give a final concentration of 20–40 nm, and flowed at 20 μl/min at 25 °C over a streptavidin-coated sensor chip immobilized with biotinylated Fn7–10 at a density of ∼500 resonance units. All measurements were base line-corrected by subtracting the sensorgram obtained with a control streptavidin surface, and kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software version 3.0. The SG/19 Epitope Maps to Thr82 in the Hybrid Domain of the β1 Subunit—SG/19 was originally identified as a mouse mAb that blocked binding of the Nalm-6 human pre-B cell line to the murine stromal cell line BMS2 (13Miyake K. Hasunuma Y. Yagita H. Kimoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It strongly inhibits β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion at 10 μg/ml (13Miyake K. Hasunuma Y. Yagita H. Kimoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Whereas most function-blocking mAb to β1 bind to the I-like domain (9Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SG/19 maps to a more N-terminal region in the β1 subunit (28Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Within this N-terminal region, only 4 residues in the PSI domain and 7 residues in the hybrid domain differ between human and mouse β1. Although these domains are not known to be implicated in the ligand binding function, inspection of a homology model of α5β1 reveals that 2 of these 11 species-specific residues (i.e. Thr82 and Lys87) are positioned very close to the ligand binding I-like domain (Fig. 1) and thus are likely candidates for the SG/19 epitope. These residues were individually mutated to the corresponding murine residue, and the reactivity of SG/19 was evaluated. As shown in Table I, the binding of SG/19 to the β1 chain was critically dependent on Thr82, whereas the mutation at Lys87 did not affect the binding. Conversely, the binding of another function-blocking mAb, SG/7, which had been reported to recognize a Ca2+-dependent epitope (29Miyake K. Yamashita Y. Kimoto M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1221-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was totally abolished by the mutation of Lys87 and only partially by the mutation of Thr82. Mutation of species-specific residues in the I-like domain, i.e. N207D, K208R, V211F, K218Q, M287V, and A342G, did not affect the binding of either mAb.Table IEffect of single amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of the β1 chain on the reactivity of anti-β1 mAbs CHO-K1 transfectants expressing human β1 containing the indicated mutations were examined for reactivity with anti-β1 mAbs by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. 207/208/211 denotes β1 carrying the combined mutations N207D, K208R, and V211F.

Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The epitope for mAb 13 had been mapped to residues 207–218 in the β1 I-like domain (27Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results revealed that mAb 13 recognizes a combinatorial epitope made by Asn207, Lys208, and Val211 with Asn207 contributing the most (Table I). Next we explored whether SG/19 and mAb 13 compete with each other for binding to β1. Cy3-labeled SG/19 was competed out by mAb 13 for binding to wild type human β1 (Table II). Reciprocally, the binding of mAb 13 was competed by mAb SG/19. Reciprocal competition was also observed between SG/19 and SG/7 mAbs (data not shown) and between mAb SG/7 and mAb 13 (13Miyake K. Hasunuma Y. Yagita H. Kimoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, SG/19 did not compete with two other mAbs, TS2/16 and 4B4, mapped to residues 207–218 (data not shown) indicating that the binding site for mAb 13 is slightly different from that for TS2/16 and 4B4. In the three-dimensional model, Asn207, Thr82, and Lys87 are all located in close proximity (Fig. 1B). Because the antigen-binding footprints for the three inhibitory mAbs 13, SG/19, and SG/7 are overlapping, they are likely to have similar impacts on the conformation of the junction of the β1 I-like and hybrid domains to which they bind.Table IICompetitive binding between mAbs 13 and SG/19 CHO-K1 cells transfected with wild type human β1 were stained with 5 μg/ml Cy3-labeled mAbs (or unlabeled rat mAb 13 in combination with fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-rat IgG) in the absence or presence of 50 μg/ml unlabeled antibodies.

Therefore, stimulatory mAbs generally show increased binding toward activated receptors (9Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tsuchida J. Ueki S. Takada Y. Saito Y. Takagi J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Allosteric inhibitory mAbs that work in the opposite way are expected to show reduced binding to the active conformer. We have successfully engineered a mutant β3 integrin constitutively in a high affinity state by introducing an N-glycosylation site, i.e. a glycan wedge, at the inner side of the bend between the I-like and hybrid domains (31Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A previously designed β1 glycan wedge mutant, β1-P333N, has a high affinity for ligands (31Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although it is less well expressed than wild type and only partially expresses activation epitopes. Therefore, another mutant, β1-G429N, was designed to introduce an N-glycosylation site at Asn429 to wedge open the I-like hybrid domain interface (Fig. 1C). This mutant shows maximal ligand binding activity in the absence of any activating agents (Fig. 2A). This activated β1 mutant assumes the high affinity conformation in the absence of a bound ligand, as shown by the markedly increased binding of the stimulatory mAbs 12G10 and HUTS-4 compared with binding to the wild type receptor (Fig. 2B). Conversely, binding of the inhibitory mAbs 13 and SG/19 was decreased more than 4-fold to the β1-G429N mutant compared with wild type (Fig. 2B). SG/7 also reacted much less well (∼70% reduction from wild type) to the wedge mutant (data not shown). A reduction of mAb 13 binding and augmentation of mAb HUTS-4 by an activating mutation in the β1 I-like domain α7-helix has been reported (32Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These effects of the L358A mutation are much less pronounced (∼50% reduction and ∼50% increase in binding of mAbs 13 and HUTS-4, respectively) than the G429N mutation. As Gly429 is located far from the SG/19 epitope at Thr82 and the mAb 13 epitope at Asn207 (Fig. 1), it is unlikely that mutation of Gly429 directly affects binding to these epitopes. Taken together, the data suggest strongly that the inhibitory mAbs 13 and SG/19 prefer the resting (i.e. low affinity) conformer and stabilize this conformation upon binding thereby allosterically modulating the ligand binding activity of β1 integrin. EM Images of SG/19 Fab Bound to the α5β1 Integrin Head-piece—We next sought to clarify how SG/19 could stabilize a particular conformation of an integrin. In a recent study (24Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we utilized negative stain EM and image analysis to visualize a headpiece fragment of α5β1 integrin in the absence and presence of a bound ligand. In the absence of a bound ligand, the α5β1 headpiece assumes the “closed” conformation with the β1 hybrid domain close to the α subunit (Fig. 3A and Ref. 24Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Binding to a fragment of the ligand fibronectin changes the conformation dramatically, with an outward swing of the hybrid domain away from the β subunit to assume the “open” conformation (Fig. 3B and Ref. 24Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The complex of the α5β1 headpiece and SG/19 Fab reveals a clear density for the Fab bound to the side of the β1 subunit (Fig. 3C). The Fab fragment can be easily distinguished by its typical oval shape with a “dimple” corresponding to the thin central part between the VL/VH and CL/CH1 lobes. The very uniform orientation of SG/19 Fab relative to the rest of the particle makes it possible to define the binding surface. The antigen binding site of the SG/19 Fab docks to the boundary between the I-like and hybrid domains of the β1 subunit at the “side” away from the α5 subunit. This is in perfect agreement with the result of the epitope mapping (see Fig. 1). Importantly, the ligand binding interface located on the top of the receptor is completely exposed and not occluded by the bound Fab (Fig. 3, compare B with C). The images show that the binding site of SG/19 centers on the junction between the I-like and hybrid domains, very close to the location of the key antigenic residue Thr82, which is at the domain boundary (see Fig. 1). The binding site of SG/19 clearly includes significant portions of both the I-like and hybrid domains (Fig. 3C). This binding site is significantly rear-ranged when the hybrid domain swings out ∼70° upon binding fibronectin (Fig. 3B) so that it is unlikely that SG/19 could bind to it. These findings suggest that SG/19 prevents the outward swing of the hybrid domain, trapping the integrin in a low affinity conformation. α5β1 Bound by Inhibitory Anti-β1 mAbs Has Low but Detectable Affinity for Ligands—The ligand binding characteristics of α5β1 integrin bound by inhibitory mAbs was measured using SPR to determine whether these mAbs abolished ligand binding, or maintained α5β1 in a low affinity state. To ensure saturation, purified recombinant α5β1 integrin was preincubated with purified mAbs in large excess. Incubation with 1.8 μm SG/19 Fab for 10 min resulted in saturation binding of the α5β1 headpiece with no dissociation detected during ∼20 min of gel filtration (Fig. 3D). Saturation was also observed with 100 nm SG/19 Fab (not shown). Reaction mixtures containing 140 nm α5β1 headpiece and 560 nm mAb (i.e. 1120 nm of Fab equivalents) were diluted up to 7-fold (thus maintaining the concentration of uncomplexed Fab equivalents at >140 nm) and directly infused onto sensor chips coated with fibronectin fragment in a buffer containing 1 mm Mn2+. α5β1 complexed with the non-blocking, non-activating α5 mAb 11 showed an elevated signal compared with the uncomplexed α5β1 because of the increased mass of the analyte (Fig. 4, compare tracing b with c). Although mAb 11 binding slightly changed the binding kinetics by decreasing the dissociation rate, this seems to be a general effect of mAb binding, because another non-blocking, non-activating β1 mAb JB1 (Fig. 4a) and an anti-coiled coil tag mAb 2H11(not shown) had a similar effect. The inhibitory α5 mAbs 16 (Fig. 4g) and P1D6 (Fig. 4f) completely abolished the binding of α5β1 headpiece to fibronectin. In contrast, α5β1 complexed with mAb 13 (Fig. 4d) or SG/19 (Fig. 4e) showed decreased but significant binding to the ligand. Increasing the mAb concentration 2-fold did not alter the binding (not shown). Together with the saturation binding experiments described above, the known KD of 0.34 nm of mAb 13 for α5β1 (11Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the high concentrations of mAb used in SPR, these results demonstrate that the incomplete inhibition is not because of incomplete saturation of the binding sites by mAbs. Therefore, mAbs SG/19 and 13 decrease the affinity of α5β1 for fibronectin. The kinetic constants (Table III) show that SG/19 binding affected both association and dissociation rate constants resulting in an overall 30-fold drop in the KD value.Table IIIKinetic parameters for α5β1 binding to Fn7–10 fragment Surface plasmon resonance binding was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the kinetic parameters were derived using the BIAsimulation software.

The inhibitory mAbs 13 and SG/7 show similar binding and inhibition characteristics and have an overlapping binding footprint, suggesting that the allosteric mode of inhibition is shared among these three mAbs. In fact, mAb 13 has been reported to be an allosteric inhibitor for ligand binding by α5β1 (11Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This notion was based on the fact that mAb 13 binding to β1 was attenuated by ligand, and the concentration of ligand required for half-maximal inhibition was independent of the mAb concentration. Not only occupation by ligand but also mutations that lock the β1 integrin in a high affinity state perturb mAb 13 binding (Fig. 2B and Ref. 32Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), supporting the indirect mode of inhibition by this class of mAbs. EM images of the integrin-SG/19 Fab complex clearly show that the mAb docks at the outer hinge connecting the I-like domain and the hybrid domain. This would prevent the outward swing of the hybrid domain and fix the closed conformation of the headpiece that represents the low affinity state (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Recently, we (33Luo B.-H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10215-10221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and others (32Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have reported that shape shifting in the α7 helix region of the β I-like domain upregulates ligand affinity. In the context of the whole molecule, this shape shifting causes an outward swing of the β hybrid domain (3Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 26Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus inhibitory mAbs represented by mAb 13 and SG/19 exert their effect by disabling the conformational transition of β I-like domain to the high affinity state. This is exactly the reverse of the mechanism by which the glycan-wedge mutation activates integrins (31Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether all anti-β1 inhibitory mAbs work with a similar indirect mechanism. The inhibitory mAb 4B4 maps to Lys218 of the β1 I-like domain and does not compete with mAb 13, SG/19, or SG/7. 2J. Takagi, unpublished result. The Lys218 epitope of 4B4 is more proximal to the ligand binding site (Fig. 1). However, because 4B4 binding is also diminished in the β1 wedge mutant (data not shown), it is likely that inhibition by 4B4 is, at least in part, allosteric in nature. Is the allosteric mode specific to β1 mAb or shared with inhibitory mAb to other integrin β subunits? Inhibitory mAbs to human β2 are divided into two classes based on the epitope location, one has been mapped to the top of the I-like domain primarily recognizing Glu175 or Arg122 and the other recognizes a combinatorial epitope involving the side chains of Lys133, His322, and Tyr339 (34Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21514-21524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of the β2 I-like domain reveals that the latter residues are situated on the side/bottom face of the I-like domain in a location similar to the epitope residues for mAb 13, SG/19, or SG/7, suggesting the latter class of mAbs to inhibit β2 integrin function in a way similar to the mAbs described in this paper. All of the anti-β3 inhibitory mAbs in which the epitopes have been mapped in detail to date recognize the top part of the I-like domain (35Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and it is not known whether these mAbs inhibit β3 integrin function directly or indirectly. Inspection of the β3 integrin structure reveals that human/mouse species-specific residues are excluded from the outer hinge region between the I-like and hybrid domains, suggesting that mouse anti-human allosteric inhibitory mAbs against β3 similar to SG/19 could not be obtained because of the sequence conservation. Mould et al. (10Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have reported that anti-α5 mAbs also primarily work as allosteric inhibitors. This notion was again based on the fact that the binding of inhibitory anti-α5 mAbs were non-competitively attenuated by the bound ligand. However, our SPR experiments clearly showed that α5β1 bound by anti-α5 mAb 16 or P1D6 had no detectable affinity for ligand, in contrast to the decreased but significant ligand affinity of the SG/19-bound form (Fig. 4). This strongly suggests that the mechanisms for the inhibition are quite different between these two classes of mAbs. EM imaging of the complex of Fn7–10 with the α5β1 headpiece fragment revealed that the 10th module docked onto the α/β interface with the 7–9th modules located close to the α5 subunit, although a direct interaction between the 9th module and the α5 β-propeller domain was not evident (Fig. 3B and Ref. 24Takagi J. Strokovich K. Springer T.A. Walz T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that binding of anti-α5 mAbs to the top of the α5 β-propeller sterically precludes the approach of the Fn7–9 portion, even if the binding site is distinct from the ligand binding pocket. The present study underscores the strength of EM imaging in analyzing the conformation of protein complexes. The determination of epitope residues by mutagenesis, combined with three-dimensional structure information, generally leads to a reasonable assumption about the binding mode of an antibody. Direct visualization of the antigen-antibody complex, however, reveals not only the location of the actual interface but also elucidates the impact of antibody binding on the conformation of the target protein. In contrast to x-ray crystal structures, which usually show one of several possible low energy conformations, molecular EM samples the entire set of conformations of single particles and can thus produce structures for all of the major conformations present in the protein population. Another advantage is that EM imaging can be accomplished with a relatively small amount of dilute sample. In conclusion, we have shown that one class of allosteric anti-β1 mAbs blocks ligand binding by preventing the “swingout” of the hybrid domain from the I-like domain, thus stabilizing the closed conformation of the integrin headpiece. There may exist another class of allosterically inhibitory mAbs that stabilize the “bent” conformation of integrins by stabilizing the head-tail or α-tail-β-tail interactions. The use of mAbs as a probe for integrin structure and function has yielded a profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying ligand recognition and affinity regulation of integrins. The unique mode of functional perturbation by anti-β1 integrin mAbs described here may have important implications in developing anti-integrin pharmaceuticals. For example, an antibody that stabilizes the low affinity conformation of an integrin without completely eliminating its function may prove desirable to prevent the oversuppression of integrin activity. Stabilizing the natural low affinity conformation may also be advantageous, because an antagonist-induced conformational change has been implicated in the development of autoantibodies in patients receiving anti-integrin drugs (36Billheimer J.T.

The effects of SR proteins have only been investigated on a limited number of HIV-1 splicing sites by using small HIV-1 RNA pieces.

For interpretation of the data, transcripts containing one or several of the HIV-1 acceptor sites were spliced in vitro in the presence or the absence of one of the tested SR proteins.

By using the integrated proviral genome as the template, RNA polymerase II of the infected cell produces long primary transcripts that are all identical. Some of these transcripts are transported to the cytoplasm in an intact form to serve as genomes for new virions or as messenger RNAs for the production of the Gag-Pol protein precursor. The other transcripts undergo alternative splicing to produce mRNAs for the auxiliary and regulatory proteins and the Env precursor protein. Production of mRNAs encoding HIV-1 proteins depends on the alternative utilization of four 5′-splice sites D1 to D4 (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and eight 3′-splice sites (A1, A2, A3, A4a, -b, -c, A5, and A7) (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional 3′-splice site (A6) was only found in one HIV-1 strain (2Benko D.M. Schwartz S. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2505-2518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Donor sites D1, D2, and D3 can be coupled to any of the A1 to A5 acceptor sites, whereas donor site D4 is exclusively coupled to site A7 and to site A6 when this site is present (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Benko D.M. Schwartz S. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2505-2518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The combination of these various sites gives rise to at least 35 different mRNAs (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the relative efficiencies of the HIV-1 donor sites seem to depend mainly upon their complementarity to the U1 snRNA 5′-terminal sequence (3O'Reilly M.M. McNally M.T. Beemon K.L.

Biol. 2002; 323: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Despite these numerous handicaps, the utilization of several of the HIV-1 acceptor sites is essential for virus multiplication. Sites A3 and A7 are used for production of mRNAs of the Tat transcriptional activator (see Ref. 1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and for review see Ref. 25Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). One of the three A4a, -b, or -c sites and site A7 are used to produce mRNAs for the Rev protein (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This regulatory protein plays an essential role in the transport of intact primary transcripts to the cytoplasm (for review see Ref. 26Boris-Lawrie K. Roberts T.M. Hull S.

Nef down-regulates the cell-surface expression of the HIV-1 receptor glycoprotein and has many additional roles in the infected cell that favor virus multiplication. It is also responsible for AIDS pathology, because of its role in bystander lymphocyte apoptosis (for reviews see Refs. 27Harris M. Curr.

Commun. 2000; 267: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, site A2 is needed for production of mRNAs for the Vpr protein. Vpr is implicated in nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex, and it induces cell cycle arrest in proliferating cells (for review see Ref. 29Bukrinsky M. Adzhubei A. Rev. Med. Virol. 1999; 9: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the regulated acceptor sites of cellular mRNAs generally depends upon the binding of members of the SR protein family (for reviews see Refs. 30Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar and 31Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). To date, 10 distinct members of this family have been identified (for reviews see Refs. 30Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar and 32Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). These proteins contain one or two RNA recognition motif(s), together with a carboxyl-terminal domain containing numerous arginine-serine amino acid pairs. SR proteins are involved in constitutive splicing where they seem to have redundant functions in assistance to spliceosomal component assembly. Because of their interactions with the 70K protein of U1 snRNP, the 35-kDa subunit of factor U2AF, and proteins of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, the SR proteins are essential actors in the complex mechanism of spliceosome assembly (for reviews see Refs. 30Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar and 33Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, SR proteins can regulate alternative splicing by binding to cis-regulatory elements. These regulatory elements generally bind specifically one given SR protein and, depending on the identity of this SR protein, different effects may be generated. Binding of SR proteins to specific sequences located downstream from the acceptor site generally reinforces the efficiency of U2AF binding to the polypyrimidine tract, either by direct interaction of the RS domain of the SR protein with the RS domain of U2AF35 or by displacement of the hnRNP A1 protein that blocks the access of spliceosomal components to the 3′-splice site (for reviews see Refs. 30Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 31Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The role of SR proteins on viral multiplication has been demonstrated by previous studies on adenovirus. SR proteins activate the production of the early mRNAs, but a limitation of their activity is required for the late phase of infection (34Molin M. Akusjarvi G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9002-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This limitation results from titration of the SR proteins by the major late transcripts (35Himmelspach M. Cavaloc Y. Chebli K. Stevenin J. Gattoni R. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 794-806PubMed Google Scholar) and/or a virus-induced dephosphorylation (36Kanopka A. Muhlemann O. Petersen-Mahrt S. Estmer C. Ohrmalm C. Akusjarvi G. Nature. 1998; 393: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although variations of the cellular concentrations of some of the SR proteins, namely SC35 and 9G8, have been observed after cell infection by virus HIV-1 (37Maldarelli F. Xiang C. Chamoun G. Zeichner S.L. Virus Res. 1998; 53: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Ryo A. Suzuki Y. Arai M. Kondoh N. Wakatsuki T. Hada A. Shuda M. Tanaka K. Sato C. Yamamoto M. Yamamoto N. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), little is known about the action of SR proteins on the competition between the eight splicing acceptor sites and four splicing donor sites of HIV-1 RNA. The present knowledge in this field can be summarized as follows: (i) deep studies, which were performed both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrated the action of proteins ASF/SF2 and SC35 at acceptor site A7 (17Tange T.O. Kjems J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Zhu J. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Mol.

Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For a complete study of the effects of individual SR proteins on the entire set of HIV-1 splicing sites in cellular conditions, we cotransfected HeLa cells with a construct that produces a truncated HIV-1 RNA containing all the splicing sites (13Bilodeau P.S. Domsic J.K. Stoltzfus C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9764-9772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jacquenet S. Ropers D. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Mougin A. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a plasmid that overexpresses one of the SC35, SRp40, ASF/SF2, and 9G8 SR proteins. In these ex vivo experiments, very different HIV-1 RNA splicing patterns were obtained with different overexpressed SR protein. For interpretation of the data, in vitro splicing assays were performed with transcripts that contained the D1 donor site and one or several of the A1 to A5 acceptor sites. Plasmids Used in This Study—pLD-C2, pLD-C3, and pLD-L3-U1 constructs, used for production of the C2, C3, and L3-U1 transcripts, were described previously (11Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To build the plasmid pLD-C1, two DNA fragments were generated by PCR amplifications of plasmid pBRU3 (42Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the HIV-1 BRU/LAI complete cDNA (Gen-Bank™ accession number K02013). Amplifications were performed as described previously (23Damier L. Domenjoud L. Branlant C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding the RNA region from position 4313 to 4545 (43Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K.

The BglII-EcoRI fragment of plasmid pLD-C2 (23Damier L. Domenjoud L. Branlant C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was substituted for the BglII-EcoRI fragment of the amplified DNA. The SP1 ex2 inv 9G8–102 plasmid (44Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was used for production of an SP6 transcript allowing us to test for protein 9G8 splicing activation properties in vitro. Plasmid ΔPSP used for transfection experiments was described previously (11Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Plasmids pXJ41-ASF, pXJ41-SRp40, pXJ42–9G8, pXJ42-SC35, or pXJ42-SRp20 were used for overexpression of the corresponding SR proteins. They were constructed by insertion of the cDNA of each SR protein in the multicloning site of pXJ41 or pXJ42 expression vector, as described previously (45Bourgeois C.F. Popielarz M. Hildwein G. Stevenin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7347-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription and in Vitro Splicing Assays—Plasmids pLD-C1 and pLD-C2 were linearized by EcoRI, plasmids pLD-C3 and pLD-L3-U1 by PstI, and plasmid Sp1 ex2 inv 9G8-102 by HindIII. They were used as templates for the production of capped, uniformly labeled RNAs by the T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. In vitro splicing assays were performed in HeLa cell nuclear extract (from the Computer Cell Culture Center S.A., Belgium), pure cytoplasmic S100 extract prepared as described previously (35Himmelspach M. Cavaloc Y. Chebli K. Stevenin J. Gattoni R. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 794-806PubMed Google Scholar), or mixtures of S100 and nuclear extracts (4:4 μl and 7:1 μl), in 22-μl assays using classical conditions for in vitro splicing reaction (23Damier L. Domenjoud L. Branlant C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The duration of incubation at 30 °C was for 2 h and 30 min. For SR protein assays, 150 or 300 ng of purified 9G8, ASF/SF2, SC35, or SRp40 recombinant protein were used, prepared as described previously (44Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The degree of purity of these proteins was verified by electrophoresis followed by argentic staining and Western blot analysis. The C1, C2, C3, L3-U1, and Sp1 ex2 inv 9G8-102 splicing products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5 or 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and were visualized by autoradiography. Quantifications were performed with a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences) using the ImageQuant software (version 5.2). Splicing efficiency was expressed as the ratio of spliced products (M) versus unspliced RNA (P). For each gel electrophoresis of splicing products, M/P values were measured three times using the ImageQuant software. The mean value is given with an estimation of the M/P measurement error, shown as bar errors in the histograms representing the M/P values (Figs.1, E1–E4, 2, C1–C4, and 3, C1–C3). The factor of splicing activation by SR proteins was estimated by dividing the M/P ratio obtained in the presence of the recombinant SR protein by that obtained in its absence (fold of activation). The estimated errors on the factors of activation due to the experimental errors on M/P measurements mentioned above was deduced and represented as bar errors in the histograms showing activation factors.Fig. 2Differential effects of individual SR proteins on the splicing of the L3-U1 RNA in S100 or NE/S100 mixtures.

Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar), with 1 μgof ΔPSP plasmid and 50–400 ng of plasmids overexpressing SR proteins. Carrier BSSK DNA was added to the transfections up to a total amount of DNA of 8 μg. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the transfected HeLa cells 48 h after transfection with the RNA-solv Reagent (Omega Bio-Tek), and it was treated by DNase. Three μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed by the Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase according to the supplier's specifications (Invitrogen), using oligonucleotide ACC15 (5′-TTCACTAATCGAATGGATC-3′, complementary to the HIV-1 pNL4-3 RNA from positions 8445 to 8463) as the primer. About 10% of each of the RT assays was PCR-amplified with the forward oligonucleotide 2143 (5′-GGCTTGCTGAAGCGCGCACGGCAAGAGG-3′, containing the HIV-1 pNL4–3 RNA sequence from positions 700–727), and reverse primer 2144, which spans the D4 and A7 splice sites (5′-TTGGAGGTGGGTTGCTTTGATAGAG-3′, complementary to pNL4–3 RNA from positions 6029–6041 and 8369–8381). This selectively amplified the 1.8-kb HIV size class mRNAs. Amplification was limited to 30 cycles, in order to detect both major and minor bands. DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel, and a Typhoon 8600 imager (Amersham Biosciences) was used to scan the gel after ethidium bromide staining. PCR products were quantified using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). The fractionated cDNAs were identified by reference to previous data on HeLa cells transfected with plasmid ΔPSP (11Jacquenet S.

ActRII/IIB are promiscuous receptors known to bind at least a dozen TGF-β superfamily ligands including activins, myostatin, several BMPs, and nodal. Here we utilize a new screening procedure to rapidly identify activin-A mutants with loss of signaling activity. Our goal was to identify activin-A mutants able to bind ActRII but unable to bind ALK4 and which would be, therefore, candidate type II activin receptor antagonists. Using the structure of BMP-2 bound to its type I receptor (ALK3) as a guide, we introduced mutations in the context of the inhibin βA cDNA and assessed the signaling activity of the resulting mutant proteins. We identified several mutants in the finger (M91E, I105E, M108A) and wrist (activin A/activin C chimera, S60P, I63P) regions of activin-A with reduced signaling activity. Of these the M108A mutant displayed the lowest signaling activity while retaining wild-type-like affinity for ActRII. Unlike wild-type activin-A, the M108A mutant was unable to form a cross-linked complex with ALK4 in the presence of ActRII indicating that its ability to bind ALK4 was disrupted. This data suggested that the M108A mutant might be capable of modulating signaling of activin and related ligands. Indeed, the M108A mutant antagonized activin-A and myostatin, but not TGF-β, signaling in 293T cells, indicating it may be generally capable of blocking ligands that signal via ActRII/IIB.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The receptor activation mechanism for activin involves initial binding to its type II receptor (ActRII/IIB), which leads to the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of its type I receptor (ALK4) followed by activation of intracellular signaling (13Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Lebrun J.-J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the specific amino acid residues of activin-A involved in the underlying intermolecular interactions within the activin/ActRII-ECD/ALK4-ECD complex are only now, based on relevant structural and functional data, being deduced. Activin and related TGFβ ligands have a single disulfide bond that covalently connects the two chains of the dimer. Based on the crystal structure of related ligands (15Mittl P.R. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grutter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and of activin bound to ActRIIB (16Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and with reference to the BMP7·ActRII structure (17Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), it is predicted that within each activin monomer two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands form first a short and then a long “finger” that stretch out like wings from the cystine-knot core of the dimer. The characteristic curvature of the fingers creates concave and convex surfaces on the butterfly-shaped ligand. At the base of the wing-like fingers, each monomer has an α-helix, which together with the pre-helix loop and the inner concave surface of the fingers of the other monomer, form the “wrist” region. In the crystal structure of the ActRII-ECD bound to BMP7 (17Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), as well as that of activin bound to ActRIIB (16Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the activin type II receptor ECDs make contact with the convex outer face or “knuckle” of the finger region of each ligand. The activin-A:ActRIIB interface involves hydrophobic (Ile30, Ala31, Pro32, Pro88, Leu92, Tyr94, and Ile100), and ionic/polar (Arg87, Ser90, Lys102, Glu111) residues on activin-A and overlaps the interface determined in the BMP7: ActRII structure (16Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Less is known about the activin-A:ALK4 interface. Based on the crystal structure of BMP2 in complex with ALK3 (18Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), it has been predicted that all type I receptors bind to the wrist epitope of their respective ligands, irrespective of whether they do so with high or low affinity. Consistent with this model, an allosteric conformational change was observed in the “wrist” region of BMP7 following binding to the ActRII-ECD, and this may allow for the cooperative type I/type II receptor assembly induced by TGF-β superfamily members (17Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To test whether residues in the wrist region of activin-A are important for binding to ALK4, we have subjected activin-A to both alanine and homology scanning mutagenesis. Using these approaches we have shown that substantial mutations in the α-helix region are required to have any significant effects on activin-A activity. This is in contrast to the importance of the corresponding region of BMP2 for binding to ALK3 and highlights important differences in the way activin and BMP2 interact with their type I receptors. Of greater importance for activin biological activity and binding to ALK4 were residues on the concave face of finger 2. Mutation of these residues generated activin mutants with disrupted ALK4 binding, dramatically reduced signaling and antagonist/partial agonist activity. Materials—NuPAGE gels and molecular mass markers were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Recombinant human activin-A was generated using a stable activin-expressing cell line provided by Dr. J. Mather (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). 125I-Activin A was prepared using the chloramine T method as previously described (19Husken-Hindi P. Tsuchida K. Park M. Corrigan A.Z. Vaughan J.M. Vale W.W. Fischer W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19380-19384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG, TMB substrate, chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal™), and the BCA protein assay kit were obtained from Pierce. The activin-A constructs used in this study were in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of Activin-A—To incorporate mutations in the mature region of the full-length rat inhibin βA cDNA, we utilized an overlapping PCR strategy. First, we introduced a unique NheI site just 5′ of the mature region in the inhibin βA construct, allowing us to make and subclone mutant PCR products (∼600 bp) spanning only the mature region. Primers were constructed to incorporate a 5′ NheI site and a 3′ XhoI site for subcloning back into the full-length construct. Gel-purified PCR products were digested with NheI and XhoI and then subcloned into NheI/XhoI-digested inhibin βA vector. For each construct, the mutated N-terminal mature region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Measurement of Recombinant Activin-A Expressed In and Secreted from HEK293T Cells—293T cells were grown in 5% CO2 to 40–60% confluence on poly-d-lysine coated plates in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% bovine calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine). Cells were transfected with wild-type activin-A or activin-A mutants using Perfectin (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturers instructions. Approximately 48 h following transfection, conditioned medium was collected and tested for the presence of activin-A both by functional assay and by Western blot analysis (20Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Koerber S.C. Fischer W. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test for functional activin-A, conditioned medium was serially diluted and each fraction was tested for activity using an activin-responsive luciferase assay. 293T cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-treated 24-well plates at 150,000 cells per well and transfected in triplicate 24 h later with 0.5 μg DNA per well (400 ng of pcDNA3.0: 50 ng of FAST2: 25 ng of A3-lux: 25 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase). 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with the serially diluted activin samples and then incubated overnight (∼16 h). Media were aspirated, and cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized relative to β-galactosidase activities. Competition Binding Studies of Activin-A Analogs—293T cells were plated at 105 cells/well in 24-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine. 16 h after plating the cells were transfected with 50 ng of ActRII cDNA using the Perfectin reagent described above. 48 h following transfection binding was carried out in the wells at room temperature on intact cells. Cells were washed in Hepes Dissociation Buffer (HDB) (12.5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl and 5 mm KCl) and then 200 μl was added to each well: 100 μl of binding buffer (HDB with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2), 50 μl of unlabeled competitor (activin-A or activin-A mutant as indicated) at various dilutions in binding buffer and 50 μl of 125I-activin-A (500,000 cpm/well). Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then wells were rinsed in HDB, and cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and 125I-activin-A from each well was counted using a γ counter. Binding data were analyzed using the Prism program (version 2.0 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Large Scale Production and Purification of Activins—High level and high-throughput production of mutant activins were achieved using high molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI, Aldrich) to transiently transfect HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were plated at 107 cells/15-cm plate coated with poly-d-lysine. 16 h following plating cells were transfected using the PEI transfection reagent. Briefly, for 15-cm plates, 24 μg of activin mutant DNA was diluted to 1.2 ml with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. PEI (10 mg/ml stock) was diluted to 1 mg/ml in H2O and 36 μl was added to the DNA solution, vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. During the incubation cells were rinsed with HDB, and 12 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added to each plate. After 10 min the DNA/PEI complexes were added directly to the plates and incubated for 3–4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 3–4 h fetal bovine serum was added to the plates for a final concentration of 10%. Activin mutants were purified from the conditioned media of the HEK293T cells 72 h after transfection. Purification was performed using a combination of heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, reversed phase HPLC (C4), and size exclusion chromatography as previously described for wild-type activin-A (19Husken-Hindi P.

Typical yields of mutant proteins ranged from 1–4 μg/15-cm plate. Covalent Cross-linking—For cross-linking, 293T cells were plated on 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of 400,000 cells per well. Approximately 24 h later, cells were transfected with 2 μgofDNA per well with the indicated constructs (the ratio of ActRII:ALK4 was 2:1 and total DNA was kept constant using pcDNA3.0). After 48 h cells were incubated with 125I-activin-A or 125I-M108A (106 cpm/well) for 4 h at room temperature in binding buffer (20Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Koerber S.C. Fischer W. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with gentle rocking. Cells were washed in HDB, resuspended at 0.5 mm disuccinylsuberate (DSS) in HDB and incubated 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (TBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate and 2 mm EDTA) and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc or anti-ALK4 antibodies as indicated. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Antagonism Assay in HEK293T Cells—The activin/TGFβ-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid A3-Lux (21Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and the FAST2 transcription factor (21Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) were used as described (22Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.C.E. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 293T cells were plated on poly-lysine-coated 24-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells per well. Approximately 24 h later, each well was transfected with 500 ng of DNA: empty vector (pcDNA3; 400 ng), FAST-2 (50 ng), A3-lux (25 ng) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-β-galactosidase (β-GAL) (25 ng). Transfections were performed under optimized conditions using Perfectin transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems). 16 h post-transfection, cells were pretreated with activin-A mutants for 2 h prior to treatment with activin-A, myostatin or TGF-β for ∼16 h. Cells were harvested in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized relative to β-GAL activities. FSH Assay in the LβT2 Gonadotrope Cell Line—LβT2 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Before initiating experiments, the cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed three times with the same medium and treated for 72 h as indicated. FSH was quantified by radioimmunoassay with reagents from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program of NIDDK, as previously described (23Bilezikjian L.M. Corrigan A.Z. Vaughan J.M. Vale W.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2554-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Synthesis and Secretion of Wild-type and Mutant Activin-A by 293T Cells—Synthesis of activin-A was first analyzed in 293T cells using a transient transfection approach. Fig. 1A shows that conditioned medium from 293T cells transfected with the inhibin βA cDNA contains mature, dimeric activin-A protein as detected by Western blot analysis. The concentration of activin-A in the conditioned media of transiently transfected 293T cells after 48 h was generally 5–10 nm based on densitometric analysis of autoradiographs. All the activin mutants described in this study were expressed at levels comparable to wild-type activin-A (data not shown). In order to rapidly screen numerous activin-A mutants for biological activity we utilized a luciferase-based assay system in HEK293T cells (22Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.C.E. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 293T cells had previously been shown to express all of the components of the activin signal transduction system except for the transcription factor FAST2 (22Yan Y.T. Liu J.J. Luo Y.C.E. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Without FAST2, 293T cells do not respond to activin. By co-transfecting 293T cells with the A3-luciferase reporter construct (A3-lux), and FAST2, we generated a system that was exquisitely sensitive to activin stimulation. When conditioned medium from 293T cells transfected with the inhibin βA cDNA was used to treat cells transfected with A3-lux and FAST2 there was a dose-dependent induction of luciferase expression (Fig. 1B). Maximal stimulation was obtained with conditioned medium diluted 1:2 and was comparable to that seen with a maximal dose of activin-A (2 nm, Fig. 1B). These results indicate that 293T cells transfected with the inhibin βA cDNA secrete functional activin-A. We have also demonstrated that this assay can be carried out on cells in which inhibin βA, FAST2, A3-lux, and CMV-β-galactosidase are transfected into the same cells (data not shown). In this case, induction of luciferase is the result of activin-A being secreted and then acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner on the cells that secreted it. These assay systems provided us with a rapid indication of the functional status of individual activin-A mutants. Selection of Amino Acid Residues on Activin-A for Mutagenesis—We showed that 293T cells secrete functional, dimeric activin-A when transfected with the inhibin βA cDNA (Fig. 1), and we proceeded to introduce mutations within the mature region of the inhibin βA construct with the goal of identifying activin-A mutants able to bind ActRII but unable to bind ALK4 and, therefore, candidate type II activin receptor antagonists. Kirsch et al. (18Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) identified a large epitope for high affinity ALK3 binding spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer (Fig. 2), and we have mutated most of the residues on activin-A individually or in combination which correspond to these BMP-2 residues. In addition, we have mutated activin-A residues in the broader region implicated by the BMP-2/ALK3 complex structure focusing, in particular, on the wrist epitope of activin-A, which comprises residues in the pre-helix loop and the α-helix of one monomer as well as residues in the finger region of the second monomer (Fig. 2). Initially, residues were substituted by alanine and then subsequently charged residues were introduced as these were predicted to be more disruptive. In order to disrupt the organization of the α-helix, residues in this region were also substituted for proline. Finally, we generated activin-A/activin-C chimeras in which the pre-helix loop or α-helix of activin A was replaced with the corresponding regions of the biologically inactive activin-C. Functional Properties of Activin-A Mutants—We tested the relative abilities of wild-type and mutant activin-A constructs to induce A3-lux in 293T cells. For the initial screen, each mutant was quantitated by densitometric analysis following Western blot and then diluted to 2 nm (data not shown). As shown in Table I, most mutants with changes within the prehelix loop and α-helix had little effect on activin-A activity. Only substantial mutations, such as exchanging the entire α-helix of activin-A for that of the biologically inactive activin-C analog (A/C-2 mutant), or inserting proline residues at certain points within the α-helix (S60P, I63P), had significant effects on activin-A activity. This is in contrast to the importance of the corresponding residues of BMP2 for binding to ALK3 and highlights important differences in the way activin and BMP2 interact with their type I receptors. Of greater importance for activin activity were residues in finger 2 of the activin-A ligand. In particular, mutation of residues Ser90, Met91, Leu92, Lys102, Ile105, and Met108 had significant effects on activin-A activity (Table I). Residues Ser90, Leu92, and Lys102 have previously been shown to be involved in activin-A binding to ActRII and were included as controls in this assay (17Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E.

Open table in a new tab Competition Binding Studies of Activin-A Analogs—The low biological activity of some of the activin-A mutants could have been because of either disrupted ActRII or ALK4 binding. To determine whether the identified mutants retained the ability to bind ActRII we performed competition binding assays in which the mutants were assessed for their ability to displace 125I-activin-A from 293T cells transfected with ActRII. The EC50 of activin-A for ActRII in these studies was determined to be ∼150 pm. As is shown in Fig. 3A, the three activin-A α-helix mutants with disrupted activity (A/C-2, S60P, I63P) each retained the ability to bind ActRII, as illustrated by their wild-type-like ability to compete for 125I-activin-A binding to 293T cells. In contrast, of the five activin “finger” mutants tested only M108A retained affinity for ActRII comparable to that of wild-type activin-A (Fig. 3B). Mutants I105E and M108E had a 2-fold lower affinity for ActRII than did wild-type activin (∼400 pm; Fig. 3B), whereas the ability of mutant M91E to displace 125I-activin-A from 293T cells transfected with ActRII was severely compromised. These results, coupled with the functional studies, indicate that substantial changes, such as the introduction of charged residues, in the finger region of activin-A disrupt binding to both ActRII and ALK4. The K102E mutant that had previously been shown to have disrupted binding to ActRII was included as a control in these experiments (Fig. 3B) (24Wuytens G. Verschueren K. de Winter J.P. Gajendran N.

https://openalex.org/W2111670326,"The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family is thought to act largely as a negative regulator of signaling by cytokines and some growth factors. Surprisingly, the SOCS-6 transgenics had no significant defects in the cytokine signaling and hematopoietic system but displayed significant improvements in glucose metabolism. Insulin stimulation of Akt/protein kinase B was also potentiated. Biochemical analysis showed that, after insulin stimulation, SOCS-6 interacted with the monomeric p85 subunit of class-Ia phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase but not with p85/p110 dimers. Furthermore, SOCS-6 expression is transiently increased by serum and insulin in normal fibroblasts. However, both the mRNA and protein of SOCS-6 were rapidly degraded after induction by insulin. The degradation of the SOCS-6 protein was partially inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting a proteasome-mediated degradation mechanism. In contrast, SOCS-6-associated p85 was not degraded and could be recruited to the newly synthesized SOCS-6 molecules in the presence of insulin, suggesting that SOCS-6 expression and its interaction with p85, but not the degradation, is regulated by insulin. The phenotype of SOCS-6 transgenic mice bears a striking resemblance to p85 knock-out mouse models in which glucose metabolism stimulated by insulin is significantly improved despite reduced activation of PI 3-kinase. This suggests that monomeric p85 might play a physiologically important role in attenuating signaling through PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways in unstimulated cells. Therefore, our results indicate that SOCS-6 may provide a dynamically regulated mechanism by which insulin can transiently overcome the negative effects that p85 monomers have on signaling via PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways.

Therefore, our results indicate that SOCS-6 may provide a dynamically regulated mechanism by which insulin can transiently overcome the negative effects that p85 monomers have on signaling via PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways.

Members of the SOCS family share a common structure containing a central SH2 domain and a C-terminal SOCS box, and variability in their sequences at the N terminus probably confers specificity of function (1Kile B.T.

The SH2 domain allows the SOCS proteins to interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated target proteins such as Janus kinases (JAKs), and the SOCS box is suggested to act as a common binding domain for a large family of E3 ubiquitin protein ligases (2Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Asimakis M. Greenhalgh C.J. Willson T.A. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Carter W. Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this manner, molecules containing the SOCS domain may regulate protein degradation by targeting proteins for ubiquitination and, subsequently, for proteasome-mediated degradation (5Kamizono S.

CIS, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3 are the most widely studied members of SOCS family, and it is known that the expression of these genes is rapidly induced by an array of stimuli such as cytokines (6Hortner M.

The increased levels of CIS, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3 result in feedback inhibition of a wide variety of agonist-induced signaling pathways (14Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this finding is not just restricted to cytokine signaling. For example, in the case of insulin signaling there is evidence that the overexpression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 attenuates insulin signaling by binding to the insulin receptor (IR) directly and targeting the insulin receptor substrate molecules (IRS-1 and IRS-2) for proteasome-mediated degradation (12Rui L.

Thus, SOCS molecules appear to act as part of a classical negative feedback loop, inhibiting the signaling pathways that initially led to the expression of SOCS genes. However, an important feature of this system is that it allows for regulatory cross-talk between signaling pathways. For example, the increase in SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression by cytokines has been suggested as the mechanism by which they bring about the attenuation in insulin signaling that causes insulin resistance associated with the development of type 2 diabetes (15Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C. Freidinger K. Hilton D.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47944-47949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Despite structural similarities in SOCS proteins, evidence is now emerging to show that different members of the SOCS family have distinct roles. For example, the regulation and function of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in cytokine signaling appears to be very similar to both binding to JAKs and the inhibition of kinase activity. However, mice lacking SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 showed completely different phenotypes (17Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E. Stravopodis D. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N.

Cell. 1999; 98: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), suggesting that the roles of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in signaling outside the cytokine pathways might differ. Furthermore, we observed previously that CIS negatively regulates IL-2 signaling but promotes T-cell receptor stimulation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in T-cells (21Li S. Chen S. Xu X. Sundstedt A. Paulsson K.M. Anderson P. Karlsson S. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is suggestive of a dual function of CIS in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling and the positive regulation of T-cell receptor signaling, which may be essential for the maintenance of homeostasis of the immune system. Unlike CIS and SOCS-1–3, SOCS-4–7 have not been extensively studied (22Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). SOCS-6 and SOCS-7 have longer N-terminal domains than do CIS, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3. Like other SOCS proteins, SOCS-6 binds to elongin B/C via the SOCS box domain (23Krebs D.L. Uren R.T. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Zhang J.G. Starr R. De Souza D.P. Hanzinikolas K. Eyles J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Nicholson S.E. Baca M. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4567-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other SOCS molecules studied, SOCS-6 does not interact with JAK and does not have any inhibitory effect on the signaling induced by the growth hormone, the leukemia inhibitory factor, or prolactin (24Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, a recent report indicates that SOCS-6 has direct effects on IR signaling in regard to reported interactions with the IR-(16) and SH2 domain-mediated interactions with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase as well as IRS-2 and IRS-4 (23Krebs D.L. Uren R.T. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Zhang J.G. Starr R. De Souza D.P. Hanzinikolas K. Eyles J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Nicholson S.E. Baca M. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4567-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This finding would suggest that SOCS-6 might be involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. However, mice with targeted disruption of the SOCS-6 gene do not display significant defects in glucose metabolism although they do display growth defects, weighing 8–10% less than wild type mice (23Krebs D.L. Uren R.T. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Zhang J.G. Starr R. De Souza D.P. Hanzinikolas K. Eyles J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Nicholson S.E. Baca M. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4567-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present study, we established transgenic mice overexpressing SOCS-6 to examine its function in vivo. SOCS-6 transgenics developed normally but displayed improved glucose and insulin tolerance. An insulin-induced interaction of SOCS-6 with the monomer form of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was found and was associated with increased Akt/PKB activation induced by insulin. In addition, we found that SOCS-6 was induced by insulin but rapidly degraded by proteasome. Together, these findings indicate that SOCS-6 could play an important role in regulating insulin action in vivo. Antibodies—Mouse anti-human c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) antibody, goat polyclonal anti-Akt/PKB antibody, and goat polyclonal anti-ERK antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt/PKB antibody, and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-IR antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p85 (αp85pan) antibody and anti-phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-phospho-IκB kinase was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The anti-SOCS-6 antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein encoding the SOCS-6 SH2 domain and the SOCS box (Fusion Antibodies, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK). Generation of SOCS-6 Transgenic Mice—A murine full-length SOCS-6 cDNA was isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library (Stratagene). SOCS-6 cDNA tagged with the human c-Myc tag at its C terminus was cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of vector pEFneo under an elongation factor I promoter. Mice constitutively overexpressing the SOCS-6 transgene were established through an embryonic stem cell approach. Briefly, the vector-free pEF-SOCS-6-pSV40-neo fragment was transfected into E14 cells by electroporation. The Geneticin-resistant E14 clones were screened for SOCS-6 transgene expression by Western blotting with anti-c-Myc, and two of the positive clones were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6. Both of the two clones successfully transmitted to the germ line, and the SOCS-6 transgenics was backcrossed five times to C57/BL6 background before phenotyping was performed. Metabolic Studies—To determine fasting blood glucose concentrations, two-month-old mice were starved overnight, and total blood was obtained by tail bleeding. All blood glucose concentrations were determined with a MediSense Optium glucometer and MediSense Optium electrodes (Abbott Laboratories). Glucose tolerance tests were performed after overnight fasting by intraperitoneal injection of 2g/kg d-glucose at time 0. Blood samples were taken at the indicated time points, and glucose levels were determined as described (Fig. 3b). For the insulin tolerance test, blood samples were obtained at indicated time points after intraperitoneal injection of 0.75 IU/kg human insulin (Sigma) (Fig. 3c). Plasma insulin levels in the serum from fasting animals were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using mouse insulin as a standard (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL). Hyperglycemic Clamps—Under anesthesia, a PE-10 tubing catheter was inserted into the left jugular vein and externalized through an incision in the skin flap behind the head. The mice were allowed to recover for 2 days. Before starting the experiments, mice fasted for 5 h. Then, through the implanted catheter, a 30% glucose solution was infused into the mice at the rates adjusted to maintain the blood glucose concentration at 10 mm, as determined from tail vein blood. Blood was collected after 2 h of performing the glucose clamp technique, and plasma insulin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In Vivo Insulin Stimulation and Analysis of Insulin-signaling Proteins—Two-month-old mice were starved overnight, anesthetized with Hypnorm and Hypnovel, and 5 IU of human insulin (Sigma) was injected into the portal vein. Liver and muscles were removed at 3 and 5 min respectively, and instantly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of insulin-signaling molecules were performed on tissue homogenates extracted with homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Northern Blotting—For the study of the regulation of SOCS-6 expression by insulin stimulation, mouse embryo fibroblasts were isolated from embryonic day 13.5 embryos of C57BL/6 mice and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After overnight or 4-h starvation of cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum, the cells were stimulated with 1 μm human insulin at the indicated time points (Fig. 5), and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). To confirm SOCS-6 transgene expression in SOCS-6 transgenic mice, liver and muscles were isolated from 6–8 week-old wild type or SOCS-6 transgenics, and total RNA was extracted as described above. 30 μg of total RNA from each sample was fractionated on formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The SOCS-6 cDNA probe was a 1-kb fragment that spanned nucleotides 420 to 1434 in the SOCS-6 coding sequence. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was a 560-bp PCR fragment spanning nucleotides 40–600 in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase coding sequence and served as the loading control. PI 3-Kinase Assay—Cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using either a polyclonal anti-sera that recognized all forms of p85 (p85pan) or a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99), washed three times with the tissue homogenization buffer and twice with PI 3-kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and then suspended in 35 μlof PI 3-kinase reaction buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Sigma). The reactions were initiated by adding 15 μl of a MgCl2-ATP mixture (5 mm MgCl2 and100 μm ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to the immunoprecipitates and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by acidification. After the phosphorylated lipids were extracted and evaporated, the pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (4:1), The phosphorylated lipids were separated by TLC and visualized by a phosphorimaging device. Proteasome Degradation Assay—For a pulse-chase assay with CHO cells, the cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine master mix (Amersham Biosciences) after 4 h of starvation. The labeled cells were then incubated with insulin-containing medium, proteasome inhibitor LLnL (Sigma), or Me2SO. Cells were harvested and lysed at different time points (Fig. 6). The precipitates with different antibodies, as indicated (Fig. 6), were resolved by SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized. Proteasome Degradation Assay with Cardiomyocyte—Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were generated from SOCS-6 transgenics and cultured as described previously (25De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were collected from 1–2-day-old SOCS-6 transgenics, the atrial tissue was removed, and the ventricles were cut into small pieces and digested with 0.05% pancreatin (Sigma) and 100 units/ml collagenase (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and cultured in M199 media (Invitrogen) with 15% fetal bovine serum. The non-myocytes were removed by incubation for 1 h in an uncoated dish. The enriched cardiomyocyte fractions were then plated on gelatin-coated plates and cultured for 16 h in serum-free M199 media. Cells were then treated with cycloheximide (1 μm) for 6 h to inhibit de novo syntheses of proteins in the cardiomyocytes. The treated cells were then incubated with insulin-containing medium, the proteasome inhibitor LLnL, or Me2SO. Cells were harvested and lysed at different time points (Fig. 6). The anti-p85 precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-bodies against c-Myc for the detection of Myc-tagged SOCS-6, p85, and IRS-1, respectively. Generation of SOCS-6 Transgenic Mice—Two founder lines of transgenic mice were produced, each overexpressing the Myc-tagged SOCS-6 transgene at different levels (Fig. 1). Both lines were used for characterization of the phenotype. The expression levels of SOCS-6 in line 1 and line 2 were 5- and 10-fold higher, respectively, than those for wild type litter mates in liver, muscle, and T lymphocytes at either the mRNA (Fig. 1b) or protein level (Fig. 1a). All transgenic mice appeared to be healthy and grossly normal at baseline. They exhibited a normal reproductive rate, and the mortality rate over 12 months was the same as that for the wild type controls. Insulin Induces the Interaction of SOCS-6 and p85 Subunit of PI 3-Kinase—SOCS proteins were initially discovered to be the negative regulators of cytokine signaling, with SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS being associated with the down-regulation of JAK-STAT pathways (14Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, SOCS-6 and SOCS-7 have longer N-terminal domains than SOCS-1, -2, -3, and CIS (22Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), and, despite the structural homology in SH2 and SOCS domains to other SOCS proteins, SOCS-6 does not interact with JAK2 or inhibit signaling by growth hormone, leukemia inhibitory factor, or prolactin (24Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that SOCS-6 may not be acting on cytokine-signaling pathways and, consistent with this possibility, we could not detect any suppressive function of SOCS-6 in lymphocytes stimulated by interleukin-2, interferon-γ, interleukin-4, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-12. 2L. Li, L. M. Grønning, P. O. Anderson, S. Li, K. Eduardsen, J. Johnston, D. Kioussis, P. R. Shepherd, and P. Wang, manuscript in preparation. The phosphorylation of STAT-1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 induced by cytokines was similar between the SOCS-6 transgenics and the wild type counterparts. 2L. Li, L. M. Grønning, P. O. Anderson, S. Li, K. Eduardsen, J. Johnston, D. Kioussis, P. R. Shepherd, and P. Wang, manuscript in preparation. While the mice were being generated it was reported that SOCS-6 could interact with IRS proteins and the p85 regulatory subunit of the class-Ia PI 3-kinase (23Krebs D.L. Uren R.T. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Zhang J.G. Starr R. De Souza D.P. Hanzinikolas K. Eyles J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Nicholson S.E. Baca M. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4567-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that these interactions could be occurring in our mice, we examined whether these proteins associated with the overexpressed SOCS-6. Transgenic mice were challenged with insulin, and anti-Myc antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the SOCS-6 transgene product from liver extracts. The precipitates were Western blotted with antibodies specifically recognizing IRS-2, IRS-4, the IR, and p85, respectively. We could not detect neither the IR nor IRS-2 and IRS-4 in the co-precipitates (data not shown). However, the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase was readily detected in the SOCS-6 co-precipitates (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the interaction of SOCS-6-Myc and p85 was only detected after stimulation with insulin (Fig. 2a). To confirm this interaction in another system, we transfected the SOCS-6-expressing construct into CHO-IR cells. Again, the interaction between p85α and SOCS-6 was readily detected, but only after insulin stimulation (Fig. 2b). However, no interaction between SOCS-6 and the IRS proteins was found (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation using an antibody that recognizes all isoforms of p85 showed that the wild type and transfected cells contained similar levels of p85 and the p110β catalytic subunit (Fig. 2b). In contrast, SOCS-6 immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated CHO-IR cells overexpressing SOCS-6 contained p85α but did not contain any p110β (Fig. 2b) which indicates the following: (i) that the p85α associated with SOCS-6 is a free monomer not bound to the catalytic subunit; and (ii) that the p85α associated with SOCS-6 is not recruited to the IRS proteins. The finding that insulin specifically recruits SOCS-6 to p85 monomers is very interesting, as there have been a number of recent studies indicating that p85 can have both positive and negative effects on insulin signaling and that the negative effects overcome the positive effects when high levels of a p85 monomer are present in cells (26Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Yballe C.M. Fassaur M. Klein J. Asano T. Cantley L.C. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48453-48566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Ueki K.

Therefore, SOCS-6 could act as a physiologically relevant modulator of the effects of the p85 monomer, either mediating or attenuating the negative effects on insulin signaling. Improved Glucose Metabolism in SOCS-6 Transgenics—To test the effect of SOCS-6 on insulin action, we investigated glucose metabolism by insulin in SOCS-6 transgenic mice. We found lower fasting glucose levels in both lines of transgenic mice (84 ± 15 mg/dl for transgenic line 1 and 80 ± 18 mg/dl for transgenic line 2 versus 105 ± 33 mg/dl) as compared with the levels for wild type. (Fig. 3a). Both lines of mice also exhibited significant reductions in plasma glucose levels at all points in a glucose tolerance test as compared with the levels for wild type mice, and both lines also showed a significantly better clearance of glucose in an insulin tolerance test (Fig. 3, b and c). Furthermore, significantly higher levels of glucose transport stimulated by insulin were observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from the SOCS-6 transgenics as compared with MEFs from control animals (Fig. 3d). The increased rate of glucose disposal could be due to increased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, decreased hepatic glucose output, or increases in insulin secretion. The data from the insulin tolerance tests supports a role for increased insulin sensitivity, and this possibility is further supported by the finding that insulin levels were significantly lower in transgenic animals, both in the fasting state and 30 min after a glucose challenge (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, insulin levels remained lower in transgenic animals even when glucose levels had been clamped at 10 mm glucose for 120 min (Fig 3f). SOCS-6 Increases the Activity of Akt in Response to Insulin Stimulation—To examine the effect of SOCS-6 overexpression on insulin-mediated signaling, we investigated the activation of the IR, Akt/PKB, and the p42/p44 ERK. Overexpression of SOCS-6 in either the transgenic mice or CHO-IR cells did not affect the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the IR, the IRS, or the ERK (Fig. 4, a and b). In addition, the phosphorylation of IκB kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase in insulin-stimulated liver was also similar to that in wild type and SOCS-6 transgenic mice (data not shown). The recruitment of p85/p110 to insulin-signaling complexes was also una"

The hepatic mRNA expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) in CBA/JN was remarkably enhanced by high fructose diet but not in DBA/2N. Similar results were observed in primary hepatocytes after exposure to fructose. The nucleotide sequence at –468 bp from the putative starting point of the SREBP-1c gene was adenine in the DBA group while it was guanine in the CBA group. In hepatocytes from CBA/JN, the activity of CBA-SREBP-1c promoter was significantly increased by 2.4- and 2.2-fold, in response to 30 mm fructose or 10 nm insulin, respectively, whereas the activity of DBA-SREBP-1c promoter responded to insulin but not to fructose. In hepatocytes from DBA/2N, both types of SREBP-1c promoter activities in response to insulin were attenuated. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed an unidentified nuclear protein bound to the oligonucleotides made from the region between –453 to –480 bp of the SREBP-1c promoter of CBA/JN but not to the probe from DBA/2N. Thus, in DBA/2N, the reduced mRNA expression of SREBP-1 after fructose refeeding appeared to associate with two independent mechanisms, 1) loss of binding of unidentified proteins to the region between –453 to –480 bp of the SREBP-1c promoter and 2) impaired insulin stimulation of SREBP-1c promoter activity. To evaluate the genetic susceptibility to metabolic disorders induced by high fructose diet, we investigated the metabolic characteristics in 10 strains of inbred mice and found that they were separated into CBA and DBA groups according to the response to high fructose diet. The hepatic mRNA expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) in CBA/JN was remarkably enhanced by high fructose diet but not in DBA/2N. Similar results were observed in primary hepatocytes after exposure to fructose. The nucleotide sequence at –468 bp from the putative starting point of the SREBP-1c gene was adenine in the DBA group while it was guanine in the CBA group. In hepatocytes from CBA/JN, the activity of CBA-SREBP-1c promoter was significantly increased by 2.4- and 2.2-fold, in response to 30 mm fructose or 10 nm insulin, respectively, whereas the activity of DBA-SREBP-1c promoter responded to insulin but not to fructose. In hepatocytes from DBA/2N, both types of SREBP-1c promoter activities in response to insulin were attenuated. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed an unidentified nuclear protein bound to the oligonucleotides made from the region between –453 to –480 bp of the SREBP-1c promoter of CBA/JN but not to the probe from DBA/2N. Thus, in DBA/2N, the reduced mRNA expression of SREBP-1 after fructose refeeding appeared to associate with two independent mechanisms, 1) loss of binding of unidentified proteins to the region between –453 to –480 bp of the SREBP-1c promoter and 2) impaired insulin stimulation of SREBP-1c promoter activity. Single nucleotide polymorphism (-468 Gly to Ala) at the promoter region of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c associates with genetic defect of fructose-induced hepatic lipogenesis.

The correct title should be: Full-Text PDF Open Access The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been rising over the last few decades (1Zimmet P. Alberti K.G.M.M. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar). An important correlate of this alarming phenomenon is the recent increase in prevalence among the population of metabolic syndrome, which consists of several metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia, visceral obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperinsulinemia (2Reaven G.M. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kaplan N.M. Arch. Intern. Med. 1989; 149: 1514-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic syndrome may be induced by such environmental factors as increased consumption of processed calorie-dense foods and/or lack of exercise in certain people who have as yet an unidentified genetic predisposition. A high fructose diet in rats induces metabolic derangements similar to those that accompany with metabolic syndrome (4Shinozaki K. Kashiwagi A. Nishio Y. Okamura T. Yoshida Y. Masada M. Toda N. Kikkawa R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2437-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 5Shinozaki K. Nishio Y. Okamura T. Yoshida Y. Maegawa H. Kojima H. Masada M. Toda N. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and rats fed high fructose diet have been used as animal models for metabolic syndrome (6Sleder J. Chen Y.D. Cully M.D. Reaven G.M. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 303-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

We previously reported that the high fructose diet up-regulated hepatic expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding protein; AP4, activator protein 4; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility sift assay; FAS, fatty acid synthase; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; OCT-1, octamer transcription factor 1; NS, not significant.1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding protein; AP4, activator protein 4; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility sift assay; FAS, fatty acid synthase; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; OCT-1, octamer transcription factor 1; NS, not significant. a key transcription factor for hepatic expression of lipogenic enzymes, but down-regulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor for expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (7Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E1180-E1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These alterations in the expression of the transcription factors may play a central role in the pathogenesis of metabolic derangements in rats fed a high fructose diet. The molecular mechanisms, however, by which fructose induces the SREBP-1 gene expression and suppresses the PPARα gene expression are not yet fully understood. Likewise, the genetic predisposition to metabolic disorders in response to a high fructose diet has not yet been determined. Therefore, we hypothesized that inducibility of SREBP-1 and PPARα expressions in response to a high fructose diet could be genetically determined. To investigate the genetic heterogeneity in the regulation of hepatic SREBP-1 and PPARα gene expressions after consumption of high fructose diet, we selected two inbred mouse strains, one of which is highly responsive to a high fructose diet. We found that there were marked differences in CBA/JN mice and DBA/2N mice between the hepatic mRNA expressions of SREBP-1 in response to a high fructose diet. We also observed a single nucleotide mutation in DBA/2N mice from guanine to adenine at –468 bp from the putative starting point of the SREBP-1c gene, which caused impaired activation of SREBP-1c gene transcription in response to fructose. These results indicate that the loss of nuclear protein binding to the specific site at the promoter region of SREBP-1c may cause impaired hepatic lipogenesis in mice. Materials—All materials were of reagent grade and were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) or Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Animals—Five-week-old male mice of CBA/JN, DBA/2N, C57BL/6N, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and DBA/1JN strains were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Mice of C57BL/6 strain were purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan). Mice of C3H/He, C3H/HeN, and BALB/c strains were purchased from SLC Japan, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided free access to a laboratory diet and water. The animals were divided into two groups (a control diet group and a high fructose diet group) and pair-fed for 8 weeks. The control diet (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) consisted of 58% carbohydrate (no fructose), 12% fat, and 30% protein (energy percent of diet). The high fructose diet (oriental yeast) contained 67% carbohydrate (98% of which was fructose), 13% fat, and 20% protein. The day before the experiment we withdrew the food from all animals at 20:00. The next day half of the animals were fed either the control diet or the high fructose diet in the dark from 6:00 to 8:00 before the experiment, and the other half were kept in the fasting state. At 10:00, after 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal pentobarbital injection and under deep anesthetization, the liver and the epididymal fat were excised, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Blood samples were also taken for several blood tests such as triglyceride, total cholesterol, blood sugar, and insulin. RNA and DNA were extracted from the frozen samples. Shiga University of Medical Science Animal Care Committees approved all experiments. Mouse Primary Hepatocytes—Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase method with minor modifications (9Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Under deep anesthetization the liver of each mouse was perfused in situ via the portal vein with 150 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer followed by 100 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer containing collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were dispersed in an equal volume of ice-cold William's E medium (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were precipitated and washed twice at 4 °C with the same medium. Aliquots of 1 × 106 cells in William's E medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 nm insulin, 100 nm triiodothyronine, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin were plated onto 6-well rat collagen I-coated dishes (Asahi Techno Glass, Chiba, Japan). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C in 9% CO2, the cells were incubated with William's E medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 nm insulin, 1 nm triiodothyronine, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Northern Blot Analysis—Total hepatic RNA was isolated from the livers with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) after perfusion of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (–) in situ via the portal vein. In cases of primary hepatocytes they were starved in William's E medium supplemented with 0.75% bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin followed by 6 h with insulin (100 nm), mannitol (30 mm), or fructose (30 mm). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent. Then 10–30 μg of RNA samples were run on a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Nytran N; Schleicher & Schuell). The cDNA probes for Northern blot analyses were generated as previously described (7Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E1180-E1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using a labeling kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan), hybridized to ultraviolet cross-linked blots overnight at 68 °C in the hybridization buffer (Perfecthyb; Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan), and then washed at 68 °C over 40 min with 1× saline-sodium citrate and 0.1% SDS. The blots were exposed to Kodak Biomax (Eastman Kodak Co.) film at –80 °C. The signal was quantified with a densitometer, and loading differences were normalized to the signal generated with a probe for 18 S ribosomal RNA (8Tenenhouse H.S. Martel J. Biber J. Murer H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1995; 268: 1062-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of SREBP-1c Promoter Region—DNA sequences were analyzed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Construction of Plasmids—The 1.2-kilobase pair sequence from the 5′-flanking regions of SREBP-1c genes of both CBA/JN and DBA/2N mice were amplified using each genomic DNA by PCR with the sense primer 5′-GGATCCAGAACTGGATCATC and the antisense primer 5′-CCTAGGGCGTGCAGACGCTA. The resultant amplicons were gel-purified, inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), digested with KpnI/BglII, and inserted into KpnI/BglII-linearized pGL3-basic to form a reporter plasmid, pGL3-CBA/JN or pGL3-DBA/2N. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Primary hepatocytes were prepared as described. All transfections were performed using Superfect (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were carried out with 1 μg of pRSV-β-gal expression plasmid and 2 μg of each reporter plasmid. After the transfection for 18 h, the medium was replaced with William's E medium supplemented with 0.75% bovine serum albumin for starving followed by 8 h with either insulin (10 nm), mannitol (30 mm), or fructose (30 mm). The results were quantified with a luminometer and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity measured in the extract of the cells. Preparation of Nuclear Protein Extracts—Nuclear protein of HeLa (HeLaScribe) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Nuclear protein extract from the livers of mice and primary hepatocytes were isolated according to the procedure of Gorski et al. (9Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The nuclear extract was suspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 330 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (50 μg of protein per lane) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 20% methanol. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked and probed with the specified antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection, according to the manufacturer's (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed using radiolabeling double-strand oligonucleotides corresponding to the following pairs from the promoter regions: DBA/2N mice, 5′-TATCTAAAGGCAACTATTGG and 5′-GGAAGGCCAATAGTTG; CBA/JN mice, 5′-TATCTAAAGGCAGCTATTGG and 5′-GGAAGGCCAATAGCTG; AP4, 5′-AAAGAACCAGCTGTGGAAT and 5′-ATTCCACAGCTGGTTCTTT (10Mermod N. Williams T.J. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 6164: 557-561Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For control studies EMSAs were performed using radiolabeling OCT-1 consensus oligonucleotides (Promega). The CBA/JN and DBA/2N probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using DNA polymerase (Takara). OCT-1 and AP4 probes were labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4PNK (Takara). For EMSAs, the reaction mixture contained 10 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 7% glycerol, and 50,000 cpm-labeled probes. Samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature (11Nishio Y. Kashiwagi A. Taki H. Shinozaki K. Maeno Y. Kojima H. Maegawa H. Haneda M. Hidaka H. Yasuda H. Horiike K. Kikkawa R. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1318-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) before the addition of antibodies directed against AP4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and incubated for a further 20 min at room temperature. Then the samples were loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and run at 150 V. The gels were dried and exposed to the film. We also carried out competition assay using non-labeled oligonucleotides. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Tukey-Welsh's step-down multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of any differences among four or more groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Characteristics of Experimental Animals—In 10 inbred mouse strains (BALB/c, C3H/He, C3H/HeJ, C3H/HeN, CBA/JN, C57BL/6, C57BL/6N, C57BL/6J, DBA/1JN, and DBA/2N) we investigated the responses of metabolic characteristics to the high fructose diet. The metabolic characteristics of the six representatives are shown in Table I. Compared with the control mice fed a normal laboratory chew, C3H/He showed significantly increased body weights after feeding of the high fructose diet for 8 weeks. The epididymal fat weights for all strains except the DBA/2N and DBA/1JN strains a showed significant increase after the high fructose diet for 8 weeks compared with those of the control animals. The levels of blood glucose did not significantly differ in the control and the high fructose diet groups for any strains.Table ICharacteristics of the experimental animalsMouse strainsDietConditionBody weightEpididymal fat weightBlood glucoseTotal cholesterolTriglycerideInsulinggmmol/litermg/dlmg/dlpmol/literC3H/HeControlFasting26 ± 1.10.4 ± 0.17 ± 1.2102 ± 351 ± 1740 ± 24Postprandial--11 ± 1.8ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.108 ± 7168 ± 11ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.154 ± 100ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.FructoseFasting30 ± 1.6ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.0.9 ± 0.3ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.8 ± 2.4174 ± 25ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.80 ± 2230 ± 19Postprandial--14 ± 0.8bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.201 ± 22cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.214 ± 39bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.,cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.415 ± 107bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.,cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.CBA/JNControlFasting28 ± 1.70.5 ± 0.15 ± 2.765 ± 491 ± 720 ± 12Postprandial--20 ± 4.9ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.77 ± 5262 ± 100ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.422 ± 186ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.FructoseFasting30 ± 1.31.1 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.8 ± 2.9112 ± 9ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.150 ± 34ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.70 ± 31ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.Postprandial--14 ± 0.3bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.113 ± 19cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.392 ± 12bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.,cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.751 ± 153bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.,cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.BALB/cControlFasting29 ± 10.4 ± 0.16 ± 1.786 ± 796 ± 4105 ± 16Postprandial--15 ± 2ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.92 ± 11107 ± 12235 ± 120ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.FructoseFasting30 ± 10.7 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.8 ± 1143 ± 19ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.104 ± 1674 ± 29Postprandial--21 ± 4.3bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.152 ± 11cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.162 ± 33bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.,cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.385 ± 41bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.,cp < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial.C57BL/6NControlFasting24 ± 0.90.2 ± 0.18 ± 1.265 ± 554 ± 1433 ± 26Postprandial--16 ± 2.5ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.54 ± 1368 ± 7151 ± 98ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.FructoseFasting24 ± 2.60.6 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.6 ± 1.7113 ± 10ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.31 ± 447 ± 31Postprandial--15 ± 1.5bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.110 ± 857 ± 11224 ± 173bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.DBA/2NControlFasting23 ± 1.70.3 ± 0.28 ± 1.989 ± 899 ± 855 ± 35Postprandial--15 ± 2.7ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.92 ± 10106 ± 13168 ± 131ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.FructoseFasting25 ± 2.20.5 ± 0.26 ± 1.7120 ± 19ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.108 ± 3145 ± 23Postprandial--14 ± 1.5bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.105 ± 11126 ± 28135 ± 97bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.DBA/1JNControlFasting24 ± 0.90.3 ± 0.17 ± 2.384 ± 1299 ± 3042 ± 21Postprandial--13 ± 2.0ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.60 ± 994 ± 4188 ± 51ap < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.FructoseFasting23 ± 1.80.3 ± 0.16 ± 1.288 ± 468 ± 2140 ± 7Postprandial--15 ± 1.2bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.75 ± 1492 ± 26159 ± 66bp < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.a p < 0.01 versus the control-fasting.b p < 0.01 versus the fructose-fasting.c p < 0.01 versus the control-postprandial. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, the levels of serum triglycerides in the postprandial state were significantly elevated after feeding the control diet in the C3H/He and CBA/JN strains and after feeding the high fructose diet in the C3H/He, CBA/JN, and BALB/c strains. In addition, these three strains showed higher postprandial plasma insulin levels after feeding the high fructose diet than those after feeding the control diet. In contrast, in C57BL/6N, DBA/1JN, and DBA/2N, the levels of serum triglycerides in the postprandial state were not significantly elevated after feeding control or high fructose diet. Although the postprandial plasma insulin levels in these strains after feeding of either control or high fructose diet were increased compared with the corresponding fasting level, the postprandial insulin levels did not differ between the control and the high fructose groups, respectively. The mRNA Expression of SREBP-1 in the Liver—To explore the molecular mechanisms of the differences in response to the high fructose diet, we compared the hepatic mRNA expressions of SREBP-1, a key transcription factor regulating fatty acid synthesis in various strains of mice. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP-1 in the CBA/JN mice was increased after feeding. In the control-postprandial group, it was stimulated by 3.9-fold (p < 0.001) as compared with that of the control-fasting group. The fructose-fasting group showed stimulation by 1.9-fold (p < 0.05) as compared with the control-fasting group. Furthermore, the fructose-postprandial group showed enhancement by 23-fold (p < 0.001) compared with the control-fasting group. Thus, the fructose diet stimulated the level of SREBP-1 mRNA expression by 11-fold (p < 0.001) compared with fructose-fasting levels and by 6-fold (p < 0.001) compared with the control-postprandial group. Similar changes in the hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP-1 were observed in the C3H/He strain (Fig. 1, C and D). The hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP-1 in the C3H/He control-postprandial group was stimulated by 3.8-fold (p < 0.05) compared with that in the control-fasting group. The level in the fructose postprandial group was enhanced by 5.8-fold (p < 0.001) compared with the control-fasting group. As a result, a fructose diet stimulated the level of SREBP-1 mRNA expression by 3.5-fold (p < 0.001) compared with the fructose-fasting level and by 1.5-fold (p < 0.001) compared with the control-postprandial group. In addition, compared with that in the control-fasting group, the hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP-1 in the BALB/c strain was also significantly increased by 4.2-fold (p < 0.05) or by 6.1-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, after feeding the control or the high fructose diet. On the other hand, the hepatic mRNA expressions of SREBP-1 in the DBA/2N mice (Fig. 1, E and F) and the DBA/1JN mice (Fig. 1, G and H) were not affected by either the control or the high fructose diet. The hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP-1 in the C57BL/6N mice was increased significantly but to a lesser degree, i.e. the control postprandial group showed a 2.1-fold (p < 0.05) increase, and the fructose-post-prandial group showed a 2.5-fold (p < 0.01) increase compared with the control fasting group, respectively. However, hepatic SREBP-1 mRNA expressions in either fasting or postprandial state were not different between the control and the high fructose diet groups. The Hepatic mRNA Expression of Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS)— To investigate the effect of increased hepatic SREBP-1 expression on the downstream activation of the enzyme, we examined the mRNA expression of hepatic FAS, one of the target genes of SREBP-1, by Northern blot analysis. The hepatic mRNA expression of FAS from postprandial CBA/JN mice fed the high fructose diet was increased by 6-fold (p < 0.001) over that of the postprandial mice fed the control diet and by 4-fold (p < 0.001) when compared with that of the fructose-fasting mice (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the hepatic mRNA expression of FAS in the DBA/2N mice was not significantly affected by either control diet or high fructose diet (Fig. 2, C and D). The mRNA Expression of PPARα in the Livers from the CBA/JN and the DBA/2N Mice—As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the mRNA expression of PPARα, a key transcription factor for fatty acid oxidation, in the livers from the CBA/JN mice was decreased after intake of either the control (p < 0.01) or the high fructose (p < 0.01) diet. Similar significant reductions of the hepatic mRNA expression of PPARα were also found in DBA/2N mice after intake of either diet (Fig. 3, C and D). The mRNA Expression of SREBP-1 in Primary Cultured Hepatocytes—To study the direct effect of fructose on the expression of SREBP-1 in the liver, we examined the mRNA contents of SREBP-1 in primary cultured hepatocytes isolated from the CBA/JN (Fig. 4A) or the DBA/2N (Fig. 4B) mice in the presence or absence of 30 mm fructose. In this experiment we used cells cultured with 30 mm mannitol as a control for fructose-treated or insulin-treated cells, since 30 mm mannitol did not affect the mRNA expression of SREBP-1 in either CBA/JN or DBA/2N primary hepatocytes; the values for hepatocytes cultured with 5 mm glucose and with 30 mm mannitol were 0.9 ± 0.4 and 1.1 ± 0.2, for CBA/JN (arbitrary units, n = 8, NS) and 1.1 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.2 for DBA/2N (arbitrary units, n = 8, NS). As shown in Fig. 4A, compared with the controls, the primary cultured hepatocytes from the CBA/JN mice showed a 73% (p < 0.01) increase in the mRNA expression of SREBP-1 in the presence of 30 mm fructose in the media and 92% (p < 0.01) increase in the presence of 100 nm insulin. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4B, the incubation with 30 mm fructose did not induce the mRNA expression of SREBP-1 in the primary hepatocytes isolated from the DBA/2N mice. However, 100 nm insulin significantly increased the expression of SREBP-1 mRNA by 24% (p < 0.01) in these hepatocytes. Thus, the effect of insulin on the SREBP-1 mRNA expression in hepatocytes from DBA/2N mice was significantly blunted compared with that on the hepatocytes from CBA/JN mice (p < 0.01). The mRNA Expression of FAS in Primary Cultured Hepatocytes—The mRNA expressions of FAS in primary cultured hepatocytes from both DBA/2N and CBA/JN mice were studied in the presence or absence of 30 mm fructose. In this experiment we used cells cultured with 30 mm mannitol as the control for fructose-treated or insulin-treated cells, since the 30 mm mannitol did not affect the mRNA expression of FAS in either CBA/JN and DBA/2N primary hepatocytes; in the presence of 5 mm glucose or 30 mm mannitol the expression was 1.0 ± 0.01 and 1.0 ± 0.1 for hepatocyte from CBA/JN (arbitrary units, n = 8, NS) and 1.0 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.2 for hepatocytes from DBA2N (arbitrary units, n = 8, NS). Comparable with the results from the experiment on the mRNA expression of SREBP-1, both 30 mm fructose and 100 nm insulin significantly increased (p < 0.01) the mRNA expression of FAS in the hepatocytes from CBA/JN mice, by 100 and 96%, respectively (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the mRNA expression of FAS in primary hepatocytes from DBA/2N mice was not affected by 30 mm fructose (Fig. 5B). However, a 32% (p < 0.01) increase in mRNA expression of FAS was induced by 100 nm insulin; the effect of insulin on the FAS mRNA expression was reduced significantly (p < 0.01) compared with that on the hepatocytes from CBA/JN mice. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in SREBP-1c Promoter Region—We have cloned a 1.2-kilobase pair fragment of the 5′ upstream region of SREBP-1c gene from each inbred mouse strain and found a single nucleotide polymorphism at –468 bp from the putative starting point of the SREBP-1c gene. The nucleotide at –468 bp in the C3H/HeN, C3H/He, C3H/HeJ, BALB/c, and CBA/JN strains is guanine, whereas it is adenine in the C57BL/6, C57BL/6J, C57BL/6N, DBA/1JN, and DBA/2N strains. Luciferase Activities of SREBP-1c Promoters—To investigate the significance of the single nucleotide mutation from guanine to adenine at –468 bp of the SREBP-1c promoter, we analyzed the promoter activity using the luciferase reporter carrying the 1.2-kilobase pair SREBP-1c promoter region of the CBA/JN or DBA/2N mice with 5 individual experiments in a total of 12 determinations. The activity of SREBP-1c promoter in primary hepatocytes isolated from CBA/JN mice was significantly increased by 2.4-fold (p < 0.01) by exposure of the cells to 30 mm fructose (Fig. 6A), but no increase was observed in primary hepatocytes isolated from the DBA/2N mice (Fig. 6B). The activity of the SREBP-1c promoter from DBA/2N mice was not induced by 30 mm fructose in primary hepatocytes isolated from either the CBA/JN or the DBA/2N mice. We also investigated the effect of insulin with 5 individual experiments in a total of 12 determinations. As shown in Fig. 6C, the activity of SREBP-1c promoter from either the DBA/2N or CBA/JN strain in hepatocytes isolated f"
https://openalex.org/W1991069455,"The Gal4p family of yeast zinc cluster proteins comprises regulators of multidrug resistance genes. For example, Pdr1p and Pdr3p bind as homo- or heterodimers to pleiotropic drug response elements (PDREs) found in promoters of target genes. Other zinc cluster activators of multidrug resistance genes include Stb5p and Yrr1p. To better understand the interplay among these activators, we have performed native co-immunoprecipitation experiments using strains expressing tagged zinc cluster proteins from their natural chromosomal locations. Interestingly, Stb5p is found predominantly as a Pdr1p heterodimer and shows little homodimerization. No interactions of Stb5p with Pdr3p or Yrr1p could be detected in our assays. In contrast to Stb5p, Yrr1p is only detected as a homodimer. Similar results were obtained using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Importantly, the purified DNA binding domains of Stb5p and Pdr1p bound to a PDRE as heterodimers in vitro. These results suggest that the DNA binding domains of Pdr1p and Stb5p are sufficient for heterodimerization. Our data demonstrate a complex interplay among these activators and suggest that Pdr1p is a master drug regulator involved in recruiting other zinc cluster proteins to fine tune the regulation of multidrug resistance genes.

Toxic compounds such as drugs are used to treat many diseases by killing the harmful target cells, which can be either foreign pathogenic organisms or the tumor cells of the patients. However, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells can acquire the ability to become resistant to toxic compounds through the phenomenon of multidrug or pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR). 1The abbreviations used are: PDR, pleiotropic drug resistance; MFS, major facilitator superfamily; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; DBD, DNA-binding domain; MDR, multidrug resistance; PDRE, pleiotropic drug response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can also acquire PDR, making it a valuable tool in the study of this phenomenon so that we may gain insights into the mechanisms behind PDR in pathogenic fungi and in higher eukaryotes. Cells that have acquired PDR have consistently shown higher levels of expression of drug efflux pumps (reviewed in Refs. 1Koloczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and 2Wolfger H. Mamnun Y.M. Kuchler K. Res. Micr. 2001; 152: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These pumps fall within two protein families: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. Their increased expression allows expulsion of drugs from within the cell and, as a result, survival in the presence of these drugs. These higher levels of expression are often due to mutations in the transcription factors that regulate the expression of these pumps. A complex network of various transcription factors is involved in the regulation of the expression of genes encoding ABC or MFS proteins. There are two major families of transcription factors involved in PDR: 1) the bZip protein family (Yap family), and 2) zinc cluster proteins. Yap1p is the best characterized member of the bZip family and is an important regulator in the stress response (3Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other class of transcription factors involved in PDR is composed of a subclass of zinc finger proteins, the zinc cluster or binuclear zinc cluster proteins (7Akache B. Wu K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Akache B. Turcotte B. J. Biol.

These proteins contain a DNA binding domain (DBD), which possesses the well-conserved motif Cys-X2-Cys-X6-Cys-X5–16-Cys-X2-Cys-X6–8-Cys, with cysteines binding to two zinc atoms, coordinating folding of the domain involved in DNA recognition (11Vallee B.L. Coleman J.E. Auld D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Two highly homologous zinc cluster proteins, Pdr1p and Pdr3p, positively control the expression of genes involved in multidrug resistance (1Koloczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Wolfger H. Mamnun Y.M. Kuchler K. Res. Micr. 2001; 152: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Target genes of Pdr1p and Pdr3p include the ABC transporters genes PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1 (13Decottignies A. Lambert L. Catty P. Degand H. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol.

Wesolowski-Louvel M. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Delahodde A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Another zinc cluster protein, Yrr1p, regulates the expression of SNQ2 and YOR1 (18Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X. Cui Z. Miyakawa T. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

In addition to these three zinc cluster proteins, Stb5p and Rdr1p have been recently implicated in the regulation of expression of PDR5 and/or SNQ2 (8Akache B. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21254-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Hellauer K. Akache B. MacPherson S. Sirard E. Turcotte B. J. Biol.

Pleiotropic drug response elements (PDREs) present in the promoters of genes encoding ABC transporters, as well as in the PDR3 promoter have been shown to be important in the regulation of these genes. Pdr1p, Pdr3p, Stb5p, and Rdr1p all act through this element, with Pdr1p, Pdr3p, and Stb5p able to bind to an everted repeat CCGCGG (8Akache B. Turcotte B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2098-2104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Characterization of PDREs in the PDR3 promoter indicates that autoregulation can occur at this gene (22Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Even though they act through the same element, all these zinc cluster proteins may perform different functions. Pdr1p and Pdr3p have recently been shown to be able to form homo- and heterodimers (26Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Different combinations of homo- and heterodimers may regulate the expression of different genes, which might help explain how these two proteins act differently. We were interested in determining if Stb5p acts by itself or if it regulates gene expression in concert with other zinc cluster proteins involved in PDR. We show that Stb5p interacts predominantly with Pdr1p (but not Pdr3p or Yrr1p) in vivo and that Yrr1p forms homodimers. Strains—Wild-type strains used were BY4741, MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0, and BY4742, MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (27Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). The open reading frames of PDR1, PDR3, STB5, YRR1, DAL81 and UGA3 were tagged at their natural chromosomal locations with triple HA and Myc epitopes according to Schneider et al. (28Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Pdr1p, Stb5p, Yrr1p, Dal81p, and Uga3p were N-terminally tagged. Since an N-terminally tagged Pdr3p was not functional (data not shown), it was tagged at its C terminus. Tagging was performed by transforming the strains BY4741 and BY4742 with the PCR products generated with the following oligos using p3XMYC and p3XHA as templates (28Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Oligos were obtained from AlphaDNA (Montréal) and purified on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel.

Nucleotides in bold correspond to the initiator codon. Transformants were selected on plates lacking uracil. Homologous recombinations were verified by loss of function (reduced drug resistance for PDR1, PDR3, STB5, and YRR1) or by PCR (for DAL81 and UGA3). Cells were grown overnight in rich medium to allow internal recombination between sequences encoding epitopes and ura3– strains were selected on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (28Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Strains of the opposite mating type were crossed to obtain diploid strains expressing combinations of tagged proteins. Media—Media were prepared according to Adams et al. (29Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1997: 145-157Google Scholar). YPD contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose. S.D. contained 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) and was supplemented with adenine and appropriate amino acids at a final concentration of 0.004%. Bacterial Expression Vectors—A bacterial expression vector for Yrr1p, pGST-Yrr1-(1–170), was constructed by amplifying the sequences encoding the DBD of Yrr1p (amino acids 1–170) using oligos CGGGATCCATGAAAAGAAGAAGCGATGC and ACTACGCAATTGTTAGTAGTACCGGTCGGCATATG and yeast genomic DNA (isolated from strain YPH499, Ref. 30Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, as a template. The PCR product was cut with BamHI and MfeI and subcloned into pGEX-f (24Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) cut with BamHI and EcoRI. Similarly, pGST-Pdr1-(1–152) was constructed using oligos CGGGATCCATGCGAGGCTTGACACCTAA and GGAATTCAATCGTCGTCATTCT. The PCR product was cut with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pGEX-f cut with the same enzymes. The same DNA fragment was subcloned into pRSET-A (Invitrogen) cut with BamHI and EcoRI to give pHis-Pdr1-(1–152). Sequences encoding a triple HA epitope were amplified by PCR using oligos GAAGATCTCTGCAGATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCT and GAAGATCTAGCAGCGTAATCTGGAACG using plasmid p3XHA (28Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR product was cut with BglII and subcloned into the BamHI site of pHis-Pdr1-(1–152) to give pHis-HA-Pdr1-(1–152). Protein Expression and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Expression, purification of fusion proteins, and EMSA were performed as described (24Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Noël J. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17463-17468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) except that the amount of probe was five times higher (0.3 pmol per binding reaction). The probe for EMSA corresponds to the PDRE 1 found in the SNQ2 promoter (centered at position –601 bp relative to the ATG) and was obtained by annealing oligos TCGAACCGTACACATTTTTCCACGGCAAGGAAGTGGCGCG and TCGACGCGCCACTTCCTTGCCGTGGAAAAATGTGTACGGT, filling-in with Klenow and dGTP, dTTP, dATP, and [32P]dCTP. In Vitro Pull-down Assays—BY4741 cells containing the open reading frame encoding the HA-tagged Stb5p or Yrr1p were grown in 200 ml of YPD to an OD600 of ∼1. Cells were pelleted and washed with ice-cold water. Cells were resuspended in an equal volume of ice-cold IP-1 buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) as modified from Mamnun et al. (26Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An equal volume of chilled glass beads was added, and the cells were vortexed three times for 1 min each. The lysate was separated from the debris and unlysed cells by centrifugation. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (24Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using plasmids pGST-Pdr1-(1–152) (see above), pGST-Yrr1-(1–170) (see above), and pGal4-(1–143) (24Hellauer K. Rochon M.-H. Turcotte B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Half of the GST proteins attached to glutathione Sepharose beads were mixed with the yeast lysates and left overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with IP-1 buffer, and the proteins were suspended by adding 50 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer and boiling. The proteins were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the HA antibody (12Ca5, Roche Applied Science). In Vivo Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Diploid strains described above were grown in YPD to an OD600 of ∼1 in a volume of 200 ml. Proteins were isolated as described above and incubated for 2 h with 4 μg of Myc antibody (9E10, Upstate Technologies). Then 20 μl of a 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry were added to the lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed five times with the IP-1 buffer, and then the proteins were dissociated from the beads by boiling the sample for 5 min in 1× Laemmli buffer. The samples were run on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with a HA antibody (12Ca5, Roche Applied Science). Pdr1p and Pdr3p activate transcription through PDREs by forming homo- and heterodimers (26Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since Stb5p also activates transcription by binding to PDREs (8Akache B. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21254-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we tested if it could dimerize with either Pdr1p, Pdr3p, Yrr1p, or itself using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Triple Myc or HA epitopes were inserted into chromosomal DNA at the loci encoding these proteins and at the DAL81 and UGA3 loci. Uga3p, another member of the family of zinc cluster proteins, activates expression of genes involved in γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) catabolism by binding to promoters of target genes (31Noël J. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17463-17468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Talibi D. Grenson M. Andre B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) while the zinc cluster protein Dal81p is a general activator of nitrogen regulated genes (33Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Coornaert D. Vissers S. Andre B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tagged Uga3p and Dal81p were used as negative controls since they do not play any role in conferring drug resistance and, as a result, they should not interact with Stb5p, Pdr1p, Pdr3p, or Yrr1p. All tagged proteins were fully functional since the haploid strains expressing these tagged proteins had a wild-type phenotype when tested on drugs for PDR1, PDR3, STB5, and YRR1 and when assayed with the reporter UGA1-lacZ (31Noël J. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17463-17468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for UGA3 and DAL81 (data not shown). Since the tagged proteins are expressed from their natural promoters, levels of these proteins should not differ from those normally present in wild-type cells. We assayed the relative expression of tagged Pdr1p, Stb5p, Yrr1p, and Pdr3p. Diploid strains expressing tagged proteins of interest were grown in rich medium (YPD) to mid-log phase, and extracts were used for immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1). Tagged proteins were detected at positions expected from their predicted molecular weight. Stb5p, Yrr1p, and Pdr3p were expressed at somewhat similar levels while Pdr1p was expressed at much higher levels (Fig. 1) as observed by Ghaemmaghami et al. (35Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar) who showed that Pdr1p is expressed at higher levels than Stb5p and Pdr3p. Multiple forms of Pdr3p were detected in agreement with another study that showed that the bands correspond to non- and phosphorylated forms of the protein (26Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similarly, multiple forms of Pdr1p were detected. However, we have not yet differentiated the various observed forms of Pdr1p (Fig. 1, lane 1). Diploid strains expressing Myc-Pdr1p along with various HA-tagged zinc cluster proteins were used for co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody. A strong signal was obtained when Myc-Pdr1p co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Stb5p (Fig. 2, top panel, lane 5) while there was no signal for HA-Yrr1p or HA-Uga3p (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 4 and 6). Moreover, no signal was detected in the absence of tagged Pdr1p (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 1–3). Control experiments showed that HA-tagged Uga3p, Stb5p, and Yrr1p were detected when immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 1–6). In summary, our results strongly suggest that Stb5p specifically interacts with Pdr1p in vivo. To ensure that Stb5p does interact with Pdr1p and to test if it can form homodimers, we performed additional experiments where Myc-tagged zinc cluster proteins were used for immunoprecipitation. As shown previously, a strong signal was observed when Myc-Pdr1p was used for co-immunoprecipitation with HA-Stb5p (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 6). To test the formation of a Stb5p homodimer, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with Myc-Stb5p and HA-Stb5p. Only a small fraction of Stb5p could be detected as a homodimer (Fig. 3A, top panel, compare lanes 5 and 6). No interaction between Stb5p and the PDR regulator Pdr3p could be detected in this assay (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 4). In addition, Dal81p, a zinc cluster protein not involved in PDR (33Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Coornaert D. Vissers S. Andre B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), did not interact with Stb5p (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 3). Control experiments showed that all Myc-tagged proteins tested above could be detected when immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A, bottom panel, lanes 1–6). In summary, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments strongly suggest that Stb5p does not efficiently homodimerize and is predominantly found as a heterodimer with Pdr1p in vivo. To test if the DBD of Pdr1p is sufficient for interaction with Stb5p, in vitro GST pull-down assays were performed. As a negative control, we used the zinc cluster protein Gal4p that is involved in galactose metabolism and unrelated to PDR (36Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The DBDs of Pdr1p and Gal4p fused to GST were expressed in bacteria, purified, and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. A protein extract was prepared from a haploid yeast strain expressing HA-Stb5p and added to the GST fusion proteins bound to beads. After washing, bound proteins were dissociated by boiling, run on a gel and visualized by immunoblotting. GST-Pdr1p interacted with HA-Stb5p while GST-Gal4p did not (Fig. 3B). The results from these GST pull-down assays are in agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments and suggest that the DBD of Pdr1p (amino acids 1–152) is sufficient for dimerization with Stb5p. Since Yrr1p is also involved in PDR, we were interested in determining if it could interact with itself as well as with other PDR activators such as Pdr1p, Pdr3p, and Stb5p. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments similar to those described above were performed with Myc- and HA-tagged Yrr1p. Results show that Yrr1p forms homodimers in vivo (Fig. 4A, top panel, lane 6). No interaction of Yrr1p with Dal81p, Pdr3p, and Stb5p was detected in this assay (Fig. 4A, top panel, lanes 3–5). Control experiments showed that Myc-tagged Yrr1p, Dal81p, Pdr3p, and Stb5p were detected when immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4A, bottom panel, lanes 2–5). Results were confirmed using a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4B). HA-Yrr1p was pulled down with GST-Yrr1p but not GST-Gal4p. Thus, the GST pull-down assay with Yrr1p is also in agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, as observed with Stb5p. We also wished to determine if the interaction of Stb5p with Pdr1p seen in vivo could be observed in vitro using purified components in an EMSA. We used the approach of Hope and Struhl (37Hope I.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1987; 9: 2781-2784Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that relies on proteins with different electrophoretic mobilities in order to detect an intermediate complex corresponding to a heterodimer. Various polypeptides encoding the DBDs of Stb5p and Pdr1p showed similar mobilities as tested in EMSA (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, a fusion of the DBD of Pdr1p with 6 histidines and a triple HA epitope (His-HA-Pdr1p) was expressed in E. coli and purified on a nickel column. Similarly, GST-Stb5p was expressed in E. coli, purified and the GST moiety removed by thrombin cleavage. Binding in vitro of the purified proteins was assayed by EMSA using a probe corresponding to the PDRE number 1 found in the SNQ2 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). With the DBD of Stb5p alone, two major retarded complexes of fast mobility were observed (Fig. 5, lanes 2–5). With the DBD of Pdr1p alone, a retarded complex was observed only at high protein concentration (Fig. 3, lanes 6–9). Smearing suggests that the DNA-Pdr1p complex dissociated during electrophoresis. Interestingly, a complex of intermediate mobility was observed when mixing the DBDs of Pdr1p and Stb5p, strongly suggesting the formation of a heterodimer (Fig. 5, lanes 10–13). These results suggest that the DBDs of Stb5p and Pdr1p bind in vitro as a heterodimer to a target DNA sequence. At least four zinc cluster proteins activate transcription of multidrug resistance genes. Initially, it was shown that the expression of these genes was activated by Pdr1p, Pdr3p, and Yrr1p through the PDREs found in their promoters (1Koloczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, Stb5p has been identified as an additional transcriptional activator of multidrug resistance genes (8Akache B. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21254-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Stb5p activates transcription by binding to PDREs, the same elements found to be critical for Pdr1p and Pdr3p activity. It has been shown that Pdr1p and Pdr3p homo- and heterodimerize (26Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since Stb5p and Yrr1p have similar roles and act through the same elements as Pdr1p and Pdr3p, we tested the ability of these four proteins to dimerize with each other. Interestingly, Stb5p dimerizes with Pdr1p while Yrr1p forms homodimers. The interactions among these various transcriptional activators are summarized in Fig. 6. Using native co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we determined that Stb5p was found predominantly as a heterodimer with Pdr1p (Figs. 2A and 3A). Only a small fraction of Stb5p was found as a homodimer and no Stb5p-Pdr3p or Stb5p-Yrr1p heterodimers were detected in our assay. The Stb5p-Pdr1p interaction was also observed when a GST-Pdr1p(DBD) fusion was able to specifically pull-down Stb5p (Fig. 3B), indicating that the 152 N-terminal amino acids of Pdr1p are sufficient to mediate dimerization with Stb5p. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments also showed that Yrr1p homodimerizes (Fig. 4A). In agreement with the immunoprecipitation experiments, Yrr1p was also pulled down by the GST-Yrr1p(DBD) fusion protein (Fig. 4B). Many zinc cluster proteins (Gal4p, Leu3p, Hap1p, Ppr1p, Put3p, etc.) initially characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were shown to bind to DNA as homodimers (7Akache B. Wu K. Turcotte B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Todd R.B. Andrianopoulos A. Fungal Gen. Biol. 1997; 21: 388-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). More recently, Oaf1p and Oaf2p (Pip2p) were shown to bind as heterodimers to target sequences of genes for peroxisome proliferation (38Karpichev I.V. Luo Y. Marians R.C. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, Uga3p, the activator of GABA-responsive genes, interacts in vivo with the zinc cluster protein Dal81p. 2M.-A. Sylvain and B. Turcotte, unpublished results. The zinc cluster protein ArgRIIp heterodimerizes with members of the MADS family to activate genes for arginine metabolism (40Amar N. Messenguy F. El Bakkoury M. Dubois E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results combined with those of Mamnun et al. (26Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Pdr1p can dimerize with itself, Pdr3p and Stb5p. In addition, we have previously shown that another zinc cluster protein, Rdr1p, represses the expression of some PDR genes such as PDR5 and PDR16 (21Hellauer K. Akache B. MacPherson S. Sirard E. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17671-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the repressive effect of Rdr1p is mediated by PDREs. Interestingly, Rdr1p interacts in vivo with both Pdr1p and Pdr3p. 3S. MacPherson and B. Turcotte, unpublished results. Formation of heterodimeric complexes by zinc cluster proteins may therefore be a more predominant mechanism for regulation of gene expression than initially anticipated. Regulation of a relatively simple pathway, such as the one triggered by galactose, is efficiently performed by Gal4p homodimers, while more complex processes, like PDR, must require various combinations of homo- and heterodimers to integrate different signals allowing for precise expression of target genes. Taken together, the data suggest that Pdr1p is a master PDR regulator involved in recruiting other zinc cluster proteins to fine-tune the regulation of multidrug resistance genes. This is reminiscent of the mammalian nuclear receptor RXR, which forms heterodimers with the receptors for 9-cis retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D, as well as peroxisome proliferator activators to differentially regulate expression of target genes (41Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). An EMSA showed that the purified DBDs of Pdr1p and Stb5p bound as a heterodimer to a PDRE in vitro (Fig. 5). The N termini of Pdr1p (amino acids 1–152) and Stb5p (amino acids 1–163) are sufficient to allow formation of heterodimers on DNA. Crystal and solution structures of the DBDs of zinc cluster proteins Gal4p, Ppr1p, Put3p, and Hap1p show that these proteins homodimerize via a coiled-coil dimerization domain composed of heptad repeats located at the C terminus of the zinc finger (42Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 43Baleja J.D. Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Wagner G.

However, no obvious heptad repeats are predicted to be present in the Pdr1p polypeptide used for EMSA (9Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) while only one repeat is found in the DBD of Stb5p. 4B. Turcotte, unpublished results. Clearly, further studies will be required to define the structural basis for the multiple interactions of Pdr1p with other zinc cluster proteins. Zinc cluster proteins contribute differently to the regulation of specific PDR genes. For example, induced-expression of FLR1, a gene involved in PDR (49Alarco A.M. Balan I. Talibi D. Mainville N. Raymond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19304-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), is dependent on Pdr3p but not Pdr1p (50Broco N. Tenreiro S. Viegas C.A. Sa-Correia I. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, a deletion of Pdr1p greatly diminishes expression of PDR5 while removal of Pdr3p has marginal effects (15Mahe Y. Parle-McDermott A. Nourani A. Delahodde A. Lamprecht A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of PDR1 or PDR3 results in increased or decreased expression of PDR15 (a homologue of PDR5), respectively (51Wolfger H. Mahe Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This pattern of regulation is further complicated by the fact that Pdr3p undergoes positive autoregulation (22Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) while expression of YRR1 is under the control of Pdr1p/Pdr3p and itself (19Zhang X. Cui Z. Miyakawa T. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Growth conditions also modulate Pdr3p expression (52Mamnun Y.M. Schuller C. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, activity of Yrr1p is negatively regulated by overexpression of the zinc cluster protein Yrm1p (53Lucau-Danila A. Delaveau T. Lelandais G. Devaux F. Jacq C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52641-52650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The observation that zinc cluster proteins form various combinations of dimers will be invaluable in better understanding the complex regulation of PDR genes. In conclusion, we have shown that the four zinc cluster protein activators of multidrug resistance genes do not act individually. Instead, they form various populations of homo- and heterodimers (Fig. 6). There may be differences in the binding specificity or activity of each of these populations, allowing for a very specific and varied expression of genes involved in PDR. Pdr1p was the only protein able to show multiple interactions indicating that it is similar to mammalian nuclear receptor RXR in its ability to recruit various partners. With at least four different zinc cluster proteins regulating the expression of PDR genes via different PDREs, the cellular ability to respond to drugs is much more adaptable and flexible. These discoveries present many more questions regarding PDR. For example, would various environmental signals cause a shift in the balance of the various populations of homo- and heterodimers? Is the hyperactivity of the Pdr1p and Pdr3p mutants caused by a change in the activity of the protein or to a change in the partner of the protein? Are other regulators of drug resistance, such as members of the Yap1p family, able to dimerize with these zinc cluster proteins? We thank Dr. A. B. Futcher for providing plasmids for epitope tagging. We are grateful to Karen Hellauer for providing purified zinc cluster proteins.

The Nf2 gene was isolated by positional cloning and encodes merlin, which was named for its striking structural similarity with the ERM family proteins (moesin, ezrin, and radixin) linking the actin cytoskeleton to various membrane-associated proteins (3Gusella J.F.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) showed that Nf2 deficiency leads to defective cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, abolishing the contact-dependent inhibition of cell growth. Their results indicated that merlin localizes at the adherens junctions and physically interacts with their components in confluent cells, suggesting that merlin normally controls adherence junctions assembly and contact-dependent growth inhibition directly from the sites of cell-cell contact. For the better understanding of merlin function, merlin-associated proteins were screened using a yeast two-hybrid interaction trap strategy from a human brain cDNA library. We identified a human transactivation-responsive RNA-binding protein (TRBP) as a novel protein interacting with merlin via its carboxyl-terminal domain. TRBP is encoded by the tarbp2 gene localized at human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 15 (12Kozak C.A. Gatignol A. Graham K. Jeang K.T. McBride O.W.

The two isoforms of TRBP, TRBP1 (original TRBP) and TRBP2, are expressed by alternative transcriptional initiation, resulting in the TRBP2 protein that is longer than TRBP1 by 21 amino acids at its amino terminus (14Duarte M.

TRBP dsRBD2 binds transactivation-response with higher affinity than dsRBD1, because of the presence of a KR helix motif (16Bannwarth S. Talakoub L. Letourneur F. Duarte M. Purcell D.F. Hiscott J.

TRBP acts in synergy with functional Tat to stimulate the expression of the HIV-1 long terminal repeats in human and murine cells (14Duarte M. Graham K. Daher A. Battisti P.L. Bannwarth S. Segeral E.

The murine homologue, Prbp, binds the 3′-untranslated region of Prm1 protamine RNA, represses its translation, and plays a physiological role in spermatogenesis (23Lee K. Fajardo M.A. Braun R.E. Mol.

TRBP also directly binds the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) that has anti-viral and anti-proliferative effects. TRBP inhibits the ability of PKR to phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, leading to its inactivation (25Park H. Davies M.V. Langland J.O. Chang H.W. Nam Y.S. Tartaglia J.

Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In relation to the inhibition of PKR activity, TRBP was recently demonstrated to play a growth promoting role and has an oncogenic potential (26Benkirane M. Neuveut C. Chun R.F. Smith S.M. Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the tumor suppressor merlin interacts with oncogenic TRBP and inhibits its function. In this report, we present evidence for the direct interaction between merlin and TRBP both in vitro and in vivo and show that merlin reverses the growth promoting and tumorigenic activities of TRBP. Plasmids—The plasmids for wild type merlin, its deletion mutants (M1–M4), and active Ras in the mammalian system were described in previous reports (27Kim H. Lim J.Y. Kim Y.H. Park S.H. Lee K.H. Han H. Jeun S.S. Lee J.H. Rha H.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 14: 108-114Google Scholar, 28Kim J.Y. Kim H. Jeun S.S. Rha S.J. Kim Y.H. Ko Y.J. Won J. Lee K.H. Rha H.K. Wang Y.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The yeast plasmids for the merlin proteins were generated by PCR cloning in pGBT9, a GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using a BamHI site. The full-length and derivatives of human TRBP were synthesized using PCR and inserted in the BamHI/XhoI sites of pACT2 yeast plasmids (Clontech) or in the cloning sites of pcDNA3.1-V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for mammalian expression. His and V5 epitopes were tagged at the carboxyl-terminus of TRBP proteins in the mammalian expression plasmids. The full-length TRBP was constructed in pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusion (pGST-TRBP) and in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) for GFP fusion (pEGFP-TRBP), using the BamHI/XhoI sites in both cases. The RFP fusion of the full-length merlin was generated by cloning RFP fragment from pDsRed-N1 (Clontech) into the BamHI site of pcDNA-NF2, a merlin expression plasmid. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The full-length human NF2 in pGBT9 (pGBT9-NF2) was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screens of a human brain cDNA library in pACT2 (Clontech). The bait and the library DNAs were co-transformed by the lithium acetate method as previously described (29Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Twenty-five colonies of 2 × 106 transformants grew normally in the absence of histidine and showed detectable β-galactosidase activity within 3 h of reaction. The clones were subjected to partial sequence determination. Cloning of the Full-length cDNA of tarbp2—PCR was performed from the human brain cDNA library (Clontech) using TRBP5′ (5′-atgagtgaagaggagcaaggctccggcact-3′) and TRBP3′ (5′-tcacttgctgcctgccatgatcttgaggta-3′) primers. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen), and a 1.1-kb tarbp2 cDNA was verified by sequencing. Northern Blotting—Hybridizations were performed with the random-primed 32P-labeled probes, corresponding to the full-length human TRBP cDNA and the β-actin-tested human multiple-tissue Northern blot (Clontech), where poly(A)+ mRNAs from peripheral blood leukocyte, lung, placenta, small intestine, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, colon, skeletal muscle, heart, and brain were represented. The membrane was washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then exposed to the x-ray film. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—NIH3T3 and SK-N-BE (2Evans D.G. Huson S.M. Donnai D. Neary W. Blair V. Teare D. Newton V. Strachan T. Ramsden R. Harris R. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 29: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and wild type and NF2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF wt and MEF –/–) were kindly provided by Dr. McClatchey. All of the cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The Gene Porter2 reagent (Gene Therapy System. Inc.) was used for transfection according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Construction of Stable Cell Lines—NIH3T3 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and transfected with the plasmids containing merlin and/or TRBP after 16 h. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were split at ratios of 3:1, 9:1, 27:1, and 50:1, and the G418-resistant colonies were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Before each experiment performed with the constructed stable cell lines, Western blots were performed to certify the expression of TRBP and/or merlin. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—The antibodies for merlin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), V5 epitope (Invitrogen), and β-actin (Sigma) were obtained from commercial sources. Polyclonal anti-TRBP antibody was produced in rabbit using a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide (RSPPMELQPPVSPQQSECNPVGALQ) as an epitope (Peptron Inc., Daejeon, Korea). The obtained polyclonal anti-TRBP antibody was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western analysis (data not shown). For immunoprecipitation or Western blotting, the cells were lysed in RIPA-B buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h on ice. The insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection was performed according to the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Biosciences). For all of the merlin detection procedures, a mixture of anti-merlin polyclonal antibodies sc331 and sc332 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution. GST Pull-down Assay—The GST-TRBP was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (30Park I. Chung J. Walsh C.T. Yun Y. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12338-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the pull-down assay, 2 μg of each GST fusion protein was immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with the merlin-transfected NIH3T3 cell lysates in RIPA-B buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-merlin antibody. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—NIH3T3 cells were seeded in a 4-well chamber slide (2 × 104 cells/well) and transfected with pRFP-merlin and/or pEGFP-TRBP. Twenty-four hours later, the localization of the expressed proteins was determined by means of their green and red fluorescences using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Wild type and NF2-deficient MEF cells in Lab-Tek II glass chamber slides (VWR International) were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol. The chamber slides were incubated in PBS supplemented with 20 mm ammonium chloride and 10% fetal calf serum for blocking, and the slides were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-TRBP antibody (diluted at 1:300 in PBS with 10% fetal calf serum) followed by highly cross-adsorbed goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The nuclear DNA was counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich). The confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscopy and imaging were performed using a 543-nm HeNe laser for excitation and a 565–615-nm filter for emission. Cell Proliferation Assays—The proliferation of stable NIH3T3 cells expressing pcDNA control, TRBP, NF2, or TRBP+NF2 was assessed by CellTiter 96 Aqueous assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, each stable cell line was seeded into the 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells/well. Three hours after plating (when the cells were well attached), the combined MTS/PMS solution was added into each well, to control the initial amount of cells. After incubation for 30 min in the CO2 incubator, the absorbance was recorded at 490 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Then cell proliferation was chased at days 1, 2, 3, and 4 after seeding using the same procedure as that described above. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay—The NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the pcDNA control, active Ras, TRBP, NF2, or TRBP+NF2 (5 × 103 cells) were mixed with 1 ml of 0.35% molten agarose (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Each mixture was plated on a 2-ml solidified layer of 0.7% agarose prepared in the same medium in a 6-well plate. The number and size of the resulting colonies were determined by microscopic visualization after 12–14 days. Tumorigenesis Assay in Nude Mice—Five-week-old BALB/c-nu SLC mice were obtained from Jung-Ang Lab Animal, Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Three mice were used for each experimental group. Each mouse was inoculated subcutaneously with the same stable NIH3T3 cells (1 × 107 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS) as in the soft agar assay. Tumor growth was monitored twice a week and examined at 28 days after inoculation. Identification of TRBP as a Merlin-binding Protein—To identify the proteins that associate with merlin, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with a human brain cDNA library and the full-length merlin as bait. Twenty-five clones were initially selected and subdivided into five different groups after DNA sequencing. One group of them contained parts of a cDNA encoding human TRBP. TRBP was initially identified as an HIV transactivation-response RNA-binding protein with two double-stranded RNA-binding domains, dsRBD1 (amino acids 31–79) and dsRBD2 (amino acids 160–222) (see Fig. 2B). It is currently implicated in counteracting PKR activity, which results in the proliferative and oncogenic effects in cells (26Benkirane M. Neuveut C. Chun R.F. Smith S.M. Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, the direct interaction between merlin tumor suppressor and oncogenic TRBP might have biological significance in regulating cell proliferation. The tissue distribution of TRBP expression was first determined using a human adult multiple tissue RNA blot (Clontech) and a full-length TRBP cDNA probe. The result showed that TRBP was present mainly as a single species of 1.5 kb in most of the tissues (Fig. 1). Its expression was high in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta and was relatively low in the brain, colon, thymus, spleen, small intestine, and lungs. Two minor transcripts of 3.2 and 5.4 kb were also observed but were barely detected in most of the tissues, as in the case of previous report (31Siffroi J.P. Pawlak A. Alfonsi M.F. Troalen F. Guellaen G. Dadoune J.P. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Merlin was also shown to be expressed in almost all adult tissues, particularly in the heart and skeletal muscle (32Trofatter J.A. MacCollin M.M. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Duyao M.P. Parry D.M. Eldridge R. Kley N. Menon A.G. Pulaski K. Haase V.H. Ambrose C.M. Munroe D. Bove C. Haines J.L. Martuza R.L. MacDonald M.E. Seizinger B.R. Short M.P. Buckler A.J. Gusella J.F.

TRBP and Merlin Interact with Each Other via Their Carboxyl-terminal Regions in Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The TRBP clone isolated from the screening lacked both of the RNA-binding domains and contained only the carboxyl-terminal region (cf. TRBP-partial in Fig. 2B). The partial and full-length TRBP obtained by PCR cloning were tested in the yeast system for the interaction with the full-length and deletion mutants of merlin (Fig. 2A). As summarized in Table I, both the full-length and partial TRBP specifically associated with the full-length merlin in the LacZ assay and yeast growth test. They were associated with the M1, M2, and M4 deletion mutants of merlin but not with the M3 mutant, which does not contain the carboxyl-terminal region. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal regions of each protein are responsible for the interaction of merlin and TRBP in the yeast system.Table IMerlin and TRBP interaction in yeast two-hybrid assayTRBP partialaOriginally screened clone from human brain cDNA library.Wild type TRBPLacZHis—, Ade—LacZHis—, Ade—Merlin wild type++++++++++M1++++++++M2++++M3----M4++++++++++++a Originally screened clone from human brain cDNA library. Open table in a new tab In Vitro Interaction between TRBP and Merlin in the GST Pull-down Assay—To further confirm the direct interaction of TRBP and merlin in vitro, the GST pull-down assays were performed with the GST fusion of full-length TRBP. The lysates of NIH3T3 cells expressing full-length merlin or its deletion mutants were incubated with the resin-bound GST-TRBP, and the pulled down samples were detected using anti-merlin antibodies (Fig. 3). Consistent with the yeast-two hybrid results (Table I), GST-TRBP, but not GST alone, selectively pulled down full-length merlin (Fig. 3A). Only the M1, M2, and M4 merlin deletions containing the carboxyl-terminal region of merlin were selectively pulled down by GST-TRBP, but the M3 merlin mutant was not (Fig. 3B). The amount of the various merlin proteins in the input sample was also checked by Western blotting. Various forms of the M2 deletion mutant of merlin were observed in the input and GST pull-down samples. The M2 deletion mutant of merlin seems to have some sites susceptible to cleavage. Nonetheless, all of them bound TRBP in the GST pull-down assay. Notably, merlin was present mainly in a phosphorylated form in the input cell lysates. However, a significant amount of the hypophosphorylated merlin was detected in the GST-TRBP-pulled down assays, and the quantity of hypophosphorylated merlin was slightly greater than that of the phosphorylated merlin. This result suggests that TRBP might interact preferentially with the hypophosphorylated form of merlin in vitro. TRBP Associates with Merlin in Vivo—The physical interaction between merlin and the full-length or deletion mutants of TRBP (TRBPΔdr1 and TRBPΔdr1,2; Fig. 2B) was examined in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4). The V5 epitope-tagged TRBP or its deletion mutants were expressed together with merlin in NIH3T3 cells, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-V5 antibody. Subsequent Western blotting with anti-merlin antibody revealed that both the hypophosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of merlin interacted with all of the TRBP proteins in vivo (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Again, the level of the hypophosphorylated merlin was quite low in the input lysates (Fig. 4A, top panel) and in the immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). Consistent with the result obtained from the yeast two-hybrid assay, merlin was co-immunoprecipitated with both of the TRBP deletion mutants containing the carboxyl-terminal region of TRBP (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Only a small amount of merlin was detected with TRBPΔdr1,2, probably because the TRBPΔdr1,2 protein level was relatively low in the immunoprecipitated sample (Fig. 4A, bottom panel) and in the input lysate (data not shown). It is likely that the TRBPΔdr1,2-V5 protein is relatively unstable compared with the other forms of TRBP. Reciprocally, TRBP was co-immunoprecipitated with merlin from the NIH3T3 cell lysates by the anti-merlin antibody (Fig. 4B). However, the TRBP mutant without the carboxyl-terminal region (TRBPΔc) was not co-immunoprecipitated with merlin (Fig. 4B, lane 5). Taken together, these results suggest that TRBP and merlin interact in vivo via the carboxyl-terminal regions of each protein and that both of the dsRBDs of TRBP are dispensable for the interaction with merlin. The interaction between endogenous TRBP and merlin was investigated by immunoprecipitation in SK-N-Be (2Evans D.G. Huson S.M. Donnai D. Neary W. Blair V. Teare D. Newton V. Strachan T. Ramsden R. Harris R. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 29: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), a human neuroblastoma cell line, because we used human TRBP sequence. As shown in Fig. 4C, TRBP and merlin were co-immunoprecipitated each other in SK cell lysates, whereas the preimmune serum showed no detectable immunoprecipitates. This result suggests that TRBP and merlin interact with each other at the physiological level. TRBP Co-localizes with Merlin—To further support their interaction in vivo, we examined whether TRBP and merlin would co-localize in NIH3T3 cells. The TRBP-GFP and merlin-RFP fusion proteins were co-expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and the fluorescence images were analyzed using a confocal microscope. The GFP or RFP control localized diffusely throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm (data not shown). The TRBP-GFP fusion proteins were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and to some extent in the nucleus (maybe in the nucleolus) (Fig. 5A). The Merlin-RFP fusion proteins were mainly localized at the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 5, A and B), which is consistent with other reports (11Lallemand D. Curto M. Saotome I. Giovannini M. McClatchey A.I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). When TRBP-GFP and merlin-RFP were co-expressed in NIH3T3 cells, they were observed to co-localize mainly in the perinuclear and partly in the membrane ruffling regions (Fig. 5, C–E). The localization of TRBP was further investigated in NF2-wild or -deficient MEF cell lines (MEF wt and MEF –/–). As shown in Fig. 5F, endogenous TRBP was detected mainly in the nucleus and partially in the perinuclear region and cytoplasm in the NF2-deficient MEF cells. Interestingly in wild type MEF cells with a physiological level of merlin, TRBP was also detected in the cellular membrane region as well as in the nucleus and perinuclear regions (Fig. 5G).

https://openalex.org/W2129672735,"Neurotensin (NT) is a gut peptide that plays an important role in gastrointestinal (GI) secretion, motility, and growth as well as the proliferation of NT receptor positive cancers. Secretion of NT is regulated by phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms-α and -δ and may involve protein kinase D (PKD). The purpose of our present study was: (i) to define the role of PKD in NT release from BON endocrine cells and (ii) to delineate the upstream signaling mechanisms mediating this effect. Here, we demonstrate that small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against PKD dramatically inhibited both basal and PMA-stimulated NT secretion; NT release is significantly increased by overexpression of PKD. PKC-α and -δ siRNA attenuated PKD activity, whereas overexpression of PKC-α and -δ enhanced PKD activity. Rho kinase (ROK) siRNA significantly inhibited NT secretion, whereas overexpression of ROKα effectively increased NT release. Rho protein inhibitor C3 dramatically inhibited both NT secretion and PKD activity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PKD activation plays a central role in NT peptide secretion; upstream regulators of PKD include PKC-α and -δ and Rho/ROK. Importantly, our results identify novel signaling pathways, which culminate in gut peptide release.

In addition to its trophic effects on normal GI tissues, NT stimulates proliferation of certain pancreatic, colonic, and prostatic cancers bearing NT receptors (NTR) (8Thomas R.P. Hellmich M.R. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms for pancreatic hormone release have been well characterized (9Goodge K.A. Hutton J.C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathways regulating stimuli-induced gut hormone secretion are not entirely understood. One reason for this paucity in our understanding is the relative lack of useful in vitro models that recapitulate in vivo properties of intestinal endocrine cells. The BON endocrine cell line was established from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor and characterized in our laboratory (10Evers B.M. Ishizuka J. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson J.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 733: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These cells have served as an invaluable in vitro model for hormone secretion studies. Similar to the terminally differentiated N cell of the small bowel, BON cells express high levels of NT/neuromedin N mRNA, synthesize and secrete NT peptide, and process the NT/neuromedin N precursor protein in a fashion identical to that of the normal intestine (11Carraway R.E. Mitra S.P. Evers B.M. Townsend Jr., C.M. Regul. Pept. 1994; 53: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). BON cells exhibit morphological and biochemical characteristics consistent with the enteroendocrine cell phenotype, including the presence of numerous dense core granules and the expression and secretion of chromogranin A and other peptides (e.g. pancreastatin) (10Evers B.M.

The PKCs comprise a family of intracellular serine/threonine-specific kinases that are, depending on the isoform, typically activated by Ca2+, lipid second messengers or protein activators and mediate the effects of a wide range of physiological stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters (16Newton A.C.

Protein kinase D (PKD), originally referred to as PKC-μ, is a serine/threonine protein kinase with unique structural, enzymological, and regulatory properties that are different from those of the PKC family members (18Johannes F.J.

The most distinct characteristics of PKD are the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain within the regulatory region, and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its N-terminal region (18Johannes F.J.

The potential role of Rho family members in gut peptide secretion is not known. The purpose of our present study was 2-fold: (i) to determine whether PKD is involved in NT secretion, and (ii) to delineate upstream regulators of PKD in the BON endocrine cell line. We found that the novel PKD protein mediates phorbol ester- or bombesin (BBS)-stimulated NT secretion and is regulated by PKC-α, -δ, and the Rho/ROK pathway.

Recombinant GST-C3 and GST control proteins were purified from Escherichia coli using constructs provided by Dr. Keith Burridge (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Establishment of Stable Cell Line—The BON cell line was derived from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor and characterized in our laboratory (10Evers B.M. Ishizuka J. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson J.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 733: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). BON cells are maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mixture, F12K, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For transiently transfection, plasmids, siRNA and GST-C3 protein were transfected by electroporation (400 V, 500 μfarads for plasmids or siRNA; 450 V, 25 μfarads for GST-C3 protein) using GenePulser XCell (Bio-Rad). To establish BON cell clones that express GRPR, parental BON cells were transfected by electroporation with GRPR-GFP. Stably transfected clones were selected in medium containing 800 μg/ml of G418 (Cellgro). Individual G418-resistant clones were isolated using trypsin, transferred, and subcultured. Stable cell clones were screened by fluorescent microscopy. Once established, clones were maintained in media containing 400 μg/ml of G418. NT Radioimmunoassay (RIA)—Parental BON cells were treated with PMA in secretion medium for 30 min. The BON/GRPR-GFP cells were treated with the GRPR ligand, BBS, in Krebs-Henseleit Buffer, containing 0.294 g/liter of CaCl2, 5.9 g/liter of HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). For inhibitor treatments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min, followed by combined treatments with PMA (10 nm) and inhibitors for another 10 min. Medium was collected and stored at -80 °C until RIA for NT. RIA for NT was performed in duplicate samples as described previously (42Jones P.M. Howell S.L. Biochem. Soc.

Real Time Confocal Microscopy—BON cells, transiently expressing GFP-tagged PKD, were cultured in 25-mm round coverslips in 6-well plates and imaged in real time before and after PMA treatment. Cells were placed inside a prewarmed (37 °C) chamber on the stage of an LSM 510 META confocal system configured with an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). GFP fluorescence images were acquired using a plan-aprochromat 63×, 1.4 NA oil immersion objectives and the 488 nm line of an argon ion laser for excitation. The image acquisition and processing was carried out using the Zeiss LSM510 work-station (v 3.0) and the Zeiss Image Browser (v3.1) software. Protein Preparation and Western Blotting—Protein preparation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (14Li J. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Am. J.

In brief, equal amounts of protein were resolved on Novex Tris-glycine or Nu-PAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were developed using the ECL detection system. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (14Li J.

In brief, proteins (50 μg) were incubated with PKD or GFP antibodies (1:50) on a shaker for 2 h at 4 °C followed by another 2 h incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were suspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer and kinase reaction, with or without 2.5 μg of syntide-2 as a substrate, was started by adding 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× Tris-glycine sample buffer. Samples were denatured by boiling for 5 min and separated by NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels. Gels were incubated in Gel-Dry drying solution (Invitrogen) for 5 min and dried at 60 °C for 60 min followed by exposure to x-ray film. RhoA Activity Assay—RhoA activity was assessed using the Rho binding domain of Rhotekin as described (44O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.K. Mercurio A.M. J.

In brief, cells (3 × 106) were transfected with 50 μg of GST-C3 or GST protein and plated onto 60-mm dishes in growth medium, allowed to adhere and then serumstarved in secretion medium overnight. Cells were treated with PMA (10 nm) for 10 min and then extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min, the extracts were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with bacterially expressed GST-RBD (Rho binding domain of Rhotekin) fusion protein (44O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and then washed three times. The RhoA content was determined by immunoblotting samples using rabbit anti-RhoA antibody. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least two times and data are reported as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance for a two-factor factorial experiment (Figs. 1B, 2A, 6, A–C, and 8C) or a one-factor experiment (Fig. 6D). Fisher's least significant difference procedure was used for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment for the number of comparisons. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.Fig. 2Overexpression of wild-type PKD and constitutively active PKD significantly increases PMA-mediated NT secretion.A, BON cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type PKD, constitutively active PKD-GFP or the empty vector and allowed to recover for 24 h. Cells were then serum-starved in secretion medium overnight and treated with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or 10 nm PMA for 30 min.

Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G1197-G1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we determined whether PKD is involved in PMA-mediated NT secretion. We took advantage of the RNA interference (RNAi) to selectively reduce PKD expression (Fig. 1). BON cells were transfected with the PKD siRNA vector (pSUPER.PKD siRNA) and the control vector (pSUPER). Cells were collected at 48 or 96 h after transfection, and lysates immunoblotted to assess expression of endogenous PKD (Fig. 1A, top). Compared with cells transfected with the control siRNA (pSUPER), transfection of PKD siRNA significantly reduced PKD levels. The blot was stripped and reprobed with β-actin demonstrating equal loading. Moreover, the PMA-activated phosphorylation of PKD was reduced significantly by PKD siRNA compared with the PMA-treated control vector (Fig. 1A, bottom). Next, BON cells were transfected with PKD siRNA or the control vector (pSUPER) and treated with PMA; NT secretion was assayed by RIA (Fig. 1B). Transfection with siRNA directed against PKD decreased both basal and PMA-stimulated NT secretion from BON cells compared with the control vector. Taken together, our results, using complementary techniques, strongly demonstrate an important role for PKD in NT secretion from BON cells. Overexpression of Wild-type and Constitutively Active PKD Increases PMA-mediated NT Secretion—To further confirm the regulation of PKD on NT secretion, BON cells were transiently transfected with PKDWT, or the constitutively active PKDΔPH, both linked to GFP, or the empty vector (pEGFP-N-1), as a control (Fig. 2). 24 h after, the cells were serum-starved, then treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or PMA (10 nm) for 30 min, and the medium collected for measurement of NT by RIA (Fig. 2A). In the absence of PMA treatment, overexpression of PKDΔPH increased NT release compared with the empty vector (pEGFP-N-1) and PKDWT. The PH domain exerts an inhibitory effect on the catalytic domain of PKD (46Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); therefore, the increase in basal NT release suggests that the PH domain plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of its enzymatic activity. NT secretion was significantly increased by PMA treatment of BON cells transfected with the empty vector. Importantly, PMA treatment of cells transfected with either PKDWT or PKDΔPH resulted in a significantly enhanced NT secretion compared with PMA treatment of BON cells transfected with the empty vector, but the increase in secretion from BON cells transfected with PKDΔPH was lower than NT secretion noted fr"

Yet hRAD51 lacks the coordinated ADP/ATP processing exhibited by RecA and is less efficient in HRR reactions in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that hXRCC2, one of five other poorly understood non-redundant human mitotic RecA homologs (hRAD51B, hRAD51C, hRAD51D, hXRCC2, and hXRCC3), stimulates hRAD51 ATP processing. hXRCC2 also increases hRAD51-mediated DNA unwinding and strand exchange activities that are integral for HRR. Although there does not seem to be a long-lived interaction between hXRCC2 and hRAD51, we detail a strong adenosine nucleotide-regulated interaction between the hXRCC2-hRAD51D heterodimer and hRAD51.

Unlike the other human RecA/RAD51 family members, RAD51 seems to be essential for HRR in both mitotic and meiotic cells (5Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Mutat.

The RecA/RAD51 family of proteins promotes HRR by catalyzing homologous pairing and strand exchange between parental DNAs (2Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Whereas hRAD51 and a hRAD51C-hXRCC3 complex seem to retain a homologous pairing and strand exchange activity (9Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C.

Homology between RecA/RAD51 family members is largely confined to the Walker A/B nucleotide binding domains (2Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). These peptide motifs allow a number of diverse proteins to coordinate the free energy of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) binding and hydrolysis into biological processes (15Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). During HRR, the bacterial RecA protein efficiently synchronizes the binding and hydrolysis of ATP between monomers within a nucleoprotein filament (NPF) that ultimately facilitates unwinding and strand exchange between homologous DNAs (2Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, hRAD51 alone is largely unable to coordinate ATP processing between individual subunits of the NPF, which is manifest in modest strand exchange activity and a dramatically reduced ability to process heterologous (mismatched) DNA sequences, a genetic signature of HRR (9Baumann P.

These results have suggested that additional factors are necessary to coordinate the hRAD51 ATPase during HRR in eukaryotic cells. Hydrolysis of an NTP can be conceptually divided into two phases: 1) γ-phosphate hydrolysis and 2) the release of the hydrolysis products (NDP + Pi) followed by binding of a new NTP (NDP→NTP exchange). NDP→NTP exchange seems to be the rate-limiting step in many NTPase cycles (25Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Fishel R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Sablin E.P. Fletterick R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 617-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The regulation of NDP→NTP exchange by “exchange factors” is one mechanism by which cells may control protein conformational transitions that are coupled to biological function. Such regulated control seems to enhance the efficiency of NTPases (28Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Examples of exchange factors and their cognate NTPases include guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for G-proteins, profilin for actin, actin for myosin, and β-tubulin for dynein and kinesin (25Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Fishel R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Sablin E.P. Fletterick R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 617-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence that links exchange factors with ATPases has been previously inferred from single-turnover ATP hydrolysis studies and/or comparison of protein-cofactor alterations of ADP/ATP binding (for example, see Refs. 29Kabani M. Beckerich J.M. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4677-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 30Kabani M. Beckerich J.M. Gaillardin C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6923-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that there are very few examples in which a direct examination of ADP→ATP exchange has been demonstrated (31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Cell. 2002; 10: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The human mitotic RecA homolog XRCC2 (x-ray sensitive cross complementation group-2) was identified based on its ability to complement the sensitivity of irs1 hamster cells to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (33Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical and molecular basis of XRCC2 function is unknown, these studies have suggested that it plays an important role in HRR (35Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tebbs R.S. Schild D. Tucker J.D. Shen M.R. Brookman K.W. Siciliano M.J. Walter C.A. Fan W. Narayana L.S. Zhou Z.Q. Adamson A.W. Sorensen K.J. Chen D.J. Jones N.J. Thompson L.H. Mol.

In this study, we demonstrate that hXRCC2 enhances ATP processing by hRAD51. Unlike other well-characterized RecA/RAD51 homologs, hXRCC2 does not seem to possess significant intrinsic DNA binding, ADP/ATP binding, or ATPase activities. We confirm and purify a stable hXRCC2-hRAD51D heterodimer (37Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14315-14320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). hRAD51D also does not seem to significantly bind ATP. We find that hRAD51D and the hXRCC2-hRAD51D heterodimer only interact with hRAD51 in the presence of the reaction intermediate mimetic ADP-aluminum fluoride. These results are consistent with a role for hRAD51D in localizing hXRCC2 to the active site of the hRAD51 NPF and a unique role for hXRCC2 in regulating hRAD51 activities. Protein Purification—hRAD51 and hRAD51(K133R) [K/R hRAD51] was purified as described previously (20Tombline G. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14417-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the C-terminal His6-tagged hXRCC2 was subcloned into pFast-Bac-Dual (BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression system; Invitrogen). The hRAD51D was inserted into the second expression site of pFast-Bac-Dual vector containing His6-hXRCC2. hXRCC2 and the hXRCC2-hRAD51D heterodimer were overexpressed in High Five insect cells (Invitrogen). Infected cells containing overexpressed hXRCC2 or hXRCC2-hRAD51D were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin)) followed by rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysates were prepared by thawing cells on ice, passed them through a 25-gauge needle, and clearing debris by ultracentrifugation. For hXRCC2 purification the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) column, washed with buffer A, and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 20 mm to 200 mm. Pooled fractions (fraction I) containing hXRCC2 were dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Fraction I was loaded on to Mono-S in tandem with a Heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The flow through (fraction II) was dialyzed against buffer C (5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Fraction II was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column in tandem with Polybuffer Exchanger (PBE) (Pharmacia). The PBE column was disconnected. The remaining hydroxyapatite column, including hXRCC2 protein, was washed and eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate from 5 to 200 mm. Pooled fractions (fraction III) were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Fraction III hXRCC2 was stable for several months. To purify the hXRCC2-hRAD51D heterodimer, the cleared cellular supernatant was loaded and eluted from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) column as above. Pooled fractions (fraction I) containing hXRCC2-hRAD51D were dialyzed against buffer B and loaded onto a tandem MonoS (Pharmacia)/Heparin-Agarose (Amersham Biosciences) column. The flow through (fraction II) was collected and loaded directly onto Hydroxyapatite (ceramic Micro-Prep; Bio-Rad) and eluted in buffer B with a 0–400 mm potassium phosphate gradient. Pooled fractions (fraction III) eluting at ∼200 mm potassium phosphate were collected and dialyzed against buffer B, loaded onto a Mono Q Column (Pharmacia), and eluted with a linear sodium chloride gradient (150–1000 mm). Pooled fractions (fraction IV) eluting at ∼250 mm NaCl were dialyzed against buffer B, frozen and stored at –80 °C. ATPase and ATPγS Binding—The ATPase activity was measured in 10 μl buffer X (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), plus 3 μm (nt or bp) ϕX174 ssDNA or ϕX174 dsDNA replicative form I (RFI) (unless otherwise specified) and the indicated concentration of ATP/[γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 400 μl of 10% activated charcoal (Sigma) containing 1 mm EDTA (20Tombline G. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14417-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The charcoal was pelleted and duplicate 50 μl aliquots of the supernatant were counted by the Cherenkov method. ATPγS binding was performed by incubating 1 μm hXRCC2 with the indicated amount of ATPγS for 30 min in buffer X supplemented with 2 mm Mg(OAc)2 and subsequently placed on ice for 20 min. 4 ml of ice-cold buffer X supplemented with 2 mm Mg(OAc)2 was added, and samples were filtered (HAWP filters; Millipore). The filters were dried and counted by liquid scintillation as described previously (31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift—The single-stranded oligonucleotide dT50 (oligo-dT50)was synthesized and 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled substrates were gel-purified and DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotide. 41 bp of oligonucleotide dsDNA was prepared as described previously (31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assay was performed in 20 μl of buffer X supplemented with 2 mm Mg(OAc)2 and contained labeled oligo-dT50 ssDNA or 41 bp of dsDNA, hRAD51, and indicated concentration of hXRCC2. Concentrations of adenosine nucleotides are indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min unless otherwise indicated. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 4% nondenaturing PAGE in 1× Tris-borate/EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize the products as described previously (31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). ADP Binding and ADP→ATP Exchange—ADP binding activity was measured in 10 μl of buffer X supplemented with 2 mm Mg(OAc)2,3 μm (nt or bp) ϕX174 ssDNA or ϕX174 dsDNA RFI (unless otherwise specified), the indicated concentration of ADP in Fig. 3 containing 2 μm [3H]ADP. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and placed on ice for 10 min. The solution was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (HAWP; Millipore) and washed with 4 ml of ice-cold buffer X supplemented with 2 mm Mg(OAc)2. Filters were air-dried, incubated overnight in scintillation fluid, and the amount of radioactivity retained on the filters was determined as described previously (31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The ADP→ATP exchange was measured in buffer X supplemented with 2 mm Mg(OAc)2 plus indicated ADP/[3H]ADP. 0.6 μm hRAD51 was pre-incubated with ADP and ϕX174 DNA at 37 °C for 15 min in a final volume of 10 μl. ADP→ATP exchange was initiated by adding the indicated concentration of hXRCC2, and 1 mm ATP in buffer X supplemented with 2 mm Mg(OAc)2 (final volume, 30 μl), and incubation was continued at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped at indicated times in Fig. 3 by dilution and immediate filtration through a nitrocellulose membrane (HAWP; Millipore). Radioactivity retained on the filters was quantitated as described previously (31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). UV Cross-linking—Reactions were performed as described previously (21Tombline G. Shim K.S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14426-14433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 μm hXRCC2 and 1 μm hRAD51 were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. in 10 μl of buffer X supplemented with 1 μm [α-32P]ATP (60 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 6 μm ϕX174 ssDNA and 2 mm Mg(OAc)2. The plate was irradiated at 254 nm in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) for 10 min. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and proteins were visualized by Coomassie stain. After digital imaging (Epson Perfection 636), the gel was dried and radiolabel visualized with a PhosphorImager. DNA Unwinding—DNA unwinding catalyzed by hRAD51 was examined using a modification of a method described previously (14Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Relaxed DNA (form IV) was prepared in batch by incubating 9 μg of ϕX174 replicative form I DNA (New England Biolabs) with 30 units of calf thymus topoisomerase I (Invitrogen) in 40 μl at 37 °C for 40 min. DNA unwinding assays were then initiated by addition of 2 μl (34 μm nucleotides) of batch prepared relaxed ϕX174 DNA, including topoisomerase I, to the indicated amount of hRAD51 and/or hXRCC2 in 20 μl of buffer X supplemented with 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 and 5 mm ATP or ADP at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were deproteinized by adding 2 μl of 10% SDS and 15 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. 2 μl of loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue/0.25% xylene cyanol and 50% glycerol) was added and 24 μl of the final sample volume subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel in Tris-acetate/EDTA buffer and followed by ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) staining. Strand Exchange—Reactions were performed as described previously (19Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with some modification. Linear ϕX174 dsDNA were prepared by digestion of ϕX174 RFI dsDNA with ApaL1. All the reaction steps were carried out at 37 °C. The reaction was assembled by mixing 6.0 μm hRAD51 (16 μl) and 30 μm (nt) circular ϕX174 ssDNA ± 1.0 μm hXRCC2 (2.6 μl) in 80 μl of final reaction volume (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2,2mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for Fig. 5B (otherwise in the presence of indicated amount of hXRCC2 for Fig. 5C). After 5 min of incubation, (NH4)2SO4 (final concentration, 100 mm) and linear duplex DNA (final concentration, 15 μm) were added sequentially. At the indicated times in Fig. 3, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn, the reaction was stopped and deproteinized by adding 3 μl of 10% SDS and 15 mg/ml proteinase K, incubated further for 20 min, and subjected to electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in Tris-acetate/EDTA buffer. GST-IVTT Interaction—Reactions were performed as described previously (39Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40Schmutte C. Sadoff M.M. Shim K.S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33011-33018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Full-length hRAD51 cDNA was subcloned into pGEX4T-2 (Pharmacia), which allows high expression of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The fusion product was expressed in Escherichia coli, and an extract was generated as described previously (40Schmutte C. Sadoff M.M. Shim K.S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33011-33018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cleared extract was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h under gentle continuous agitation and subsequently centrifuged. Each pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA or 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 10, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Under these conditions, ∼20–50 ng of protein was bound to 25 μl of beads. Lysates containing the unmodified pGEX vector were treated in the same way and used as a negative control. GST and GST-fusion protein binding to the beads was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). 35S-labeled hRAD51D was synthesized using in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) (TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega) and added to the GST fusion protein-bound beads in binding buffer. ADP, ATPγS, ATP, and NaAlF4 (1 mm) were added as indicated. The samples were gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then centrifuged, washed three times, as above, and the bound proteins were separated by PAGE and detected using a PhosphorImager system. No binding of the IVTT material to unmodified GST was detected under any of the conditions described previously (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation—Protein A beads (Sigma) suspended in buffer I (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm dithiothreitol) were exposed over night to hRAD51 polyclonal antibody. The Protein A beads were then washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 10, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and incubated at 4 °C for 1h with purified hRAD51 with hXRCC2 or the heterodimer hRAD51D/XRCC2 as indicated. ADP and NaAlF4 (1 mm) were added as indicated. After three washes with binding buffer, the bound proteins were subjected to PAGE and detected by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies to hRAD51 and XRCC2 (Novus). IAsys Biosensor DNA-protein Interaction—IAsys Biosensor studies were performed using an IAsys Auto+ unit (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK). A model oligonucleotide (oligo-dT50) with 5′-end biotinylated (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) was attached via streptavidin to the surface of an IAsys SPR cuvette pre-coated with biotin (Affinity Sensors). The kinetics of wild-type hRAD51 (250 nm) and K/R hRAD51 (250 nm) DNA binding ± hXRCC2 (250 nm) were measured in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Where indicated, 2.5 mm ADP, ATP, or ATPγS were added to the binding mixture. Representative binding isotherms are shown. Purification and Characterization of hXRCC2—To define its biochemical function, we have purified human XRCC2 (hXRCC2) to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1A).

DNA binding was not observed with different length DNA substrates (oligo-dT50 or ϕX174 and up to 30 μm ssDNA; data not shown), in the absence/presence of adenosine nucleotide (AMP, ADP, ATP, ATPγS; data not shown), or at hXRCC2 concentrations that were nearly 10-fold in excess of those required for complete binding by hRAD51 (Figs. 1B and 2A, lane 6; data not shown). We also evaluated the ability of hXRCC2 to bind and hydrolyze adenosine nucleotides. hXRCC2 displayed an extremely weak steady-state ATP hydrolysis (ATPase) activity (Fig. 1C; Table I) and ATPγS binding activity that seemed to be largely independent of DNA (Fig. 1D; Table I). hXRCC2 displayed negligible ATP binding and no effect on hRAD51 ATP binding in the presence of up to 1 mm nucleotide. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the hXRCC2 ATPase was ∼100-fold less than hRAD51 and 2500-fold less than RecA (Table I; Ref. 20Tombline G. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14417-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To confirm the ATPγS binding results we performed ATP-cross-linking studies (Fig. 1E). In agreement with previous studies, we observed strong cross-linking of ATP to hRAD51 (21Tombline G. Shim K.S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14426-14433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and negligible cross-linking of ATP to hXRCC2 (Fig. 1E). We were unable to detect significant ADP binding by hXRCC2 (Fig. 1F, ×; Table I). These results highlight the poor intrinsic DNA binding and ATP processing activities of hXRCC2 compared with hRAD51 or RecA (4Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Tachiiri S. Fukushima T. Sonoda E. Schild D.

Although their central role in membrane fusion is appreciated, little is known about the mechanisms by which individual SNARE proteins are targeted to specific organelles. Here we investigated functional domains in Sec22p that direct this SNARE protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to Golgi membranes, and into SNARE complexes with Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sed5p. A series of Sec22p deletion mutants were monitored in COPII budding assays, subcellular fractionation gradients, and SNARE complex immunoprecipitations. We found that the N-terminal “profilin-like” domain of Sec22p was required but not sufficient for COPII-dependent export of Sec22p from the ER. Interestingly, versions of Sec22p that lacked the N-terminal domain were assembled into ER/Golgi SNARE complexes. Analyses of Sec22p SNARE domain mutants revealed a second signal within the SNARE motif (between layers -4 and -1) that was required for efficient ER export. Other SNARE domain mutants that contained this signal were efficiently packaged into COPII vesicles but failed to assemble into SNARE complexes. Together these results indicated that SNARE complex formation is neither required nor sufficient for Sec22p packaging into COPII transport vesicles and subsequent targeting to the Golgi complex.

In eukaryotic cells, most intracellular membrane fusion processes are mediated by a related family of small proteins, called SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; m, mouse; MBP, maltose-binding protein; WT, wild-type (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors) proteins (1Söllner T.

SNAREs share a conserved heptad repeat coiled coil sequence, called the SNARE domain, that is typically adjacent to a C-terminal-membrane bound region (3Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E.

Specific sets of SNARE domains assemble into parallel four-helix bundles forming the stable core of a SNARE protein complex (4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T.

Current membrane fusion models theorize that cognate sets of SNARE proteins provided from opposing membranes assemble into “trans” SNARE complexes and drive membrane bilayers together during fusion (2Jahn R.

The assembly of cognate SNAREs has also been proposed to define the compartmental specificity of membrane fusion based on experiments showing that only specific combinations of SNARE proteins catalyze in vitro fusion when reconstituted into synthetic proteoliposomes (8McNew J.A.

Cell Res. 1999; 247: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These and other observations suggest that additional spatial and temporal determinants in SNARE proteins contribute to the specificity of the membrane fusion (2Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of SNARE proteins display significant diversity and appear to govern SNARE protein activity and distribution. For example, the N-terminal domain of the syntaxin-like SNARE proteins, such as neuronal syntaxin1 and yeast Sso1p, fold into three-helix bundles and inhibit SNARE pairing when folded back against their SNARE domains (17Fernandez I.

The structure of the N-terminal domain of a non-syntaxin yeast SNARE, Ykt6p, resembles the overall fold of the actin regulatory protein, profilin. In vitro studies (21Tochio H. Tsui M.M. Banfield D.K. Zhang M. Science. 2001; 293: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reveal that the Ykt6p N-terminal domain interacts with the Ykt6p SNARE domain and influences the specificity of SNARE pairing and the kinetics of SNARE complex formation. Further studies (22Hasegawa H. Zinsser S. Rhee Y. Vik-Mo E.O. Davandger S. Hay J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 698-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) of mammalian Ykt6 demonstrate that this N-terminal domain also acts in directing Ykt6 to a specialized subcellular location. The N terminus of mouse Sec22b (mSec22b) also contains a profilin-like domain that is conserved among different Sec22 species. Unlike the syntaxin-related SNARE proteins and Ykt6p, the mSec22b N-terminal domain does not appear to interact with its SNARE domain and has no effect on the rate of SNARE complex assembly in vitro (23Gonzalez L.C. Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24203-24211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sec22p cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. This localization permits Sec22p to act in both anterograde- and retrograde-directed fusion events in transport between these compartments (14Liu Y. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The assembly of Sec22p into SNARE complexes with Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sed5p catalyzes anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi (2Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). In this report, we explore the features in yeast Sec22p that influence its localization and assembly into SNARE complexes. Our studies demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of Sec22p is required for targeting Sec22p to the Golgi complex but has no apparent effect on ER/Golgi SNARE complex assembly. As expected, the SNARE domain of Sec22p is critical for Sec22p SNARE interactions; however, a smaller region of the SNARE domain unexpectedly contributes to Sec22p trafficking. Taken together, our data indicate that the ER exit of Sec22p is independent of assembly into SNARE complexes. Plasmid Construction—To generate plasmid pRS313-SEC22, the SEC22 coding sequence with ∼700 bp of flanking upstream and ∼180 bp of downstream sequence was excised from YEP511-SLY2/SEC22 (26Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) with BamHI and EcoRV and ligated into the single copy vector pRS313 (27Sikorski P. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate N-terminal truncation mutants, point mutations creating an EcoRI site at +6 (pRS313-SEC22E) and an MfeI site at +210 (pRS313-SEC22EM1) or +303 (pRS313-SEC22EM2) were introduced into pRS313-SEC22 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The truncation constructs were made by excision of the EcoRI/MfeI fragments followed by ligation to generate pRS313-SEC22ΔN1 and pRS313-SEC22ΔN2. The restriction sites BamHI and EcoRV were used to subclone the coding and flanking sequences of the SEC22 mutants into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pRS423 (28Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) to produce pRS423-SEC22ΔN1 and pRS423-SEC22ΔN2. To obtain plasmid pRS313-MBP-SEC22, the maltose-binding protein (MBP) sequence was amplified by PCR with flanking EcoRI sites from pRC1047 (29Calero M. Winand N.J. Collins R.N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and inserted into the EcoRI site at +6 on pRS313-SEC22E. To construct SNARE domain deletion mutants, an EcoRI site was introduced at +429 or +447, and an MfeI site was introduced at +489 or +555 into pRS313-SEC22. The specific regions were removed by EcoRI/MfeI, digestion and the plasmids were religated to yield pRS313-SEC22ΔS, pRS313-SEC22ΔS1, and pRS313-SEC22ΔS2. The pRS313-SEC22ΔS3 construct was made by oligonucleotide-directed deletion of nucleotides from +430 to +459 using the QuikChange method. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strains CBY740 (MATα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3) and CBY773 (MATα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 sec22Δ::KAN) were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Wild-type and mutant SEC22 constructs on pRS313 or pRS423 plasmids were transformed into CBY740 or CBY773. Yeast strains were grown overnight in selective medium (0.67% nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose) with the required supplements to maintain selective pressure on strains carrying plasmids and then grown in rich medium (1% Bactoyeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) to log phase (∼A600 0.7) before preparation of membranes. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Antibodies directed against Sec61p, Bos1p, Bet1p, and Sed5p have been described previously (25Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Erv25p (30Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have been published. Western blots were developed using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). For densitometric analysis, films were scanned and plotted using NIH Image 1.52. Subcellular Fractionation—Membrane organelles prepared from cell lysates were resolved on 18–60% sucrose density gradients (32Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) with modifications (31Otte S. Belden W.J. Heidtman M. Liu J. Jensen O.N. Barlowe C. J.

Gradient fractions were collected and diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immunoblotted for Sec61p (ER marker), Och1p (Golgi marker), and Sec22p. Relative levels of specific proteins in each fraction were quantified by densitometric scanning of immunoblots. Immunoprecipitations—Native immunoprecipitation of Bos1p from detergent-solubilized membranes was performed as described by Liu and Barlowe (14Liu Y. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Anti-Sec22p antibodies were also used to immunoprecipitate the ER/Golgi SNARE complexes. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted for Sec22p, Bos1p, Sed5p, Bet1p, and Erv25p. In Vitro Vesicle Budding Assay—Yeast semi-intact cells were prepared for in vitro budding assays. Analytical scale in vitro budding reactions in the absence or presence of purified COPII proteins (Sar1p, Sec13/31p complex, and Sec23/24p complex) were as described previously (34Barlowe C. Orci L.

The N-terminal Domain of Yeast Sec22p Is Required for Incorporation into COPII-coated Vesicles—Sec22p localizes to membranes of the ER and early Golgi compartments. Genetic and biochemical experiments indicate that Sec22p function is required directly in anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi by forming a SNARE complex with Sed5p, Bos1p, and Bet1p (8McNew J.A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 927-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Unlike other ER/Golgi SNAREs required for anterograde transport, Sec22p is dispensable for growth, because another SNARE protein, Ykt6p, functionally substitutes for Sec22p in sec22Δ strains (14Liu Y. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The sec22Δ allele results in slow growth and temperature sensitivity (26Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Sec22p also functions in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER (24Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) forming a complex with the ER-localized SNARE proteins Ufe1p, Sec20p (40Lewis M.J. Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3017-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and Use1p/Slt1p (41Dilcher M. Veith B. Chidambaram S. Hartmann E. Schmitt H.D. von Mollard G.F.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and COPI-coated (24Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) transport vesicles. Sec22p consists of an N-terminal profilin-like domain followed by a conserved SNARE domain and a C-terminal transmembrane segment (Fig. 1). The function of the Sec22p N-terminal domain remains unknown, although it has been proposed to function in subcellular localization (2Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) and/or to play a regulatory role in SNARE complex assembly (23Gonzalez L.C. Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24203-24211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To explore the role of this domain in Sec22p trafficking and SNARE protein interactions, we constructed a series of Sec22p N-terminal mutants for study. Structure-based sequence alignments show that the Sec22p N-terminal domain resembles its mouse homolog mSec22b consisting of mixed α-helical and β-sheet folds (23Gonzalez L.C. Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24203-24211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, we constructed two N-terminal truncations, SEC22ΔN1 and SEC22ΔN2, deleting beyond the first and second α-helical segments of the N-terminal domain, respectively. We also generated an MBP-SEC22 fusion protein by appending a 40-kDa MBP tag on the N terminus of Sec22p (Fig. 1). These constructs were introduced into sec22Δ cells on CEN vectors (pRS313) for single copy expression or 2-μm vectors (pRS423) for multicopy expression. As shown in Fig. 2, control SEC22 on a CEN plasmid was expressed in sec22Δ cells at a level equal to the wild-type. The N-terminal Sec22p mutants were expressed at their expected sizes although at apparently reduced levels compared with the wild-type protein. These expression levels were increased when the mutants were expressed from 2 μm vectors.Fig. 2Expression levels of Sec22p N-terminal truncation mutants. An immunoblot to monitor the expression of Sec22p in the semi-intact cells from WT (CBY740), sec22Δ (CBY773), and sec22Δ strains expressing the indicated N-terminal mutants is shown. Semiintact cells were diluted in sample buffer and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot for Sec22p and Erv25p (loading control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sec22p as well as other ER/Golgi SNARE proteins are efficiently packaged into COPII transport vesicles (25Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of the N-terminal mutations on the COPII packaging efficiency of Sec22p. For these studies, in vitro vesicle budding reactions were performed from semi-intact yeast cell membranes supplied with purified COPII subunits (Fig. 3). As expected, wild-type Sec22p was sorted efficiently into COPII vesicles as was the ER vesicle protein Erv25p, whereas Sec61p, an ER resident protein, was excluded (30Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of the N-terminal mutants, Sec22pΔN1, Sec22pΔN2, or MBP-Sec22p were packaged into COPII-coated vesicles. Even when their protein levels were increased by expression from 2μm plasmids, the two N-terminal truncation mutant proteins Sec22pΔN1 and Sec22pΔN2 failed to sort into COPII vesicles. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain of Sec22p is required for its export from the ER via COPII-coated vesicles. Sec22p N-terminal Truncation Mutants Accumulate in the ER—In wild-type cells, Sec22p is incorporated into COPII-coated vesicles and localizes to ER and Golgi compartments (25Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the Sec22p N-terminal mutants were not efficiently packaged into COPII transport vesicles, we speculated that their subcellular distribution would be different compared with wild-type Sec22p. To examine the localization of these mutant proteins, we employed a subcellular fractionation procedure to resolve ER and Golgi compartments on sucrose gradients (31Otte S. Belden W.J. Heidtman M. Liu J. Jensen O.N. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 33Powers J. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1209-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The resolution of ER and Golgi compartments with this method was confirmed by monitoring the Golgi-localized marker Och1p, which peaked in fractions that were separated from the ER marker, Sec61p. Wild-type Sec22p displayed a distribution between ER and Golgi membranes. In contrast, the N-terminal mutants, Sec22pΔN1 and MBP-Sec22p, were shifted to Sec61p-containing fractions indicating that these N-terminal mutants had accumulated in the ER (Fig. 4). Based on the COPII-budding and subcellular fractionation data, we conclude that the N-terminal domain of Sec22p is required for efficient packaging into COPII-coated vesicles and for Golgi localization. Thus, one role for the N-terminal domain is to direct trafficking of Sec22p into ER-derived transport vesicles. Sec22p N-terminal Domain Mutants Assemble into ER/Golgi SNARE Complexes in Vivo—We next tested whether these N-terminal truncations interfered with the assembly of Sec22p into ER/Golgi SNARE complexes that operate in anterograde transport. Previously, we showed (14Liu Y. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that a set of ER/Golgi SNARE proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Bos1p from detergent-solubilized membranes. Using this technique, Bos1p or Sec22p was immunoprecipitated from wild-type and SEC22 N-terminal mutant strains, and associated SNARE proteins were detected by immunoblot (Fig. 5). Bet1p, Sec22p, and Sed5p co-precipitated with Bos1p in wild-type (sec22Δ + SEC22 WT) membranes. The same SNARE interactions were observed in immunoprecipitations using anti-Sec22p antibodies. Surprisingly, the N-terminal truncation mutants, Sec22pΔN1 and Sec22pΔN2, were also detected in ER/Golgi SNARE complexes when anti-Bos1p antibodies. Similarly, Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sed5p were immunoprecipitated from the N-terminal truncation strains when anti-Sec22p antibodies were used. These results indicate that the Sec22p N-terminal domain is not required for SNARE complex formation. Furthermore, because Sec22pΔN1 and Sec22pΔN2 were localized to the ER, a significant fraction of ER/Golgi SNARE complexes must also be present in the ER. The amounts of Sec22pΔN1 and Sec22pΔN2 in these SNARE complex immunoprecipitations were lower than with wild-type Sec22p probably due to lower expression levels of the N-terminal truncation mutants (Figs. 2 and 5). In agreement with this possibility, increased expression of Sec22pΔN1 and Sec22pΔN2 from 2μm plasmids resulted in increased amounts of each N-terminal mutant protein associated with Bos1p. A corresponding increase in the levels of Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sed5p associated with these N-terminal deletion mutants was also observed when the overexpressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sec22p antibodies (Fig. 5). Notably, the amount of Sec22p containing ER/Golgi SNARE complexes did not exceed the wild-type level even when N-terminal deletion mutants were overexpressed. Therefore it seems unlikely that the N-terminal domain of Sec22p negatively regulates SNARE domain interactions with other ER/Golgi SNARE proteins, because the N-terminal deletions would be expected to alleviate this negative effect and increase Sec22p assembly into SNARE complexes. Instead, these results suggest that the N-terminal domain of Sec22p does not regulate SNARE complex assembly and is not necessary for their formation. Because the N-terminal mutants of Sec22p still formed ER/Golgi SNARE complexes, we speculated that these mutant proteins would at least partially fulfill the function of Sec22p in vivo. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the growth phenotypes of sec22Δ strains that expressed these individual mutants. Dilution series of these strains were plated and incubated at 30 and 37 °C to observe thermosensitive growth defects (Fig. 6). As expected, the sec22Δ strain grew at a rate comparable with the wild type at 30 °C but displayed a reduced growth rate at 37 °C. When SEC22 on a CEN plasmid was introduced into the sec22Δ strain, wild-type growth rates were observed at both temperatures. Expression of the N-terminal mutants, SEC22ΔN1, SEC22ΔN2, and MBP-SEC22, from CEN plasmids partially complemented the growth defect of sec22Δ at 37 °C. Increased complementation was observed when SEC22ΔN1 and SEC22ΔN2 were overexpressed from 2 μm plasmids. These findings indicate that the Sec22p N-terminal truncation mutants are functional and assemble into SNARE complexes in vivo, although their steady state distribution is altered. We speculate that a small fraction of the N-terminal Sec22p mutants continue to cycle between ER and Golgi compartments in a “bulk flow” manner and function in membrane fusion events. Overexpression of the mutants would be expected to increase their concentration on ER–Golgi membranes and probably explains the increased level of complementation and SNARE pairing we observe when 2-μm versions are used. Residues within the SNARE Motif Contribute to Sec22p Trafficking—Having established a role for the N-terminal domain of Sec22p in trafficking, we next investigated the function of the Sec22p SNARE domain in localization and activity. We initially constructed three different SNARE domain truncation mutants. Sec22pΔS removes most of the SNARE domain from the -4 to +8 layers. Sec22pΔS1 and Sec22pΔS2 partially delete the SNARE domain from layers -2 to +2 and +2 to +8, respectively (Fig. 1). These mutant proteins were expressed in wild type and sec22Δ backgrounds from CEN plasmids, and each was readily detected with anti-Sec22p antibodies (Fig. 7). An increased expression level of the SNARE domain mutant proteins was observed in the wild-type background compared with the sec22Δ background, indicating that wild-type Sec22p somehow influences expression of these mutants. In vitro budding reactions were performed to monitor the packaging efficiency of each of the SNARE domain mutants into COPII vesicles. Sec22pΔS incorporation into COPII-coated vesicles was not detected when expressed in either the wild-type or sec22Δ background (Fig. 8A). However, Sec22pΔS1 and Sec22pΔS2 were both sorted into COPII vesicles, although the packaging efficiency of Sec22pΔS1 was greatly diminished while Sec22pΔS2 was packaged near wild-type levels (Fig. 8, B and C). Similar results were observed when the COPII packaging of Sec22pΔS1 and Sec22pΔS2 was monitored in a sec22Δ background (Fig. 8, B and C). These results indicate that the N-terminal domain, though required, is not sufficient for optimal packaging of Sec22p into COPII vesicles. Additional determinants within the SNARE domain appear to be required for efficient COPII-dependent export of Sec22p from the ER.Fig. 8Packaging of Sec22p SNARE domain mutants into CO-PII-coated vesicles.In vitro budding reactions from sec22Δ + SEC22ΔS and WT + SEC22ΔS (A), sec22Δ + SEC22ΔS1 and WT + SEC22ΔS1 (B), and sec22Δ + SEC22ΔS2 and WT + SEC22ΔS2 strains (C).

They are both modular proteins composed of independently folded domains (modules) that are arranged in linear fashion. Fibronectin is a covalent dimer and tenascin is a hexamer. The site on tenascin to which fibronectin binds has been localized to type III modules 3–5. In this study we use surface plasmon resonance to examine the interaction between various fragments of fibronectin and tenascin to further characterize and localize the binding sites. We found that tenascin fragments that contain type III modules 3–5 bind primarily to the N-terminal 29-kDa hep-1/fib-1 domain, which contains the first five type I modules of fibronectin. The dissociation constant, Kd, is ≈1 μm. The binding site on fibronectin appears to be cryptic in the whole molecule in solution but is exposed on the proteolytic fragments and probably when fibronectin is in the extended conformation.

Tenascin-C (TN) 1The abbreviations used are: TN, tenascin-C; FN, fibronectin; TN1–5, FN-III domains 1–5 of tenascin-C. 1The abbreviations used are: TN, tenascin-C; FN, fibronectin; TN1–5, FN-III domains 1–5 of tenascin-C. and fibronectin (FN) are glycoprotein components of the extracellular matrix that interact with each other and with other matrix molecules including collagen and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Both proteins are constructed from independently folded domains arranged in tandem to produce elongated structures with limited flexibility (dimeric in the case of FN and hexameric in the case of TN). FN is processed into an insoluble fibrillar matrix to which TN binds either directly or indirectly via proteoglycans that bridge the two proteins (1Chung C.Y. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins contain sites that are recognized by cell surface receptors whose occupation allows the extracellular matrix to regulate the adhesion, differentiation, growth, and migration of cells. Both proteins are subject to alternative splicing so that certain modules are differentially expressed during various stages of development and again during wound healing and tumorigenesis. TN is known to interfere with the cell adhesive function of FN either by binding to FN and restricting access of its integrin binding sites (2Lightner V.A. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 263-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by binding to cell receptors and altering their responsiveness to FN (3Prieto A.L. Andersson-Fisone C. Crossin K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 663-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 4Fischer D. Brown-Ludi M. Schulthess T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potential for these proteins to interact in vitro was first inferred from the co-localization of TN on FN fibrils in tissue culture (5Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and in amphibian embryos (6Riou J.-F. Shi D.L. Chiquet M. Boucaut J.C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was reported that TN could bind to surfaces coated with FN or its cell-binding fragment but not those coated with a gelatin-binding fragment (7Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Kalla P. Pearson C.A. Beck K. Chiquet M. Cell. 1988; 53: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The small alternative splice variant of TN bound better than the large one, and the binding was sensitive to high ionic strength and low concentrations of urea (7Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Kalla P. Pearson C.A. Beck K. Chiquet M. Cell. 1988; 53: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). FN and TN secreted into cell culture medium did not appear to form a complex in fluid phase (8Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, Chung et al. (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that TN sedimented faster in a glycerol gradient if plasma FN was present throughout, indicating a fluid phase association. This effect could be attenuated by including certain recombinant fragments of TN in the gradient, allowing the binding site on TN to be localized to a region near the third type III module (TN3), which by itself showed an effect. This was confirmed by solid phase binding measurements in which TN3-containing fragments were able to compete with TN for binding to FN-coated plastic wells. Fragment TN3–5 (the third through the fifth FN-III domains) was more potent than TN3 alone, suggesting that multiple modules are required for full affinity. At the same time, the location of the TN binding site within FN has been uncertain. As mentioned above, TN was reported to bind to surfaces coated with the cell-binding fragment of FN but not with the gelatin-binding fragment (7Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Kalla P. Pearson C.A. Beck K. Chiquet M. Cell. 1988; 53: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). More recently, Huang et al. (18Huang W. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Moyano J.V. Garcia-Pardo A. Orend G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8586-8594PubMed Google Scholar) reported an interaction of TN with the hep-2 region of FN localized to the 13th type III module. Neither study examined fragments from the 29-kDa N- or C-terminal regions of FN. Thus additional studies were needed to fully understand the nature of this interaction, to determine its affinity, and to more precisely define the location of the binding site(s) within FN. Fibronectin was prepared as described (10Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Fragments of fibronectin (except the 70-kDa N-terminal fragment) were prepared as described (11Ingham K.C. Brew S. Huff S. Litvinovich S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1718-1724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Tenascin fragments were prepared by bacterial expression and purified as described (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Swine skin gelatin and sodium heparin (porcine intestinal mucosal) were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant fragments of tenascin were prepared as described (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 280 nm corrected for light scattering was measured to calculate the concentration of the proteins using published extinction coefficients (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Broekelmann T.J. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11901-11907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments to be coupled to Biacore CM5 chips were dialyzed against the indicated coupling buffers, and fragments to be used as analytes were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20 (HBS-EP). Surface plasmon resonance was used to detect interaction between recombinant tenascin fragments and fibronectin and its fragments with a Biacore 3000 instrument. Ligands were coupled to CM5 sensor chips with the wizard program for amine coupling chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Excess sites were blocked with ethanolamine. TN1–8 and TN1–5 in 10 mm acetate, pH 4, were coupled to the flow paths of a CM5 sensor chip, each at levels of ∼1000 resonance units. The 29- and 70-kDa N-terminal fragments of fibronectin were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip in 10 mm maleate, pH 6, and 10 mm acetate, pH 4, respectively, at levels of ∼2300 resonance units. Fibronectin in 10 mm acetate, pH 4.5, and swine skin gelatin (Sigma) in 10 mm borate, pH 8.5, were coupled to CM5 chips at ∼3000 and 400 resonance units, respectively. A blank flow path lacking protein was derivatized with ethanolamine on each chip. All sensorgrams were corrected by subtracting the background runs of analytes over this flow path from corresponding runs of analytes over flow paths derivatized with ligands. The indicated concentrations of analytes in HBS-EP, which was also used as the running buffer, were injected at 30 μl/min for 3 min. After a 2.5-min wash with HBS-EP, the flow paths were regenerated with 6 m urea in HBS-EP containing 1 m NaCl. Exposure to 6 m urea did not irreversibly affect the ability of immobilized proteins to bind analytes as duplicate runs gave essentially identical results, and the surfaces retained their binding properties over repeated use. Using Biacore evaluation software the data were globally fit to the model for simple 1:1 interaction to obtain values for the forward (ka) and reverse (kd) reactions. The equilibrium dissociation constant was then calculated as Kd = kd/ka. Equilibrium binding was determined by plotting Reqversus concentration (C) and fitting the data to the steady state model. Req=Rmax×Kd×C/(1+Kd×C) Fig. 1 illustrates the modular composition of TN and FN and shows the fragments that were used in this study. The binding site for FN on TN was previously localized to type III modules 3–5 (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas the binding site for TN on FN was the main subject of the present investigation. Three different recombinant fragments containing various type III modules of TN were immobilized on a sensor chip and used to test a battery of FN fragments spanning almost the entire polypeptide chain. As shown in Fig. 2, the only fragments that gave a significant response were the N-terminal 70-kDa Fib-1/gelatin-binding fragment and 29k-Da Fib-1 fragments (the latter is contained within the former). The 42-kDa gelatin-binding fragment that constitutes the other portion of the 70-kDa fragment failed to bind as did the central 110-kDa cell binding fragment, the 40-kDa hep-2 fragment, and the C-terminal 20-kDa fib-2 fragment. These results suggest that the primary binding site is located within the first five type I modules of FN that constitute the 29-kDa fragment.Fig. 2Binding of FN and its fragments to immobilized TN fragments at 25 °C, pH 7.4, in HBS-EP. Proteins were applied at a concentration of 1 μm and a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Binding was detected by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 3000 instrument as described under “Methods and Materials.” Only the N-terminal 70- and 29-kDa fragments show a significant response.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) FN itself gave a relatively small response. This was surprising because the surface plasmon resonance signal tends to be proportional to the molecular weight of the substance that binds. Because FN was applied at the same concentration as all of the fragments (1 μm), this means that much less FN is bound to the surface, implying a significantly lower affinity. Note that the response with the 70-kDa fragment was also lower than that of the 29-kDa fragment. This pattern suggests that the binding site is largely masked in the intact protein and partially masked in the 70-kDa fragment. Next we compared a collection of TN fragments for binding to the immobilized 29- and 70-kDa fragments of FN. As shown in Fig. 3A, all TN fragments that contain FN-III modules 3–5 gave a good response with the fragment of 29-kDa FN; those lacking these modules gave a poor response. Module TN3 by itself gave a slight response, suggesting that it may participate but that it needs additional modules 4 and/or 5 for strong binding. Again, the response of the 70-kDa fragment (Fig. 3B) was consistently weaker than that on the 29-kDa fragment, and the response of the 42-kDa fragment (not shown) was negligible. FN was immobilized on the biosensor surface and tested for binding to TN fragments. Under conditions where gelatin gave a strong response, TN1–5 and TN1–8 gave a poor response (Fig. 4A). Likewise, when fluid phase FN was tested on immobilized TN1–5 and TN1–8, very little response was obtained under conditions where it gave a strong response on immobilized gelatin (Fig. 4B). The same was true on TN3–5 (not shown). These results support the above suggestion that the TN binding site is cryptic in whole FN and becomes more accessible after proteolysis. They also illustrate that the FN used in this study was functional, at least in terms of gelatin binding. An additional experiment was conducted to determine whether the binding of FN to gelatin, which occurs through the 42-kDa region, would render the TN-binding site in the adjacent 29-kDa region more accessible. Whole FN was first loaded onto a gelatin surface, and the solvent was then switched to buffer alone to initiate slow dissociation. After a few seconds, the solvent was switched again to buffer containing a TN fragment. There was no increase in the resonance signal, indicating that the binding of FN to gelatin does not expose the TN-binding site (data not shown). Likewise, heparin when added to TN fragments had little or no effect on their binding to immobilized 29-kDa or 70-kDa fragments, and heparin by itself did not appear to bind to either FN fragment, i.e. it gave no plasmon resonance signal. Fig. 5 presents a typical example of the concentration dependence of binding of the N-terminal 29-kDa fragment of FN to immobilized TN1–5. The data were fit globally to a Langmuir binding isotherm to obtain an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.85 μm. Although the fit of the kinetics is poor (especially in the region of dissociation), the concentration dependence of the equilibrium plateau level is well reproduced by the global fit. It is apparent that the bulk of the binding and dissociation occur at too high of a rate for meaningful analysis of the kinetics. However, the plateau values still provide a valid measure of the relative concentration of analyte bound at equilibrium. Therefore, we plotted the plateau values from these and other titrations as a function of concentration and fit the data to the binding isotherm (Fig. 6). The Kd values for the binding of the 70-kDa fragment to TN fragments TN1–8 and TN1–5 were identical at 1.9 μm. The values for the 29-kDa fragment were only slightly smaller (0.9 and 1.1 μm) in good agreement with the value of 0.85 μm obtained from the global fit in Fig. 4.Fig. 6Steady state binding results for interaction of FN 29-kDa and 70-kDa fragments with fragments of TN (squares, TN1–5; triangles, TN1–8). Equilibrium values of the surface plasmon resonance response (e.g. plateaus in Fig. 5) were plotted and fit to a 1:1 binding isotherm (solid lines). The resulting Kd values are given on the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All of the binding experiments shown above were done at a NaCl concentration of 0.15 m. Divalent cations, calcium and magnesium, at concentrations of 1 mm had no significant effect on the interaction with 29-kDa fragments, and they did not disclose the cryptic binding site in FN (not shown). When the NaCl concentration was increased to 0.5 m, no binding was detected with any of the fragment combinations (not shown), suggesting that the interaction is dominated by electrostatic forces. Our results show that the primary TN-binding site on FN is located in the N-terminal 29-kDa region, which is composed of the first five type I modules. The Kd for the interaction is ∼1 μm. Additional binding sites have been reported in other regions of FN, namely the central cell binding region (7Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Kalla P. Pearson C.A. Beck K. Chiquet M. Cell. 1988; 53: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and the hep-2 region (18Huang W. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Moyano J.V. Garcia-Pardo A. Orend G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8586-8594PubMed Google Scholar). However, fragments containing those regions were inactive in our assays. We note that neither study (7Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Kalla P. Pearson C.A. Beck K. Chiquet M. Cell. 1988; 53: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 18Huang W. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Moyano J.V. Garcia-Pardo A. Orend G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8586-8594PubMed Google Scholar) tested the 29-kDa N-terminal fragment of FN, which is most active in our assays, so it is not known if this would be active in their systems. Both studies utilized whole TN (whereas we used recombinant TN segments) raising the possibility of an additional binding site that could account for the discrepancy. In the end, however, we cannot explain why Huang et al. (18Huang W. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Moyano J.V. Garcia-Pardo A. Orend G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8586-8594PubMed Google Scholar) found significant binding to the hep-2 segment of FN, whereas we found negligible binding to this segment. Among the various TN fragments tested, only those containing type III modules 3–5 were able to bind. This is consistent with previous studies that localized the FN-binding site to this region of TN (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the interaction to high salt suggests that electrostatic effects play a major role. Both domains have a large number of charged surface residues that could mediate the interaction. The 29-kDa fragment binds to heparin-Sepharose, which is also an electrostatic interaction. However, it binds poorly to heparin in the fluid phase, and heparin binds poorly to the immobilized 29-kDa fragment (13Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Atha D.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272 (S. B.S. A.): 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present study we also failed to observe a plasmon resonance signal when heparin was flowed over a Biacore chip to which the 29-kDa fragment was coupled, and the presence of heparin did not affect the binding of TN fragments to that chip. These data consistently indicate that binding of heparin to the 29-kDa fragment is very weak. The TN-binding site appears to be cryptic in FN because whole FN when coupled to the Biacore chip failed to bind any of the TN fragments. Moreover, FN in solution failed to bind to immobilized TN fragments. FN in solution in physiological salt is known to adopt a compact conformation in which the two subunits of the dimer are thought to be folded upon each other (14Johnson K.J. Sage H. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15473-15479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the TN binding site may be buried in the compact conformation. This could explain the apparent high affinity interaction observed between whole TN and FN when the latter was adsorbed to microtitre wells (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported a change in FN conformation upon binding to plastic (15Narasimhan C. Lai C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5041-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Ugarova T.P. Zamarron C. Veklich Y. Bowditch R.D. Ginsberg M.H. Weisel J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and it is possible that this change exposes the cryptic TN-binding site as well as others. TN did appear to interact with soluble FN when sedimented through a glycerol density gradient (9Chung C.Y. Zardi L. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, glycerol has been shown to favor the extended conformation of FN (17Rocco M. Carson M. Hantgan R. McDonagh J. Hermans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14545-14549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may have exposed the TN-binding site. We note in addition that this previous solution phase assay involved dimeric FN and hexameric TN, giving the possibility of enhanced apparent affinity through multivalent binding. The binding reaction measured here is likely to be relevant in tissues where FN exists in a stretched fibrillar form that is thought to expose other cryptic binding sites (19Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). TN concentrations in tissues may reach 0.2–2.0 mg/ml (21Lightner V.A. Slemp C.A. Erickson H.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which corresponds to the low μm range. Thus, if the site is exposed, significant interaction could be expected based on the Kd values reported here. Moreover, because TN is hexameric, it may have substantially enhanced binding through multivalent attachment to two or more FN molecules in FN matrix fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2009887995,"We have shown previously that hyperinsulinemia inhibits interferon-α-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-induced serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. Here we report that chronic insulin and high glucose synergistically inhibit interleukin (IL)-4-dependent activation of PI3-kinase in macrophages via the mTOR pathway. Resident peritoneal macrophages (PerMΦs) from diabetic (db/db) mice showed a 44% reduction in IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase activity stimulated by IL-4 compared with PerMΦs from heterozygote (db/+) control mice. IRS-2 from db/db mouse PerMΦs also showed a 78% increase in Ser/Thr-Pro motif phosphorylation without a difference in IRS-2 mass. To investigate the mechanism of this PI3-kinase inhibition, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-matured U937 cells were treated chronically with insulin (1 nm, 18 h) and high glucose (4.5 g/liter, 48 h). In these cells, IL-4-stimulated IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase activity was reduced by 37.5%. Importantly, chronic insulin or high glucose alone did not impact IL-4-activated IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase. Chronic insulin + high glucose did reduce IL-4-dependent IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and p85 association by 54 and 37%, respectively, but did not effect IL-4-activated JAK/STAT signaling. When IRS-2 Ser/Thr-Pro motif phosphorylation was examined, chronic insulin + high glucose resulted in a 92% increase in IRS-2 Ser/Thr-Pro motif phosphorylation without a change in IRS-2 mass. Pretreatment of matured U937 cells with rapamycin blocked chronic insulin + high glucose-dependent IRS-2 Ser/Thr-Pro motif phosphorylation and restored IL-4-dependent IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase activity. Taken together these results indicate that IRS-2-dependent IL-4 signaling in macrophages is impaired in models of type 2 diabetes mellitus through a mechanism that relies on insulin/glucose-dependent Ser/Thr-Pro motif serine phosphorylation mediated by the mTOR pathway.

We have shown that chronic insulin in the presence of high glucose leads to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 through an mTOR-dependent mechanism and that this renders IRS-1 a poorer substrate for JAK1 (18Hartman M.E. Villela-Bach M. Chen J. Freund G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that serine phosphorylation targets IRS-1 for proteasome-dependent degradation in L6 muscle cells (19O'Connor J.C. Freund G.G. Metabolism. 2003; 52: 666-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, these same mechanisms have not been investigated in relation to IRS-2-dependent cytokine signaling. IRS-2 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and appears, in IRS-1 knock-out mice, to duplicate many of the functions of IRS-1 (20Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E.

IRS-2 knock-out studies in mice have shown that IRS-2 is important for neuroendocrine function, and a lack of IRS-2 leads to enhanced neointima formation (26Withers D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Kubota T. Kubota N. Moroi M. Terauchi Y. Kobayashi T. Kamata K. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Namiki A. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Yamaguchi T. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3073-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IRS-2 is necessary for IL-4-induced proliferation and differentiation of T cells (28Wurster A.L. Withers D.J. Uchida T. White M.F. Grusby M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment shows a high degree of homology between IRS-1 and IRS-2, including the presence of two Src homology 2 domain binding sites for the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase (20Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). As with IRS-1, serine phosphorylation appears to regulate IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation negatively. Removal of basal serine phosphorylation of IRS-2 increases IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2, and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-2 on serine residues impairs insulin receptor-dependent IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (29Greene M.W. Garofalo R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7082-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-2 induced by either TNF-α or prolonged insulin exposure results in a reduced ability of IRS-2 to interact with the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor (15Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E. Kanety H. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The IL-4 receptor is expressed ubiquitously on monocytes and macrophages (30Ohara J. Paul W.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Wagteveld A.J. van Zanten A.K. Esselink M.T. Halie M.R. Vellenga E. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 782-788PubMed Google Scholar), and, as with other class I cytokine receptors (hematopoietin receptor family), the IL-4 receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity and requires receptor-associated kinases for initiation of intracellular signaling (32Yin T. Tsang M.L. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26614-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19136-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IL-4 to its receptor leads to JAK1 and JAK3 activation. One or both of these tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the IL-4α chain on residues Tyr497, Tyr575, Tyr603, Tyr631, and Tyr713. Tyr497 is within the insulin/IL-4 receptor motif and is responsible for IRS-2 recruitment (34Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). IL-4 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine and leads to an “alternative activation phenotype” in macrophages. This IL-4-dependent macrophage activation results in an absence of nitric oxide production, generation of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist, and suppressive activity directed toward T cells (35Mosser D.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Recently, subacute chronic inflammation (36Pradhan A.D. Manson J.E. Rifai N. Buring J.E. Ridker P.M. JAMA. 2001; 286: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar, 37Greaves D.R. Gordon S. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 180-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) has been identified as a significant contributor to the complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (38Plutzky J. Viberti G. Haffner S. J. Diabetes Complications. 2002; 16: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cardiovascular problems such as accelerated and exacerbated atherosclerosis appear especially responsive to the proinflammatory environment of diabetes (37Greaves D.R. Gordon S. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 180-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 39Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The diabetic state is known to alter macrophage function resulting in increased lipoprotein lipase production and TNF-α release (40Sartippour M.R. Renier G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, hyperglycemia, through the generation of advanced glycation end products, increases macrophage secretion of IL-1 and TNF-α while enhancing intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression and decreasing phagocytic activity (41Liu B.F. Miyata S. Kojima H. Uriuhara A. Kusunoki H. Suzuki K. Kasuga M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the IRS-2/PI3-kinase pathway is common to both IL-4 and insulin signaling in macrophages, we wanted to demonstrate that IL-4-dependent IRS-2/PI3-kinase signal transduction was inhibited in diabetic macrophages and that the likely mechanism was a result of mTOR-dependent serine phosphorylation of IRS-2 on Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. Materials—The U937 promonocytic cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). All cell culture reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma except as noted below.

Sensitive rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit was purchased from Linco Research, Inc. (St. Charles, MO). Animals—All animal care and use were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC). 8- to 12-week-old db/db (C57BL/6J-leprdb/leprdb) mice and their agematched nondiabetic db/+ (C57BL/6J-leprdb/+) littermates were bred in-house from mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in standard shoebox cages and given pelleted food (NIH 5K52; LabDiet, Purina Mills Inc., Brentwood, MO) and water ad libitum in a temperature - (72 °C) and humidity- (45–55%) controlled environment with a 12/12-h dark/light cycle (7:00 a.m.–7:00 p.m.). Blood Glucose and Serum Insulin Measurement—Blood was collected from the lateral saphenous vein of 8-week-old db/+ and db/db mice. Blood glucose levels were measured using a One Touch Ultra® glucometer per the manufacturer's instructions. For random and fasting blood glucose measurements, blood was collected at 9:00 a.m. from mice fed ad libitum or fasted overnight, respectively. Serum insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions. For random serum and fasting insulin levels, blood was collected as above, and serum was fractionated by centrifuging whole blood for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Peritoneal Macrophage (PerMΦ) Isolation—Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and peritoneal cells were collected by peritoneal lavage using two 5-ml washes of ice-cold low glucose growth medium (glucose-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1.0 g/liter glucose, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 62.1 mg/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Macrophages where then isolated from the lavage fluid by adherence to plastic using the following procedure. Lavage cells were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml of hypertonic red blood cell lysis buffer (142 mm NaCl, 1 mm KHCO3, 118 mm NaEDTA, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 4 min then mixed 1:1 with growth medium, pelleted, and resuspended in pure growth medium at 37 °C. Cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/ml, and after 30 min plates were washed twice to remove nonadherent cells, resulting in ∼80% pure macrophages, confirmed by morphology (42Ceddia M.A. Woods J.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 87: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PI3-Kinase Assays—PI3-kinase activity was assayed as described previously (43Godbout J.P. Cengel K.A. Cheng S.L. Minshall C. Kelley K.W. Freund G.G. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated as indicated and then lysed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm okadaic acid and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Lysates were clarified, normalized to 1 mg of protein/1.5 μg of antibody, and immunoprecipitated for 2 h with either anti-IRS-1 or -2 antibody as indicated. PI3-kinase activity was assayed in immunoprecipitates as follows. Immune complexes were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and three times with 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 0.333 mg/ml sonicated l-α-phosphatidylinositol in 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm NaPO4, 8 μm [γ-32P]ATP (41.6 μCi/nmol), 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1. The reactions were terminated after 15 min, and phospholipids were extracted in chloroform and separated by thin layer chromatography. Phospholipid reaction products were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager System (Sunnyvale, CA). Cell Culture/Insulin and Glucose Treatment—U937 cells were grown in low glucose growth medium. Cells were passaged 1:1 with fresh medium every 3 days. All cell counts were performed on a Coulter ZM (Miami, FL). For high glucose treatments, cells were resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in low glucose growth medium with the addition of 3.5 g/liter glucose and grown for 48 h. For chronic insulin treatment, cells were resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in low glucose growth medium with or without the addition of 3.5 g/liter glucose and grown for 48 h. During the last 18 h, 1 nm insulin was added. TPA Maturation of U937 Promonocytes to Macrophages—TPA maturation was performed as described previously (44Deszo E.L. Brake D.K. Cengel K.A. Kelley K.W. Freund G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10212-10217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 45Deszo E.L. Brake D.K. Kelley K.W. Freund G.G. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, U937 cells were pelleted and resuspended in growth medium containing 100 nm TPA and incubated for 3 h. Cells were then washed and plated at 5 × 105 cells/ml in TPA-free medium and allowed to mature for 2 days prior to experimentation. Maturation was confirmed by CD11b and CD86 staining using flow cytometry. Western Analysis—Western analysis was performed as described previously (13Cengel K.A. Freund G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer. Lysates were clarified and normalized using Bio-Rad protein reagent. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were normalized to 1 mg of protein/1.5 μg of antibody and immunoprecipitated for 2 h. For whole cell lysates, proteins were normalized and were loaded at 250 μg/lane. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. For membrane stripping and reprobing, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min with a stripping buffer containing 2% SDS, 6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.704% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Stripped membranes were washed extensively with 0.01% Tween 20 and Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.0, then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Blots were reprobed with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the indicated primary antibodies and enhanced ECL reagents followed by autoradiography and densitometry. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The significance of difference was determined by one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was denoted at p < 0.05. IL-4-activated IRS-2-associated PI3-Kinase Activity Is Impaired in PerMΦs from db/db Mice—We have shown previously that chronic insulin exposure-dependent serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 can block cytokine signaling in myeloma cells in vitro (13Cengel K.A. Freund G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate whether macrophages from type 2 diabetic animals had impaired IRS-2-dependent cytokine signaling, we examined PerMΦs from db/db mice (Table I). Fig. 1A shows that PerMΦs from 8-week-old db/db mice treated with IL-4 (5.5 ng/ml, 15 min) had a 44% (db/+, 100 ± 11.8%; db/db, 56.0 ± 12.3%; p < 0.05) reduction in IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase activity compared with similarly treated PerMΦs from db/+ control mice. Activity of PI3-kinase associated with IRS-2 basally was not different in db/db and db/+ PerMΦs. Fig. 1, B and C, demonstrates that, when insulin (100 nm, 10 min) or IGF-I (10 ng/ml, 10 min) was used in place of IL-4, PerMΦ PI3-kinase activity associated with IRS-2 was also reduced by 34% (db/+, 100 ± 9.3%; db/db, 66.2 ± 11.3%; p < 0.05) and 39% (db/+, 100 ± 4.6%; db/db, 61.4 ± 4.0%; p < 0.01) in db/db mice, respectively. To determine the serine phosphorylation state of IRS-2 in db/db mouse PerMΦs, Western analysis was performed. Fig. 1D demonstrates that IRS-2 Ser/Thr-Pro motif phosphorylation was increased 78% in db/db mouse PerMΦs compared with PerMΦs from db/+ mice (db/+, 100 ± 2.2%; db/db, 177.9 ± 2.2%; p < 0.001). Importantly, IRS-2 mass from both db/db and db/+ mice was similar (Fig. 1E; db/+, 100 ± 20.67%; db/db, 99 ± 20.67%; p = not significant). The mass of PI3-kinase from db/db and db/+ PerMΦs was also equivalent (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that PerMΦs from type 2 diabetic mice have a reduced ability to form active IRS-2/PI3-kinase complexes coupled with augmented basal Ser/Thr-Pro motif IRS-2 phosphorylation.Table IDb/db mice have elevated serum insulin and blood glucose levelsdb/+db/dbBody Wt (g)26.72 ± 0.7436.10 ± 1.34ap < 0.05.FBG (mg/dl)93.4 ± 11.07379.2 ± 46.9ap < 0.05.RBG (mg/dl)157.6 ± 17.42448.6 ± 38.67ap < 0.05.FSI (ng/ml)1.31 ± 0.042.26 ± 0.07ap < 0.05.RSI (ng/ml)2.04 ± 0.065.31 ± 0.09ap < 0.05.(0.356 nm)(0.927 nm)a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Chronic Insulin and High Glucose Synergize to Block IL-4-activated IRS-2-associated PI3-Kinase Activity—We have shown previously that maturing promonocytic U937 cells with TPA induces a macrophage phenotype (44Deszo E.L.

Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that when U937 cells were matured with 100 nm TPA IRS-2 was up-regulated 10-fold. IRS-1 expression was not detected in U937 cells prior to maturation and was barely detectable after maturation (data not shown). When matured U937 cells were treated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min, IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase activity increased 150-fold, whereas no specific change in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase was observed (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether chronic insulin (1 nm, 18 h) and high glucose (4.5 g/liter, 48 h) could impair IRS-2-dependent IL-4 signaling, we examined IRS-2·PI3-kinase complexes in matured U937 cells. Fig. 2C demonstrates that chronic insulin + high glucose treatment led to a 37.5% (–Ch.Ins, 100 ± 3.3%; +Ch.Ins, 62.5 ± 3.3%; p < 0.01) reduction in peak IL-4-activated (5.5 ng/ml, 15 min) IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase activity. Importantly, IL-4-activated IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase activity was not affected by chronic insulin or high glucose alone (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2E shows that chronic insulin + high glucose reduced by 54% (–Ch.Ins, 100 ± 16.2%; +Ch.Ins, 45.9 ± 16.2%; p < 0.05) IL-4-dependent (5.5 ng/ml, 15 min) IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibited by 37% (–Ch.Ins, 100 ± 6.3%; +Ch.Ins, 62.8 ± 6.3%; p < 0.01) IL-4-dependent (5.5 ng/ml, 15 min) IRS-2/PI3-kinase p85 association. Insulin alone had no impact on the ability of IL-4 to induce IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation or p85 association (data not shown). These results indicate that chronic insulin + high glucose synergize to block IL-4 from inducing IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation thereby diminishing its subsequent ability to associate with PI3-kinase. JAK/STAT Signaling Activated by IL-4 Is Unaffected by Chronic Insulin + High Glucose—As Fig. 2 shows, IL-4-dependent IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited in matured U937 cells treated with chronic insulin + high glucose. This finding indicates that the ability of IL-4 to activate JAK may be impaired. Fig. 3A demonstrates that when matured U937 cells were treated with chronic insulin + high glucose, IL-4-dependent (5.5 ng/ml, 15 min) JAK1 autophosphorylation was similar to IL-4-dependent JAK1 activation in cells treated with just high glucose. As in Fig. 2, chronic insulin alone had no effect by itself and did not alter the ability of IL-4 to induce JAK1 autophosphorylation (data not shown). Because IL-4 can also transduce its signal via JAK3 (46Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Riedy M.C. O'Shea J.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), JAK3 was examined. Fig. 3B shows that JAK3 was not detected in matured U937 cells. Finally, to examine whether other JAK1 substrates aside from IRS-2 were impacted by chronic insulin + high glucose IL-4-dependent (5.5 ng/ml, 15 min) STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation was examined. Fig. 3C demonstrates that like IL-4-dependent JAK1 autophosphorylation, chronic insulin + high glucose had no effect on IL-4-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6. As above, insulin alone did not alter the ability of IL-4 to induce STAT6 phosphorylation (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that chronic insulin and high glucose target the IRS-2/PI3-kinase arm of the IL-4 signaling pathway and not the JAK/STAT arm. The mTOR Pathway Is Required for the Chronic Insulin + High Glucose Effect on IL-4 Signaling—We have shown previously that mTOR-dependent serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 within Ser/Thr-Pro motifs inhibits IFN-α signaling (18Hartman M.E. Villela-Bach M. Chen J. Freund G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-4-dependent IRS-2 associated PI3-kinase activation was regulated by mTOR, rapamycin inhibition studies were performed. Fig. 4A shows that chronic insulin (1 nm, 18 h) + high glucose (4.5 g/liter, 48 h) treatment of matured U937 cells increased Ser/Thr-Pro motif phosphorylation 92% (–Ch.Ins, 100 ± 14.2%; +Ch.Ins, 192 ± 14.2%; p < 0.01) over high glucose alone. Importantly, pretreatment of matured U937 cells with 1 nm rapamycin 30 min prior to the addition of insulin completely blocked the increase in IRS-2 Ser/Th"
https://openalex.org/W2095470012,"Hepoxilins are biologically relevant eicosanoids formed via the 12-lipoxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid cascade. Although these eicosanoids exhibit a myriad of biological activities, their biosynthetic mechanism has not been investigated in detail. We examined the arachidonic acid metabolism of RINm5F rat insulinoma cells and found that they constitutively express a leukocyte-type 12S-lipoxygenase. Moreover, we observed that RINm5F cells exhibit an active hepoxilin A3 synthase that converts exogenous 12S-HpETE (12S-5Z,8-Z,10E,14Z-12-hydro(pero)xy-eicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid) or arachidonic acid predominantly to hepoxilin A3. 12S-lipoxygenase and hepoxilin A3 synthase activities were co-localized in the cytosol; immunoprecipitation with an anti-12S-lipoxygenase antibody co-precipitated the two catalytic activities. These data suggested that hepoxilin A3 synthase activity may be considered an intrinsic catalytic property of the leukocyte-type 12S-lipoxygenase. To test this hypothesis we cloned the leukocyte-type 12S-LOX from RINm5F cells, expressed it in Pichia pastoris, and found that the recombinant enzyme exhibited both 12S-lipoxygenase and hepoxilin A3 synthase activities. The recombinant human platelet-type 12S-lipoxygenase and the porcine leukocyte-type 12S-lipoxygenase also exhibited hepoxilin A3 synthase activity. In contrast, the native rabbit reticulocyte-type 15S-lipoxygenase did not convert 12S-HpETE to hepoxilin isomers. These data suggest that the positional specificity of lipoxygenases may be crucial for this catalytic function. This hypothesis was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis studies that altered the positional specificity of the rat leukocyte-type 12S- and the rabbit reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase. In summary, it may be concluded that naturally occurring 12S-lipoxygenases exhibit an intrinsic hepoxilin A3 synthase activity that is minimal in lipoxygenase isoforms with different positional specificity.

Hepoxilins form a family of eicosanoids that are biosynthesized via the 12S-lipoxygenase (12S-LOX) 1The abbreviations and trivial terms used are: LOX, lipoxygenase; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HXA3, hepoxilin A3 (8-S/R-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid); HXB3, hepoxilin B3 (10S-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid); 12S-HpETE, 12S-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-12-hydro(pero)xy-eicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid; OPP, 4-(2-oxapentadeca-4-yne)phenylpropanoic acid; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; TrXA3, trioxilin A3 PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AA, arachidonic acid.1The abbreviations and trivial terms used are: LOX, lipoxygenase; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HXA3, hepoxilin A3 (8-S/R-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid); HXB3, hepoxilin B3 (10S-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid); 12S-HpETE, 12S-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-12-hydro(pero)xy-eicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid; OPP, 4-(2-oxapentadeca-4-yne)phenylpropanoic acid; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; TrXA3, trioxilin A3 PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AA, arachidonic acid. pathway of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade. Chemically they constitute epoxy-hydroxy eicosanoids that can be classified as HxA3 (8-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and HxB3 (10-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) (1Pace-Asciak C.R. Granstrom E. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepoxilins exhibit a myriad of biological activities. They stimulate glucose-induced secretion of insulin and increase the intracellular calcium levels in rat pancreatic islets cells (2Pace-Asciak C.R. Martin J.M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Med. 1984; 16: 173-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In human neutrophils a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration (3Dho S. Grinstein S. Corey E.J. Su W.G. Pace-Asciak C.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Laneuville O. Reynaud D. Grinstein S. Nigam S. Pace-Asciak C.R. Biochem.

Commun. 1990; 171: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were observed. The latter effect was blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting a receptor-mediated mechanism involving GTP-binding proteins. In neurons, HxA3 induces hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and increases the amplitude and duration of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (6Piomelli D. Shapiro E. Zipkin R. Schwartz J.H.

Nature. 1987; 328: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In platelets and aplysia neurons, HxA3 antagonized the expansion of cell volume and the opening of potassium channels (8Margalit A. Sofer Y. Grossman S. Reynaud D. Pace-Asciak C.R. Livne A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2589-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Belardetti F. Campbell W.B. Falck J.R. Demontis G. Rosolowsky M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although hepoxilin biosynthesis has been studied for a long time, some mechanistic details remain unclear. The first step of hepoxilin formation is conversion of AA to 12S-HpETE by a 12S-LOX (10Reynaud D. Delton I. Gharib A. Sada N. Lagarde M. Pace-Asciak C.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells this primary metabolite may be further metabolized via two alternative routes: (i) reduction to 12S-HETE (reductive pathway), and (ii) isomerization to hepoxilins (hepoxilin synthase pathway). When the reductive pathway, which involves glutathione peroxidase isoforms, is up-regulated hepoxilin biosynthesis is minimal because of substrate exhaustion (11Shankaranarayanan P. Ciccoli R. Nigam S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells with diminished reductive capacity are capable of biosynthesizing large amounts of hepoxilins provided that they express a hepoxilin synthase (11Shankaranarayanan P. Ciccoli R. Nigam S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A critical point in the mechanism of cellular hepoxilin formation has been the question of whether or not intracellular conversion of 12S-HpETE to hepoxilin isomers is an enzymatic process. Recent investigations on the stereospecificity of hepoxilin formation in rat pineal glands suggested an enzymatic pathway. This conclusion was based on the stereoselective conversion of 12S-HpETE. Under strictly comparable conditions, 12R-HPETE remained unmetabolized (10Reynaud D. Delton I. Gharib A. Sada N. Lagarde M. Pace-Asciak C.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, it became evident during the past several years that an active hepoxilin biosynthesis was always associated with a high expression level of the 12S-LOXs. This observation was usually explained by the fact that a 12S-LOX was required to convert AA to 12S-HpETE, the immediate substrate of hepoxilin biosynthesis (12Pace-Asciak C.R. Reynaud D. Demin P. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, these data prompted the possibility that 12S-LOX itself might be involved in the isomerization of 12S-HpETE to hepoxilins (11Shankaranarayanan P. Ciccoli R. Nigam S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). LOXs are multifunctional enzymes that exhibit a hydroperoxidase (13Pace-Asciak C.R. Reynaud D. Demin P.

We recently observed that RINm5F rat insulinoma cells convert exogenous arachidonic acid or 12S-HpETE to hepoxilins and that HxA3, but not HxB3, was the major metabolite (11Shankaranarayanan P. Ciccoli R. Nigam S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). More detailed mechanistic investigations revealed that these cells are devoid of glutathione peroxidase activities that reduce hydroperoxy fatty acids to the corresponding hydroxy compounds but express a leukocyte-type 12S-LOX at relatively high levels (11Shankaranarayanan P. Ciccoli R. Nigam S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the present study, we cloned a HXA3 synthase from RINm5F rat insulinoma cells and characterized the enzyme as leukocyte-type 12S-LOX. Alterations of the positional specificity of this enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis were paralleled by changes in the intrinsic hepoxilin synthase activity. An inverse mutagenesis strategy converting the rabbit 15S-LOX to a 12-lipoxygenating enzyme species induced significant HXA3 synthase activity. These data as well as HxA3 synthase activity assays of other LOX isoforms indicated that mammalian 12S-LOXs exhibit an intrinsic HxA3 synthase activity. Cell Culture—The permanent rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F (a kind gift from Dr. Tiedge, Hannover, Germany) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Activity Assays—HxA3 synthase activity was assayed by incubating intact cells or enriched enzyme preparations with exogenous AA (100 μm) or 12S-HpETE (20 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. The formation of hepoxilin isomers was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and/or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The reaction was stopped by acidification to pH 3.0, the mixtures were allowed to incubate at room temperature under acidic conditions for 15 min (epoxide hydrolysis), and the lipids were twice extracted with three volumes of ethyl acetate. The solvent was evaporated, the lipids were reconstituted in 0.1 ml of methanol, and aliquots were directly injected in HPLC or, after making suitable derivatives, in GC-MS. For measurements of the cellular HxA3 synthase activity, intact RINm5F cells (about 107 cells) were resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS. 0.1 mm AA was then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 min. The lipids were extracted by adding a mixture of diethyl ether/methanol/1 M citrate (135:15:1, v/v), and after phase separation the upper organic layer was recovered. The solvents were evaporated, the residues were reconstituted in 0.1 ml of ethyl acetate, and aliquots were converted to methylsilyl derivatives for GC-MS. For convenient detection in HPLC a fluorophore was introduced at the carboxylic group by the reaction with 100 μg of 9-anthryldiazomethane for one hour at room temperature (21Demin P. Reynaud D. Pace-Asciak C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was carried out on a Novapak-C18 column (250 × 46 mm; 5-μm particle size) using acetonitrile/methanol/water (90:6:4; by vol) as a mobile phase. The column eluate was monitored at 254 nm using a Shimadzu diode-array detector. Alternatively, we recorded the chromatograms with a Shimadzu fluorescence detector (excitation 254 nm, emission 400 nm). To assay the LOX activity, the cellular lysates or enriched enzyme preparations were incubated with exogenous AA, and the LOX products formed were quantified by HPLC. For this purpose 5–10 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and 0.1 mm of AA (final concentration) was added. Then the cells were lysed on ice by sonication (Labsonic microtip-sonifier; Braun, Melsungen, Germany) two times for5sat full power, and the homogenate was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The hydroperoxy lipids formed were reduced to the corresponding hydroxy compounds by addition of 0.1 ml of saturated sodium borohydride solution (in dry methanol). The incubation mixture was acidified with 50 μl of glacial acetic acid, and 0.6 ml of ice-cold methanol was added. The sample was kept on ice for 10 min, and protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the clear supernatant were directly injected to HPLC. RP-HPLC was carried out on a Nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey/Nagel, Düren, Germany; 250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (85:15:0.1; v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The absorbance was monitored at 235 nm. A calibration curve (6-point measurement) for conjugated dienes was established using 13-HODE as standard. Kinetic measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV2100), and the linear parts of the kinetic progress curves were evaluated. The basic kinetic characteristics (Km and Vmax) were calculated using the Graphpad software package (San Diego, CA). Immunoblotting—For electrophoresis the cells were reconstituted in lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 mg/ml each), and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Lowry's assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany) using a semidry blotting procedure. After blocking with 5% skimmed milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the blots were probed with an antiporcine leukocyte-type 12-LOX rabbit antibody (kind gift from Prof. S. Yamamoto, Kyoto, Japan) for 1 h and stained using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The antibody used cross-reacts with both the rabbit reticulocyte-type 15-LOX and the porcine leukocyte-type 12-LOX but does not recognize platelet-type 12-LOXs. Immunoprecipitation—RINm5F cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the antileukocyte-type 12S-LOX antibody (20 μg/ml) and protein A-Sepharose (1 h of incubation). The total lysate, the resuspended immunoprecipitate, and the depleted precipitation supernatant were incubated with 20 μm 12S-HpETE. The production of trioxilin A3 (TrXA3), the major hydrolysis product of HXA3, was determined by GC-MS. Similarly, LOX activity was determined by incubating the different immunoprecipitate fractions with 100 μm AA and analyzing the LOX products by HPLC as described above. 13S-Hydroxy-octadecaenoic acid was used as an internal standard for quantification of both TrXA3 and 12S-HETE. Chiral Phase HPLC Analysis—Chiral phase HPLC of the fluorescence derivative (9-anthryldiazomethane ester) of HXA3 was performed on a Supelco LC-(R)-DNB-PG chiral phase column (4.6 mm × 250 mm; Sigma) using the solvent system n-hexane/isopropanol (96:4, v/v) after prepurification of the 9-anthryldiazomethane derivatives by RP-HPLC. Authentic standards of 8(S)- and 8(R)-HXA3 isomers (kind gifts from Dr. Cecil R. Pace-Asciak, Toronto, Canada) were used as reference compounds. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry—Prior to GC-MS the free fatty acid derivatives were converted to their methyl esters by the addition of 300 μl of ethereal diazomethane. After 5 min of incubation the solvent was evaporated, 30 μl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide were added, and the hydroxy groups were silylated for 30 min at 60 °C in dry pyridine. GC-MS was performed on a Varian Saturn 4D GC-MS-MS system (Varian, Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with a Supelco DB5-MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm). The temperature program was started at 150 °C and increased to 250 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min, followed by an isothermic postrun at 250 °C for 20 min. The injector and transfer line temperatures were adjusted at 230 and 220 °C, respectively. Cloning of Hepoxilin A3 Synthase from RINm5F Cells—According to our working hypothesis, the leukocyte-type 12S-LOX of RINm5F cells might exhibit HXA3 synthase activity. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the leukocyte-type 12S-LOX from these cells. For this purpose we first isolated total RNA from RINm5F cells using an RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Then 3 μg of the RNA preparation were reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 60 min with 150 pmol of oligo(dT) primer and 15 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). For amplification of the leukocyte-type 12S-LOX cDNA, 1 μlof the reverse transcription reaction was used and the following primers were added to the amplification mixture: 5′-cga cat atg tgt cta ccg cat ccg c-3′ (forward primer), 5′-tgg ctc gag tca gat ggc cac gct gtt-3′ (reverse primer). After initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of PCR were performed. Each cycle consisted of a denaturing period (40 s at 94 °C), an annealing phase of 30 s at 60 °C, and a synthesis phase (90 s at 64 °C). After the last cycle, all samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA bands were stained with ethidium bromide. The purified 12S-LOX PCR fragment was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites in PET 15b vector (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany), and LOX-positive colonies were isolated. Their sequence insert was confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing. Expression of the Cloned LOX in P. pastoris GS 115—The 12S-LOX cDNA was cloned into the pPICZ, and the native stop codon prevented formation of a C-terminal His tag fusion protein. The plasmid was linearized and electroporated into competent P. pastoris GS115 cells. LOX-positive colonies were selected using zeocin as selection marker. The mutant phenotypes of the transformants were tested by plating them on minimal medium containing histidine and methanol or dextrose. All positive clones turned out to be mutants. Some of them were randomly selected and then cultured in minimal medium containing glycerol, biotin, and histidine for 3 h at 37 °C with constant stirring to an optical A600 of 2. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1/10 of the initial culture volume (minimal medium containing histidine and 0.5% methanol), and further grown at 30 °C. After 24 h the cells were harvested and lysed using glass beads. The lysates were centrifuged, and the stroma-free lysate supernatant was used as enzyme source. Expression of Rabbit 15S-LOX Mutants in Escherichia coli—The recombinant wild-type and mutant rabbit 15S-LOX and the various mutants were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged fusion proteins. For this purpose the 15S-LOX cDNA was cloned into the pQE-9 expression plasmid (Qiagen) between the SalI and Hind III restriction sites. Bacteria were transformed with the recombinant plasmids, and 3 liters of Luria Bertani medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 25 mg/liter kanamycin were routinely inoculated with a 15-ml overnight preculture. The bacteria were allowed to grow at 37 °C for 16 h, and then expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). The cultures were kept for an additional 2 h at 30 °C, and then the bacteria were pelleted, washed (with PBS), and resuspended in 30 ml of PBS. Cells were disrupted with an Emulsiflex-C5 high pressure cell homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada), and the cell debris was spun down. The clear lysis supernatant was applied to a 0.5-ml Ni-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The adherent proteins were eluted, rinsing the column with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Five 0.25-ml fractions were collected, and the LOX activity was assayed in each of them. Routinely, more than 90% of the activity was recovered in fractions 2–4. These fractions were pooled, diluted 1:50 with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (gel bed volume 500 μl; Amersham Biosciences) for further purification by anion exchange chromatography. After loading, the column was washed twice with 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and then the enzyme was eluted with 120 mm KCl dissolved in the same buffer. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected, activity was assayed, and the active fractions were pooled. For storage the enzyme preparation was supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of leukocytetype 12S-LOX was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The following amino acid exchanges were performed: L417Q, I418A, N592S, V593I, and H366L. The mutated plasmids were transformed into E. coli, and five colonies were selected for each mutant for activity assays. The sequence of these colonies was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Kinetic Studies of 12S-HpETE Conversion—Kinetic characterization of 12S-HpETE conversion by the wild-type rabbit 15S-LOX (no HXA3 formation) and its I418A mutant (5 point measurements) was carried out in the 12S-HpETE concentration range between 15–150 μm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature. The decrease in absorbance at 235 nm was assayed spectrophotometrically, and the catalytic activity was normalized to the LOX protein content of the enzyme preparation. The kinetic constants were extracted from the experimental raw data using the Sigma plot software package (enzyme kinetics module). Rat Insulinoma RINm5F Cells Express a Leukocyte-type 12S-LOX and Convert 12S-HpETE to HxA3—When RINm5F cells were incubated with high concentrations of exogenous AA (100 μm), 12S-HETE was detected as a major oxygenation product (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts using a polyclonal antiporcine leukocyte-type 12S-LOX antibody indicated an immunoreactive band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa (Fig. 1B). Moreover, RT-PCR using a set of rat leukocyte-type 12S-LOX-specific primers revealed a fragment with the expected molecular mass (not shown). Preincubation of the cells with 10 μm of the leukocyte-type 12S-LOX inhibitor 4-(2-oxapentadeca-4-yne)phenylpropanoic acid (OPP) (22Richards K.M. Moody J.S. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16529-16538Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23Moody J.S. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10297-10303Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) abrogated formation of both 12S-5Z, 8Z, 10E, 14Z-12-hydro(pero)xy-eicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid and HXA3 (data not shown). To obtain more detailed information on the identity of the leukocyte-type 12-LOX of RINm5F cells, we cloned its cDNA following a RT-PCR-based strategy. Sequencing the isolated cDNA clone, we observed 100% identity with the published sequence of the rat leukocyte-type 12S-LOX (GenBank™ accession number NM_031010). These data indicate that RINm5F cells express the rat leukocyte-type 12S-LOX. Earlier we reported that RINm5F cells exhibit HxA3 synthase activity (11Shankaranarayanan P. Ciccoli R. Nigam S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); these results were confirmed in the present study. To characterize the enzymes involved in HxA3 biosynthesis, intact RINm5F cells as well as cell lysates were incubated with exogenous 12S-HpETE and the lipid extracts were analyzed by HPLC for the presence of hepoxilin isomers. From Fig. 2 it can be seen that substantial amounts of HxA3 were formed with intact cells (trace A) or cellular lysate (trace B). In contrast, we did not find any HxA3 formation when a boiled cell lysate was used as enzyme source (trace C). Preincubation of the cells with the 12S-LOX inhibitor OPP strongly impaired HxA3 formation; similar results were obtained with arachidonic acid as substrate (data not shown). From these results one may conclude that RINm5F cells are capable of oxygenating AA to 12S-HpETE and further convert this primary LOX product to hepoxilins via a heat-sensitive metabolic pathway that can be inhibited by a 12S-LOX inhibitor. Thus, 12S-LOX appears to be involved in the conversion of 12S-HpETE to HxA3. To obtain additional evidence for the enzymatic character of the hepoxilin A3 synthase reaction, the enantioselectivity of HxA3 biosynthesis was tested. For this purpose, lysed RINm5F cells were incubated with 12S-HpETE, the lipids were extracted, and HxA3-9-anthryldiazomethane derivatives were prepared and purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2). Chiral phase HPLC for the separation of hepoxilin A3 enantiomers was then carried out. From Fig. 3, trace B, it can be seen that 8(S)-HxA3 is preferentially formed and only trace amounts of the corresponding 8(R)-enantiomer were detected (S/R ratio 93:7). This high degree of enantioselectivity is not compatible with a nonenzymatic isomerization but strongly suggests its enzymatic character. Differential Centrifugation Suggests Colocalization of 12S-LOX and HXA3 Synthase—In the next series of experiments we investigated the subcellular localization of 12S-LOX and HxA3 synthase activities in RINm5F cells. For this purpose the cells were lysed and several subcellular compartments were prepared by differential centrifugation. Major shares of both 12S-LOX and HXA3 synthase activities were recovered in the cytosolic fraction (100,000 × g supernatant). In contrast, the washed mitochondrial pellet (20,000 × g pellet) and the microsomes (100,000 × g pellet) only contained small amounts of the two catalytic activities (Table I). These data indicate a similar subcellular localization of 12S-LOX and HxA3 synthase and exclude cytochrome P-450 isoforms (microsomal localization) and mitochondrial oxygenases as metabolic sources of HxA3.Table IColocalization of 12-LOX and HXA3 synthase activity in RINm5F cellsSubcellular fractionRelative shares of 12-LOX activityRelative shares of HxA3 synthase activity%%1,000 × g supernatant10010020,000 × g pellet (mitochondria)3<1100,000 × g pellet (microsomes)73100,000 × g supernatant9387 Open table in a new tab Co-immunoprecipitation of 12S-LOX and HxA3 Synthase Using an Anti-12S-LOX Antibody—Lipoxygenases are multifunctional enzymes that, in addition to their fatty acid oxygenase activity, exhibit a hydroperoxidase (14Garssen G.J.

https://openalex.org/W2011137269,"GADD45a is a transcription target of the breast tumor suppressor gene BRCA. It was recently shown that mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of Brca1 (Brca1(Delta11/Delta11)) or a Gadd45A-null mutation (Gadd45a(-/-)) suffer centrosome amplification. To study genetic interactions between these genes during centrosome duplication, we generated Brca1(Delta11/Delta)(11)Gadd45a(-/-) mice by crossing each mutant. We found that all Brca1(Delta11/Delta11)Gadd45a(-/-) embryos at embryonic days 9.5-10.5 were exencephalic and exhibited a high incidence of apoptosis accompanied by altered levels of BAX, BCL-2, and p53. The trigger for these events is likely the genetic instability arising from centrosome amplification that is associated, at least in part, with decreased expression of the NIMA-related kinase NEK2. We demonstrate that small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of Brca1 decreased Nek2 more dramatically in Gadd45a(-/-) cells than in wild-type cells and, conversely, that overexpression of Brca1 and/or Gadd45a up-regulated transcription of Nek2. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of Nek2 in Brca1-specific small interfering RNA-treated wild-type and Gadd45a(-/-) cells repressed abnormal centrosome amplification. These observations suggest that NEK2 plays a role in mediating the actions of BRCA1 and GADD45a in regulating centrosome duplication and in maintaining genetic stability."

Other HpETE regioisomers and reactive lipid carbonyl compounds might also have effects similar to 15(S)-HpETE and 4-HNE. Thus, LOX enzymes (12Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) might modulate TrxR, and the regulatory control it exerts over other proteins and processes, such as ribonucleotide reductase and the cell cycle. To determine if LOX enzymes modulate TrxR, we developed HEK-293 cells that stably express either 15-LOX-1 or 5-LOX under the control of a ponasterone-responsive, heterologous transcription complex (13Saez E. Nelson M.C. Eshelman B. Banayo E. Koder A. Cho G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14512-14517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3831-3837PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that overexpression of 15-LOX-1 inhibits cellular TrxR. Specifically, cellular TrxR activity was inversely related to 15-LOX-1 activity. Several 15-LOX-1 metabolites inhibited purified TrxR in vitro: 4-HNE, 12-oxo-ETE, and 15(S)-HpETE had IC50 = 1 ± 0.2 μm, 2.7 ± 0.7 μm, and 13 ± 1.5 μm, respectively. Induction of 15-LOX-1, and the resulting inhibition of TrxR caused a corresponding inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity, cell cycle arrest in G1, impairment of anchorage-independent growth, and accumulation of the proapoptotic protein BAX. These effects are consistent with known regulatory roles for the TrxR-Trx system. In contrast to 15-LOX-1, expression of 5-LOX enzyme did not inhibit TrxR. These findings support the concept that molecular interactions between 15-LOX-1 and TrxR, a vital selenoenzyme, might be relevant to carcinogenesis (17Shureiqi I. Lippman S.M.

Exact concentrations of ethanolic solutions of the stable test compounds 5(S)-, 5(R)-, 12(S)-, 15(S)-, 15(R)-, and 20-HETE; 9(S)-, and 13(S)-HODE, and the metastable test compounds 5(S)-, 12(S)-, and 15(S)-HpETE, 9(S)- and 13(S)-HpODE, 5-oxo-, 12-oxo-, and 15-oxo-ETE, and 4-HNE were determined with UV spectroscopy. Before addition of the TrxR enzyme reaction mixture, 1–10-μl aliquots of test compound in ethanol were evaporated at 25 °C in a 1.5 ml of conical tube. Each test compound was then incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with 80 μl of a reaction buffer containing 50 μm K2PO4, pH 7, and 200 μm EDTA, 2 μm NADPH and 5 μl of purified rat liver TrxR. 5 mm DTNB substrate was added prior to measurement of absorbance at 412 nm for 5 min. Conditional Expression of 15-LOX-1 and 5-LOX Enzymes—Stable cell lines for the conditional expression of 15-LOX-1 and 5-LOX were created using a system based on VgEcR, a chimeric protein composed of the VP16 activation domain fused to an ecdysone receptor with altered DNA-binding specificity. Upon exposure to ponasterone, this protein dimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and the VgEcR/RXR heterodimer induces the expression of any gene inserted 3′ to the ecdysone response element (13Saez E.

We transfected this vector into EcR 293 cells stably transformed with the regulatory vector pVgRXR. We then isolated a population of G418-resistant cells that stably expressed ponasterone-inducible 15-LOX-1 and 5-LOX. Measurement of Protein Expression and Enzyme Activity—15-LOX-1 protein expression was determined immunochemically. Lox15-1+ cells were incubated with 0–10 μm ponasterone for 0–96 h. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were harvested, treated with lysis buffer, sonicated intermittently for 15 s at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g.15 μg of supernatant protein was fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk in TBS-T, then incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with primary antibody (anti-15-LOX-1, 1:1000) and HRP-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1: 4000). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with ECL reagents. 5-LOX expression in Lox5+ cells and COX-2 expression in Cox2+ cells was determined with anti-5-LOX antibody (1: 250) and anti-COX-2 antibody (1:450). 15-LOX-1 activity was quantified by measuring 15(S)-HETE formation. Lox15-1+ cells were incubated with 3 μm ponasterone, added once every 24 h, for 24–96 h. At t = 20, 44, 68, or 92 h, 0–120 μm AA was added and incubated with ∼1 × 106 cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell culture medium (supernatant) was collected, diluted 1:10–1:100 with PBS, pH 7.4. 15-HETE in the supernatant was quantified by immunoassay. Results were normalized to the cell number. COX-2 activity was quantified by immunoassay for PGE2 formation. 5-LOX activity was quantified by HPLC for 5(S)-HETE with UV detection at 230 nm. Measurement of TrxR Activity in Lox15-1+, Lox5+, and Cox2+Cells— Lox15-1+ cells were incubated for 0–96 h with vehicle, or with 3 μm ponasterone. This concentration of ponasterone was determined by a dose-response experiment (Fig. 2B). Vehicle or ponasterone was added every 24 h to maintain 15-LOX-1 expression; 20–100 μm AA was added to initiate cellular 15-LOX-1 metabolism. The corresponding cellular TrxR activity was quantified at intervals from 10 min to 8 h after the addition of AA or LA. Cox-2+ and Lox5+ cells were treated analogously to quantify the effect of COX-2 and 5-LOX on cellular TrxR activity. Cells were lysed in the usual lysis buffer, sonicated intermittently for 15 s at 4 °C, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was harvested. 20 μl of supernatant (4 μg protein/μl) was added to 80 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Trism pH 7.4, 143 μm insulin, 171 μm NADPH, and 1 mm EDTA, then incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. 66.6 μm Trx substrate was then added to start the TrxR enzymatic reaction. The oxidation of NADPH was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm in microcuvettes at 25 °C for 5 min. TrxR activity corresponded to the formation of μmol of NADP+/min/mg of cellular protein. Cell Cycle Analysis—Approximately 6 × 105 cells in 2 ml of complete DMEM media were plated in 6-well plates. Lox15-1+ cells were incubated daily with 3 μm ponasterone or vehicle for 96 h. 20 μm AA was added for 4 h prior to cell fixation, and the distribution of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was determined by FACS analysis. Adherent cells were released by treatment with 0.25% trypsin. The trypsin was inactivated with 10% serum in complete DMEM media. Each sample was washed twice with 1× PBS and fixed overnight with ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Cells were rehydrated with 1× PBS, then stained with 10% propidium iodide in 0.1% Triton X-100, 3.7% EDTA, and 100 units/ml of RNase in 1× PBS for 60 min at 25 °C. Cells were filtered through 35-μm filters before analysis. The flow cytometer was configured to track the number of events with the FL2 parameter (BD Pharmingen FACSCAN®. The DNA content was analyzed using a nonlinear least-squares algorithm (23Bauer K.D. Duque R.E. Shankey T.V. Clinical Flow Cytometry: Principles and Application. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1993: 44-46Google Scholar). Lox5+ cells were treated analogously in separate experiments. Growth in Soft Agar—Lox15-1+ and Cox-2+ cells were suspended in 0.5% low melting point agar with complete DMEM medium. Approximately 1 × 104 cells were plated on an 85-mm dish coated with 1% agar, and maintained at 37 °C. On day 10, cells were stained with 1 ml of 2-(p-isodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride hydrate (250 mg/l in PBS) for 24 h (24Kelavkar U.P. Nixon J.B. Cohen C. Dillehay D.

Measurement of Ribonucleotide Reductase Activity in Lox15-1+Cells—Approximately 1 × 105 cells were plated on a T-25 flask and rested overnight. They were then treated with 3 μm ponasterone every 24 h, and harvested after 96 h. Four hours prior to harvesting, cells were treated with 20 μm AA. Cells were treated with 1 mm hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that served as a procedural control (25Yeh Y.C. Tessman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1323-1324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxyurea was added at the same time as the AA. Adherent cells were removed with 0.25% trypsin. To enhance cell permeability, cells were washed twice in solution A (150 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 35 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2), then suspended in 500 μl of cold Solution A containing 0.25 mg/ml lysolecithin, and incubated for 1 min at 4 °C. To measure ribonucleotide reductase activity, 1 × 106 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 300 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.75 mm CaCl2, 10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm [3H]rCDP, 0.2 mm rGDP, 0.2 mm rADP, and 0.2 mm dTDP. After 10 min, the incubation mixture was added to 60 μl of 60% percholic acid/0.1% Na4P2O7 to quench ribonucleotide reductase activity. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, then diluted with 1 ml of H2O, and centrifuged to precipitate acid-insoluble material. The pellet was extracted with 100 μl of 0.2 n NaOH and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 75 μl of each sample was suspended in 5 ml of Ecoscint A, and 2′-deoxy-[3H]rCDP, the radioactive product, was counted using a Wallac Microbeta liquid scintillation counter. Results were normalized to the total number of cells. Bcl-2 and BAX Protein Expression in Lox15-1+Cells—Lox15-1+ cells were treated with vehicle or 3 μm ponasterone for 24–96 h. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were lysed, and the supernatant was harvested. 20 μg of protein from each sample was fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. Membranes were probed for Bcl-2 (antimouse Bcl-2, 1:400) and BAX (anti-rabbit BAX,1:500). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with ECL reagents. Immunochemical Analysis 4-HNE:TrxR Protein Adducts—For direct modification of TrxR by 4-HNE, purified TrxR (0.51 μg/ul) in 50 μm K2PO4, pH 6.5, and 200 μm EDTA, 2 μm NADPH was incubated with 10–30 μm of 4-HNE or vehicle for 0.5 min. To facilitate spontaneous formation of 4-HNE, 10–30 μm 15(S)-HpETE was preincubated with NADPH in K2PO4 and EDTA buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. Isolated TrxR (0.51 μg/ul) was then added to the mixture and incubated for 0.5 min before fractionation by 10% SDS-PAGE. In the 4-HNE-treated TrxR samples, 75 ng of protein was added to Laemmli buffer with and without β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Three times as much protein (225 ng) was used in the 15(S)HpETE-treated TrxR samples. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed for 4-HNE adducts with rabbit anti-4-HNE (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit-HRP (1:5000). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with ECL reagents. Statistics—Statistical significance at a 95% confidence interval was determined by analysis of variance with the Krusky-Wallis non-parametric test and Dunn's post hoc test. Effect of LOX Metabolites on Purified TrxR—Metabolites of 15-LOX-1 inhibited isolated TrxR more potently than metabolites of 5-LOX. Table I lists the concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) by reactive carbonyls (enones); hydroperoxy lipids, and hydroxy lipids. Overall, the most potent inhibitor was 4-HNE, a spontaneous rearrangement product of the HpETEs and HpODEs. The most potent inhibitors among hydroperoxy and hydroxy lipids were 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE, respectively. Hydroperoxy substituents conferred ∼2–3-fold more potency than the corresponding hydroxy substituents. The steric configuration of the hydroxy substituent also influenced the IC50: 15(S)-HETE was 4-fold more potent than the 15(R)-stereoisomer. The LOX substrates, AA and LA did not inhibit TrxR at >100 μm.Table IInhibition of purified TrxR by LOX metabolitesCompoundIC50μmReactive carbonyls (Enones)4-HNE1 ± 0.212-oxo-ETE2.7 ± 0.715-oxo-ETE29 ± 45-oxo-ETE37 ± 6Hydroperoxy metabolites15(S)-HpETE13 ± 1.512(S)-HpETE19 ± 2.213(S)-HpODE279(S)-HpODE295(S)-HpETE32 ± 0.3Hydroxy metabolites15(S)-HETE2112(S)-HETE6013(S)-HODE649(S)-HODE6515(R)-HETE765(R)-HETE>1005(S)-HETE>100SubstratesAA>100LA>100 Open table in a new tab 4-HNE formed a covalent adduct with TrxR in vitro, as shown by the appearance of a protein with a 4-HNE epitope co-migrating with TrxR under denaturing conditions (Fig. 1). Maximal formation of the 4-HNE:TrxR adduct occurred within ∼0.5 min. Incubation of TrxR with 15(S)-HpETE generated lesser, but detectable amounts of this adduct, consistent with spontaneous generation of 4-HNE from lipid peroxides (9Schneider C. Tallman K.A. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20831-20838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 11Gardner H.W. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1975; 23: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Boiling samples in Laemmli buffer with β-mercaptoethanol eliminated the 4-HNE adduct, consistent with its formation by a Michael reaction between a redox-sensitive nucleophile on TrxR and the electrophilic β-carbon of 4-HNE. Inhibition of Cellular TrxR Activity by 15-LOX-1 Induction and Catalysis—Ponasterone induced enzymatically competent 15-LOX-1 in a concentration and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Half-maximal formation of 15(S)-HETE occurred with 20 μm AA (Fig. 2C). TrxR activity in Lox15-1+ cells declined after induction of 15-LOX-1 (Fig. 3). In Lox15-1+ cells treated with ponasterone and 20 μm AA or LA, TrxR activity was 50% lower than the corresponding control cells without 15-LOX-1 induction (p < 0.05, n = 8). The NADPH oxidation shown in Fig. 3 was due to TrxR activity, because NADP+ formation was indistinguishable from background in the absence of added Trx (Fig. 3, panel A). Kinetic experiments also support the conclusion that 15-LOX-1 metabolism causes the loss of TrxR activity. In Lox15-1+ cells treated with ponasterone, TrxR activity fell within 10 min after the addition of AA. The inhibition was saturable, and it persisted for at least 8 h, consistent with an irreversible, or slowly reversible mechanism (Fig. 3, B and C). Maximal inactivation of TrxR occurred with addition of ∼50 μm AA, from which 15-LOX-1 can generate 15(S)-HpETE, 15(S)-HETE, and 4-HNE, along with lesser amounts of 12(S)-HpETE and 12(S)-HETE (26Bryant R.W. Bailey J.M. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6050-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparable experiments with Cox-2+ cells indicated that the induction of COX-2 had no effect on cellular TrxR activity (Table II). Ponasterone induced COX-2 with a dose-response and time course similar to its induction of 15-LOX-1. Cox-2+ cells converted the majority of AA to PGE2.Table IIConditional expression of COX-2 does not inhibit cellular TrxR activityTreatmentCOX-2+ cellsaValues are mean ± S.E., n = 3.%Vehicle control100 ± 63 μm ponasterone97 ± 33 μm ponasteroneplus 20 μm AA95 ± 2Vehicleplus 20 μm AA108 ± 4a Values are mean ± S.E., n = 3. Open table in a new tab Cell Cycle Arrest, Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibition, and Anchorage-independent Growth: Relation to 15-LOX-1 Induction and Catalysis—Lox15-1+ cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle following the induction of 15-LOX-1 (Fig. 4A). Results were similar with Lox15-1+ cells grown in serum-free medium (CD293), which excludes the possibility that fatty acids or other substances present in the serum caused cell cycle arrest (Fig. 4). Cell cycle arrest in G1 is consistent with inhibition of TrxR, which regulates cellular ribonucleotide reductase activity (3Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). Measurements affirmed that Lox15-1+ cells treated with ponasterone and AA had a 32 ± 4% decline in ribonucleotide reductase activity compared with control cells (Fig. 4C). Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar is one index of the oncogenic potential of cells. Lox15-1+ cells treated with ponasterone formed fewer colonies in soft agar compared with Lox15-1+ cells treated with vehicle, or compared with Cox-2+ cells treated with vehicle or ponasterone (Fig. 5). Cox-2+ cells treated with ponasterone formed more colonies in soft agar compared with Cox-2+ cells treated with vehicle. Thus, 15-LOX-1 induction opposes anchorage-independent growth; COX-2 induction favors it. Apoptosis: Relationship to 15-LOX-1 Induction—To determine if induction of 15-LOX-1 enhanced apoptosis, we measured bcl-2 and BAX protein expression. Bcl-2 and BAX affect apoptosis in opposite ways (27Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 28Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5864) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is anti-apoptotic, while BAX is pro-apoptotic. The ratio of BAX to bcl-2 rose in the cells expressing 15-LOX-1, suggesting higher numbers of cells poised for apoptosis (Fig. 6A). The level of BAX expression increased progressively from 0–96 h, while the level of bcl-2 expression remained constant in Lox15–1+ cells treated with ponasterone (Fig. 6A). In contrast, in Cox-2+ cells the ratio of bcl-2 to BAX rose, consistent with fewer cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 6B). Bcl-2 protein expression increased from 24 to 96 h, while BAX expression remained constant. Consistent with these observations, Lox15-1+ cells treated with ponasterone displayed a 3-fold higher caspase-3 activity than cells treated with vehicle (data not shown). Effect of 5-LOX E"

Little is known about the physiological significance of the NBCe1 for proton homeostasis and for other acid/base-coupled transporters in these cells. We have measured the voltage-dependent transport activity of an NBC from human kidney, type hkNBCe1, expressed in oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis, by recording membrane current and the changes in intracellular pH and sodium at different membrane potentials between –20 and –100 mV. The apparent intracellular buffer capacity was increased and became dependent upon membrane voltage when the NBCe1 was expressed; the measured buffer capacity increased by up to 7 mm/10 mV of membrane depolarization. Lactate transport by the electroneutral monocarboxylate transporter became enhanced and dependent upon membrane potential, when the monocarboxylate transporter (isoform 1) was co-expressed with NBCe1 in oocytes. Our results indicate that the electrogenic NBCe1 renders the cell membrane potential an effective regulator of intracellular H+ buffering and acid/base-coupled metabolite transport.

Our results indicate that the electrogenic NBCe1 renders the cell membrane potential an effective regulator of intracellular H+ buffering and acid/base-coupled metabolite transport. Many processes in living cells are pH-dependent: in particular, enzymatic reactions and acid/base-coupled transport. Therefore, cytosolic proton buffering and proton regulation are essential properties of all cells. In fact, no ion is as well buffered as protons; for each free cytosolic H+, 104 to 105 H+ are bound. This is reflected in a nanomolar concentration of free H+ in cells (∼40–80 nm), although the total amount of protons is in the ten-millimolar range. Regulation of intracellular H+ is mainly due to Na+-dependent and/or HCO –3-dependent carriers, which can recover intracellular pH from an acidification or alkalinization. These transporters can be so effective in “muffling” H+ that they can contribute apparent buffer capacity intra- and extracellularly (1Thomas R.C. Coles J.A. Deitmer J.W. Nature. 1991; 350: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1) 1The abbreviations used are: NBCe1, sodium bicarbonate cotransporter; MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. , which carries Na+ with HCO –3 across cell membranes with a stoichiometry of 1:2 or 1:3 (2Boron W.F.

Physiol. 2001; 531: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), has been reported to be highly active in some cell types such as epithelial and glial cells (5Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 699-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Chesler M. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1183-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Because of the electrogenic nature of the NBCe1, the activity of this co-transporter is dependent upon membrane potential. We have shown recently (7Becker H. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that the NBCe1, when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, increased the total apparent buffering power. In co-expression with another acid/base-coupled transporter, the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1), which co-transports one monocarboxylate anion with one H+, the NBCe1 considerably increased the metabolite transport capacity of the MCT1. This functional transport cooperation was presumably due to the NBCe1 counteracting the dissipation of the H+ gradient after H+-lactate flux across the cell membrane. We have now studied whether the apparent buffering follows the voltage-dependent activity of the NBCe1. Therefore, we have expressed the NBCe1 in Xenopus frog oocytes and determined the total buffer capacity of the cytosol as dependent upon the activity of the NBCe1, in comparison to H2O-injected control oocytes and to oocytes in which the MCT1 was expressed alone or together with the NBCe1. Our results suggest that, because of the NBCe1 activity, H+ buffering becomes voltage-dependent, which also renders the transport activity of the electroneutral MCT1 membrane potential-dependent. Oocytes and Injection—The constructs and procedures have been described previously (7Becker H. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The human kidney NBCe1 cDNA (hkNBCe1) cloned in the oocyte expression vector pGH19 was kindly provided by Dr. Walter Boron (8Choi I. Romero M.F. Khandoudi N. Bril A. Boron W.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C576-C584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into the vector pGEMHeJuel. Rat MCT1 cloned in the vector pGEMHeJuel, which contains the 5′ and the 3′ untranscribed regions of the Xenopus β-globulin flanking the multiple cloning sites, was used (9Bröer S. Rahman B.

Briefly, plasmid DNA was linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA-polymerase in the presence of the cap analogon m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX) to produce a capped RNA transcript. The cRNA was purified and stored at –70 °C in diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O. Integrity of the cRNA was checked by formaldehyde-gel electrophoresis. Xenopus laevis females were purchased from Horst Köhler, Hamburg, Germany. Oocytes were isolated and singularized by collagenase (collagenase A, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) treatment in Ca2+-free oocyte Ringer's solution at 26 °C for 1.5 h. The singularized oocytes were left overnight in Ca2+-containing oocyte Ringer's solution to recover. The oocyte saline had the following composition: 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES; the solution was titrated with N-methyl-d-glucosamine to pH 7.0 or 7.4. The bicarbonate-containing saline contained 58.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 24 mm NaHCO3 and was gassed with 5% CO2 (pH 7.4) and 5mm HEPES to stabilize the pH. Experiments with MCT1-expressing oocytes were done in saline buffered to pH 7.0, which contained 72.5 mm NaCl and 10 mm NaHCO3. Lactate (3 mm and 10 mm) was added as Na-l-lactate and exchanged for equimolar amounts of NaCl. In Na+-free saline, NaCl was exchanged by N-methyl-d-glucosamine and titrated with HCl to pH 7.0; lactate was added to Na+-free salines as free acid. Stages V and VI oocytes were selected and injected either with 14 ng of NBCe1-cRNA, 13 ng of MCT1-cRNA, or with 7 ng of MCT1-cRNA and 14 ng of NBCe1-cRNA by using glass micropipettes and a microinjection device (Nanoliter 2000, World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany). Injection of 7 ng of MCT1-cRNA and more gave similar expression of MCT1, but injection of more than 7 ng of MCT1-cRNA sometimes interfered with the expression of NBCe1. Control oocytes were injected with an equivalent volume of diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O. Intracellular pH and Na+Measurements—For measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) and membrane potential double-barrelled microelectrodes were used; for intracellular Na+ (Na+i), single-barrelled microelectrodes were used. The manufacture and application have been described in detail previously (10Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, for double-barrelled microelectrodes two borosilicate glass capillaries 1.0 and 1.5 mm in diameter were twisted together and pulled to a micropipette. The ion-selective barrel was silanized with a drop of 5% tri-N-butylchlorsilane in 99.9% pure carbon tetrachloride, which was back-filled into the tip. The micropipette was baked for 4.5 min at 450 °C on a hot plate. A H+-sensitive mixture (Fluka 95291, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was back-filled into the tip of the silanized ion-selective barrel and filled up with 0.1 m Na-citrate, pH 6.0. The reference barrel was filled with 3 m KCl. To increase the opening of the electrode-tip, it was bevelled with a jet stream of aluminum powder suspended in H2O. Calibration of the electrodes was carried out in oocyte salines with a pH of 7.0 and 6.4. The recording arrangement was the same as described previously (10Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Munsch T. Deitmer J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 43-53Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The central and reference barrels of the electrodes were connected by chloride-treated silver wires to the head-stages of an electrometer amplifier. Electrodes were accepted for use in the experiments when their response exceeded 50 mV per unit change in pH; on average, they responded with 54 mV for unit change in pH. In the experimental chamber, they responded faster to a change in saline pH than the fastest reaction expected to occur in the oocyte cytosol. For single-barrelled Na+-sensitive microelectrodes, a 1.5-mm borosilicate glass capillary was silanized as described above and back-filled with a Na+-sensitive mixture made of 10% (w/w) sodium ionophore VI (Fluka 71739), 89.5% (w/w) 2-nitrophenylether and 0.5% (w/w) sodium-tetraphenylborate. The pipette was filled up with 100 mm NaCl + 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. Calibration of the electrodes was carried out in oocyte saline with a Na+ concentration of 5, 10, 15, and 84.5 mm; on average, the electrodes responded with 52 and 50 mV for a 10-fold change in the Na+ concentration with N-methyl-d-glucosamine or K+ as Na+ substitutes, respectively. As described previously (12Bröer S. Schneider H.-P. Bröer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), optimal pH changes were detected when the electrode was located near the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This was achieved by carefully rotating the oocyte with the impaled electrode. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C). Only oocytes with a membrane potential negative to –30 mV were used for experiments. Buffering Power and Proton Fluxes—The measurements of pHi were stored digitally using homemade PC software (13Deitmer J.W. Schneider H.-P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and could be converted into intracellular H+ concentration, [H+]i. This allowed for changes in the [H+]i which take into account the different pH baseline, as e.g. measured in HEPES- and CO2/HCO3–-buffered salines. Amplitude and rate of change of the measured pHi or of the [H+]i were continuously recorded. The intrinsic buffering power, βi, was calculated from the maximal “instantaneous” pHi changes recorded when changing from HEPES- to 5% CO2/24 mm or 10 mm HCO –3-buffered saline (pH 7.4 or 7.0, respectively). The CO2-dependent buffering power, βCO2, was calculated from the intracellular bicarbonate concentration in the oocytes (βCO2 = 2.3 × [HCO –3]i), and the bicarbonate concentration was obtained from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The total buffer capacity, βT, was defined as the sum of βi and βCO2. Net acid/base flux rate, JA/B (mm/min), defined as the net transport of acid and/or base equivalents across the cell membrane, was calculated as the product of the rate of pHi change, ΔpHi/t, and the buffering power β. For calculation of the flux rates in HEPES-buffered saline, ΔpHi/t was multiplied with the intrinsic buffer capacity βi of the oocyte. For calculation of the flux rate in CO2/HCO3–-buffered saline, ΔpHi/t was multiplied with the total buffering capacity βT. Voltage-clamp Recording—A borosilicate glass capillary, 1.5 mm in diameter, was pulled to a micropipette and back-filled with 3 m KCl. The resistance of the electrode measured in oocyte saline was around 1 mΩ. For voltage-clamp recordings, both electrodes were connected to the head-stages of an Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The experimental bath was grounded with a chloride-treated silver wire coated by agar dissolved in oocyte saline. For the calculation of significant difference, a Student's t test or, if possible, a paired t test was used. In the figures shown, significance levels are: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. Transport Activity of the NBCe1—We determined the transport activity of the NBCe1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes by simultaneously measuring the membrane current, the intracellular sodium activity, Na+i, and the intracellular proton activity, H+i, of voltage-clamped oocytes (Fig. 1A). When a HEPES-buffered saline was replaced by a saline containing 5% CO2/24 mm HCO3– at a constant pH of 7.4, an outward current was activated which slowly declined as the Na+i and the H+i increased. The rate and extent of these changes were dependent upon the membrane potential. At a more depolarized potential (at –20 mV), the current, amplitude, and rate of Na+i change were enhanced, whereas the amplitude and rate of H+i change were reduced, as compared with more negative membrane potentials (–60 mV, –100 mV). In contrast, H2O-injected control oocytes acidified similarly at all membrane potentials (Fig. 1B), and neither current nor Na+i changes were observed in these control oocytes (not shown). We reasoned that the changes in membrane current and Na+i were due to NBCe1 transport activity, challenged by the intracellular acidification after diffusion of CO2 into the oocytes: the outward current and the rise in Na+i indicate inwardly directed NBCe1, with the co-transported HCO –3 counteracting the CO2-induced acidification. Consistent with the electrogenic nature of the NBCe1 (stoichiometry 1 Na+:2 HCO –3; Ref. 3Heyer M. Müller-Berger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Frömter E. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the inwardly directed transport was larger at more positive potentials and was smaller as the membrane potential was held at more negative values. The relationships between the measured parameters and the membrane potential are shown in Fig. 2. A non-linear change in membrane current, H+i and Na+i, was observed in NBCe1-expressing oocytes. The CO2-induced rise in H+i decreased from 42.4 ± 4.8 nm at –100 mV to 17.6 ± 1.7 nm at –20 mV (n = 11; Fig. 2A), and the rate of H+i rise decreased from 16.2 ± 2.6 nm/min at –100 mV to 8.5 ± 1.0 nm/min at –20 mV (n = 11; Fig. 2B). The values for both, the H+i rise and the rate of H+i rise at –40 mV and –80 mV, respectively, were significantly different (p < 0.01). The mean change in H+i as induced by CO2 in control oocytes (H2O-injected; Fig. 2F) was between 74 and 88 nm at membrane potentials between –20 and –100 mV, showing no significant voltage dependence (n = 6). The rise in Na+i after the addition of CO2 increased from 3.1 ± 0.3 mm at –100 mV to 5.0 ± 0.7 mm at –20 mV (Fig. 2C), and the rate of Na+i rise increased from 0.43 ± 0.07 mm/min at –100 mV to 0.63 ± 0.09 mm/min at –20 mV (n = 10; Fig. 2D). Although the values for the rise in Na+i at –40 mV and –80 mV were significantly different (p < 0.05), the values for the rate of Na+i rise were not significantly different at these potentials, respectively. The membrane current challenged by CO2 was highly voltage-dependent; it increased from 278 ± 22 nA at –100 mV to 547 ± 49 nA at –20 mV, and was significantly different at –40 mV and –80 mV (p < 0.001; n = 11; Fig. 2E). Consistent with electrogenic NBCe1 activity, the membrane current and the Na+i rise increased, and the rise in H+i and the rate of H+i rise decreased, with membrane depolarization. Taking the values for membrane current and the rate of H+i changes, the activity of the NBCe1 increased by a factor of 2 and 1.9 between –100 and –20 mV, respectively. Membrane Potential-dependent Buffer Capacity—From the intracellular pH and HCO –3 changes induced by CO2 (see Fig. 1), the intrinsic and CO2-dependent buffer capacity was calculated and summed up to the total buffer capacity (βT, see “Experimental Procedures”). The plot of βT against the membrane potential for NBCe1-expressing oocytes showed a marked voltage dependence; βT increased from 63 ± 6 mm to 119 ± 14 mm, when the membrane potential changed from –100 mV to –20 mV (n = 11; Fig. 3A). The βT of H2O-injected control oocytes, in contrast, remained unchanged near 40 mm for all membrane voltages; 22 mm was due to HCO –3-dependent buffer capacity at an intracellular HCO –3 concentration of 9.5 ± 0.4 mm in saline buffered with 5% CO2/24 mm HCO3– at pH 7.4. When the values for βT of NBCe1-expressing oocytes and control oocytes were subtracted, the buffering contributed by the NBCe1 was obtained (Fig. 3A, βNBC), increasing from 24 mm at –100 mV to 79 mm at –20 mV. A voltage dependence of nearly 0.7 mm/mV was indicated for βNBC by the regression line near the points, suggesting that the NBCe1 renders the buffer capacity voltage-dependent and adds 7 mm apparent buffer capacity for a 10 mV membrane depolarization. The total buffer capacity of NBCe1-expressing oocytes displayed a similar voltage dependence as did the CO2-induced membrane current and Na+i rise, which are indicative of NBCe1 activity: the slope was 0.59 for the buffer capacity, 0.56 for the current, and 0.60 for the change in Na+i (Fig. 3B). Transport Activity by MCT1 Co-expressed with NBCe1—To evaluate the functional significance of the voltage dependence of buffering imposed by the NBCe1, we co-expressed a second acid/base transporter together with the NBCe1. The MCT1 cotransports an organic anion, such as lactate or pyruvate, with one proton in an electroneutral 1:1 mode (14Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). If buffering by NBCe1 affected the transport activity of the MCT1, lactate/pyruvate transport might be expected to become voltage-dependent. We measured membrane current and H+i changes in voltage-clamped oocytes expressing NBCe1+MCT1 in the absence and presence of the substrates of NBCe1, Na+, and HCO –3 (Fig. 4A). Lactate, as a substrate for MCT1, was applied in two concentrations (3 and 10 mm; the Km of MCT1 in oocytes had been determined to be 3–5 mm; Ref. 12Bröer S. Schneider H.-P. Bröer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) in saline buffered to 7.0 with either HEPES or 5% CO2/10 mm HCO –3 (the lower pH value of the saline was chosen to ensure prominent MCT1 activity, which depends on external H+ as cosubstrate). The intracellular acidifications during lactate application, indicative for the activity of MCT1, were neither Na+-nor HCO –3-dependent, as they were unchanged in nominally CO2/HCO3–-free, HEPES-buffered, as well as in Na+-free saline. Upon addition of 5% CO2/10 mm HCO –3, there was a small intracellular acidification and a prominent outward current, indicative for the diffusion of CO2 into the cell and activation of NBCe1 in the inwardly directed mode, respectively. In the presence of CO2/HCO –3, lactate now produced smaller intracellular acidifications but large outward currents due to NBCe1 activity (7Becker H. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After removal of external Na+, the cytosol acidified by more than 100 nm H+ and was accompanied by a transient inward current, which is indicative of the reversed, outwardly directed transport mode of the NBCe1. The lactate-induced acidifications became larger compared with those in the presence of external Na+, whereas the currents were suppressed. The results show that lactate transport via MCT1 is accompanied by a larger change in H+i in the absence of Na+ in NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes by a factor of 3.5 and 3.0 for 3 and 10 mm lactate, respectively, but not in oocytes expressing MCT1 alone (Fig. 4B). The membrane current induced by the addition and removal of 3 and 10 mm lactate was reduced to 28 and 23% for the outward current (inwardly directed mode of NBCe1), and to 13 and 9% for the inward current (outwardly directed mode of NBCe1). This Na+-dependence in CO2/HCO –3-buffered saline indicates that the current is largely due to NBCe1 activity (Fig. 4C; see also Ref. 7Becker H. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Lactate produced small membrane currents in the nominal absence of CO2/HCO –3, which were suppressed after Na+ removal, suggesting that these currents were due to NBCe1 activity present in the nominal absence of CO2/HCO –3, which still contained a few hundred μm HCO –3 (see also Ref. 7Becker H. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The rise of H+i induced by lactate because of H+-lactate co-transport via MCT1 was presumably reduced because of the intracellular acidification and was due to the increased buffering capacity in the presence of CO2/HCO –3. The H+i rise evoked by 3 mm lactate was compared when holding the oocyte membrane potential at –40 and –80 mV for NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes and for oocytes expressing MCT1 alone (Fig. 5A). Although the rise in H+ was similar for MCT1-expressing oocytes at the two voltages, it was significantly smaller at –80 mV for the NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes. Similarly, the HCO –3 concentration, as calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, was also significantly larger in NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes at –40 mV, being 15 ± 0.7 mm, than at –80 mV, being 9.9 ± 0.5 mm (p < 0.001; n = 7–9; Fig. 5B), reflecting the voltage dependence of the NBCe1 activity. In contrast, similar HCO –3 concentrations were determined in MCT1-expressing oocytes at –40 and –80 mV, being 8.2 ± 0.7 mm and 8.6 ± 0.2 mm (n = 5, 6), respectively. When the total buffering capacity was determined for the three different types of oocytes, only the buffer capacity of oocytes (co-)expressing the NBCe1 displayed a voltage-dependence, which was 42% larger at –40 mV than at –80 mV in NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 5C). This result corresponds to the increase of βT by 35% in oocytes expressing NBCe1 alone at these potentials (see Fig. 3A). Oocytes expressing MCT1 alone or H2O-injected control oocytes had a buffer capacity of between 27 and 36 mm (Fig. 5C) and were similar at –40 and –80 mV, respectively. Using the total buffer capacity to calculate the rate of acid/base flux, JA/B, induced by 3 mm lactate revealed that the transport activity of the MCT1 was more than doubled at –40 mV when the NBCe1 was co-expressed (Fig. 5D), rising from 0.8 ± 0.1 mm/min in MCT1-expressing oocytes to 1.9 ± 0.2 mm/min in NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes. In contrast, lactate transport was significantly smaller in NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes at –80 mV, being 0.3 ± 0.1 mm/min as compared with 0.8 ± 0.1 mm in oocytes expressing MCT1 alone. At –80 mV, where the inwardly directed NBCe1 is reversed by the steep electrical gradient, the NBCe1 seems to counteract the uptake of lactate and would rather support efflux of lactate via MCT1. However, the values for the flux rate as determined in NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes may have been underestimated because of some conversion of HCO –3 (transported into the cell by the NBCe1) into CO2, which could leave the cell “silently” and, hence, would be missed by the pH sensor (see also “Discussion”). The results of the present study clearly show that expression of NBCe1 adds apparent buffer capacity to the cytosol, which is voltage-dependent, presumably because of the electrogenic nature of the NBCe1. The NBCe1 co-transports 1 Na+ and 2 HCO –3 (8Choi I. Romero M.F. Khandoudi N. Bril A. Boron W.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C576-C584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Heyer M. Müller-Berger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Frömter E. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In oocytes held at –40 mV, the reversal potential of the NBCe1 was –56 mV (7Becker H. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, at a potential more positive to the reversal potential, the NBCe1 transports Na+ and HCO –3 into the cell and hence adds apparent buffer capacity, whereas at a potential more negative to the reversal potential, the NBCe1 extrudes Na+ and HCO –3 and removes base equivalents and, hence, cytosolic buffer capacity. This conclusion is drawn from comparing the NBCe1 activity and buffer capacity at –40 and –80 mV. In most physiological experiments using intracellular pH sensors, the total cell capacity for muffling H+ is measured (1Thomas R.C. Coles J.A. Deitmer J.W. Nature. 1991; 350: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); it includes the instantaneous, chemical, H+ buffering, because of binding and release of H+ by intracellular molecules, and the dampening of pH changes contributed by fast acid/base transport across the cell membrane. Among other factors, therefore, the determination of the buffer capacity depends upon the speed and sensitivity of the method of sensing H+i and on the capacity and velocity of the acid/base transport. The voltage dependence of the total buffer capacity indicated that a 10 mV depolarization activated the NBCe1 to increase the buffer capacity by up to 7 mm. The relationship between buffer capacity and membrane potential was linear over the potential range between –100 and –20 mV. The HCO –3 concentration in NBCe1+MCT1-expressing oocytes was 52% larger at –40 mV than at –80 mV, which also results from the activity of the NBCe1. If the CO2-dependent buffer capacity, as derived from the HCO –3 concentration (see “Experimental Procedures”), is compared with the measured total buffer capacity, a discrepancy becomes evident: although the total buffer capacity increased by about 27 mm between –80 and –40 mV, the increase in HCO –3 concentration by 5 mm indicates an increase of 11.5 mm βCO2. Because it must be assumed that any apparent buffer capacity contributed by NBCe1 activity is CO2-dependent buffer capacity, there is a deficit of 15.5 mm buffer capacity (compare Fig. 5, B and C), or stated differently, 57% of the calculated buffer capacity is not reflected by a change in intracellular HCO –3 concentration. This deficit can be explained by the fact that we can only measure net H+ changes with limited velocity during the addition of CO2 or lactate; hence, we can miss fluxes of H+ and HCO –3, which are rapidly converted into CO2 and, as such, return silently across the cell membrane in the opposite direction. Hence, some “short-circuit” of acid/base-coupled fluxes occurs within the open CO2/HCO –3 buffer system, which would lead to an underestimation of the buffer capacity and acid/base-coupled fluxes in our measurements. The electroneutral lactate transport via MCT1 became membrane potential-dependent when the MCT1 was co-expressed with NBCe1. We have shown in a previous study (7Becker H. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that this co-expression facilitates lactate transport, presumably because of the increased buffer capacity in the presence of NBCe1 expression. Our present results support this conclusion and show that lactate transport was enhanced at a more depolarized membrane, when NBCe1 adds apparent buffer capacity, and was reduced at a more negative membrane potential, where the activity of the NBCe1 is directed opposite to that of the MCT1 during lactate uptake. It is the NBCe1 activity that changes as a function of membrane voltage, whereas the MCT1 activity follows that of NBCe1; we have no evidence that MCT1 itself becomes electrogenic after co-expression with NBCe1. Nevertheless, in a cell expressing NBCe1, the membrane potential becomes an important regulator of acid/base-coupled metabolite transport. In epithelial cells and glial cells, where the NBCe1 is expressed (5Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 699-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Chesler M. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1183-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), an electroneutral acid/base-coupled transport, such as the MCT, may become membrane potential-dependent because of the interaction via the acid/base gradient and the buffer capacity, which is rendered voltage-dependent by the electrogenic NBCe1. This might also lead to some confusion when trying to determine the stoichiometry of transporters, which interact with electrogenic transporters in the manner described here; the apparent voltage dependence would suggest an electrogenic nature of even electro-neutral transporters. There are several types of cells in which functional expression of NBCe1 and MCT has been reported, including epithelial, muscle, and glial cells (14Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 16Soleimani M. Burnham C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Considering co-expression of NBCe1 and MCT1, our present results suggest that factors activating the outward mode of NBCe1, which results in an intracellular acidification, would stimulate efflux of lactate and H+ by means of MCT1. Such factors could be a membrane hyperpolarization, because of the activation of K+ conductance or electrogenic transporters such as, for example, the Na+-K+-ATPase, or an increase in the intracellular Na+ concentration because of Na+-dependent uptake of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate or γ-aminobutyric acid (17Schousboe A. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1241-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Amara S.G. Fontana A.C. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Activity of glutamatergic neurons, which could initiate these processes, thus might lead to a net efflux of Na+ and lactate from glial cells (19Deitmer J.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), linking the uptake of glutamate by glial cells with the transfer of energetic compounds, such as lactate or pyruvate, from glial cells to neurons (20Magistretti P.J.

The functional significance of this pattern of expression is not known. Ca2+ signaling is particularly suitable to address questions related to polarized expression of signaling complexes, because [Ca2+]i can be measured with an excellent spatial and temporal resolution. Stimulation of GPCRs in polarized cells generates propagating Ca2+ waves (5Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Two models have been proposed to explain the polarized Ca2+ wave. The first model proposes that clustering of Ca2+ signaling proteins at the apical pole generates an apical-to-basal gradient of responsiveness, leading to an apical to basal Ca2+ wave (9Shin D.M.

This model does not require long rang diffusion of second messengers but rather differential sensitivity of apical and basal signaling complexes to stimulation by agonists. The second model proposes that long range diffusion of second messengers transmit signals generated at the basal pole to the apical pole to initiate the Ca2+ waves (14Ashby M.C. Camello-Almaraz C.

Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Functional mapping of Ca2+ signaling complexes in cellular microdomains is necessary to distinguish between the two models. Importantly, this has not been examined for any signaling pathway. Limited access and difficulties in reliably and repeatedly stimulating receptors in defined membrane patches have made it difficult to functionally map signaling complexes in all cell type, particularly in polarized cells. In the present work, we overcame these difficulties by developing a two-patch pipette procedure to alternately stimulate multiple plasma membrane patches of the same cell, with the same agonist concentration, to functionally map the activity of Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical and basal poles of pancreatic acinar cells. We report that clustering of GPCR Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole resulted in a higher responsiveness of the apical than the basal pole to agonist stimulation. Furthermore, stimulation of apical pole membrane patches evoked Ca2+ waves that were initiated at the site of stimulation, indicating that long distance diffusion of second messengers is not obligatory to evoke apical-to-basal Ca2+ waves. These findings provide direct evidence for functional heterogeneity of GPCR signaling complexes in plasma membrane microdomains and an explanation for the consistency of apical-to-basal Ca2+ waves in polarized cell. Preparation of Pancreatic Acini—Acinar cell doublets were obtained by collagenase and trypsin digestion as described (9Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After isolation, the cells were suspended in solution A (in mm, 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor) and kept on ice until used. Electrophysiology—The Ca2+-activated Cl– current was measured as described (23Zeng W. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using a pipette solution containing (in mm) 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 5 ATP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with KOH). Cell stimulation was done by touching the cells with a second patch pipette filled with solution A containing 20% glycerol and agonist. The stimulating pipette (SP) was advanced close to the patched cell until it gently touched the cell. Stimulation was started by a further slight advancement of the SP to firmly touch the plasma membrane. After about 4–7 min the SP was withdrawn and moved to a second site, and the cell was stimulated again in the same manner. The proximity of the SP to the membrane was evaluated from the increase in pipette resistance. Bright field images were acquired at the end of each of the stimulation events to avoid perturbation of the current recording. Measurement of [Ca2+]—[Ca2+]i was measured by imaging Fura2 fluorescence (9Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were placed in a perfusion chamber, a doublet was selected, and the SP was advanced close to the stimulated cell without touching. Because visual inspection during final advancement of the SP was not possible while recording fluorescence, preliminary experiments trained the experimenter as to how much to advance the SP to obtain a firm cell attachment. Membrane attachment was verified by an increase in pipette resistance. At the end of the stimulation period, a bright field image was acquired to ascertain pipette position. Fluorescence recording was begun just before the final advancement of the SP and was halted during pipette movement between sites. Fura2 fluorescence was measured at a resolution of 30 images/s, and images were analyzed and displayed as F0/Ft. Immunolocalization—Staining with anti-M3 and anti-IP3 antibodies was as described (9Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, acini were fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol, and after blocking of nonspecific sites, the cells were incubated with control serum or 1:100 dilutions of monoclonal anti-IP3R3 and polyclonal anti-M3 receptor antibodies. The antibodies were detected with IgG tagged with fluorescein or rhodamine. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Many signaling complexes are clustered in cellular microdomains (1Anderson R.G. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 2Hering H. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Polarized secretory cells cluster Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole (3Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in supplemental Fig. 1, showing expression of the M3 and IP3 receptors at the apical pole of pancreatic acini. This is the site from which Ca2+ waves are initiated when the cells are stimulated by any GPCR (9Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because of technical limitations, the functional significance of such clustering of signaling complexes is not known. In the present work we addressed this question directly by functionally mapping the responsiveness of Ca2+ signaling complexes in membrane microdomains. A Procedure for Stimulation of Multiple Membrane Patches—A technique suitable for the functional mapping of signaling complexes must allow stimulation of multiple membrane patches of the same cell and with the same agonist concentration. A patch pipette is ideal for such a task. However, the pipette tip should have a surface sufficient to generate a measurable stimulus while having little to no leakage. Another critical feature is that the pipette should allow firm attachment to the cell surface without generation of a GΩ seal so that the pipette can be moved between membrane patches. We reasoned that increasing the viscosity and hydrophobicity of the pipette solution would enable us to meet these requirements. Trials showed that good results could be obtained with a pipette tip of 1.5–2.0 μm and when the SP is filled with a solution containing 20% glycerol. Under these conditions the SP resistance was 3.31 ± 0.15 MΩ, and a GΩ seal was not formed in any of the experiments (n > 150). All of the experiments in the present work were performed with two-cell clusters, which maintain excellent cell polarity and intact tight junctions (18Park M.K. Lee M. Petersen O.H. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, it was necessary to minimize propagation of the stimulus between cells to avoid complications in interpreting the results. In pancreatic acini the stimulus propagates through gap junctions (16Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19769-19775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yule D.I. Stuenkel E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1285-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the configuration of the doublets minimizes gap junction communication (see supplemental Fig. 1D). Controls—Several controls were performed to test the applicability of the technique. First, a visible dye and a brightly fluorescent dye were included in the SP, and while not perfusing the bath, leakage was inspected. No leakage was detected in 10 such experiments with each dye. Second, using SP without agonists, in six of seven experiments firmly touching the cells at the apical pole had no effect, and in one experiment small current oscillations were observed, indicating that touching with the SP is not sufficient to evoke a stimulus. Third, in nine experiments similar to that in supplemental Fig. 1D, SP containing 100–250 μm carbachol were used to stimulate by touching apical patches of the adjacent cell and then the cell from which current was recorded. A much stronger (4 of 9 cells, as in supplemental Fig. 1D) or exclusive (5 of 9 cells) stimulation was observed by touching the cell from which current was recorded. These findings further indicate a minimal, if any, gap junction communication between the couplets. Fourth, in all experiments it was necessary to firmly touch the cell. The extent to which the SP touched the cell was evaluated from the change in SP resistance. Advancing the SP to lightly touch the apical pole increased the resistance from 3.32 ± 0.15 to 7.3 ± 0.3 MΩ. Lightly touching the basal pole of the same cells with the same pipettes during the second stimulation event resulted in SP resistance of 7.1 ± 0.3 MΩ (n = 44). Touching the cell in this manner did not evoke a stimulus. To initiate a stimulus the SP was advanced further, which increased the SP resistance to 11.0 ± 0.4 and 10.8 ± 0.4 MΩ when touching the apical and basal poles, respectively. In 22 of the experiments the apical pole was touched first, and in 22 of the experiments the basal pole was touched first. The identical increase in membrane resistance indicates that the same extent of stimulus is applied to the two membrane patches. Firmly touching the cells was also observed as a small membrane indentation and was always observed before a stimulus could be detected. This is illustrated in supplemental Fig. 1E by demarcation of the SP and the cell borders with a green and an orange line, respectively. Conversely, when the SP was withdrawn from the cell, the membrane patch was frequently stretched out before snapping into place. Thus, the combined control experiments indicate that solution leakage from the SP was minimal and not sufficient to trigger cell stimulation and that the apical and basal poles of the same cell were stimulated to the same extent. If there was any leakage, it was the same for all stimulation events. Differential Responsiveness of Apical and Basal Membrane Patches—Fig. 1 shows how the technique was used to map the M3 receptor signaling complexes in the polarized pancreatic acinar cells. Relatively high concentrations of agonists had to be included in the SP, probably because small membrane patches were stimulated, and there was restricted access of the agonist to the patches because of the increased hydrophobicity of the SP solution. To ensure that the sequence of patch stimulation was not the reason for any observed differences, receptors at the apical pole were stimulated first and at the basal pole second in one-half of the experiments (Fig. 1, A, D, and F); in the second half, the reverse sequence was used (Fig. 1, B, E, and G). It is clear from Fig. 1 that the apical pole membrane patches were much more sensitive to stimulation of the M3 receptors than the basal pole patches. Hence, in eight experiments with 100 μm carbachol in the SP, stimulation of apical pole patches evoked repetitive oscillations in the Ca2+-activated Cl– current, whereas in all experiments, stimulation of basal pole patches of the same cells failed to generate a Ca2+ signal (Fig. 1, A and B). The findings in Fig. 1, A and B, are particularly significant because numerous studies in pancreatic acinar cells show that global stimulation with low, physiological agonist concentrations evoke only repetitive Ca2+ spikes (3Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Petersen O.H. Petersen C.C. Kasai H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 297-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), similar to those triggered by stimulation of the apical pole membrane patches. This is also illustrated in Fig. 1C. Global stimulation by perfusing the cells with a solution containing 0.25 μm carbachol triggered Ca2+ spikes, whereas stimulation with 100 μm carbachol resulted in a sustained response. Hence, it appears that for the most part, if not exclusively, the Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole generate Ca2+ signals at physiological agonist concentrations. Fig. 1, D and E, shows that increasing the carbachol concentration to 250 μm increased the intensity of the response when apical membrane patches were stimulated; yet either no response or only low frequency/low amplitude [Ca2+]i oscillations were evoked by stimulation of basal membrane patches of the same cells (n = 8). A response could be evoked routinely by stimulation of basal membrane patches when the SP contained 1 mm carbachol (Fig. 1, E and F). However, these responses were oscillatory and smaller than the responses evoked by stimulation of apical patches of the same cells (n = 16). In a previous work we show that the CCK receptors are also expressed at high levels at the apical pole region (9Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane distribution of the bombesin (BS) receptors is unknown. Because stimulation of both the CCK and BS receptors triggers an apical-to basal Ca2+ wave (11Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to map these receptors functionally. Representative experiments are depicted in Fig. 2. As found for the M3 receptors, stimulation of the CCK (Fig. 2, A and B) and BS (Fig. 2C) receptors at apical membrane patches generated a much more intense Ca2+ signal that stimulation of the receptors at basal patches. It is therefore clear that the uneven distribution of Ca2+ signaling complexes of both the CCK and BS receptors at the plasma membrane generates sites from which Ca2+ signals can be evoked at low physiological agonist concentrations. Basal and Apical Stimulation Trigger Ca2+Waves—Repetitive stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with the same agonist at the same (13Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or increasing agonist concentrations (9Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) evoked the exact same Ca2+ wave with the same initiation site and propagation pattern. Therefore, we asked whether stimulation of apical and basal membrane patches of the same cell would evoke the same Ca2+ wave. Fig. 3 shows the results of a typical experiment with an SP containing 1 mm carbachol. First, [Ca2+]i imaging confirmed the results obtained by measuring the Ca2+-activated Cl– current, showing that stimulation of apical patches generated a much larger [Ca2+]i increase than stimulation of basal patches of the same cells. Second, invariably, stimulation of apical membrane patches resulted in a Ca2+ wave that always initiated at the site of patch stimulation (n = 54/54). This was the case whether the apical or the basal pole patches were simulated first. Stimulation of basal membrane patches of the same cells also generated an apical-to-basal Ca2+ wave. However, in most experiments (52 of 54), either stimulation of the basal pole did not evoke a Ca2+ signal (5 of 52) or the Ca2+ waves evoked by apical and basal pole stimulation of the same cell had different initiation sites (47 of 52; see arrowheads in Fig. 3). As concluded previously (14Ashby M.C. Camello-Almaraz C. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20860-20864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), initiation of a Ca2+ waves at the apical pole upon stimulation of basal patches indicates that second messengers like IP3 must diffuse from the basal to the apical pole. However, because apical and basal pole stimulation evoked Ca2+ signals with different initiation sites, whereas repetitive global stimulation evokes Ca2+ waves with the exact same initiation site (9Shin D.M.

Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), diffusion of second messengers from the basal to the apical pole did not reproduce the more physiological Ca2+ wave that is triggered by global stimulation. Global stimulation is likely to initiate Ca2+ waves by stimulation of the more responsive receptors at the apical pole. Conclusion—The present work provides the first functional mapping of Ca2+ signaling complexes in polarized epithelial cells and reveals heterogeneity in the responsiveness of GPCRs in these cells. Clustering of Ca2+ signaling proteins, including GPCRs, at the apical pole has been shown in several epithelial cells (supplemental Fig. 1 and Refs. 5Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Kuo T.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of these findings remains unknown. Early radioligand studies localized GPCRs to the basolateral membrane, and thus it is traditionally assumed that all signaling events initiate at the basal pole. By demonstrating that stimulation of basal pole patches evoked Ca2+ increase at the apical pole, it was concluded that all Ca2+ signaling, including polarized Ca2+ waves, are due to generation of Ca2+-releasing messengers at the basal pole that diffuse to the apical pole to trigger the Ca2+ wave (14Ashby M.C. Camello-Almaraz C. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20860-20864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, by examining the responsiveness of GPCRs at apical and basal pole membrane patches, we found that the apical pole is much more responsive than the basal pole to all agonists that act on pancreatic acini. Furthermore, the more physiological, low intensity stimulus that generates repetitive [Ca2+]i oscillations is sufficient to stimulate only the apical membrane patches (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is likely that at physiological stimulus intensity, Ca2+-releasing messengers are generated at the apical pole to initiate the Ca2+ wave. Specialization of Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole is even more intricate than demonstrated here. Thus, the much higher sensitivity of the apical pole to agonist stimulation (present work), together with the invariable Ca2+ wave initiation site upon global repetitive stimulation with the same agonist (9Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggests that the apical pole signaling complexes are heterogeneous with respect to responsiveness to agonist stimulation. Initiation of Ca2+ waves at the site of apical pole patch stimulation indicates that stimulation of any site at the apical pole can generate sufficient IP3 to evoke a Ca2+ signal. However, the consistency of the Ca2+ wave initiation site on repetitive global stimulation indicates that there must exist an apical pole membrane patch that has the highest sensitivity to agonist stimulation and that functions as a Ca2+ wave initiation site. Clustering of GPCR Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole ensures that local Ca2+ signals and Ca2+ waves are initiated at the apical pole. Hence, low physiological agonist concentrations at the extracellular space, released by nerve terminals or arriving in the blood stream, will not stimulate the cells until they reach the apical pole. This is probably vital for the physiological function of polarized cells such as pancreatic acinar cells. These cells secrete digestive enzymes by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis across the apical membrane in addition to a small amount of a NaCl-reach fluid that washes the enzymes to the duct (22Williams J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the secreted ions and fluid are replenished by uptake across the basolateral membrane. Placing the most responsive Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole ensures that no events will take place at the basal pole before exocytosis take place at the apical pole. Cells other than epithelial cells express Ca2+ and other type of signaling complexes unevenly at the plasma membrane, as in caveolae and membrane rafts (1Anderson R.G. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to use a technique similar to the one described here to functionally map signaling complexes in such cells and study their physiological significance.

To determine the structure of the pathway for cations across the transmembrane portion of the Na,K-ATPase, we mutated 24 residues of the fourth transmembrane segment into cysteine and studied their function and accessibility by exposure to the sulfhydryl reagent 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate. Accessibility was also examined after treatment with palytoxin, which transforms the Na,K-pump into a cation channel. Of the 24 tested cysteine mutants, seven had no or a much reduced transport function. In particular cysteine mutants of the highly conserved “PEG” motif had a strongly reduced activity. However, most of the non-functional mutants could still be transformed by palytoxin as well as all of the functional mutants. Accessibility, determined as a 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate-induced reduction of the transport activity or as inhibition of the membrane conductance after palytoxin treatment, was observed for the following positions: Phe323, Ile322, Gly326, Ala330, Pro333, Glu334, and Gly335. In accordance with a structural model of the Na,K-ATPase obtained by homology modeling with the two published structures of sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (Protein Data Bank codes 1EUL and 1IWO), the results suggest the presence of a cation pathway along the side of the fourth transmembrane segment that faces the space between transmembrane segments 5 and 6. The phenylalanine residue in position 323 has a critical position at the outer mouth of the cation pathway. The residues thought to form the cation binding site II (333PEGL) are also part of the accessible wall of the cation pathway opened by palytoxin through the Na,K-pump.

Accessibility, determined as a 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate-induced reduction of the transport activity or as inhibition of the membrane conductance after palytoxin treatment, was observed for the following positions: Phe323, Ile322, Gly326, Ala330, Pro333, Glu334, and Gly335. In accordance with a structural model of the Na,K-ATPase obtained by homology modeling with the two published structures of sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (Protein Data Bank codes 1EUL and 1IWO), the results suggest the presence of a cation pathway along the side of the fourth transmembrane segment that faces the space between transmembrane segments 5 and 6. The phenylalanine residue in position 323 has a critical position at the outer mouth of the cation pathway. The residues thought to form the cation binding site II (333PEGL) are also part of the accessible wall of the cation pathway opened by palytoxin through the Na,K-pump. The Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, is a membrane protein present in all animal cells. It is responsible for the maintenance of the Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane that are essential for many aspects of the cell function such as the maintenance of cell volume, the control of membrane potential, and the secondary active transport of many solutes. The Na,K-ATPase belongs to the P-type ATPase family. The structure and function of several P-ATPases have been studied extensively, in particular the Na,K-ATPase, the yeast H-ATPase, and the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate; TM, transmembrane; TEA, triethylammonium; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate; I/V, current/voltage.1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate; TM, transmembrane; TEA, triethylammonium; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate; I/V, current/voltage.

The high resolution structure of two distinct conformations of SERCA has been obtained recently by x-ray crystallography (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanism of cation translocation is not yet known for the Na,K-ATPase or any other P-ATPase.The Na,K-ATPase is constituted of two subunits: the main α subunit and a smaller glycoprotein, the β subunit. Similarly to other P-ATPases such as SERCA, the α subunit is predicted to include 10 transmembrane segments. The high resolution structure of SERCA shows that a group of four TM segments, namely the fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth TM segments, form the “core” of the transmembrane part of this ATPase, and the results of extensive mutagenesis studies confirm that these segments have an essential role in cation translocation in SERCA as well as in the Na,K-ATPase and provide the main residues that contribute to the cation binding sites (1Maclennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 4Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).Energy-driven cation translocation across the membrane is presently best explained by the “alternating access” mechanism (5Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 552: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). According to this model two gates, one on the extracellular side and one on the intracellular side, control the access to cation binding sites, which become occlusion sites when both gates are closed. The coordinated alternative opening and closing of these gates allow the successive loading of cations from one side and then release on the other side of the membrane. This model has recently received an interesting confirmation through the understanding of the mechanism of action of palytoxin. Palytoxin binds to the Na,K-ATPase from the extracellular side and alters the control of the gates allowing the presence of a conformation in which both gates are opened, a conformation that is not present with the native Na,K-pump; in this conformation the palytoxin-bound Na,K-pump behaves like a cation-selective channel with a rather large pore diameter estimated to 7.5 Å (6Artigas P. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Artigas P. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The alternating access model of the Na,K-pump requires the presence of pathways leading from the extra- and intracellular solutions to the binding sites, the access channels, and some kind of “gates” controlling the open or closed state of these channels. The nature and the structure of these access channels and of the gates are still unknown.We have recently published the results of studies in which we have examined the accessibility of the residues of the fifth and sixth TM segments by systematic mutagenesis of all the residues of these domains into cysteine (8Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and then probing the accessibility of the introduced thiol groups with sulfhydryl reagents. These studies have allowed us to define the aspects of the corresponding TM helices that form the pathway for cations across the membrane. We used the same approach to study the role of the fourth TM segment in cation translocation. We analyzed the results using a structural model of the Na,KATPase based on the known SERCA structures (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration and Expression of the Mutants in the Xenopus Oocyte—Systematic mutation of each residue of the fourth TM domain to a cysteine was performed starting from the C111S mutant of the α1 subunit of the Bufo marinus Na,K-ATPase (cloned in the pSD5 vector) in which a reactive cysteine of the first transmembrane segment had been removed and that has physiological properties similar to the wild type protein (10Wang X. Horisberger J.-D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 687-691PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the mutants were generated using a phenotypic selection strategy (11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar), and some mutants were generated using the PCR procedure that was performed in a cassette defined by the BlnI and SunI restriction enzymes. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cysteine mutant Bufo α1 subunits as well as wild type Bufo β1 subunit cRNA were synthesized by in vitro transcription as described previously (12Jaisser F. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16895-16903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Stage V/VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were obtained from ovarian tissue of female animals that had been anesthetized by immersion in MS 222 (2 g/liter; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) according to the regulations of the animal care State of Vaud authorities. Seven nanograms of α subunit and 1 ng of β subunit cRNA were mixed and co-injected in a total volume of 50 nl into stage V-VI X. laevis oocytes (13Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Häuptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The injected oocytes were incubated for 3-5 days in a modified Barth's solution and loaded with Na+ by exposure to a K+-free solution overnight before the electrophysiological measurements as described earlier (8Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Electrophysiological Measurements—The oocytes expressing the mutant Na,K-ATPase were studied by the two-electrode voltage clamp method using a Dagan TEV-200 voltage clamp apparatus (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Current/voltage (I/V) curves were recorded and analyzed using the Digidata/Pclamp package of Axon Instruments (Union City, CA).The composition of the control solution was 92.4 mm Na+, 0.82 mm Mg2+, 5 mm Ba2+, 0.41 mm Ca2+, 10 mm TEA+, 22.4 mm Cl-, 2.4 mmHCO3−, 10mm HEPES, 80 mm gluconate, pH 7.4; a low chloride solution and K+ channel blockers (barium and TEA) were used to minimize the oocyte Cl- conductance and the non-pump-related K+ currents.The effects of palytoxin and of 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) after palytoxin treatment were performed following a protocol similar to that previously reported for the study of fifth and sixth TM segments. Briefly the steady-state whole oocyte current was first measured at a holding potential of -50 mV using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. In the experiments with palytoxin, to fully inhibit the endogenous Xenopus Na,K-ATPase and to avoid the activation by palytoxin of any of the endogenous Na,K-pumps, the experiments were performed in the continuous presence of 10 μm ouabain. The Na,K-pump activity was first measured as the outward current activated by changing from a K+-free to a 10 mm K+ solution. Then the oocyte was exposed to a 2 nm palytoxin solution until the inward current had increased at least 3 times (1-3 min). After removal of palytoxin, the methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA or MTSET) reagent was added at a concentration of 100 μm for a 1-min period. The palytoxin-induced conductance was calculated as the conductance after palytoxin treatment minus the conductance before palytoxin treatment. The final solutions of palytoxin and methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compound solutions were prepared immediately before each electrophysiological measurement from 100 μm (palytoxin) or 100 mm (MTSEA or MTSET) stock solutions kept on ice.Immunoprecipitation—The expression of the Na,K- or H,K-ATPase wild type and a few selected mutants was examined by pulse (12 h) and chase (48 h) experiments using [35S]methionine metabolic labeling. Microsomes were prepared as described previously (14Jaunin P. Horisberger J.-D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and loaded on 5-13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The α subunit was immunoprecipitated using Bufo α1 subunit antibody (15Girardet M. Geering K. Frantes J.M. Geser D. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbühl J.-P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) under nondenaturing conditions as described previously (16Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The dissociated immune complexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and labeled proteins were detected by fluorography.Reagents—Palytoxin from Palythoa caribaeorum, purchased from Sigma, was dissolved in distilled water and kept as a 100 μm stock solution at -80 °C. The final palytoxin dilution was performed in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin to avoid nonspecific adsorption on vessels and tubing. Ouabain was purchased from Sigma and used from a 200 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. The MTS reagent MTSEA was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada).Homology Modeling—Two homology models of the Na,K-ATPase were built based on the crystal structures of SERCA in the E1 state (Protein Data Bank code 1EUL) and E2 state (Protein Data Bank code 1IWO), which are the two main conformations of the protein during the transport cycle of SERCA or Na,K-ATPase (20Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). First a multiple alignment was performed between all members of the Na,K-ATPase family together with all members of the SERCA family using the T-Coffee program (17Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5380) Google Scholar). Based on this alignment, models of the B. marinus Na,K-ATPase were generated by satisfaction of spatial restraints using the MODELLER program (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10374) Google Scholar). For each of the E1 and E2 states, 100 different models were computed by using different random assignment of the velocities during the simulated annealing part of the optimization. This procedure allowed the assessment of the regions of the model where the spatial restraints confine well the solution space and where there is some conformational freedom. The resulting models were clustered using the heavy atom root mean square deviation of the TM4 segment. The conformation with the lowest energy was chosen from the largest cluster. No significant violations of spatial restraints were observed in the final model.RESULTSFunctional Expression of the Cysteine Mutants—The functional expression of each mutant was evaluated in several ways: first as the outward current induced by addition of 10 mm K+ to a previously K+-free solution (we have shown earlier that when this measurement is performed in Na+-loaded oocytes at a membrane potential of -50 mV it provides a reliable estimate of the number of active Na,K-pump units expressed at the cell surface (14Jaunin P. Horisberger J.-D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), second as the current inhibited by 2 mm ouabain in the presence of 10 mm K+ in the extracellular solution, and third, in a qualitative manner, as the change in membrane conductance induced by exposure to 2 nm palytoxin. These results are presented in Fig. 1.The results of the evaluation of the functional expression of the Na,K-pump as K+-induced current and as ouabain-sensitive current were highly concordant except for small differences that will be discussed in a following paragraph devoted to the voltage dependence of the Na,K-pump function. As expected because the oocyte endogenous Na,K-pump was inhibited by ouabain, the oocyte injected with the cRNA of the β subunit alone did not express any potassium-activated or ouabain-sensitive current. The C111S mutant that we used as control expressed a potassium-activated current (186 ± 47 nA, n = 12) and a ouabain-sensitive current (178 ± 46 nA, n = 12) that were similar to those observed in earlier experiments (8Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Wang X. Horisberger J.-D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 687-691PubMed Google Scholar). Twelve of the 23 mutants expressed an electrogenic current that was not significantly different from those of the C111S mutant, and it is worth noticing that all the mutants of the most intracellular positions of the TM4 segment (from position Ala338 to Leu344) are among this group. On the other hand, two mutants, F323C and L337C, did not express any significant potassium-activated or ouabain-sensitive current with mean values that were not significantly different from the group injected with the β subunit alone. Three other mutants, G326C, P333C, and G335C, had a very low amplitude Na,K-pump electrogenic activity (below 20 nA), but nevertheless the mean values were significantly different from the negative control, namely oocytes injected with the β subunit alone. Six other mutants (I322C, L324C, I327C, A330C, N331C, and E334C) had slightly but significantly reduced Na,K-pump activity (roughly between 20 and 90 nA).When exposed to 2 nm palytoxin, all mutants except three reacted with an increase of the membrane conductance that was significantly larger than that observed in the β subunit alone group. The three non-reactive mutants, G326C, L337C and T339C, had either a very low (G326C) or no detectable (L337C) Na,K-pump activity as described above, and in the set of experiments in which palytoxin was used in the presence of 10 μm ouabain, no K+-activated current could be detected in either group. Surprisingly T339C presented a significant K+-induced and ouabain-sensitive Na,K-pump activity but no significant response to palytoxin. In contrast, the F323C mutant, which expressed no ouabain-sensitive current, and P333C and G335C, which had a very low amplitude Na,K-pump electrogenic activity, responded to palytoxin with a large conductance increase (with amplitude similar to that observed in the control C111S group).Protein Expression—To evaluate the possibility that the low level of functional expression of some mutants would be related to a low level of protein expression due to inefficient synthesis and/or rapid degradation of the protein, we examined by metabolic labeling the amount of protein synthesized in a pulse-chase experiment. Analysis by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2) revealed that α G326C and L337C were present only in very low amount compared with the control C111S mutant (with only a slightly larger amount of protein than the oocytes expressing the β subunit alone), although they did not appear to have a short half-life as the amount of protein did not decrease after a 48-h chase period. The E334C and the T339C mutants appeared to be normally synthesized and did not appear to be degraded.Fig. 2Protein expression of wild type and selected mutants of the Bufo Na,K-ATPase. Microsomes were prepared from oocytes injected with α (wild type or mutant) and β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase after a 24-h pulse (P) and 48-h chase (C) of metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and were immunoprecipitated with an anti-α subunit antibody (see “Materials and Methods”). The dissociated immune complexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In summary, except for the L337C mutant, we observed evidence for some degree of membrane expression, although it was much reduced in some cases, for each of the mutants tested. The functional characteristics of the mutants were tested further by examining the voltage dependence of the K+-induced and the ouabain-sensitive current. To avoid a too low signal to noise ratio when low expression levels were encountered, we included only recordings in which the Na,K-pump current amplitude amounted to at least 20% of the mean of the group.Voltage Dependence of the Na,K-pump Activity—I/V curves of the K+-induced and ouabain-sensitive current of selected mutants are shown in Fig. 3. To reduce the variation due to the level of expression, all the values are normalized to the ouabain-sensitive current recorded at -50 mV. The C111S mutant (that we used as control) presented an I/V relationship similar to what has been published earlier with very little voltage dependence in the low membrane voltage range and a slight voltage dependence (positive slope I/V curve) in the high negative membrane voltage range (19Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Eleven mutants (V321C, I322C, L324C, I325C, V329C, V332C, L336C, and V340C through L344C) had an I/V relationship that was qualitatively similar to the control (C111S) group (data not shown). These mutants all had a normal or only slightly reduced Na,K-pump activity at -50 mV. Their function can be considered as only slightly modified by the mutations. Four mutants (I327C, A330C, N331C, and A338C) presented a difference between the K+-induced and ouabain-sensitive I/V curve especially in the negative voltage range.Fig. 3Voltage-dependent electrogenic activity of Na,K-ATPase mutants. I/V relationship of the potassium-induced and ouabain-sensitive current is shown for oocytes injected with the β subunit + the α subunit of the control C111S mutant or selected mutants (not shown are the mutants with a I/V curve very similar to that of the α subunit control C111S mutant (V321C, I322C, L324C, I325C, W329C, V332C, L336C, L340C, T341C, V342C, and L344C) and I337C for which the current amplitude was too small to obtain a reliable I/V relationship). To eliminate the variability due to variation in expression level, all current values are normalized to the ouabain-sensitive current recorded at -50 mV measured in the same oocyte. The normalization value is indicated in each panel. For the F323C mutant, absolute values are indicated because the ouabain-sensitive current was very close to 0. The number of measurements is between 4 and 12 in each group. ou, ouabain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Three mutants (I328C, A330C, and E334C) were characterized by a negative slope of the I/V curve of the ouabain-sensitive current in the low and positive membrane potential range. The E334C mutant presented a K+-activated current that had amplitude about half that of the ouabain-sensitive current in the high negative membrane potential range.The ouabain-sensitive current was very small over the whole membrane potential range for the F323C, but a significant K+ induced inward current was recorded mostly at negative membrane potential. The G335C mutant presented an identical and strongly voltage-dependent I/V relationship of the K+-induced and ouabain-sensitive currents yielding a linear I/V relationship with a reversal potential close to -130 mV.To investigate the reason for the surprising discrepancy between the ouabain-sensitive current and the smaller K+-activated current in the E334C mutant, the effect of 2 mm ouabain was measured in the presence and in the absence of extracellular K+. and the effect of K+ in the presence and in the absence of ouabain. While in the control group the ouabain-sensitive current measured in the presence of K+ (126 ± 31 nA, current values at -50 mV) was similar to the K+-induced current (124 ± 29 nA, not significant), in the E334C group the ouabain-sensitive current was significantly larger (23.3 ± 5.2) than the K+-induced current measured in the same oocytes (11.5 ± 3.0, n = 9, p < 0.01 paired t test). Ouabain added in the absence of extracellular K+ had no detectable effect in the control group (0.1 ± 2.8 nA, n = 7), while it produced a significant inhibition of an outward current in the E334C group (9.6 ± 1.9, n = 9, p < 0.01). Finally, when the Na,K-ATPase had been blocked by 2 mm ouabain, increasing extracellular K+ to 10 mm induced similar small inward currents in both groups (C111S, -2.9 ± 1.9 nA, n = 7; E334C, -3.5 ± 1.2, n = 9, not significant); these small inward currents are probably due to incomplete block of the membrane K+ conductance. These results indicate that the E334C mutant has a significant electrogenic activity in the absence of extracellular K+. This K+-independent activity amounts to about half the maximal K+-stimulated activity and explains the difference between the K+-induced and the ouabain-sensitive current.Residue Accessibility after Palytoxin Treatment—Similarly to what we had studied earlier for the fifth and sixth TM segment, we have examined the accessibility of the cysteine residues introduced by mutagenesis to the sulfhydryl reagent MTSEA after exposure to palytoxin. The accessibility was estimated from the reduction of the membrane conductance of palytoxin-treated oocytes. To prevent a low signal to noise ratio, only oocytes in which a Na,K-pump current amounted to at least 20% of the mean measured in earlier experiments (see above) and that presented a palytoxin-induced conductance of at least 4 microsiemens were analyzed. For these experiments, oocytes injected with the C111S mutants were used as the negative control, and oocytes injected with Y778C and L780C, positions that have been shown to be readily accessible to MTSEA after palytoxin treatment (8Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were used as the positive control.The results of these accessibility measurements are summarized in Fig. 4. While the palytoxin-induced conductance (GPTX) was not inhibited by MTSEA in the C111S control mutant, the sulfhydryl reagent nearly completely inhibited GPTX in the two cysteine mutants of the fifth TM segment that we used as positive control. A statistically significant inhibition was also observed for the three positions of the central conserved “PEG” motif (P333C, E334C, and G335C; p < 0.001 in each case). An inhibition was also observed for the F323C and the A338C mutants (p < 0.05). In the oocytes injected with the β subunit alone or with G326C, L337C, and T339C, it was not possible to obtain a palytoxin-induced conductance of sufficient amplitude to measure reliably the effect of MTSEA on this conductance.Fig. 4Effect of MTSEA treatment on the palytoxin-induced conductance. The bar graph shows the mean values of the palytoxin-induced conductance remaining after a 1-min treatment with 100 μm MTSEA normalized to the palytoxin (PTX)-induced conductance before MTSEA treatment. The control C111S mutant was used as a negative control for the effect of MTSEA, and two cysteine mutants of the fifth transmembrane segment, L870C and Y778C described earlier (8Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were used as the positive control. Stars indicate that the mean value was significantly different (p < 0.05) from 1 and from the value observed with the C111S mutant. The number of measurements is between 5 and 16 in each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Accessibility to MTSEA in the Native Na,K-pump—We also tested the accessibility to MTSEA in the native Na,K-pump (i.e. without treatment with palytoxin) of the mutants of the outer part of the fourth TM segment. The current activated by 10 mm K+ was measured before and after a 2-min exposure to 1 mm MTSEA (in the control, K+-free solution). Fig. 5 shows the mean values of the K+-activated current at -50 mV. As reported earlier (8Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), MTSEA had no effect on the C111S mutant or on most of the tested cysteine mutants. MTSEA, however, significantly inhibited the Na,K-pump current in the I322C, G326C, A330C, and E334C mutants (p < 0.05 in each case). The effect of MTSEA on the whole I/V curve is shown on these mutants in Fig. 6. In these series of experiments, the K+-ind"
https://openalex.org/W2090075286,"Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice fed a chow diet have a mild hypercholesterolemia caused by the abnormal accumulation in the plasma of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-100- and apoB-48-carrying intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL). Treatment of LDLR-deficient mice with ciprofibrate caused a marked decrease in plasma apoB-48-carrying IDL and LDL but at the same time caused a large accumulation of triglyceride-depleted apoB-100-carrying IDL and LDL, resulting in a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels. These plasma lipoprotein changes were associated with an increase in the hepatic secretion of apoB-100-carrying very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and a decrease in the secretion of apoB-48-carrying VLDL, accompanied by a significant decrease in hepatic apoB mRNA editing. Hepatic apobec-1 complementation factor mRNA and protein abundance were significantly decreased, whereas apobec-1 mRNA and protein abundance remained unchanged. No changes in apoB mRNA editing occurred in the intestine of the treated animals. After 150 days of treatment with ciprofibrate, consistent with the increased plasma accumulation of apoB-100-carrying IDL and LDL, the LDLR-deficient mice displayed severe atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. These findings demonstrate that ciprofibrate treatment decreases hepatic apoB mRNA editing and alters the pattern of hepatic lipoprotein secretion toward apoB-100-associated VLDL, changes that in turn lead to increased atherosclerosis. Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice fed a chow diet have a mild hypercholesterolemia caused by the abnormal accumulation in the plasma of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-100- and apoB-48-carrying intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL).

These plasma lipoprotein changes were associated with an increase in the hepatic secretion of apoB-100-carrying very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and a decrease in the secretion of apoB-48-carrying VLDL, accompanied by a significant decrease in hepatic apoB mRNA editing. Hepatic apobec-1 complementation factor mRNA and protein abundance were significantly decreased, whereas apobec-1 mRNA and protein abundance remained unchanged. No changes in apoB mRNA editing occurred in the intestine of the treated animals. After 150 days of treatment with ciprofibrate, consistent with the increased plasma accumulation of apoB-100-carrying IDL and LDL, the LDLR-deficient mice displayed severe atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. These findings demonstrate that ciprofibrate treatment decreases hepatic apoB mRNA editing and alters the pattern of hepatic lipoprotein secretion toward apoB-100-associated VLDL, changes that in turn lead to increased atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; ACF, apobec-1 complementation factor; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein(s); LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-like protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B, type I; TG, triglyceride(s); VLDL, very low density lipoprotein(s). occurs in two forms, apoB-100 and apoB-48 (1Davidson N.O. Shelness G.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). ApoB-100 is essential for the assembly of VLDL in the liver, and apoB-48 is essential for the assembly of chylomicrons in the intestine. In rodents, apoB-48 is also synthesized in the liver and secreted into the circulation associated with VLDL (1Davidson N.O. Shelness G.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Both apoBs are the products of a single gene. ApoB-48 is synthesized as a result of apoB mRNA editing, a process that requires a multicomponent enzyme complex containing an RNA-specific cytidine deaminase, apobec-1, and an RNA-binding subunit, apobec-1 complementation factor (ACF) (2Anant S. Davidson N.O. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition to its essential role in the assembly of VLDL in the liver, apoB-100, but not its edited form apoB-48, also plays an important role in the removal of these lipoproteins from circulation (3Havel R.J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: S1-S7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This removal is a multistep process that begins when the VLDL secreted into the circulation undergo partial degradation by lipoprotein lipase present on the surface of endothelial cells, giving rise to cholesterol-enriched remnant particles of intermediate and low densities, the IDL and LDL. The remnants are then transported to the liver where they are endocytosed by hepatocytes. In normal animals, the endocytosis of the remnants is mediated primarily by the low density lipoprotein receptor, which binds apoB-100, as well as apoE, with high affinity. In animals that lack the LDLR (e.g. homozygous LDLR knock-out mice), remnants are endocytosed by hepatocytes through the mediation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-like protein (LRP), which recognizes apoE but not apoB-100 or apoB-48 (3Havel R.J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: S1-S7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, LRP alone cannot efficiently handle the removal of remnants from the plasma when the LDLR is absent, even when the influx of VLDL into the circulation is normal, as when the animals are fed a regular rodent low fat chow diet. As a result, LDLR-deficient mice accumulate apoB-100- and apoB-48-carrying remnants in the plasma, giving rise to a characteristic mild hypercholesterolemia (4Smith J.D. Breslow J.L. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It might be anticipated, therefore, that reducing the secretion of VLDL by the liver might allow LRP to function more efficiently and consequently minimize the abnormal accumulation of VLDL remnants in the plasma of LDLR-deficient mice. A reduction in the secretion of hepatic VLDL into the plasma of normal mice can be achieved by treating the animals with fibrates (5Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Duriez P. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2001; 3: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fibrates are a class of compounds that exert their effects through the action of PPARα, a transcription factor belonging to a subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. Fibrates bind to and activate PPARα, causing this transcription factor to bind to specific response elements in the regulatory regions of target genes, resulting in the modulation of their expression (6Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). Fibrates induce the down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and in the up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes of the hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. In combination, these effects cause a decreased availability of fatty acids for the synthesis of triglycerides (TG) that are normally incorporated into hepatic VLDL (6Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). Thus, in normal animals, fibrate treatment causes fewer VLDL particles to be assembled and secreted explaining, at least in part, the well known hypotriglyceridemic effects of these compounds. In the present study we set out to examine whether the accumulation of IDL/LDL in the plasma of LDLR-deficient mice fed a common chow diet could be reduced, as in the case of normal animals, by the administration of ciprofibrate, a potent PPARα agonist. We report that ciprofibrate treatment caused a marked decrease in the accumulation of apoB-48-carrying IDL/LDL. At the same time, however, it caused a surprising and substantial increase in the secretion and plasma accumulation of apoB-100-carrying IDL/LDL, producing a significant rise in plasma cholesterol levels. We established that the ciprofibrate-induced changes in plasma apoB-48 and apoB-100 levels resulted from a marked inhibition of the hepatic apoB mRNA editing. We also report that after 150 days of treatment with ciprofibrate the LDLR-deficient mice displayed severe atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. Animals—Wild-type female mice and homozygous female LDLR-deficient mice (6–8 weeks old), both on the C57BL/6J background, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). They were housed (5 animals/cage) in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room under 12-h cycles of light (6 AM–6 PM) and darkness (6 PM–6 AM) and were fed a normal rodent chow diet that contained 4% (w/w) fat and 0.4% (w/w) cholesterol (Teklad diet TD7022), purchased from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI). Some animals received the same diet supplemented with 0.05% (w/w) ciprofibrate or fenofibrate purchased from Sigma. At specified time intervals, blood samples (40–100 μl/mouse) were collected from the tail of conscious animals into heparinized capillary tubes, always between 7 AM and 9 AM. When indicated, mice were deprived of food for 4 h before being sampled for blood from the tail. They were then injected through a tail vein with 0.2 ml of a 10% (v/v) solution of Triton WR-1339 in saline, and blood samples were collected 60 and 180 min later. During the entire period the animals had free access to water. Plasma Lipid and Lipoprotein Analysis—Lipoproteins were fractionated using equal volumes of pooled plasma from various animals/group on tandem Superose 6 FPLC columns (ÄKTA, Amersham Biosciences). The columns were eluted with 200 mmol/liter sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.03% (w/v) EDTA, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The content of TG and cholesterol in the eluted fractions, as well as in the plasma, was measured with a microplate assay technique using enzymatic assay reagent kits obtained from Sigma. For the detection of apoB-100 and apoB-48, aliquots of the FPLC-eluted fractions were diluted 1:2 (v/v) with denaturing sample buffer, heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and run on 3–8% Tris acetate gel using the NuPAGE electrophoresis system obtained from Invitrogen. The aliquots then were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the wet electrophoretic transfer system from Bio-Rad. Immunoblotting was performed on a nitrocellulose membrane with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Biodesign International, Saco, ME) against mouse apoB-48/apoB-100 as described previously (7Fu T. Kozarsky K.F. Borensztajn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52559-52563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When indicated, scanning densitometry analysis of the apoB blots was performed on a Macintosh computer using the NIH Image program. RNA Extraction and Analysis—Liver and small intestine mucosa RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma) and used for primer extension analysis of apoB RNA editing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Primer extension analysis of apoB RNA editing was performed as described previously (8Mukhopadhyay D. Plateroti M. Anant S. Nassir F. Samarut J. Davidson N.O. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Real time quantitative PCR analysis used random hexanucleotide priming and amplification in an ABI PRISM 7000 using SYBR Green PCR master mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The primers were as follows: apobec-1, 5′-ACCACAACGGATCAGCGAAA-3′ and 5′-TCATGATCTGGATAGTCACACCG-3′ (product size, 72 bp); ACF, 5′-AGCCAGAATCCTGCAATCC-3′ and 5′-AGCATACCTCTTCGCTTCATCC-3′ (product size, 75 bp); and GAPDH, 5′-GGCAAATTCAACGGCACAGT-3′ and 5′-AGATGGTGAATGGGCTTCCC-3′ (product size, 70 bp). The data from the quantitative PCR were normalized to GAPDH levels in each sample. Miscellaneous Assays—Cytoplasmic extracts from the supernatant fraction of a 100,000 × g ultracentrifugation spin of mouse liver homogenates (S100) were prepared as described originally with minor modifications (8Mukhopadhyay D. Plateroti M. Anant S. Nassir F. Samarut J. Davidson N.O. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Aliquots of protein extracts were analyzed through denaturing SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with antisera to ACF, apobec-1, or 40-kDa heat shock protein (HSP-40) as detailed previously (8Mukhopadhyay D. Plateroti M. Anant S. Nassir F. Samarut J. Davidson N.O. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Assessment of Atherosclerotic Lesions—Mice were anesthetized with Nembutal intraperitoneally (0.65 mg/10 g of body mass), and their vasculature was perfused through the heart left ventricle for 2 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 7 IU of heparin/ml and then for 5 min with 10% buffered formaldehyde. The entire aorta was removed and fixed overnight with buffered formaldehyde. After removing the adventicia and branched vessels, the aortas were stained with Sudan IV. For histological examination of the lesions, segments of the aortic arch were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Effects of Ciprofibrate on Plasma Lipids—Fig. 1 shows the plasma cholesterol and TG levels of wild-type and LDLR-deficient mice maintained on a chow diet alone or supplemented with 0.05% (w/w) ciprofibrate for up to 150 days. As anticipated, ciprofibrate treatment of the wild-type mice caused a significant decrease in plasma TG levels (p < 0.01) and had little effect on the low cholesterol levels compared with the untreated group. Also as anticipated the LDLR-deficient mice maintained on the chow diet alone displayed elevated plasma levels of cholesterol and TG compared with the wild-type mice. As in the wild-type mice, treatment of the LDLR-deficient animals with ciprofibrate resulted in a decrease in plasma TG levels, although a statistical significant difference (p < 0.01) was observed only at 12 days of treatment. In marked contrast, the already elevated plasma cholesterol levels in the LDLR-deficient mice increased further upon treatment with ciprofibrate and remained elevated throughout the treatment period. After 150 days on the ciprofibrate-containing diet, the cholesterol level in the LDLR-deficient animals was 473 ± 42 mg/dl compared with 280 ± 35 mg/dl in the untreated animals (mean ± S.D., n = 5) (p < 0.01). The ciprofibrate-induced changes in plasma lipids were not unique to that drug since similar increases in plasma cholesterol levels were observed in LDLR-deficient mice treated with fenofibrate, another PPARα agonist. The results in Fig. 2 show that when 20-week-old female LDLR-deficient mice were treated with 0.05% (w/w) fenofibrate, their plasma cholesterol levels increased from 308 ± 25 mg/dl to 544 ± 27 mg/dl (mean ± S.D., n = 5) after 30 days of treatment. Fig. 2 also shows that 10 days after cessation of the treatment with fenofibrate the plasma cholesterol returned to base-line levels.Fig. 2Plasma cholesterol in mice treated with fenofibrate. Female LDLR-deficient mice (5 animals) were maintained on a chow diet alone or supplemented with 0.05% fenofibrate for 30 days. Blood samples were collected, and the treated animals were switched to a regular chow diet for another 10 days. Results are expressed as means ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Plasma Lipids after Triton WR-1339 Injection—The lower triglyceride levels in the plasma of the ciprofibrate-treated LDLR-deficient mice (Fig. 1) is consistent with the well known effect that fibrates have in decreasing the secretion of VLDL TG into the circulation (6Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in an experiment in which LDLR-deficient mice fed a chow diet with or without ciprofibrate for 30 days were injected with Triton WR-1339. The TG accumulation in their plasma was measured at 60 and 180 min after the injection (Fig. 3). It is apparent that the rate of TG influx into the circulation of the treated mice was markedly reduced. Since the animals were deprived of food for 4 h before the Triton injections and for the subsequent 3 h of the experiment, the secretion of triglycerides by the intestine was decreased, although not eliminated, and most of the TG that accumulated in the plasma of the Triton-injected mice were those carried by the VLDL secreted by the liver. We also measured the plasma cholesterol levels in the animals injected with Triton WR-1339. Before the injection, the plasma cholesterol levels in the untreated and ciprofibrate-treated mice were, respectively, 273 ± 17 and 427 ± 28 mg/dl (mean ± S.D., n = 4), and 3 h after the Triton injection the cholesterol levels increased by 84 ± 12 and 100 ± 14 mg/dl, respectively. Thus, unlike the influx of TG, the influx of cholesterol into the plasma of the ciprofibrate-treated LDLR-deficient mice was not significantly altered (p > 0.5) compared with the untreated animals. Lipoprotein Fractionation by FPLC—To examine how the fibrate-induced changes in plasma lipids were reflected on the plasma lipoprotein profile of the LDLR-deficient mice, pooled plasma of animals maintained on chow alone or chow supplemented with ciprofibrate for 30 days was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. Fig. 4 shows the TG and cholesterol contents of the separated lipoprotein fractions. The VLDL and a considerable portion of the IDL/LDL (FPLC fractions 8–28) of the ciprofibrate-treated animals are notable for their reduced TG content compared with those fractions from the untreated mice. The IDL/LDL fraction of the treated animals is shifted to the right, indicating that the lipoproteins eluted more slowly from the FPLC column, suggesting that a portion of the IDL/LDL consisted of smaller particles. The plasma cholesterol in both the untreated and ciprofibrate-treated mice was associated predominantly with the IDL/LDL fraction. However, in the ciprofibrate-treated mice this fraction is broader and is also shifted to the right, again indicating the presence of smaller particles. No elution shift was observed in either the VLDL or the high density lipoprotein fractions. These findings were consistently observed in two other experiments (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis of FPLC Fractions—Fig. 4 also shows the distribution of apoB-100 and apoB-48 in the IDL/LDL fractions from both groups of animals as detected by Western blot analysis. It is readily apparent, from the entire IDL/LDL peak (combined FPLC fractions 20–40) as well as from selected FPLC fractions (fractions 21, 25, and 29), that the IDL/LDL from the ciprofibrate-treated mice contained considerably less apoB-48 and considerably more apoB-100 than the untreated animals. These findings were confirmed in two other separate experiments (data not shown). The presence of apoB-48 and apoB-100 could not be detected in the high density lipoprotein peaks of either group of animals, even after the eluted peaks (combined FPLC fractions 41–51) were concentrated 10-fold (data not shown). Influx of ApoB-100 and ApoB-48 into the Plasma—The decrease in apoB-48 content in the IDL/LDL of the ciprofibrate mice could be explained by a more rapid rate of removal of apoB-48-carrying lipoproteins from the plasma or/and a decreased influx of apoB-48-carrying lipoproteins into the circulation. Likewise, the increase in apoB-100 content in the plasma of the ciprofibrate mice could be explained by a greater influx of apoB-100-carrying lipoproteins into plasma or/and a further decrease in the rate of IDL/LDL clearance. To examine the effects of ciprofibrate treatment on the influx of apoB-carrying lipoproteins into the plasma, we used a procedure described by Li et al. (9Li X. Catalina F. Grundy S.M. Patel S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 210-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Mice fed a chow diet with or without ciprofibrate for 30 days (4 animals/group) were deprived of food for 4 h and then injected with Triton WR-1339. Three h later blood samples were collected, and equal amounts of plasma from the animals in each group were pooled for the isolation of the VLDL fraction. While Li et al. (9Li X. Catalina F. Grundy S.M. Patel S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 210-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) separated the VLDL by ultracentrifugation, we separated the plasma VLDL by FPLC. Because Triton WR-1339 inhibits LPL activity (10Borensztajn J. Rone M.S. Kotlar T.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the TG-rich lipoproteins secreted by the liver and intestine accumulate in the plasma, and their apoB content can be determined by Western blot analysis. Fig. 5a shows that the TG-rich lipoproteins (VLDL) that accumulated in the plasma of the ciprofibrate-treated mice eluted more slowly from the FPLC column, indicating that some lipoproteins in the peak were smaller than those secreted into the plasma of the untreated animals and presumably were the precursors of the smaller IDL/LDL particles (Fig. 4). Fig. 5, b and c, shows the Western blot and the densitometric analysis of the apoB-100 and apoB-48 in the plasma VLDL peak separated by FPLC. It is apparent that more of the liver-specific apoB-100 accumulated in the plasma of the ciprofibrate-treated animals, indicating an increased hepatic secretion of this apoprotein compared with the untreated LDLR-deficient mice. A substantial presence of apoB-48 was detected in the VLDL fractions of both groups of animals, but less was detected in the VLDL from the ciprofibrate-treated animals. However, because apoB-48 is continuously secreted by the intestine, even in animals deprived of food (11Hayashi H. Fujimoto K. Cardelli J.A. Nutting D.F. Bergstedt S. Tso P. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G709-G719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the origin of apoB-48-carrying lipoproteins that accumulate in the plasma of Triton-injected animals cannot be established with certainty. We therefore used a different approach to determine whether a decreased influx of apoB-48-carrying hepatic VLDL could account for the decreased presence of apoB-48 in the IDL/LDL of the ciprofibrate-treated mice (Fig. 4). ApoB Gene Expression in LDLR-deficient Mice Treated with Ciprofibrate—We compared apoB mRNA editing in the liver and small intestine of untreated and ciprofibrate-treated LDLR-deficient mice. First, we examined apoB mRNA editing in the liver and intestine of LDLR-deficient mice fed a chow diet with or without ciprofibrate for 30 days. In the untreated animals apoB-48 RNA accounted for ∼60 and 90%, respectively, of the hepatic and intestinal apoB mRNA population (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6). In contrast, ciprofibrate-treated mice showed a significant decrease in hepatic apoB mRNA editing (25% apoB-48; Fig. 6, lanes 1–3) but had no effect on the extent of intestinal apoB mRNA editing. Expression of the ApoB mRNA Editing Core Components, apobec-1 and ACF—ApoB mRNA editing requires a minimal core complex composed of apobec-1, the catalytic deaminase, and ACF, the RNA-binding subunit (2Anant S. Davidson N.O. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We performed real time reverse transcription-PCR to quantify these mRNAs in the livers of LDLR-deficient mice treated with or without ciprofibrate. Fig. 7 shows that there was no change in apobec-1 mRNA abundance in the livers of the LDLR-deficient treated animals compared with the untreated mice. By contrast, ciprofibrate treatment caused a significant decrease in ACF mRNA abundance. As anticipated, no changes were observed in either apobec-1 or ACF mRNA abundance in the intestine of the treated mice compared with the untreated animals. To examine apobec-1 and ACF protein expression, we also performed Western blot analysis of hepatic S100 extracts from the treated and untreated LDLR-deficient mice. Fig. 8 shows that apobec-1 protein content was comparable in both groups. In contrast, hepatic ACF protein expression was greatly decreased in the treated animals. In combination, these results clearly demonstrate that the reduced hepatic secretion of apoB-48 and the increased secretion of apoB-100 into the plasma of the ciprofibrate-treated mice were a direct consequence of an inhibition of hepatic apoB editing.Fig. 8Effect of fibrate treatment on apobec-1 and ACF protein expression. Liver S100 extracts (100 μg) obtained from the indicated groups were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with specific polyclonal antisera to apobec-1 and ACF or HSP-40 (control) and was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Migration markers are indicated on the left. This is a representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Atherosclerotic Lesions in LDLR-deficient Mice Treated with Ciprofibrate—Mice that lack the LDLR and express both apoB-48 and apoB-100 do not develop significant atherosclerosis when maintained on a regular chow diet (4Smith J.D. Breslow J.L. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast LDLR-deficient mice engineered to express only apoB-100 (LDLR-/-/ApoB100/100) and maintained on a similar diet develop extensive atherosclerosis (12Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Kim S.K. Ambroziak P. Chu A. Wilson M.D. Hellerstein M.K. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Prompted by our observations that ciprofibrate treatment of LDLR-deficient mice caused substantially higher plasma levels of apoB-100 than those found in the untreated mice, we examined the aorta of these animals after they had been maintained for 150 days on a chow diet supplemented with or without ciprofibrate. Fig. 9 shows the arch segment of representative aortas from two treated and one untreated mouse stained for lipids with Sudan IV. It is clear that as a result of ciprofibrate treatment these animals developed multiple lipid-laden lesions. Histological sections (Fig. 9) revealed lesions filled with foam cells and the presence of cholesterol clefts. As anticipated, atherosclerotic lesions were not observed in the untreated LDLR-deficient mice or in the treated and untreated wild-type mice (results not shown). Fibrates, through activation of PPARα, affect the expression of multiple genes involved in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins (13Barbier O. Torra I.P. Duguay Y. Blanquart C. Fruchart J.C. Glineur C. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In this report we show for the first time that ACF, the RNA-binding subunit of the core apoB RNA-editing holoenzyme, undergoes metabolic regulation in mice in response to treatment with a fibrate. As a result, the hepatic secretion of apoB-48-carrying VLDL into the plasma of LDLR-deficient mice is greatly decreased, and the secretion of apoB-100-carrying VLDL is increased. Similar effects on hepatic apoB secretion were also observed in wild-type mice treated with fibrates. 2T. Fu and J. Borensztajn, unpublished observations. However, unlike the LDLR-deficient mice used in the present study, an increased secretion of apoB-100-carrying VLDL in wild-type animals did not result in the accumulation of IDL/LDL in the plasma because these lipoprotein remnants are efficiently cleared from the plasma via the LDLR pathway. In mice lacking the LDLR, by contrast, the plasma clearance of apoB-100-carrying IDL/LDL is impaired because their uptake by hepatocytes depends on the LRP, which preferentially binds apoB-48-carrying lipoproteins of either intestinal or hepatic origin (14Veniant M.M. Zlot C.H. Walzem R.L. Pierotti V. Driscoll R. Dichek D. Herz J. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1559-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, an increased influx of apoB-100-carrying VLDL into the circulation of LDLR-deficient mice caused by fibrate treatment, as reported here, resulted in a greater accumulation of apoB-100-carrying IDL/LDL in the plasma. Other investigators (15Linden D. Lindberg K. Oscarsson J. Claesson C. Asp L. Li L. Gustafsson M. Boren J. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23044-23053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Okochi E. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have reported on the effects of PPARα agonists on the in vitro secretion of apoB-100 and apoB-48 by isolated rat hepatocytes. Those studies demonstrated that compared with untreated cells, the overall secretion of apoB-100 by the PPARα agonist-treated hepatocytes was increased, but unlike the findings reported here, the secretion of apoB-48 remained unchanged. The in vitro studies also showed that most of the apoB-100 and apoB-48 secreted was associated with lipoproteins of greater density than VLDL. The reasons for the discrepant observations between the isolated rat hepatocytes (15Linden D. Lindberg K. Oscarsson J. Claesson C. Asp L. Li L. Gustafsson M. Boren J. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1437: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and those presented here are not obvious but very likely reside in the differences in experimental systems used. In addition to a greater influx of apoB-100, a decreased rate in the removal of apoB-100-carrying IDL/LDL also may have contributed to the increased accumulation of these lipoproteins in the plasma of the ciprofibrate-treated LDLR-deficient mice. There is substantial evidence that the scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), whose main function is believed to be mediating the selective uptake of high density lipoprotein cholesterol esters, can also recognize and bind LDL (17Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Wild-type and LDLR-deficient mice with liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI have been shown to have decreased levels of plasma LDL cholesterol and apoB-100, clearly suggesting that this receptor may function in the removal of the LDL particles from circulation by the liver (18Arai T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7884-7890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), fibrate treatment of LDLR-deficient mice caused the down-regulation of SR-BI protein expression (data not shown). It is noteworthy, however, that in a study using mice with overexpression of SR-BI by adenoviral vector, Webb et al. (23Webb N.R. de Beer M.C. Yu J. Kindy M.S. Daugherty A. van der Westhuyzen D.R. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1421-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) concluded that this receptor plays only a minor role in LDL metabolism in vivo. Further work is clearly necessary to determine whether SR-BI functions in the clearance of LDL from circulation and also to determine whether the decreased amounts of SR-BI in ciprofibrate-treated LDLR-deficient mice contribute to the plasma accumulation of apoB-100-carrying IDL/LDL. Previous studies by Powell-Braxton et al. (24Powell-Braxton L. Veniant M. Latvala R.D. Hirano K.I. Won W.B. Ross J. Dybdal N. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Davidson N.O. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) using mice deficient in the LDLR and apobec-1 demonstrated that these animals, which cannot edit apoB mRNA and therefore express exclusively apoB-100, had elevated LDL cholesterol and developed extensive atherosclerosis even when maintained on a chow diet, suggesting that these animals could be used as models for human familial hypercholesterolemia. In the present study, the editing of apoB mRNA by the livers of the ciprofibrate-treated LDLR-deficient mice was only partially inhibited, and consequently, the secretion of apoB-48-carrying VLDL by the livers of these animals was greatly reduced but not completely abolished. Nevertheless, as in the study by Powell-Braxton et al. (24Powell-Braxton L. Veniant M. Latvala R.D. Hirano K.I. Won W.B. Ross J. Dybdal N. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Davidson N.O. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), this fibrate-induced inhibition of apoB mRNA editing was sufficient to cause an increase in the plasma apoB-100-carrying IDL/LDL and in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. It is possible that the ciprofibrate-induced inhibition of SR-BI expression also may have contributed to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. A decreased expression (25Huszar D. Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Feeley R. Arai T. Fairchild-Huntress V. Donovan M.J. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or complete ablation (26Covey S.D. Krieger M. Wang W. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) of SR-BI has been shown to result in increased severity of atherosclerotic lesions in LDLR-deficient mice. However, this phenomenon was observed in animals fed atherogenic diets (25Huszar D. Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Feeley R. Arai T. Fairchild-Huntress V. Donovan M.J. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26Covey S.D. Krieger M. Wang W. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Whether the decreased SR-BI expression in LDLR-deficient mice fed a normal chow diet, as in the present study, can promote or contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions remains to be determined. It bears emphasis that in humans and other species in which hepatic apoB mRNA editing does not occur, treatment with fibrates does not promote the development of atherosclerosis. Indeed, clinical studies have provided compelling evidence that in patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, treatment with fibrates can retard the progression of atherosclerosis (27Linton M.F. Fazio S. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2000; 2: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Rubins H.B. Collins D. Robins S.J. Eur. Heart J. 2000; 21: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for this outcome are presently a matter of speculation. It has generally been assumed that the beneficial effects of PPARα agonists are due to their hypolipidemic effects. However, because PPARα is known to be expressed in the major cell types found in atherosclerotic lesions, e.g. endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells (13Barbier O. Torra I.P. Duguay Y. Blanquart C. Fruchart J.C. Glineur C. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that in addition to their beneficial hypolipidemic effects, the antiatherogenic effects of PPARα agonists may also result from the modulation in the expression of anti-inflammatory genes in those cells. In the present study we did not determine whether the expression of anti-inflammatory genes in the aortas of the LDLR-deficient mice was affected by the administered ciprofibrate. It is apparent, however, that in the presence of an enhanced hypercholesterolemia, ciprofibrate treatment did not prevent but in fact promoted the development of atherosclerotic lesions. A previous study from this laboratory (29Fu T. Kashireddy P. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with another model of atherosclerosis, the apoE-deficient mouse, also showed that treatment of those animals with ciprofibrate failed to arrest the development of atherosclerosis. Duez et al. (30Duez H. Chao Y.S. Hernandez M. Torpier G. Poulain P. Mundt S. Mallat Z. Teissier E. Burton C.A. Tedgui A. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Wright S.D. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48051-48057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of apoE-deficient mice with fenofibrate, although not enhancing, failed to reduce atherosclerotic lesion surface area in the aortic sinus. These authors did report a decrease in the cholesterol content in the descending aortas of the fenofibrate-treated animals, but they did not report on changes in the surface area of the lesions. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that treatment of LDLR-deficient mice with fibrates results in an over-accumulation of apoB-100-carrying IDL/LDL in the plasma, causing an enhanced hypercholesterolemia and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. As alluded to above, it is well known that hypolipidemic drugs that are effective in humans do not always have similar effects in animal models of dyslipidemia (31Krause B.R. Princen H.M. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 140: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results of the present investigation, as well as our previous study with apoE-deficient mice (29Fu T. Kashireddy P. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showing that treatment with fibrates aggravates the hypercholesterolemia and promotes the development of atherosclerotic lesions, are further examples of divergent effects of hypolipidemic drugs in humans and experimental animals. The fact that the fibrate-treated LDLR-deficient mice developed atherosclerotic lesions while maintained on a chow diet suggests that these animals may be useful models for atherosclerosis studies. As is often the case with human subjects, the development of atherosclerotic lesions was associated with elevated levels of apoB-100-carrying lipoprotein remnants. We thank Dr. P. Kashireddy, Dr. V. Stellmach, and Mona Cornwell for invaluable assistance."

OCIL is a member of the natural killer cell receptor C-type lectin group that includes CD69 and NKRP1D. We investigated carbohydrate binding of soluble recombinant human and mouse OCIL in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assays. OCIL bound immobilized high molecular weight sulfated glycosaminoglycans, including fucoidan, λ-carrageenan, and dextran sulfate, but not unsulfated dextran or sialated hyaluronic acid. Carbohydrate binding was Ca2+-independent. Binding of immobilized low molecular weight glycosaminoglycans, including chondroitin sulfate (A, B, and C forms) and heparin, was not observed. However, the soluble forms of these low molecular weight glycosaminoglycans competed for OCIL binding of immobilized fucoidan (as did soluble fucoidan, dextran sulfate, and λ-carrageenan), indicating that OCIL does recognize these carbohydrates. Inhibition constants for chondroitin sulfate A and heparin binding were 380 and 5 nm, respectively. Immobilized and soluble monosaccharides did not bind OCIL. The presence of saturating levels of fucoidan, dextran sulfate, and λ-carrageenan did not affect OCIL inhibition of osteoclast formation. The fucoidan-binding lectins Ulex europaeus agglutinin I and Anguilla anguilla agglutinin did not block osteoclast formation or affect the inhibitory action of OCIL. Although the osteoclast inhibitory action of OCIL is independent of sugar recognition, we have found that OCIL, a lectin widely distributed, but notably localized in bone, skin, and other connective tissues, binds a range of physiologically important glycosaminoglycans, and this property may modulate OCIL actions upon other cells.

OCIL is a member of a small family of related proteins that includes murine OCILrP1 and murine OCILrP2 (also called CLR-g) (6Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Quinn J.M.W. Ly C. Gange C. Elliott J. Ng K.W.

We have previously shown that the soluble recombinant C-type lectin domains of each of these molecules inhibit osteoclast formation with similar potency (1Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Hu Y.S. Elliott J.

The OCIL family members have been mapped to the NK cell receptor gene complex on mouse chromosome 6 (3Plougastel B. Dubbelde C. Yokoyama W.M. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), where other clr genes and genes for the Ly49 subfamily, CD94, the NKRP1 subfamily, and CD69 are located. Recently, murine OCIL has been demonstrated to bind NKRP1D, resulting in inhibition of NK cell killing of target cells (4Iizuka K. Naidenko O.V. Plougastel B.F. Fremont D.H. Yokoyama W.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Whereas OCILrP2 shares 74% amino acid identity with OCIL in the extracellular domain (6Zhou H. Kartsogiannis V. Quinn J.M.W.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Lectins are nonenzymatic sugar-binding proteins that bind specific carbohydrate moieties on cell surfaces, the extracellular matrix, and secreted glycoproteins, and such C-type lectin carbohydrate binding can play an important role in cellular functions (7Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 8Bezouska K. Yuen C.T. O'Brien J. Childs R.A. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Drbal K. Fiserova A. Pospisil M. Feizi T. Nature. 1994; 372: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Alignment of the protein sequences of murine OCIL with human CD69 and rat mannose-binding protein A is shown in Fig. 1. Mannose-binding protein A contains residues conserved in classical C-type lectins that have been shown through biochemical and structural studies to coordinate the binding of Ca2+ and to confer calcium dependence to sugar recognition (7Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). However, members of the NK cell receptor group of C-type lectins, including CD69, murine OCIL (mOCIL), and human OCIL (hOCIL), do not contain these conserved residues. Surface plasmon resonance and crystallographic investigations of the NK cell receptor Ly49A bound to its bacterially expressed major histocompatibility complex I ligand have suggested no requirement for carbohydrate recognition (9Natarajan K. Boyd L.F. Schuck P. Yokoyama W.M. Eliat D. Margulies D.H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These studies did, however, indicate two distinct sites at which Ly49A can bind its ligand, one of which is in close proximity to a conserved major histocompatibility complex I glycosylation site. In some cellular systems, sugar binding may inhibit protein-ligand interactions and subsequent cellular responses. For example, the binding of transfected Ly49C-expressing COS cells to major histocompatibility complex I ligand-expressing cells is blocked by soluble dextran sulfate, λ-carrageenan, and fucoidan (11Brennan J. Takei F. Wong S. Mager D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9691-9694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ly49A-mediated cell adhesion is also inhibited by fucoidan (12Daniels B.F. Nakamura M.C. Rosen S.D. Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Immunity. 1994; 1: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Treatment of H-2Dd major histocompatibility complex class I-expressing target cells with the deglycosylase tunicamycin also prevents binding of Ly49A+ cells to target cells, blocking the inhibitory action of Ly49A and allowing target cell lysis (12Daniels B.F. Nakamura M.C. Rosen S.D. Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Immunity. 1994; 1: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CD69 has also been reported to recognize fucoidan (13Childs R.A. Galustian C. Lawson A.M. Dougan G. Benwell K. Frankel G. Feizi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and because the cross-linking of CD69 by monoclonal antibodies elicits intracellular signals (14Sanchez-Mateos P. Cebrian M. Acevedo A. Lopez-Botet M. De Landazuri M.O. Sanchez-Madrid F. Immunology. 1989; 68: 72-79PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that clustering or cross-linking of CD69 and other C-type lectins at the cell surface may result in physiological responses. Therefore, identification of the sugar binding specificities of OCIL is important to characterize its functions, particularly in bone and other tissues rich in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).In this study, we have determined the carbohydrate binding specificities of mOCIL and hOCIL using soluble recombinant forms of these proteins in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay. Because many (but not all) C-type lectins contain conserved residues for binding calcium (7Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 12Daniels B.F. Nakamura M.C. Rosen S.D. Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Immunity. 1994; 1: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we investigated the calcium dependence of sugar binding by OCIL. We also investigated whether binding of the sugar moieties identified may play a role in mediating the inhibitory action of OCIL on osteoclast formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—d(+)-Glucose and d-maltose were purchased from Merck (Kilsyth, Australia). 2-Deoxy-d-glucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, d(–)-mannose, d(+)-glucose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucopyranose, d(–)-fructose, l(–)-fucose, d-fucose, l-galactose, d(+)-galactose, d-galactose 6-sulfate, and high molecular weight carbohydrates (chondroitin sulfate A (bovine trachea) chondroitin sulfate B (porcine intestinal mucosa), chondroitin sulfate C (shark cartilage), heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa), heparin sulfate (porcine intestinal mucosa), keratan sulfate (bovine cornea), fucoidan (Fucus vesiculosus), λ-carrageenan type IV (Irish moss), and hyaluronic acid (human placenta)) were purchased from Sigma. Heparin sulfate and the chondroitin sulfates were >90% pure, except for chondroitin sulfate A, which was 70% pure, with the other 30% being made up of chondroitin sulfate C. At least two independent lots of each carbohydrate were examined in binding assays. Chemical reagents including sodium metaperiodate, sodium cyanoborohydride, and ABTS and the lectins Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I) and Anguilla anguilla agglutinin (AAA) were also from Sigma.Production of Recombinant OCIL—Expression and purification of recombinant OCIL containing the extracellular domain as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) were carried out. Production of recombinant GST, GST-mOCIL, and GST-hOCIL was carried out as described previously (2Hu Y.S. Zhou H. Myers D.E. Quinn J.M.W. Atkins G.J. Ly C. Gange C. Kartsogiannis V. Elliott J. Kostakis P. Zannettino A.C.W. Cromer B. McKinstry W.J. Findlay D.M. Gillespie M.T. Ng K.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 89-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA sequences corresponding to the extracellular domains of mOCIL (residues 76–207) and hOCIL (residues 71–191) were amplified and inserted into the pGEX-2T plasmid, and the proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, resulting in proteins with N-terminal GST tags. These GST-OCIL fusion proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of a bacterial lysate using glutathione affinity purification beads. The proteins were run on a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel at Mr ∼43,000, close to their predicted molecular weight, and protein identity was confirmed by Western blotting with antiserum specific for mOCIL, hOCIL, or the GST tag. Protein quantity and purity were estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Recombinant mouse GST-RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) fusion protein was prepared from a construct kindly provided by F. Patrick Ross (Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) as described previously (15Lam J. Nelson C.A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Fremont D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Carbohydrate Binding Assays—Sugars were diluted in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) to 2 mg/ml and oxidized with 2 mm sodium metaperiodate on ice for 1 h to yield reactive aldehyde groups. The reaction was stopped by dilution with 3 volumes of 0.2 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Sugars were then further diluted to the desired concentration in carbonate buffer, and 200 μl was added per well to Covalink™ ELISA plates (Nunc, New York, NY) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unbound sugar was removed, and the wells were washed with carbonate buffer. Sugars were then covalently linked to free amine groups present on the well surface with 0.3% sodium cyanoborohydride in 200 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaH2PO4 for 1.5 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (wash buffer) and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V, CSL Ltd., Parkville, Australia) in wash buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. mOCIL, hOCIL, or GST alone (control) was diluted to the desired concentration in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (binding buffer). 200 μl of protein was then added per well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Binding of protein was detected using anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 2500-fold with 0.2% BSA in wash buffer (200 μl) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed twice with wash buffer and blocked again with 2% BSA in wash buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1000-fold in wash buffer containing 0.1% BSA was then added to the wells for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three more times. 200 μl of buffer composed of 25 mm citric acid and 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5) containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and the substrate ABTS (1 mg/ml) was added per well and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The color reactions were measured at 405 nm absorbance. To determine whether binding by mOCIL to the GAGs is calcium-dependent, 5 mm EDTA or 5 mm CaCl2 was included in the binding buffer in which mOCIL or GST was diluted prior to adding to the wells.The data presented are the means of two to five independent experiments in which values were obtained from duplicate wells. The data presented were corrected for background levels when recombinant GST fusion proteins were incubated in wells blocked with BSA alone (no sugar present), unless otherwise specified.Carbohydrate Binding Competition Assays—30 pmol of dextran, dextran sulfate, fucoidan, λ-carrageenan, or hyaluronic acid was coupled per well to Covalink™ ELISA plates as described under “Carbohydrate Binding Assays.” Soluble high molecular weight (HMW) GAGs (150 nm) were co-incubated with mOCIL (10 μg/ml) in binding buffer for 2 h at room temperature prior to the addition of 200 μl/well, resulting in a 10-fold excess of competing soluble sugar compared with immobilized GAG. Detection of binding was carried out as described under “Carbohydrate Binding Assays.”Soluble low molecular weight (LMW) GAGs were used to compete for binding of mOCIL to immobilized fucoidan (30 pmol/well). mOCIL (10 μg/ml) was co-incubated at room temperature in binding buffer with LMW GAGs (0–50 μm). 200 μl was then added per well. Detection of binding was carried out as described under “Carbohydrate Binding Assays.”Osteoclast Formation Assays—Mouse bone marrow cells were prepared by flushing the marrow cavities of femora and tibiae from adult C57BL/6J mice with phosphate-buffered saline. The mouse bone marrow cells were centrifuged and resuspended in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL Ltd.) with penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were added at 105 cells/well to 10-mm diameter plastic tissue culture wells and stimulated with 25 ng/ml human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 100 ng/ml RANKL. GST, mOCIL, UEA-1, AAA, or soluble GAG (dextran, dextran sulfate, fucoidan, or λ-carrageenan) was added at the start of the culture period (day 0) to determine direct effects of these reagents on subsequent osteoclast formation. To investigate whether binding of any of the GAGs to mOCIL could mediate mOCIL action, GAGs were co-incubated at 10 nm with mOCIL for at least 2 h at room temperature prior to addition to cultures on day 0. The culture medium and mediators were removed and replenished on day 3. After 7 days, the cells were fixed and histochemically stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase using an acid phosphatase kit as described previously (16Horwood N.J. Elliott J. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4915-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells with more than three nuclei were counted as osteoclasts. Similar experiments were carried out with UEA-I or AAA in the presence of mOCIL.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out using either a paired t test or analysis of variance as indicated.RESULTSCarbohydrate Binding Specificity of mOCIL and hOCIL— CD69 has been shown previously to bind the HMW sulfated GAG fucoidan using an ELISA-based assay (13Childs R.A. Galustian C. Lawson A.M. Dougan G. Benwell K. Frankel G. Feizi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because of the sequence identity between CD69 and OCIL, we analyzed binding of mOCIL and hOCIL to fucoidan as well as other HMW sulfated GAGs, including λ-carrageenan and dextran sulfate, when these sugars were immobilized to the surface of Covalink™ ELISA wells. Both mOCIL and hOCIL showed significant binding to these three GAGs (Fig. 2). The binding of λ-carrageenan was ∼3.5-fold greater than that of dextran sulfate and 2.5-fold greater than that of fucoidan. No significant binding was observed for unsulfated dextran of a similar molecular weight, indicating that the presence of the sulfate groups may be important for carbohydrate recognition by OCIL. In addition, neither mOCIL nor hOCIL bound hyaluronic acid, an anionic sugar with sialic acid residues rather than sulfate groups, suggesting that the interaction with the sulfated GAGs is not due to nonspecific anionic charge.Fig. 2Specificity of mOCIL and hOCIL binding to immobilized sugars. 30 pmol of sugar was covalently linked to the surface of each well of Covalink™ ELISA plates. Binding by 2 μg of mOCIL, hOCIL, or GST alone was measured for HMW and LMW GAGs. Chondroitin S, chondroitin sulfate. Bars represent means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus GST alone; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sugar moieties that exist in the bone environment such as heparin, heparin sulfate, and keratan sulfate as well as the chondroitin sulfates (A, B, and C) were also analyzed for binding by OCIL. Neither mOCIL nor hOCIL showed significant binding to any of these LMW GAGs when immobilized on the solid surface of ELISA wells (30 pmol/well) compared with the GST control (Fig. 2). No binding was observed when the amount of GAG immobilized was increased to 250 pmol/well (1.25 μm) (data not shown). GST, the recombinant tag for hOCIL and mOCIL, showed no binding to GAGs (Fig. 2).A range of monosaccharides were also analyzed for binding by mOCIL, including maltose, d(+)-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, d(–)-mannose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucopyranose, d(–)-fructose, l(–)-fucose, d-fucose, l-galactose, d(+)-galactose, and d-galactose 6-sulfate. No significant binding was observed (data not shown).Dose-dependent Binding of mOCIL to HMW GAGs—Dose-dependent binding of mOCIL to the HMW GAGs dextran sulfate, fucoidan, and λ-carrageenan was noted when up to 30 pmol of sugar was immobilized per well (Fig. 3A). Binding of λ-carrageenan was greatest, with higher binding achieved at 10 pmol relative to 30 pmol for either dextran sulfate or fucoidan (Fig. 3A). Unsulfated dextran was used as a negative control.Fig. 3Dose response of mOCIL binding to immobilized HMW GAGs. A, increasing amounts of HMW GAGs up to 30 pmol/well were coupled to Covalink™ ELISA plate wells. Binding was carried out with 2 μg of mOCIL (50 pmol). B, increasing amounts of fucoidan up to 240 pmol/well were immobilized, followed by incubation with 2 μg of mOCIL/well (50 pmol). C, 30 pmol of fucoidan was coupled per well, followed by increasing amounts of mOCIL up to 4 μg (100 pmol) for binding. Analysis of mOCIL binding to sugars was carried out as described under “Carbohydrate Binding Assays.” The data presented were corrected for background levels when protein was added to wells blocked with BSA (containing no sugar) as well as wells that were incubated with the GST control protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When increasing amounts of fucoidan were immobilized per well, the addition of 50 pmol of mOCIL/well showed saturation in the range of 30–60 pmol of fucoidan/well (Fig. 3B). Alternatively, when wells were coupled with 30 pmol of fucoidan/well, the addition of increasing amounts mOCIL showed saturation at 50 pmol of mOCIL (Fig. 3C). This is equivalent to saturation at 1.52 pmol of mOCIL/pmol of fucoidan.Calcium-independent Binding of mOCIL to Glycosaminoglycans—To determine whether binding by mOCIL to the GAGs is calcium-dependent, 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA was included in the binding buffer in which recombinant mOCIL or GST was diluted prior to addition to wells for carbohydrate binding. 5 mm CaCl2 was chosen to achieve saturating amounts of Ca2+ based on previous reports of Ca2+ affinities of calcium-dependent C-type lectins in the range of 0.1–1.0 mm (17Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weis W.I. Crichlow G.V. Murthy H.M. Hendrickson W.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Even in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, mOCIL showed no significant increase in the binding capacity for either the HMW or LMW GAGs (Fig. 4). This shows that the mOCIL binding of these HMW sugars is calcium-independent. We did note, however, a decrease in the binding of mOCIL to λ-carrageenan (Fig. 4) and a slight increase in binding to λ-carrageenan in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. The presence of CaCl2 did not enable mOCIL to bind monosaccharides (data not shown).Fig. 4Calcium-independent binding of mOCIL to immobilized sugars. Data were obtained using the carbohydrate binding ELISA, for which mOCIL was added for binding to immobilized sugars in the presence of either 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. Binding by 2 μg of mOCIL (50 pmol) was carried out for HMW and LMW GAGs. Chondroitin S, chondroitin sulfate. Bars represent means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus α-minimal essential medium (MEM) alone; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Competition of Soluble and Immobilized Sugars for mOCIL Binding—To determine whether the capacity of OCIL to bind sugars is influenced if the sugar is soluble rather than immobilized, soluble HMW GAGs preincubated with mOCIL at a 10-fold excess (300 pmol/well) were used to compete with immobilized sugars. The mOCIL/soluble HMW sugar mixture was then added to ELISA wells containing the immobilized GAGs. In the absence of competing soluble sugars, mOCIL showed the same profile for binding to immobilized dextran sulfate, fucoidan, and λ-carrageenan (Fig. 5A) as noted previously in Fig. 2. No competition of mOCIL binding to immobilized fucoidan, dextran sulfate, or λ-carrageenan was observed upon co-incubation of mOCIL with soluble hyaluronic acid, a HMW sugar that mOCIL did not recognize in an immobilized form (Fig. 5A). mOCIL binding to immobilized dextran sulfate, fucoidan, or λ-carrageenan was greatly reduced in the presence of soluble dextran sulfate, fucoidan, or λ-carrageenan (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Inhibition of immobilized carbohydrate binding of mOCIL by soluble carbohydrates. Soluble carbohydrates were pre-incubated with mOCIL (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature prior to addition to Covalink™ ELISA plate wells containing the immobilized sugar. Subsequent binding of mOCIL to immobilized sugars was measured. A, 300 pmol (150 nm) of soluble HMW GAGs was used to compete for mOCIL binding to 30 pmol of immobilized HMW sugar. B, soluble LMW GAGs (50 μm) were co-incubated with mOCIL prior to addition of 200 μl to wells containing 30 pmol of immobilized fucoidan. C, increasing doses of LMW GAGs were co-incubated with mOCIL prior to addition of 200 μl to wells containing 30 pmol of immobilized fucoidan. Chondroitin S, chondroitin sulfate.

https://openalex.org/W1978553966,"Acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1), also denoted Runx1, is a transcription factor essential for hematopoiesis, and the AML1 gene is the most common target of chromosomal translocations in human leukemias. AML1 binds to sequences present in the regulatory regions of a number of hematopoiesis-specific genes, including certain cytokines such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) up-regulated after T cell receptor stimulation. Here we show that both subunits of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CN), which is activated upon T cell receptor stimulation, interact directly with the N-terminal runt homology domain-containing part of AML1. The regulatory CN subunit binds AML1 with a higher affinity and in addition also interacts with the isolated runt homology domain. The related Runx2 transcription factor, which is essential for bone formation, also interacts with CN. A constitutively active derivative of CN is shown to activate synergistically the GM-CSF promoter/enhancer together with AML1 or Runx2. We also provide evidence that relief of the negative effect of the AML1 sites is important for Ca2+ activation of the GM-CSF promoter/enhancer and that AML1 overexpression increases this Ca2+ activation. Both subunits of CN interact with AML1 in coimmunoprecipitation analyses, and confocal microscopy analysis of cells expressing fluorescence-tagged protein derivatives shows that CN can be recruited to the nucleus by AML1 in vivo. Mutant analysis of the GM-CSF promoter shows that the Ets1 binding site of the promoter is essential for the synergy between AML1 and CN in Jurkat T cells. Analysis of the effects of inhibitors of the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β and in vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation analysis of Ets1 suggest that glycogen synthase kinase-3β-phosphorylated Ets1 is a target of AML1-recruited CN phosphatase at the GM-CSF promoter."

This raised the possibility of a different mechanism for archaeal tyrosine recombinase. The residues of IntSSV tentatively involved in catalysis were modified by site-directed mutagenesis, and the properties of the corresponding mutants were studied. The results show that all of the targeted residues are important for activity, suggesting that the archaeal integrase uses a mechanism similar to that of bacterial or eukaryotic tyrosine recombinases. In addition, we show that IntSSV exhibits a type IB topoisomerase activity because it is able to relax both positive and negative supercoils. Interestingly, in vitro complementation experiments between the inactive integrase mutant Y314F and all other inactive mutants restore in all cases enzymatic activity. This suggests that, as for the yeast Flp recombinase, the active site is assembled by the interaction of the tyrosine from one monomer with the other residues from another monomer. The shared active site paradigm of the eukaryotic Flp protein may therefore be extended to the archaeal tyrosine recombinase IntSSV.

The shared active site paradigm of the eukaryotic Flp protein may therefore be extended to the archaeal tyrosine recombinase IntSSV. Tyrosine recombinases form a large family of site-specific recombinases comprising more than 150 members, most of which were identified on the basis of sequence similarities (1Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Within this family, several subfamilies can be defined such as the λ-phage integrase family, the Xer recombinases family, or the yeast plasmid recombinases family (1Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The hallmark of tyrosine recombinases is the conservation of six noncontiguous residues: ArgI, Lysβ, HisII, ArgII, His/Trp, Tyr (Table I). This motif is directly involved in catalysis of DNA strand cleavage and strand exchange (for review, see Ref. 3Van Duyne G. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 93-117Crossref Google Scholar). Five of the six residues are located within the highly conserved boxes I and II found in tyrosine recombinases (1Esposito D.

Cis cleavage is the result of cis activation/cis cleavage where the tyrosine of the bound monomer attacks the nearby activated phosphate. In trans cleavage, binding of a monomer to its site leads to activation of the adjacent phosphodiester that will be attacked by a nucleophile (here a tyrosine) provided in trans by a partner monomer, a mechanism that can be described as cis activation/trans cleavage. In both cases the chemistry of the reaction is conserved and is similar to that used by topoisomerases IB (18Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The ArgI, HisII, and ArgII side chains coordinate the scissile phosphate, activating it for nucleophilic attack by the tyrosine and stabilizing the resulting transient penta-coordinated phosphate. In some proteins, the His/Trp side chain forms a hydrogen bond to the nonbridging oxygen of the scissile phosphate (19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), whereas in Flp this residue is more likely involved in protein-protein interactions (20Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) reveal that this residue contacts the base adjacent to the cleavage site in the minor groove. Other structural data show that Lysβ is located on a loop displaying a high conformational flexibility (9Hickman A.B. Waninger S. Scocca J.J. Dyda F.

In a previous work we have shown that IntSSV exhibits a cleavage mechanism dependent on Tyr314, leading to the formation of a 3′-phosphoprotein intermediate like other tyrosine recombinases (26Serre M.C. Letzelter C. Garel J.R. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16758-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, IntSSV harbors substitutions at several conserved positions (Fig. 1 and Ref. 2Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and cannot be classified phylogenetically in any subgroup of the tyrosine recombinases family. Whether the recombination reaction catalyzed by IntSSV would follow the general mechanism described for tyrosine recombinases or would be different in archaea remained an open question (27Redder P. Faguy D. Brügger K. She Q. Garrett R.A. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 1060-1073Crossref Google Scholar). To characterize further the site-specific recombination mechanism in archaea we have generated IntSSV mutants and analyzed their enzymatic properties. Eight positions were targeted, including the putative six conserved catalytic residues identified by sequence alignments (Fig. 1). In the absence of a full recombination assay available in vitro, we have tested the different mutants for their binding to target sequence, covalent complex formation, and cleavage/religation properties. We found that IntSSV has a type IB topoisomerase activity, a property shared by some other tyrosine recombinases (28Abremski K. Wierzbicki A. Frommer B. Hoess R.H. J. Biol.

All of the mutants generated alter the enzymatic properties of IntSSV, indicating that the residues targeted are likely involved in the catalytic process. The conservative changes of some catalytic residues in IntSSV, with regard to the consensus, may reflect an adaptation of the active site to thermophily and/or may be the signature of the primitive active site that evolved to give the tyrosine recombinase and topoisomerase IB catalytic pockets (18Cheng C.

Importantly, in vitro complementation assays between Y314F and all other IntSSV inactive mutants restored both cleavage and DNA relaxation activities, suggesting that as for the yeast Flp recombinase, the IntSSV active site could be assembled by dimer association. The shared active site model may therefore be extended to an archaeal tyrosine recombinase. Bacterial Strains—Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for cloning and plasmid amplification, except for pGEM-SN180 and pGEM-P207, which were constructed in strain One shot Top10 (Invitrogen). Strains TG1 and RZ1032 were used for M13-based site-directed mutagenesis. Overexpression of recombinant wild-type or IntSSV mutants was carried out in strain MC1061. Strains TG1 and RZ1032 were grown in 2YT medium and all others in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin when necessary. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—The R304H mutant was obtained by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions, with plasmid pSG3 (26Serre M.C. Letzelter C. Garel J.R. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16758-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as a template. The others mutations were introduced by M13 site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (33Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) but with T7 DNA polymerase for the elongation step. The nucleotide sequence of the different mutated fragments was verified by sequencing (Applied Biosystem, ABI 370) prior to recloning in the expression vector pSG3. The integrase mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (26Serre M.C. Letzelter C. Garel J.R. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16758-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) in the different buffers up to the gel filtration step. Preparation of DNA Substrates—Plasmids pGEM-P207 and pGEM-SN180 were constructed as follows. The 207-bp fragment P207, containing the specific POP′ sequence, was amplified by PCR using plasmid pKSattP (24Muskhelishvili G. Palm P. Zillig W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as template and the primers SattP (5′-GAACGCCTTTATGTTGCC-3′) and RattP(5′-TACGTGGGTCCTTTAGCTG-3′). The PCR product was then cloned into the pGEM-Teasy T-tailing vector (Promega), and the resulting plasmid pGEM-P207 was used as specific substrate in the relaxation assay. The 180-bp fragment SN180, containing no specific sequence for IntSSV binding, was amplified by PCR using plasmid pKSattB (24Muskhelishvili G. Palm P. Zillig W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as template and the primers 5SN (5′-GGCGAACGTGGCGAG-3′) and 3SN180 (5′-CCCGCACCGATCGCCCTTCCC-3′). The PCR product was then cloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector, and the resulting plasmid pGEM-SN180 was used as nonspecific substrate in the relaxation assay. Negatively supercoiled plasmids used in the relaxation assay were purified on a CsCl gradient. Positively supercoiled DNA was obtained by incubating 2.5 μg of negatively supercoiled pKSattB with purified Thermotoga maritima reverse gyrase (kindly provided by C. Bouthier de la Tour). The reaction was done in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 μg/ml BSA for 30 min at 85 °C. The sample was then phenol extracted and DNA ethanol precipitated. The positively supercoiled plasmid was resuspended in water at a final concentration of 100 ng/μl. For band shift experiments the P207 and SN180 PCR products were purified by using the Nucleospin Extract kit (Macherey-Nagel). The P207 fragment was then 5′-end labeled on both strands using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, 5000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Biosciences). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by spin dialysis. For cleavage experiments, the XT oligonucleotide (5′-TTCCGCCTCCGGAGCCGGA-3′) was either 3′-end labeled using [α-32P]ddATP and terminal nucleotidyl transferase or 5′-end labeled by [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by spin dialysis, and the labeled oligonucleotide was hybridized in TE buffer with a 2-fold excess of unlabeled complementary strand, XB (5′-ACTCCGGCTCCGGAGGCGGA-3′). The resulting substrate is referred as to XTB (26Serre M.C. Letzelter C. Garel J.R. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16758-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Reactions and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay— The DNA binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of a mixture composed of 10 nm 5′-end-labeled P207 substrate, 0.2 μm wild-type or mutant IntSSV, in a binding buffer composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature. 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) was then added to the reaction mix. The DNA binding reactions were loaded onto an 8% nondenaturating acrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol. Electrophoresis was performed in 1× TGE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 8 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 4 h at 7.5 V/cm. The DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. Filter Binding Assay—12.5 nm 5′-end-labeled XTB substrate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 2 μm wild-type or mutant IntSSV in the binding buffer described previously. Each reaction mixture was spotted under vacuum on a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran 0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) and the spot washed three times by 20 μl of binding buffer. The membrane was heated 2 h at 80 °C, and the protein-DNA complexes were visualized by phosphorimaging. The binding efficiency of each protein was quantified using the ImageQuant version 1.2 software. The results presented are the mean of three independent experiments. Cleavage Assays—For covalent complex formation, 12.5 nm 5′-end-labeled XTB substrate was incubated with 1 μm wild-type or mutant integrase in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 125 mm NaCl for 3hat65 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer (final concentrations: 40 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 8% glycerol, 250 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) and heating for 5 min at 98 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and covalent complex formation was visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging of the gel. Determination of the cleavage position was performed by incubating 1 or 2 μm wild-type or mutant IntSSV with 12.5 nm 3′-end-labeled XTB substrate in the conditions described above. Reactions were stopped by the addition of formamide dye (97.5% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 0.3% xylene cyanol blue) and heating for 5 min at 98 °C. One-fifth of each reaction was loaded on an 18% polyacrylamide gel (19:1) containing 8 m urea, in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA), and electrophoresis was performed at 52 V/cm. Cleavage products were visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging of the gel. DNA Relaxation Assay—12.5 nm plasmid pGEM-P207, pGEM-SN180, or pKSattB was incubated with the indicated amount of IntSSV (wild-type or mutant) in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 125 mm NaCl for 3 h at 65 °C. poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was used as nonspecific competitor when indicated. After incubation, samples were treated with SDS (0.5% final) and 10× loading buffer (100 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, 40% glycerol, and 0.35% bromphenol blue) was added. Reaction mixes were loaded on a 2% agarose gel, and electrophoresis was performed in 1× TEP buffer (90 mm Tris phosphate, 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature for 4 h at 3.5 V/cm. DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Relaxation assays with calf thymus topoisomerase IB (Invitrogen) were done as follow. 12.5 nm plasmid was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μl of topoisomerase (corresponding to 5–15 units) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 30 μg/ml BSA in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were stopped and analyzed as described above. To monitor the activity of IntSSV on positively or negatively supercoiled substrates, the reaction products were analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (34Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After the first dimension was performed as described above, the second dimension was run in a perpendicular direction in TEP buffer containing 3 μg/ml chloroquine for 15 h at 0.8 V/cm. Chloroquine was removed by washing the gel in water for at least 3 h. The distribution of topoisomers was then visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Mutagenesis Strategy and Production of IntSSV Mutants within the Conserved Motifs of Tyrosine Recombinases—The signature of tyrosine recombinases is the conservation of two short regions of similarity in their C-terminal part (1Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Within these regions, six residues are strictly conserved and were shown to be directly involved in catalysis by biochemical studies and crystal structures of tyrosine recombinases and topoisomerases IB (for a review, see Ref. 3Van Duyne G. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 93-117Crossref Google Scholar). Alignment of IntSSV with members of the tyrosine recombinase family suggested that they correspond to residues Arg211, Arg240, Lys278, Arg281, Arg304, and Tyr314 in IntSSV (Fig. 1 and Table I). All of these positions were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, as well as two other less conserved positions Glu214 and Lys282, which correspond to positions conserved at more than 80% within the tyrosine recombinases conserved boxes I and II (Fig. 1). The two latter residues were shown to play a role in the catalytic process mediated by the Flp recombinase (35Chen J.W. Evans B.R. Yang S.H. Araki H. Oshima Y. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Grainge I. Lee J. Xu C.J. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 717-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 37Lee J. Serre M.C. Yang S.H. Whang I. Araki H. Oshima Y. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Within IntSSV three of the six conserved residues are divergent from the tyrosine recombinases consensus, namely Arg240, Lys278, and Arg304. We have replaced all divergent residues with the consensus residues, and in addition we have introduced either aliphatic or residues with an opposed charge at these positions (Table I). Residues Glu214 and Lys282 were targeted with the same rationale. None of the mutations introduced altered the level of expression nor the purification behavior of proteins (Fig. 2), although two mutants showed an increased sensitivity to proteolysis (R281L and R304L). All mutant proteins were therefore purified as described previously for wild-type IntSSV (26Serre M.C. Letzelter C. Garel J.R. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16758-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with the addition of a mixture of inhibitors in all buffers up to the chromatographic step. All IntSSV Mutants Are Still Able to Bind the att Sites— IntSSV activity depends on its ability to recognize and bind specific DNA sites. We analyzed the binding efficiency of IntSSV on a substrate that carries the POP′ core sequence of the attP site (Fig. 3A) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3B). In the absence of competitor DNA, three protein-DNA complexes of retarded electrophoretic mobility can be observed, referred as to CI, CII, and LMC (low mobility complexes), the major species obtained corresponding to the CII complex (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Adding increasing amounts of nonspecific DNA (SN180) to the reaction leads to the disappearance of the LMC to the benefit of CII (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). At a molar ratio of up to 1:20 (specific:nonspecific), the CI and CII complexes are also competed (lane 5). The apparent affinity of IntSSV for its core site is relatively low but in the same order of magnitude as that observed for binding of the λ-Int to its POP′ site in the absence of IHF (38Moitoso de Vargas L. Pargellis C.A. Hasan N.M. Bushman E.W. Landy A. Cell. 1988; 54: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A simple interpretation of this profile is that CI could reflect the binding of one monomer of IntSSV to one “core-type” site (P or P′) and CII the binding of a dimer to both core-type sites (P and P′). The heterogeneous third complex, LMC, could either represent higher order structures of CI and/or CII or more likely be generated by nonspecific binding of more than two monomers of IntSSV along the substrate. To verify whether the IntSSV mutants were still able to bind DNA, we analyzed their ability to generate protein-DNA complexes with attP. Given the apparent low affinity of IntSSV for this substrate, the experiment was realized in the absence of competitor DNA. The DNA binding profile of most of the mutants is similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3C). However, the ratio of complexes over the free substrate depends on the mutation introduced. Mutants E214N, R240K, R281L, K282L, R304H, R304L, and Y314E behave as the wildtype protein with regard to the amount of CII formed. Mutants K278H, K278L, and K282H generate a somewhat reduced amount of CI and CII. At the same time the LMC disappear as the free substrate amount increases. The last class of mutants (R211L, R211Q, E214K, R240L, and Y314F) generate less CI and CII but about the same amount of LMC as the wild-type protein. Among these, some mutants retain a large amount of substrate in the wells, possibly by nonspecific aggregation (see E214K, R240L, and R281L in Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, all of the mutants generally conserved the property to generate CI and CII, and CII is systematically the most abundant, suggesting that it is the more stable IntSSV-DNA association. IntSSV Has a Topoisomerase IB Activity—Previous work on IntSSV described an in vitro test for recombination (24Muskhelishvili G. Palm P. Zillig W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Muskhelishvili G. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 605-608Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, like others, we were unable to reproduce the published data. While attempting to set up new conditions for an in vitro recombination assay, we found that IntSSV has a DNA relaxation activity (Fig. 4) as some other tyrosine recombinases (28Abremski K.

We have investigated the effect of modifying the structure of nonribosomal RNA substrates on their interaction with ME1 and other RIPs. ME1 was shown to depurinate a variety of partially denatured nucleic acids, randomly removing adenine residues from single-stranded regions and, to a lesser extent, guanine residues from wobble base-pairs in hairpin stems. A defined sequence motif was not required for recognition of non-paired adenosines and cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond. Substrate recognition and ME1 activity appeared to depend on the physical availability of nucleotides, and denaturation of nucleic acid substrates increased their interaction with ME1. Pretreatment of mRNA at 75 °C rather than 60 °C, for example, lowered the apparent KD from 87.1 to 73.9 nm, making it more vulnerable to depurination by RIPs. Exposure to ME1in vitro completely abolished the infectivity of partially denatured RNA transcripts of the potato spindle tuber viroid, suggesting that RIPs may target invading nucleic acids before they reach host ribosomes in vivo. Our data suggest that the extensive folding of many potential substrates interferes with their ability to interact with RIPs, thereby blocking their inactivation by ME1 (or other RIPs).

Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) 1The abbreviations used are: RIP, ribosome-inactivating protein; RTA, ricin A-chain; PAP, pokeweed antiviral protein; PSTVd, potato spindle tuber viroid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; SSO, small synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. are cytotoxic enzymes that have been identified in plants, fungi, and bacteria and act as glycosidases that specifically cleave nucleotide N-glycosidic bonds (1Endo Y. Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that RIPs inhibit protein synthesis by virtue of their enzymatic activity, selectively removing a specific adenine residue from the highly conserved and surface-exposed α-sarcin/ricin loop in the large rRNA (1Endo Y. Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol.

This enzymatic cleavage prevents the binding of the EF-2·GTP complex to the ribosome, with the subsequent arrest of protein synthesis and eventually cell death (4Osborn R.W. Hartley M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The universally conserved adenine residue A4324 of the eukaryotic 28 S rRNA was long considered the only enzymatic substrate of RIPs, but several lines of evidence have recently identified a variety of alternative substrates. For instance, it has been shown that several RIPs can release adenine from multiple sites in rRNA (5Barbieri L. Ferreras J.M. Barraco A. Ricci P. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, saporin-L1 can release adenine residues from a variety of nucleic acid substrates, including poly(A), mRNA, tRNA, and DNA (6Barbieri L. Gorini P. Valbonesi P. Castiglioni P. Stirpe F. Nature. 1994; 372: 624Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P. Pession A. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). More than 50 other RIPs are active on DNA (8Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Certain RIPs also display enzymatic activity toward RNA transcripts derived from various plant and animal viruses including the human immunodeficiency virus (6Barbieri L. Gorini P. Valbonesi P.

However, enzymatic activity on these non-ribosomal substrates requires a high protein:substrate ratio, and the biological relevance of these observations is unclear. Several studies using the ricin A-chain (RTA) have suggested that RIP catalytic activity requires a specific substrate structure such as a tetraloop with the sequence 1GAGA4 (17Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marchant A. Hartley M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Orita M.

The stem of this structure possesses tilted Watson-Crick base pairing in the stem with an unusual G1:A4 base pairing in the loop region (19Orita M. Nishikawa F. Shimayama T. Taira K. Endo Y.

The depurination site adenine (A2) occupies an exposed position outside the solvent-accessible loop, whereas the other nucleotide bases are buried within the phosphodiester backbone by hydrogen bonding and base stacking. In contrast, pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) does not exhibit an absolute requirement for the tetraloop structure to exhibit enzymatic activity (18Marchant A. Hartley M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recent reports propose that PAP recognizes and binds to the cap structure of mRNAs, specifically depurinating downstream adenine residues (21Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Hudak K.A. Bauman J.D. Tumer N.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on these results, PAP may bind to capped viral RNA, subsequently depurinating viral RNAs rather than host ribosomes during the infection process (21Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis does not explain the activity of PAP with substrates such as rRNA or DNA that lack a cap structure (8Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for this remarkable array of enzymatic activities include inherent differences among RIPs, the diversity of RNA substrates, or, as explored in this paper, differences in experimental conditions. Temperature, pH, and ionic composition of the assay buffer change not only the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of RIPs but also their target sites (7Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P. Pession A.

Acta. 2001; 1519: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Experimental conditions also determine the catalytic activities of different RIPs (8Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Efficient catalysis may require that the substrate(s) assume a particular structural conformation induced by specific experimental conditions. These observations prompted us to ask whether the structural changes of substrates induced by experimental treatments such as heating could affect the enzymatic activity of RIPs. RNAs are highly flexible molecules whose structures are influenced by such factors as the vectorial nature of transcription and translation, trans-acting factors, the presence of RNA-binding proteins or RNA chaperones, and the cellular environment, including ion homeostasis (25Schroeder R. Grossberger R. Pichler A. Waldsich C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus far, studies of RNA secondary structure have been carried out almost exclusively in vitro, and it remains to be proven whether conclusions from these studies also apply in vivo. For example, a recent study of telomerase RNA has shown that RNA structures can be different in vitro and in vivo, as exemplified by the in vitro formation of the phylogenetically conserved pseudoknot in the 5′-part of the telomerase RNA, which was not observed in vivo (26Antal M. Boros E. Solymosy F. Kiss T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 912-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Importantly, changes in RNA structure in vivo can cause loss of the ability to interact with other molecules (27Nikolcheva T. Woodson S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Experimental variables such as temperature or ionic concentration often trap RNAs in inactive conformations that interfere with their interactions with other molecules (28Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 29Bonin M. Zhu R. Klaue Y. Oberstrass J. Oesterschulze E. Nellen W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have systematically perturbed the conformation of various nucleic acids to further understand the substrate specificity of RIPs. Our results demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of ME1, an RIP from Mirabilis expansa, on non-ribosomal substrates is highly structure-dependent. Extensive structural folding caused by experimental conditions was found to interfere with the interaction of ME1 and nonribosomal substrates. Enzymatic specificity and kinetics vary with the conformation of non-ribosomal substrates, and a specific motif was not found to be necessary for substrate recognition by ME1. Proteins—ME1 was purified from storage roots of M. expansa using immunoaffinity chromatography. A polyclonal antibody raised previously in our laboratory against reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography-purified ME1 (30Vivanco J.M. Savary B.J. Flores H.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose at pH 8.0. Total root proteins of M. expansa were equilibrated with 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to facilitate protein-ligand interaction, and immunobound proteins were then eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, containing 0.5 m NaCl. ME1 was further separated using cation-exchange chromatography (POROS HS; Applied Biosystems), resulting in >99% pure protein as judged by SDS-PAGE with silver staining and sequence analysis. Purified RTA and saporin-S6 were purchased from Sigma. Their purities were checked by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, and protein concentration was determined as described by Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNA and Oligonucleotide—The open reading frame region of pap-h was amplified by PCR from hairy roots of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) using gene-specific primers 5E.30 (5′-ATGCATGTTCATCTGATCAATCATAAAAGT-3′) and 3E.28 (5′-ATCAGAATCCCTGAAATAGATTACCAAG-3′) designed from its cDNA sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number AY071928). The PCR product was then subcloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega). pGEM®-T Easy recombinant plasmids encoding defense-related genes B26, Tom RP-O′b, and At2g14610 were gifts of Dr. Christopher B. Lawrence (Department of Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). The small oligonucleotide 23SSO-A12 (5′-GGGCCGGCGGUACCGCCGGCGCC-3′) was synthesized by the Macromolecular Resources Facility (Department of Biochemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). Isolation of Ribosomes—To isolate ribosomes, yeast cells (10 g, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH500) and leaves of M. expansa (50 g) were ground in liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle, and 100 ml of extraction buffer (200 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm EGTA, 200 mm sucrose, and 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) was added. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was layered onto a sucrose cushion (1 m sucrose for yeast ribosomes and 2 m sucrose for M. expansa ribosomes, 20 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) in Ti-70 tubes (Beckman Instruments) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C (L-70 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments). The pellets were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) with 25 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2. A further preparation of protein-free rRNAs was extracted from ribosomes with phenol:chloroform (1:1, v/v) and precipitated with ethanol for 2 h at –80 °C. Preparation of Substrates—DNA fragments encoding the pap-h open reading frame were amplified from the corresponding pGEM®-T Easy plasmids by PCR using gene-specific primers 5E.30 and 3E.28. After electrophoresis in a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel and staining in 0.5 mg·ml–1 ethidium bromide, the DNA fragments were excised from the gel and recovered using the Quantum Prep gel slice kit (Bio-Rad). pap-h, B26, Tom RP-O′b, and At2g14610 mRNAs were transcribed from the corresponding pGEM®-T Easy plasmid DNAs using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Template DNAs were linearized by SpeI digestion and purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Transcription reactions containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 9 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin, the four nucleoside triphosphates at 1.5 mm each, 50 nm DNA templates, and 3 units/μl T7 polymerase were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) RNA transcripts were synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase, plasmid pST64-B5 (32Cress D. Kiefer M.C. Owens R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6821-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as a template, and four nucleoside triphosphates with or without supplemental 5′-[α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Transcription reactions were subsequently extracted with phenol and chloroform, and the nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol for 2 h at –80 °C before purification by electrophoresis on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer, 5 m urea and elution in 500 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA. RNA transcripts were then recovered by ethanol precipitation. Heat Treatment and Depurination Analysis—Partial denaturation of DNA and RNA substrates was carried out for 30 s at various temperatures (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 °C). Each reaction (15 μl) contained ∼150 nm either DNA in incubation buffer PS-1 (10 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.7, 2.5 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3.75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) or RNA transcripts in buffer PS-2 (1.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm EDTA). Reactions were quenched by placing the tubes on ice. Following addition of 85 μlofRIP incubation buffer PS-3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 40 mm KCl) containing 1 ng of RIP, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Nucleic acids incubated in the absence of RIPs served as negative controls. Following incubation, RIPs were removed by phenol:chloroform (1:1, v/v) extraction, and the aqueous phase containing the nucleic acids was divided in half. One aliquot was incubated for 30 min on ice with 1 m aniline acetate (pH 4.5) before precipitation with ethanol; the second aliquot was precipitated directly. Both aniline-treated and untreated nucleic acids were fractionated by electrophoresis in 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and stained with ethidium bromide. Adenine release from a small synthetic oligonucleotide (SSO) substrate (i.e. 23SSO-A12) was measured as described by Zamboni et al. (33Zamboni M. Brigotti M. Rambelli F. Montanaro L. Sperti S. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Following preincubation at 45 °C for 30 s in buffer PS-2, the SSO (10 nm) was diluted into buffer PS-3 and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the absence and presence of RIP. One volume of cold ethanol was added, and after 10 min at –80 °C, the ethanol-soluble fractions were recovered by centrifugation. Free adenine was converted into its etheno derivative by diluting a 0.2-ml portion of the ethanol-soluble fractions to 1 ml with H2O, adding 0.4 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.1, containing 0.14 m chloroacetaldehyde, and then heating the samples in a water bath at 80 °C for 40 min. Fluorescence was measured in an Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 280 and 400 nm, respectively. Temperature-gradient Gel Electrophoresis—Temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis of 32P-labeled PSTVd RNAs was carried out using a commercially available apparatus (Qiagen). The horizontal 5% polyacrylamide, 0.17% bisacrylamide gel and buffer reservoirs contained 0.2× Tris-borate-EDTA, 5 mm NaCl. Following preelectrophoresis at 26 °C (200 V, 30 min), PSTVd transcripts (∼40,000 cpm) were diluted with 165 μl of loading buffer (18 mm NaCl, 17 mm sodium cacodylate, 3 mm cacodylic acid, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and 25 μl of loading dye (50% glycerol, 1× Tris-borate-EDTA, 2% bromphenol blue-xylene cyanol) and applied to the single 12-cm sample slot. Sixty min later, the current flow was stopped for 30 min while a 25–65 °C temperature gradient was established across the gel. Upon resumption of electrophoresis, the voltage was increased to 350 V, and 1 h 45 min later, the gel was fixed in 10% (v/v) ethanol, 1% (v/v) acetic acid and dried before overnight autoradiography. Primer Extension—pap-h mRNA transcripts treated with ME1 as described above were purified by extraction with phenol:chloroform and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol followed by ethanol precipitation. RNAs were resuspended in 5 μl of 2× primer extension buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, 2 mm dNTPs) and annealed for 20 min at 58 °C with an oligonucleotide primer (5′-CTTTGGCTTGATTGCGTAGAG-3′) complementary to a sequence located 200 bases downstream from the 5′-end of pap-h mRNA. Primer extension by reverse transcriptase was carried out for 30 min at 42 °C in a final reaction volume of 20 μl with the addition of 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer. RNA templates were destroyed by incubation with RNase A before the addition of formamide loading buffer (20 μl) to terminate the reaction. Following electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea, extension products were visualized by silver staining using the Silver Sequence™ DNA sequencing system (Promega). The position of the 5′-end was verified by comparison with a DNA sequencing ladder from a pGEM®-T Easy plasmid encoding pap-h that was prepared with the same primer used for primer extension. In-line Probing of RNA—Values for the half-maximal apparent dissociation constant (apparent KD) of each construct were determined by conducting in-line probing of RNA, wherein the concentration of the ME1 was varied between 0 and 100 μm. Composite plots of the fraction of RNA cleaved at specific sites versus the logarithm of the concentration of ME1 were generated to provide an estimate of the apparent KD. Fraction-cleaved values were normalized relative to the highest and lowest cleavage values measured for each site. The graphs were generated and analyzed using the Gel Doc 2000 gel documentation system and quantification software (Bio-Rad). PSTVd Infectivity Assays—PSTVd transcripts incubated in the presence or absence of ME1 after partial denaturation were diluted with 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of either 10 or 100 pg/μl. Aliquots (10 μl) were then placed on the carborundum-dusted cotyledons of 7-day-old tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill cv. Rutgers) seedlings and gently rubbed with the side of a sterile micropipette tip. Control plants were inoculated with buffer alone. Inoculated seedlings were maintained for 4–6 weeks in a greenhouse under conditions suitable for viroid replication and periodically tested for the presence of PSTVd progeny by dot-blot hybridization using full-length, digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes specific for (+)PSTVd (34Podleckis E.V. Hammond R.W. Hurtt S.W. Hadidi A. J. Virol. Methods. 1993; 43: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunopurification of ME1—To obtain ME1 with a high degree of purity in a single step, we used an affinity chromatography approach involving a polyclonal anti-ME1 antibody. This antibody, which was raised previously in our laboratory (30Vivanco J.M. Savary B.J. Flores H.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), was used as a ligand to generate an affinity matrix via coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose. Total root proteins of M. expansa were applied to the column, and immunobound proteins were eluted with pH linear gradients as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the single protein peak produced by the elution process contained two protein bands. These bands corresponded to ME1 (30 kDa; Ref. 35Vepachedu R. Bais H.P. Vivanco J.M. Planta. 2003; 217: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and ME2 (27 kDa; Ref. 30Vivanco J.M. Savary B.J. Flores H.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), two RIPs previously found to be present in M. expansa roots. ME1 was further purified by cation-exchange chromatography, and its RNA N-glycosidase activity was confirmed with ribosomes prepared from S. cerevisiae as described previously (36Park S.-W. Lawrence C.B. Linden J.C. Vivanco J.M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 164-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the immunopurified ME1 depurinated the 28 S rRNA and released the diagnostic 367-nucleotide fragment upon treatment with aniline, thereby demonstrating that immunopurified ME1 is an enzymatically active RIP. Activity of ME1 on Partially Denatured Non-ribosomal Substrates—As the first step in understanding the enzymatic activity of RIPs on nucleic acids, we examined the reaction catalyzed by ME1 on such partially denatured non-ribosomal substrates as DNA, rRNA isolated from yeast ribosomes, And mRNA encoding PAP-H (RIP identified in the hairy roots of pokeweed; Ref. 36Park S.-W. Lawrence C.B. Linden J.C. Vivanco J.M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 164-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Before incubation with ME1, each nucleic acid substrate was preheated to temperatures ranging from 30 to 90 °C to induce structural modifications. Non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and base stacking that stabilize double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can be disrupted by simply raising the temperature. When a depurinated nucleic acid is treated with aniline, the phosphodiester backbone undergoes cleavage at the site(s) of depurination, and small nucleotide fragment(s) are released. As a result, the amount of intact nucleic acid quantitatively decreases. As shown in Fig. 2A, the fact that dsDNA levels were not affected by preincubation at 30 °C followed by incubation with ME1 and aniline treatment indicates that ME1 neither depurinates nor degrades dsDNA. Increasing the preincubation temperature to 45 or even 75 °C resulted in the release of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but ME1 activity remained undetectable. In contrast, the quantitative decrease in intact ssDNA template visible in the electrophoretic profiles of dsDNA preincubated at 90 °C showed that ME1 readily depurinates ssDNA. Data presented in Fig. 2B showed that ssDNAs produced at >80 °C were susceptible to ME1, and incubation of ssDNA released by pretreatment at 90 °C with as little 100 pg of ME1 resulted in detectable depurination (Fig. 2C). Most importantly, the enzymatic activity of ME1 was both rapid and spontaneous. The fact that ssDNA depurination was completed in ≤30 s (Fig. 2D) allowed us to assess ME1-nucleic acid interaction before nucleic acid substrates were able to refold at 37 °C (see Supplemental Fig. 1). Throughout this study, aniline treatment of partially denatured nucleic acids alone did not result in cleavage (results not shown). We next examined the catalytic action of ME1 on two partially denatured RNA substrates. As shown in Fig. 3A (lanes d and e), ME1 was not active on deproteinized rRNAs stored at 0 °C. Data presented in Fig. 3B show, however, that preincubation of rRNAs at relatively low temperatures (i.e. 45 and 60 °C) followed by exposure to ME1 resulted in the depurination of 26 S rRNA. Increasing the preincubation temperature to 75 °C resulted in depurination of both 26 S and 18 S rRNA. These results were similar to those obtained with ssDNA substrates; i.e. exposure to as little as 100 pg of ME1 resulted in the rapid (≤30 s) depurination of rRNA (data provided as Supplemental Fig. 2). Interestingly, the electrophoretic pattern showed that the ME1-depurinated rRNAs released fragments of many different sizes after aniline treatment. Because rRNA templates were stable up to 90 °C under the buffer conditions used (Fig. 3A, lanes f–i), the fragment patterns observed in Fig. 3B indicate that ME1 can depurinate rRNAs at multiple sites. As shown in Fig. 3C, heat-treated pap-h mRNA was also susceptible to ME1. Taken together, these results indicate that (i) onset of ME1 enzymatic activity is closely related to the secondary structure of potential single-stranded nucleic acid substrates and that (ii) ME1 cleavage of physically available N-glycosidic bonds is random. Activity of ME1 on a Single-stranded RNA with Multiple Adenines—To further examine the enzymatic activity and specificity of ME1 on partially denatured mRNA substrates, pap-h mRNA synthesized in vitro was incubated with ME1 and subjected to primer extension analysis using a primer annealing 200 bases downstream from its 5′ terminus. Inspection of the electrophoretic profiles shown in Fig. 4A reveals that pap-h mRNA fragmentation was highly temperature-dependent. Preincubation of pap-h mRNA at temperatures >45 °C led to modification/cleavage at several sites. ME1 activity was greater on mRNA pretreated at 75 °C than on those preincubated at lower temperatures. Several sites (e.g. A11, A19, A25, A45, A64, A68, and A108) were susceptible to ME1 at all temperatures. None of the ME1-targeted sites, however, showed any sequence homology, indicating that ME1 recognition and catalysis do not require a defined sequence motif. As shown in Fig. 4B, the results of primer extension were largely congruent w"

The G residues originate from a postpolymerization reaction catalyzed by mannuronan C-5-epimerases (MEs), leading to extensive variability in M/G ratios and distribution patterns. Alginates containing long continuous stretches of G residues (G blocks) can form strong gels, a polymer type not found in alginate-producing bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. Here we show that the Pseudomonas syringae genome encodes a Ca2+-dependent ME (PsmE) that efficiently forms such G blocks in vitro. The deduced PsmE protein consists of 1610 amino acids and is a modular enzyme related to the previously characterized family of Azotobacter vinelandii ME (AlgE1–7). A- and R-like modules with sequence similarity to those in the AlgE enzymes are found in PsmE, and the A module of PsmE (PsmEA) was found to be sufficient for epimerization. Interestingly, an R module from AlgE4 stimulated Ps-mEA activity. PsmE contains two regions designated M and RTX, both presumably involved in the binding of Ca2+. Bacterial alginates are partly acetylated, and such modified residues cannot be epimerized. Based on a detailed computer-assisted analysis and experimental studies another PsmE region, designated N, was found to encode an acetylhydrolase. By the combined action of N and A PsmE was capable of redesigning an extensively acetylated alginate low in G from a non gel-forming to a gel-forming state.

A. vinelandii encodes a family of seven members (AlgE1–7) of Ca2+-dependent ME that are secreted to the surface and extracellular environment. The genes encoding these isoenzymes have been sequenced, cloned, and expressed in our laboratory (19Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol.

These enzymes can be divided into G block-producing (e.g. AlgE2), and MG block-forming (e.g. AlgE4) enzymes (22Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Schjerven H. Svanem B.I. Valla S. Metab.

By using AlgE1 as a model, the A module was shown to determine the epimerization pattern and to be sufficient for epimerization, whereas the reaction rate is influenced by the R modules (25Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plant pathogenic bacteria are able to sense changes in their environment and can adapt accordingly by altering the expression of genes specifically required during pathogenesis or epiphytic growth. For example, P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 causes typical bacterial blight symptoms on soybean plants when the bacteria are grown at 18 °C prior to inoculation, but not from bacteria grown at 28 °C (26Budde I.P. Ullrich M.S. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, PG4180 produced optimal levels of the virulence factor coronatine at 18 °C and negligible amounts at 28 °C (27Palmer D.A. Bender C.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to coronatine, alginate is produced as a loosely attached capsule by many P. syringae strains, and the production seems to be correlated with virulence (28Keith R.C. Keith L.M. Hernandez-Guzman G. Uppalapati S.R. Bender C.L. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Yu J. Peñaloza-Vázquez A. Chakrabarty A.M. Bender C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although PG4180 also produces alginate (30.Keith, R. C. (2002) Expression of Alginate in Response to Environmental Stress and Plant Signals. M.S. thesis, 91 pp., Oklahoma State UniversityGoogle Scholar), temperature-dependent production of alginate has not been reported for this strain. Unlike alginates from Azotobacter sp., those produced by Pseudomonas sp. are not known to contain homopolymeric G blocks (31Skjåk-Bræk G. Espevik T. Carbohydrates Eur. 1996; 14: 19-25Google Scholar). Ullrich et al. (32Ullrich M.S. Schergaut M. Boch J. Ullrich B. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) used a promoter-trapping strategy to identify P. syringae PG4180 promoters with induced expression at 18 °C when compared with 28 °C. Sequencing of several hundred nucleotides of the transcriptional fusion contained in plasmid p561 revealed the presence of an open reading frame with 53% amino acid identity to the extracellular epimerase AlgE2 from A. vinelandii (32Ullrich M.S. Schergaut M. Boch J. Ullrich B. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of this gene (designated psmE) and show that it encodes a bifunctional enzyme possessing both G block-forming ME activity and mannuronan-O-acetylhydrolase activity.

Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), whereas transformations utilizing rubidium chloride were performed according to a Northwest Fisheries Science Center protocol (available at micro.nwfsc.noaa.gov/protocols/rbcl.html). Plasmids were isolated using the Qiagen midi kit (Qiagen) or the Wizard plus SV minipreps kit (Promega). All cloning was done in Escherichia coli DH5α, and the expression plasmids were later transferred to E. coli ER2566. DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI Prism Dye Primer cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an ABI 373A apparatus. Construction and Screening of a P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 Gene Library—For library construction, genomic DNA of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 was isolated as described by Staskawicz et al. (34Staskawicz B.J. Dahlbeck D. Keen N.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6024-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and purified on CsCl-EtBr gradients (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A PG4180 genomic library was constructed in pRK7813 as described previously (36Barta T.M. Kinscherf T.G. Willis D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3021-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Tcr E. coli transfectants were screened by colony hybridization. Plasmid p561 was provided by Dr. Matthias Ullrich (International University Bremen, Bremen, Germany). An 835-bp DNA probe was amplified from p561 by PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-ATACAGCAGCCATTCAGGCCACTA-3′ and 5′-TGCTCAGGGTGTTATCAAAGACATCCAC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was isolated from agarose gels and labeled with digoxigenin using the Genius Labeling and Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) or with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rad Prime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). Hybridization and post-hybridization washes to the PG4180 cosmid library were conducted using high stringency conditions. Sequence Analysis—Sequence manipulations, amino acid alignments, phenograms, and restriction maps were constructed using the Sci Ed Central Clone Manager Professional Suite. Data base searches were performed with the BLAST service of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Preliminary genomic sequence data were obtained for P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 from The Institute for Genomic Research (www.tigr.org/), and for P. syringae pv. syringae B728a from the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (www.jgi.doe.gov/). Fold recognition was done by using the Structure Prediction Meta Server (bioinfo.pl/Meta/). This web server combines the output from several different prediction methods through a jury system (3D-Jury) (37Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Classification of 3D structures into fold classes were based on the database Structural Classification of Protein (38Lo Conte L. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G.

Structure data were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (40Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27313) Google Scholar), and fold-related alignments were generated with ClustalX (41Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35409) Google Scholar) and Alscript (42Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In Vitro Mutagenesis—The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two primers were used to introduce a BspHI site comprising the start codon; forward: 5′-CCGGAGTAACATCATGATATTAAACAC-3′ and reverse: 5′-GTGTTTAATATCATGATGTTACTCCGG -3′. Changed nucleotides are underlined, and the resulting BspHI sites are shown in bold. Alginate Substrates—5-3H-Labeled, chemically deacetylated alginate and unlabeled, O-acetylated alginate were prepared from P. aeruginosa (17Rehm B.H. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contained less than 7% G residues. The 1-13C-labeled and unlabeled mannuronan (100% M, chemically deacetylated) were prepared from an epimerase-defective (algG) P. fluorescens mutant (18Gimmestad M. Sletta H. Ertesvåg H. Bakkevig K.

Valla S. Skjåk-Bræk G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alginate containing alternating MG residues (MG-alginate) was produced in vitro from mannuronan by using recombinantly produced AlgE4 (23Høidal H.K. Ertesvåg H. Skjåk-Bræk G. Stokke B.T. Valla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12316-12322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alginate from the leaves of Laminaria hyperborea and LF 10/60, which is an L. hyperborea stripe alginate, were obtained from FMC Biochemicals, Drammen, Norway. Alginate from Macrocystis pyrifera was obtained from Sigma. Measurement of Epimerase Activity by Radiolabeling—For enzyme purification, E. coli ER2566 cells containing selected plasmids were grown in a medium containing 30 g/liter Tryptone, 15 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl. Enzyme extracts were prepared and partially purified by fast protein liquid chromatography as described previously (22Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Schjerven H. Svanem B.I. Valla S. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Crude extracts for which activities are indicated were prepared by growing the cells for 3 h at 37 °C in medium supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. The temperature was lowered to 18 °C, and cultures then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.25 mm) and grown at the low temperature for 16 h before harvesting. 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.8, containing 4 mm CaCl2) was used for cell disruption and 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.8, containing 1 mm CaCl2) for protein purification. In the assay 50 mm MOPS with varying pH and CaCl2 concentrations was used. Epimerase activities were quantified by measuring the liberation of tritium from [5-3H]alginate to water as described previously (44Ertesvåg H. Skjåk-Bræk G. Bucke C. Methods in Biotechnology 10, Carbohydrate Biotechnology Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 71-78Google Scholar). One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to epimerize 1 μmol of substrate (sugar residues in deacetylated mannuronan) in 1 min. The amounts of protein in the samples were estimated by using the Bio-Rad Coomassie Brilliant Blue-based protein assay (Bio-Rad). Measurement of Epimerase and Acetyl Hydrolase Activities by 1H NMR—In general low molecular weight mannuronan with a degree of polymerization, DPn, of ∼30 was used as substrate in the epimerase assay. In one experiment a high molecular weight mannuronan was used. Other alginate substrates were epimerized under similar conditions. In the acetylhydrolase assay, a high molecular weight P. aeruginosa alginate with an initial fraction of O-acetyl groups of 0.7 and an initial fraction of G, FG, of 0.07 was used as the substrate. The reactions were performed in a total volume of 6 ml, containing 20 mm Mops (pH 6.8), 1 mm CaCl2 (3 mm CaCl2 in the acetylhydrolase experiments), and 7.5 mg of alginate. Different reaction levels were achieved by varying the amount of enzyme or the incubation time. High molecular weight samples were partially hydrolyzed prior to the 1H NMR recordings as described previously (44Ertesvåg H. Skjåk-Bræk G. Bucke C. Methods in Biotechnology 10, Carbohydrate Biotechnology Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 71-78Google Scholar). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 300 (300 MHz) spectrometer, and FG, FGG, FMM, FGM,MG, FMGM, and FGGG were calculated from the integrated spectra as described by Grasdalen (45Grasdalen H. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 118: 255-260Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The degree of acetylation was calculated from the integrated spectra as described by Skjåk-Bræk et al. (12Skjåk-Bræk G. Grasdalen H. Larsen B. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 154: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Portions of these samples were chemically deacetylated (44Ertesvåg H. Skjåk-Bræk G. Bucke C. Methods in Biotechnology 10, Carbohydrate Biotechnology Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 71-78Google Scholar) prior to the 1H NMR recordings to permit calculation of the degree of epimerization. Time-resolved 13C NMR Spectroscopy—Prior to the NMR recording, the epimerase was partially purified by fast protein liquid chromatography, dialyzed against a low ionic strength buffer, and lyophilized. Individual solutions (final concentrations are shown) in D2O of the different components, Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.4 at 37 °C), [1-13C]mannuronan (9 mg), CaCl2 (2.5 mm), NaCl (20 mm), and epimerase (1 mg of lyophilized powder), were prepared separately, and calculated volumes were then transferred into an NMR sample tube (0.5-ml volume). Spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 300 (75 MHz) spectrometer. To monitor the progress of a single epimerization experiment, a series of 60 successive 13C NMR spectra were recorded as described by Hartmann et al. (43Hartmann M. Duun A.S. Markussen S. Grasdalen H. Valla S. Skjåk-Bræk G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each spectrum was calculated from 400 scans, which represents an average of 18 min. We chose to set the time for each result as the end-time for each uptake. The scanning for the first spectrum was started 13 min after the addition of the enzyme. The reaction was continued until the fraction of G residues no longer increased. The annotation of the signals and the calculation of FG, FM, FGG, FMG, FMM, and FGM from the integrated spectra was done according to Grasdalen et al. (46Grasdalen H. Larsen B. Smidsrød O. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 89: 179-191Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Putative Mannuronan C-5-epimerase from P. syringae—The 2.0-kb insert in plasmid p561, previously reported to contain an algE2-like region (32Ullrich M.S. Schergaut M. Boch J. Ullrich B. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was fully sequenced, and found to be similar to the entire A module of algE2 and the corresponding parts of the six other known A. vinelandii algE genes. In silico translation of the sequence revealed an ORF encoding the putative A module beginning 346 bp from the mini-Tn5 insertion in p561; however, a stop codon was not identified within the 2.0-kb cloned fragment. Therefore, it was necessary to obtain a clone containing more of the 3′ part of the putative gene, and for this purpose a cosmid library of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 was constructed in pRK7813. An 835-bp PCR fragment derived from the A module region of p561 was used to screen the library for clones containing the full-length ORF. Several cosmids were hybridized with the probe, and a clone designated pMF9 was chosen for further analysis. An 11-kb HindIII fragment from the insert in pMF9 was cloned in pET21a, forming pMT9.2. Sequence analysis of this insert revealed a stop codon in a 4830-bp ORF, which contained the putative epimerase. The gene represented by this ORF was designated psmE. Sequence Analysis of the Deduced psmE Product—Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence of PsmE showed that it contains 1610 amino acids and has a modular structure that can be described as A-R1-R2-M-R3-N-RTX-S (Fig. 1A), where A and R refer to sequences sharing similarity with the A and R modules of AlgE1–7. S refers to a sequence at the C terminus, which is also similar to the corresponding ends of the AlgE epimerases. The putative A module in PsmE comprises 383 amino acids and terminates with the sequence FPLVT. This module shares 61–67% nucleotide and 54–61% amino acid sequence identity to the A. vinelandii AlgE A modules (Fig. 1B), clearly suggesting an evolutionary relationship (Fig. 2A). The next 150 amino acids (residues 384–533) comprise the R1 module in PsmE. With the exception of AlgE4, the A. vinelandii AlgE epimerases contain more R than A modules, and the diversity of their sequences is also somewhat broader than among the A modules (20Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Svanem B.I. Skjåk-Bræk G. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 68-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phenogram in Fig. 2B illustrates that the PsmE R1 module is more similar to the A. vinelandii AlgE R modules than to R2 and R3 (154 amino acids each) in PsmE.Fig. 2Phenograms constructed based on the multiple sequence alignments.

https://openalex.org/W2034174471,"Skp1 is an adaptor-like protein in E3SCF-ubiquitin ligases and other multiprotein complexes of the cytoplasm and nucleus. In Dictyostelium, Skp1 is modified by an unusual pentasaccharide containing a Galα1-Fuc linkage, whose formation is examined here. A cytosolic extract from Dictyostelium was found to yield, after 2400-fold purification, an activity that could transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to both a Fuc-terminated glycoform of Skp1 and synthetic Fuc conjugates in the presence of Mn2+ and dithiothreitol. The microsomal fraction was devoid of activity. The linkage formed was Galα1,3Fuc based on co-chromatography with only this synthetic isomer conjugate, and sensitivity to α1,3/6-galactosidase. Skp1 exhibited an almost 1000-fold lower Km and 35-fold higher Vmax compared with a simple α-fucoside, but this advantage was abolished by denaturation or alkylation of Cys residues. A comparison of a complete series of synthetic glycosides representing the non-reducing terminal mono-, di-, and trisaccharides of Skp1 revealed, surprisingly, that the disaccharide is most active owing primarily to a Vmax advantage, but still much less active than Skp1 itself because of a Km difference. These findings indicate that α-GalT1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme whose modification of Skp1 requires proper presentation of the terminal acceptor disaccharide by a folded Skp1 polypeptide, which correlates with previous evidence that the Galα1,3Fuc linkage is deficient in expressed mutant Skp1 proteins.

The best characterized complex is the family of E3SCF-ubiquitin ligases that target modified proteins for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the 26 S proteasome (6Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In this complex, Skp1 serves as an adaptor to link the catalytic E2-ligase via cullin-1 to the F-box protein specificity factor (7Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). In the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium, Skp1 is nearly quantitatively modified by a pentasaccharide at a hydroxyproline near its C terminus, in a region of the protein that associates with the F-box partner (8Teng-umnuay P.

The function of glycosylation is not known, but partial glycosylation is necessary for nuclear concentration of Skp1, and cells that are genetically unable to extend the core monosaccharide are smaller and grow to higher saturation densities (9Sassi S.

These sugar nucleotide-dependent enzymes are novel in their soluble nature and absence of rough endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequences or membrane anchor motifs. Therefore, at least the early steps of Skp1 glycosylation are mediated by a novel pathway of cytoplasmic enzymes (5West C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14West C.M. van der Wel H. Gaucher E.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 17R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics studies suggest that a related modification pathway occurs in the cytoplasm of other lower eukaryotes including a diatom and an oomycete (15West C.M. van der Wel H. Sassi S. Gaucher E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; (10.1016/j.bbagen.2004.04.007)Google Scholar). The Fuc terminus of the core trisaccharide of Dictyostelium Skp1 is further modified by two α-linked Galp residues whose linkages have not been established (8Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14West C.M. van der Wel H. Gaucher E.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 17R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mechanism of α-galactosylation is not known but it seems likely that it will involve novel sugar nucleotide-dependent enzymes in the cytoplasm or nucleus. It is not known whether the Skp1 enzymes will be more related to α-GalTs of the eukaryotic Golgi or those that extend lipopolysaccharides and other glycoconjugates in the prokaryotic cytoplasm (16Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unlike expressed wild-type Skp1, two mutant Skp1s containing amino acid substitutions in their N-terminal regions are poorly glycosylated in vivo (9Sassi S. Sweetinburgh M. Erogul J. Zhang P. Teng-umnuay P. West C.M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis of one, Skp1A1(HW120)-myc, showed that it consists of a mixture of the unmodified protein and glycoforms terminated with GlcNAc, Fuc, or one or two α-Gal residues (8Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Incomplete peripheral galactosylation might result from inefficient addition of the sugar or increased susceptibility to its removal. These intermediate glycoforms of Skp1A1(HW120)-myc are potentially useful acceptor substrates for assaying the activity of the GalTs whose substrates are accumulated, as found for the Skp1 GlcNAcT activity (11Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36392-36402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the function of the peripheral α-Gals is not known, they appear to be heterogeneous between two normal cellular pools of Skp1 (17West C.M. Kozarov E. Teng-umnuay P. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). α-Galp residues are non-reducing terminal modifications of O- and N-linked glycans of selected secretory glycoproteins in subhuman animals and microorganisms (18Taylor S.G. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Pederson L.L. Turco S.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 259-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), where they constitute potent xenoantigens and might contribute to specific recognition determinants. With the ultimate goal of understanding the role of peripheral α-galactosylation in the cytoplasm and assessing its phylogenetic range, we have undertaken an investigation of the enzymatic basis of this modification on Skp1. A screen of an ion exchange fractionation of a cytosolic extract of Dictyostelium cells using mutant Skp1A1(HW120)-myc as an acceptor yielded a prominent α-GalT activity that was partially purified and characterized. α-GalT1 appears to be a cytoplasmic GT like the earlier enzymes in the pathway. Based on studies of model acceptor compounds, α-GalT1 modifies the blood group H (type 1) trisaccharide of Skp1 by the addition of an α-Gal to the 3-position of Fuc. The modification is greatly potentiated by normally folded Skp1 in a manner that suggests the importance of conformation of the acceptor sugar structure. These findings provide an explanation for why mutant Skp1 is incompletely α-galactosylated in vivo. Buffers were adjusted to their pH values at 22 °C, filtered, degassed, and stored at 5 °C. DTT and protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (final concentrations), were added just before use. Buffer A was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, and the protease inhibitors. Buffer B was 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaEDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and the protease inhibitors. Buffer C was 85 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.4), 20% (v/v) saturated (NH4)2SO4, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT. Buffer D was 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.4), 15% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT. Buffer E was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT. Buffer F was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Cell Growth and Lysis—Dictyostelium discoideum strain HW302 (9Sassi S. Sweetinburgh M. Erogul J. Zhang P. Teng-umnuay P. West C.M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which overexpresses a normal copy of Skp1B, was grown in 2 30-liter batches of HL-5 axenic growth medium at 22 °C to maximum cell density (∼107 cells/ml), collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 1 min, resuspended in H2O, centrifuged again, and resuspended in buffer A at 2 × 108/ml. Cells were immediately filtered through a bed of glass wool, lysed by forced passage through a 5-μm pore diameter Nuclepore filter (20West C.M. Scott-Ward T. Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. Kozarov E. Huynh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12024-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and successively centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 2 min and 100,000 × g for 70 min to yield the cytosolic supernatant S100 fraction that was chromatographed immediately as described below. For small scale preparations, the glass wool prefilter step was skipped, and the pellet from the 100,000 × g centrifugation was resuspended in buffer B, recentrifuged, and resuspended in buffer B again. The resulting S100 and washed P100 fractions were frozen at –80 °C. DEAE-Sepharose Chromatography—Each S100 fraction (from 30 liters) was pumped onto a 450-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated at 4 °C in buffer B, and the column was washed with buffer B until the A280 returned to near baseline. The column was eluted with a 2.5-liter linear gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl in buffer B, followed by 400 ml of 0.25 m NaCl in buffer B. Column fractions were frozen at –80 °C and aliquots were assayed for GalT activity (see below). Phenyl-Sepharose Chromatography—Fractions from the main GalT activity peak from both DEAE-Sepharose runs were pooled, adjusted to 20% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded at 4 °C onto a 2.6 × 20-cm column of phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (high sub) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with buffer C until the A280 returned to baseline level, and eluted with a descending linear 750-ml gradient of buffer C to buffer D. The column was washed with buffer D until the A280 returned to near baseline level, and a 750-ml ascending linear gradient from 0 to 70% ethylene glycol in buffer D, followed by 200 ml of 70% ethylene glycol in buffer D was then applied. Q-Sepharose Chromatography—The active fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose column were divided into three pools, and each loaded separately, at 4 °C, onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer E. The column was washed with buffer E until the A280 was less than 0.01. The column was eluted at 21 °C, with a 50-ml linear gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl in buffer E, followed by a 10-ml gradient of 0.25–0.5 m NaCl in buffer E. Superdex 200 Chromatography—The pooled GalT activity from the three Q-Sepharose columns was concentrated in a Centriprep 30 ultrafiltration device (Amicon) to 2.2 ml at 4 °C, and loaded onto a 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer F. The column was eluted with buffer F at 1 ml/min at 21 °C. Mr values of the calibration standards were 200,000, sweet potato β-amylase; 66,000, bovine serum albumin; and 29,000, carbonic anhydrase. Protein Determination—Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method (Pierce Coomassie Plus), or calculated from A280 values, assuming A0.1%280 = 1.0. Assay Conditions—GalT activity was assayed by the transfer of [3H]Gal from UDP-[6-3H]Gal (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) to synthetic glycosides or Skp1. Unless indicated otherwise, reactions (15–60 μl) contained 1–5 μm UDP-[3H]Gal (13,200–64,000 disintegrations/min/pmol), acceptor substrate as described below, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and were incubated at 22 °C for 30–120 min. In some tests containing 3H-labeled acceptor substrates (see below), UDP-[U-14C]Gal (300 mCi/mmol; American Radiochemical Corp.) was used in place of the tritiated compound. Early purification fractions (up through Q-Sepharose) were assayed in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 1 mm NaF. To determine the pH optimum, the enzyme was diluted into the following buffers (100 mm): MES-NaOH (pH 6.0–6.6), MOPS-NaOH (pH 6.6–7.4), and HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4–8.0). Synthetic Acceptor Substrates—Fucα1,2Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1-pNP (21Matta K.L. Rana S.S. Piskorz C.F. Abbas S.A. Carbohydr.

Res. 1981; 96: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were synthesized previously. Galβ1,3GlcNAcα1-Bn was synthesized according to the method described for the preparation of Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1-Bn (23Rana S.S. Barlow J.J. Matta K.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 96: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fucα1-Me, Fucα1-allyl, and Fucα1-Bn were obtained by the reaction of l-fucose and alcohol in the presence of acidic resin Dowex 50-X (H+). For example, l-fucose on treatment with benzyl alcohol under these conditions yielded Fucα1-Bn (24Flowers H. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 74: 177-185Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Fucα1,2(Galα1,6)Galβ1-Bn and Fucβ1,2(Galα1,6)Galβ1-Bn will be described later. 2R. D. Locke, Sirajud-Doulah. K, and K. L. Matta, unpublished data. Concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient for Bn glycosides of 3.4 × 102m–1 cm–1 at 255 nm, and for pNP glycosides of 1.15 × 104m–1 cm–1 at 300 nm. Concentrations of the other glycosides were determined by sugar composition analysis based on hydrolysis in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 100 °C, followed by chromatography in 17 mm NaOH on a PA-10 column (Dionex) and quantitation by integrated pulsed amperometry as described (25Kozarov E. van der Wel H.

Fucα1,2Galβ1,3GlcNAcα1-Bn and Fucα1,2Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1-Bn were produced by enzymatic fucosylation of Galβ1,3GlcNAcα1-Bn and Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1-Bn, respectively, using soluble recombinant Skp1 FT85 FucT purified from Escherichia coli strain ER2566 transfected with pTY(CBD-FT85) (13van der Wel H. Fisher S.Z. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46527-46534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After induction, harvest, and lysis, the bacterial extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. At 4 °C, the supernatant was made 15% saturated in (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged again. The supernatant was loaded onto a 35-ml column of phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (high sub) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 15% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer C. Elution was performed with a 140-ml linear gradient of buffer C to buffer D. After a 35-ml wash with buffer D, a second, 170-ml gradient of 0–70% (v/v) ethylene glycol in buffer E was applied followed by 35 ml of 70% ethylene glycol in buffer E. Fractions were assayed for α1,2-FucT using Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1-pNP as described (25Kozarov E. van der Wel H. Field M. Gritzali M. Brown Jr., R.D. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3022-3030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Active fractions were recovered from the second gradient and loaded onto a 3.3-ml DEAE 5PW column (Toso Haas) equilibrated in buffer B at 22 °C. The column was washed with buffer B, eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer B, and active fractions were pooled. The disaccharide-Bn compounds were incubated for 24 h at 21 °C in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 0.1 m NaCl, with a 4-fold excess of GDP-[3H]Fuc and an aliquot of purified Skp1 FucT. The reaction mixture was applied to a C18 reversed phase column and eluted as described below. The fucosylated derivative eluted in a baseline separated peak based on A254 and confirmed by scintillation counting of aliquots of the fractions. Concentration was determined from the specific activity of the incorporated [3H]Fuc. Skp1A1(HW120)-myc—Skp1A1(HW120)-myc was purified through the monoclonal antibody 3F9 step as previously described (13van der Wel H. Fisher S.Z. West C.M. J. Biol.

Skp1A1(HW120)-myc, which contains 2 missense mutations (I34T, D71G) in its N-terminal region, consists of a mixed population of glycoforms (8Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T.

Fucosylated Skp1 from Strain HL250 —Skp1 was purified from Dictyostelium strain HL250 as described above for Skp1A1(HW120)-myc. This strain, unable to synthesize GDP-Fuc, accumulates Skp1 containing the Galβ1,3GlcNAc-disaccharide (8Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The disaccharide on Skp1(HL250) was fucosylated using soluble recombinant Skp1 FT85 FucT as described above for the disaccharide-Bn compounds. Skp1(HL250) was incubated for 48 h at 21 °C with a 4.4-fold excess of GDP-fucose and a 5-fold excess of purified Skp1 FucT needed for complete fucosylation as determined in parallel aliquots supplemented with GDP-[3H]Fuc (data not shown). Fucosylated Skp1 was diluted 2-fold with water and applied to a 0.24-ml mini-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B at 22 °C on an Amersham Biosciences SmartSystem HPLC, and eluted with a 3-ml linear gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl in buffer B. Skp1-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with monoclonal antibody 3F9 (9Sassi S. Sweetinburgh M. Erogul J. Zhang P. Teng-umnuay P. West C.M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Reaction—Reactions containing the Skp1 substrates were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 700 μl of ice-cold 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After incubation on ice for 1 h, samples were vacuum-filtered through GF/C glass fiber filters pre-wetted with icecold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The reaction tube was rinsed with 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid that was also applied to the filter. The filter was rinsed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 4 times with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone, and counted in 10 ml of Scintiverse BioHP (Fisher) with a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Alternatively, reaction mixtures were diluted in 2× sample buffer and separated on 7–20% SDS-PAGE gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, followed by excision of the region of the gel containing Skp1 as described (12van der Wel H. Morris H.R. Panico M. Paxton T. Dell A. Kaplan L. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46328-46337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Negative control samples were either quenched at time 0, contained no acceptor substrate, or no enzyme, and subtracted as background as indicated. Reactions containing synthetic glycosides were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold water or 1 mm EDTA. For the Bn and pNP derivatives, the mixture was filtered over a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Millipore) mounted on a 10-position Visiprep vacuum manifold (Supelco). After seven 5-ml water washes, each Sep-Pak was eluted with 5 ml of MeOH into a scintillation vial. 15 ml of Scintiverse LS was added and the sample was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. For methyl and allyl derivatives, the mixture was applied to a 0.5-ml column of Dowex-1 (Sigma) prewashed with 5 column volumes of 1 n HCl and 20 column volumes of water. The 1-ml flow-through fraction and three 1-ml water washes were collected in a 20-ml scintillation vial, diluted with 4 volumes of Scintiverse LC, and analyzed for disintegrations/min as above. Product Characterization—To identify the position of substitution by Gal, Fuc1α-Bn was reacted with the purified pool of α-GalT1 in the presence of 1 mm UDP-[3H]Gal for varied periods of time, to compare partially and fully modified preparations. The reaction product was recovered by elution from a C18 Sep-Pak with MeOH. The dried material was dissolved in 10 mm ammonium formate (pH 4.0) and applied to a C18-reversed phase column (4.6 × 250 mm, TSK ODS-120T, 5 μm) according to Ref. 26Toomre D.K. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. The column was eluted in a gradient of 0–40% acetonitrile in the same buffer at 22 °C at 1 ml/min. The eluate was monitored by measuring A254 and liquid scintillation counting of fractions. Positional isomers of Galα1-Fucα1-Bn were synthesized in a two-step process that included: 1) condensation of the appropriately blocked benzyl-1-O-α-l-fucoside with methyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-(O-4-methoxybenzyl)-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as the glycosyl donor, and 2) deprotection of the resulting disaccharide.2 Products were characterized by NMR and MS.2 To determine sensitivity of incorporated radioactivity to digestion with α-galactosidase, Fucα1,2Galβ1-pNP (0.6 mm) was reacted in the presence of the purified pool of α-GalT1 and UDP-[3H]Gal (1.8 mm) until completion as determined by incorporation of [3H]Gal. The reaction product was recovered by elution from a C18 Sep-Pak with MeOH as above and taken to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge.

https://openalex.org/W2018208962,"Gβγ-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels have distinct gating properties when activated by receptors coupled specifically to Gαo versus Gαi subunit isoforms, with Gαo-coupled currents having ∼3-fold faster agonist-evoked activation kinetics. To identify the molecular determinants in Gα subunits mediating these kinetic differences, chimeras were constructed using pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive GαoA and Gαi2 mutant subunits (GαoA(C351G) and Gαi2(C352G)) and examined in PTX-treated Xenopus oocytes expressing muscarinic m2 receptors and Kir3.1/3.2a channels. These experiments revealed that the α-helical N-terminal region (amino acids 1-161) and the switch regions of Gαi2 (amino acids 162-262) both partially contribute to slowing the GIRK activation time course when compared with the GαoA(C351G)-coupled response. When present together, they fully reproduce Gαi2(C352G)-coupled GIRK kinetics. The Gαi2 C-terminal region (amino acids 263-355) had no significant effect on GIRK kinetics. Complementary responses were observed with chimeras substituting the Gαo switch regions into the Gαi2(C352G) subunit, which partially accelerated the GIRK activation rate. The GαoA/Gαi2 chimera results led us to examine an interaction between the α-helical domain and the Ras-like domain previously implicated in mediating a 4-fold slower in vitro basal GDP release rate in Gαi1 compared with Gαo. Mutations disrupting the interdomain contact in Gαi2(C352G) at either the αD-αE loop (R145A) or the switch III loop (L233Q/A236H/E240T/M241T), significantly accelerated the GIRK activation kinetics consistent with the Gαi2 interdomain interface regulating receptor-catalyzed GDP release rates in vivo. We propose that differences in Gαi versus Gαo-coupled GIRK activation kinetics are due to intrinsic differences in receptor-catalyzed GDP release that rate-limit Gβγ production and is attributed to heterogeneity in Gαi and Gαo interdomain contacts. Gβγ-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels have distinct gating properties when activated by receptors coupled specifically to Gαo versus Gαi subunit isoforms, with Gαo-coupled currents having ∼3-fold faster agonist-evoked activation kinetics.

We propose that differences in Gαi versus Gαo-coupled GIRK activation kinetics are due to intrinsic differences in receptor-catalyzed GDP release that rate-limit Gβγ production and is attributed to heterogeneity in Gαi and Gαo interdomain contacts. Cardiac and neuronal Gβγ-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) 1The abbreviations used are: GIRK, Gβγ-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PTX, pertussis toxin; ACh, acetylcholine. are activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) selectively coupled to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gαi/oβγ proteins (1Stanfield P.R. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 145: 47-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar). The time course for GIRK channel activation elicited by application of receptor agonist can be influenced by the multiple intervening steps of the G protein cycle that begin with agonist binding to the GPCR, and end with Gβγ binding to the GIRK channel subunits that promote gating transitions to the open state. In addition to the G protein activation steps, signal termination with GTP hydrolysis by the Gα subunit and Gβγ reassociation also impacts the kinetics and amplitude of agonist-activated GIRK currents. The ternary complex consisting of agonist, GPCR, and G protein influences the time course of agonist-elicited GIRK channel currents (3Benians A. Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that isoform composition of different GPCR-Gαi/oβγ protein-RGS protein-GIRK channel signaling complexes have different kinetic properties that affect their functional output (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We recently reported notable differences in the gating properties of GIRK channels activated by muscarinic m2 receptors coupled specifically to PTX-insensitive Gαi isoforms (Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3) versus Gαo isoforms (GαoA or GαoB) in the Xenopus oocyte system (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ACh-elicited activation time course for Gαo-coupled GIRK currents was ∼3-fold faster than for Gαi-coupled GIRK currents, and Gαo expression was significantly more effective than the Gαi isoforms at reducing receptor-independent basal GIRK channel activity. To identify the molecular determinants responsible for these differences, we constructed several PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras and examined their functional properties in the Xenopus oocyte system via coupling to muscarinic m2 receptors and GIRK channels. The GαoA/Gαi2 chimera experiments indicate the kinetic differences between GαoA and Gαi2 involve an interdomain interaction that led us to examine a previously identified domain-domain contact in Gαi1 that slows the basal (receptor-independent) GDP release rate compared with Gαo in vitro (5Remmers A.E. Engel C. Liu M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gαi2 mutations designed to disrupt the domain-domain interaction accelerated GIRK activation rates consistent with the biochemical studies of mutant Gαi1 subunits that increased basal GDP release rates (5Remmers A.E. Engel C. Liu M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus our findings establish experimental conditions whereby the GPCR-catalyzed Gα GDP release rate is the rate-limiting step in receptor-dependent GIRK activation as originally proposed by Breitwieser and Szabo (6Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 469-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) for IK,ACh in atrial myocytes, and importantly identifies molecular determinants that mediate functional differences in GIRK channels activated by GPCRs coupled to Gαi and Gαo proteins that may impact the kinetics and magnitude of inhibitory GIRK channel-mediated postsynaptic currents (7Greif G.J. Sodickson D.L. Bean B.P. Neer E.J. Mende U. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Design and Construction of PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 Chimeras—Fig. 1A shows the amino acid sequence alignment of all five Gαi/o isoforms with corresponding secondary structures determined from crystallographic studies of Gαi1 (8Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). PTX-insensitive GαoA(C351G) and Gαi2(C352G) subunits, which have 68% sequence identity, were used to construct PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras. Gαi/o subunits are comprised of three major domains: 1) an N-terminal α-helix (αN) that contains lipid-modified residues for membrane attachment and mediates in part GPCR and Gβγ interactions, 2) a closely packed α-helical domain (αHD) that encloses the guanine nucleotide binding cleft and is thought to regulate GDP/GTP exchange rates, and 3) a Ras-like domain that binds guanine nucleotides at highly conserved “switch regions” to regulate conformational changes effecting Gβγ association and dissociation (9Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Six different PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras were constructed exchanging three major regions: 1) the combined αN-αHD region (with the exception of the αE-αF linker and αF), 2) the three switch regions (SWI-III) located within the Ras-like domain, and 3) the carboxyl region containing remaining elements of the Ras-like domain (Fig. 1, B and C). The Gαi2(C352G) or GαoA(C351G) sequence corresponding to these three swapped regions are indicated in the naming of each constructed chimera; e.g. Giio,Goii,Gioi,Goio,Gioo,Gooi (Fig. 1C). The two junction sites within the Gαi2(C352G) coding region correspond to Glu161/Arg162 and Asp262/Thr263 (Fig. 1A). Non-conserved amino acid differences between Gαo and Gαi isoforms are heavily biased in the αHD region although differences exist in all major structural domains (see Fig. 1A). The PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras were constructed by PCR amplification (Vent DNA polymerase, New England Biolabs) of selected regions of the rat Gαi2(C352G) and mouse GαoA(C351G) cDNAs cloned in the pCI vector (kindly provided by Stephen Ikeda, NIAAA, National Institutes of Health). Existing or new restriction sites flanking targeted regions were introduced with oligonucleotide primers that preserved the desired coding sequence (Fig. 1B). The various PCR products were gel-purified, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated (T4 ligase, Promega) into the pcDNA3.1(+) cloning vector (Invitrogen). All primers used in the construction of the GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras are provided in Table I. The full-length GαoA/Gαi2 chimera sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Molecular Biology Core Facility, H.

Open table in a new tab Isolation and cRNA Injection of Xenopus Oocytes—All procedures for the use and handling of Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Plant City, FL) were approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Methods to enzymatically isolate and culture oocytes were as described elsewhere (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Stage V-VI oocytes were maintained at 19 °C in oocyte culture medium (OCM) consisting of 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm NaHPO4, 5.0 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm Na pyruvate, and 2% heat-inactivated horse serum, at pH 7.5 (NaOH). Mixtures of cRNAs were injected the day after oocyte isolation at a final injection volume of 50 nl (Nanoliter2000, World Precision Instruments). Each 50-nl mixture consisted of cRNA's encoding the rat Kir3.1 subunit (0.5 ng), mouse Kir3.2a subunit (0.5 ng), the human m2 receptor (0.5 ng), the PTX-S1 subunit (1 ng), and a PTX-resistant Gα subunit (5 ng). All cRNAs were synthesized in vitro from linearized cDNAs according to the manufacturer's protocol (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX) and concentrations determined by spectrophotometric absorbance at 260 nm. These oocyte expression conditions have been previously shown to yield roughly equivalent protein levels among the five different PTX-insensitive Gαi and Gαo isoforms (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Recordings—GIRK currents were measured from cRNA injected-oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp recording technique (10Stuhmer W. Parekh A.B. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 341-356Crossref Google Scholar). The oocytes were voltage clamped at a holding potential of -80 mV using 3 m KCl-filled electrodes having tip resistances of 0.8-1.2 MΩ (GeneClamp 500, Axon Instruments). Oocytes were initially superfused with a minimal salt solution composed of 98 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes at pH 7.5 (NaOH). The superfusion solution was then changed to a high K+ solution composed of 20 mm KCl, 78 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes at pH 7.5 (NaOH). The switch to high K+ solution produced an inward current consisting mostly of basal receptor-independent GIRK current (IK,basal). To evoke receptor-dependent GIRK currents (IK,ACh), a computer controlled superfusion system (SF-77B, Warner Instruments) was used to rapidly apply and washout various concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh, Sigma-Aldrich) in high K+ solution (11Doupnik C.A. Jaen C. Zhang Q. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 131-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All recordings were performed at room temperature (21-23 °C). Data Analysis—GIRK current kinetics were analyzed using nonlinear curve fitting software that fit single exponential functions to derive the activation time constant (τact) and the deactivation time constant (τdeact) (pCLAMP software, Axon Instruments). ACh dose-response relations were analyzed by fitting peak IK,ACh amplitudes with the Hill function shown in Equation 1, IK,AChTMax=11+([ACh]EC50)nH(Eq. 1) where the ACh concentration producing a 50% response (EC50) and the Hill coefficient (nH) were derived from a non-linear least-squares best fit (Origin 6.0 software, OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Statistical comparisons between the various experimental groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance where p < 0.05 was considered significant. Each experiment was replicated in oocytes derived from at least two separate oocyte batches (dissections). Functional Expression of GαoA/Gαi2 Chimeras—Each of the six PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras effectively rescued m2 receptor-activated GIRK currents in PTX-S1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 2). PTX-mediated uncoupling of endogenous Gαi/o subunits (>95%) was confirmed in parallel groups of oocytes that did not receive cRNA encoding a PTX-insensitive Gα subunit (data not shown), indicating the ACh-activated GIRK currents were evoked via coupling to the PTX-insensitive Gα subunits. As reported previously (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), expression of the parental GαoA(C351G) subunit produced smaller IK,basal amplitudes and larger receptor-activated currents (IK,ACh) compared with Gαi2(C352G), and expression of each of the PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras yielded IK,basal and IK,ACh amplitudes that ranged between the properties of the GαoA(C351G) and Gαi2(C352G) subunits (Fig. 2). Since each chimera was expressed under identical conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), and expression of the parental GαoA(C351G) and Gαi2(C352G) subunits produce equivalent protein levels (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the differences in receptor-independent and receptor-dependent GIRK channel activity with the different GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras is not readily attributable to differences in Gα subunit protein levels but instead to differences in intrinsic Gα function. Moreover, the results demonstrate that each GαoA/Gαi2 chimera expresses a functional PTX-insensitive Gα subunit capable of m2 receptor coupling, receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exhange, endogenous Gβγ association/dissociation, and intrinsic GTPase activity. Regions of Gαo That Accelerate ACh-evoked GIRK Activation Kinetics—The time course for ACh-elicited GIRK current activation and the ACh dose-dependence varied among the six GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras tested, yet ranged between the properties of the parental GαoA(C351G) and Gαi2(C352G) subunits as anticipated. Replacing either the αN/αHD region of Gαi2(C352G) with the corresponding GαoA sequence (Goii chimera), or replacing the Gαi2 switch regions with Gαo switch regions (Gioi chimera), both accelerated the GIRK activation time course compared with Gαi2(C352G)-coupled responses (Fig. 3A). The effects of each GαoA region substitution, however, was only partial and did not fully reconstitute the activation kinetics of the GαoA(C351G)-coupled response. The effects on GIRK activation kinetics were also reflected in the steady-state ACh dose-response curves, where Goii-coupled GIRK responses were leftward shifted and more characteristic of GαoA(C351G)-coupled GIRK currents than Gαi2(C352G)-coupled GIRK currents (Fig. 3A). Differences in EC50 values with Gαi2(C352G) coupling (0.43 ± 0.07 μm, n = 9) versus GαoA(C351G) coupling (0.21 ± 0.05 μm, n = 10) are small yet significantly different (Fig. 4B) and have comparable Hill coefficients (Gαi2(C352G) 1.11 ± 0.04; GαoA(C351G) 1.44 ± 0.07). Replacing the Gαi2(C352G) carboxyl region with the GαoA(C351G) carboxyl region (Giio chimera) had no significant effect on GIRK activation kinetics or the ACh dose-reponse curve, and was indistinguishable from the Gαi2(C352G)-coupled kinetics (Fig. 3A). Thus isoform differences in the last 92 residues do not mediate the kinetic differences between Gαi2(C352G)-coupled and GαoA(C351G)-coupled GIRK currents (12Denker B.M. Boutin P.M. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Effects of PTX-insensitive GαoA/Gαi2 chimera expression on receptor-independent basal GIRK channel activity and receptor-evoked GIRK deactivation kinetics.

Statistical comparisons were made between the chimera values and the corresponding parental subunit in each panel, with p ≤ 0.05 considered significant (*).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Regions of Gαi2 That Slow GIRK Activation Kinetics—For the reciprocal set of experiments where Gαi2(C352G) regions replaced the equivalent regions of GαoA(C351G), only substituting the Gαi2 switch regions (Goio chimera) caused a significant yet partial slowing in the GIRK activation kinetics (Fig. 3B). Neither the Gαi2 αN/αHD region (Gioo chimera) nor the carboxyl region (Gooi chimera) significantly slowed the GIRK activation characteristics of GαoA(C351G)-coupled responses. Yet the combined presence of both the Gαi2 αN/αHD region plus the Gαi2 switch regions (Giio chimera), was sufficient to fully reproduce the slower Gαi2(C352G)-coupled GIRK activation kinetics (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the combined presence of the GαoA αN/αHD region plus the switch regions (Gooi chimera) was sufficient to fully reproduce the faster GαoA(C351G)-coupled GIRK activation kinetics (Fig. 3B). Thus in both cases the αN/αHD region plus the switch regions are necessary and sufficient to fully reproduce the parental Gα subunit effects on GIRK activation kinetics. Effects of GαoA/Gαi2 Chimera Expression on Basal GIRK Channel Activity—In addition to receptor-dependent GIRK activation kinetics, the receptor-independent basal GIRK channel activity (IK,basal) associated with expression of each GαoA/Gαi2 chimera was also examined. A reduction in IK,basal caused by Gα subunit expression in parallel with an increased IK,ACh amplitude, is largely a consequence of Gα sequestration of free endogenous Gβγ dimers and increased heterotrimeric Gα(GDP)βγ formation (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For comparisons among the different GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras, IK,basal was expressed as the fraction of the total GIRK current elicited from each oocyte (IK,total = IK,basal + maximal IK,ACh). As reported previously (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), GαoA(C351G) reduced IK,basal amplitudes significantly greater than Gαi2(C352G) under equivalent expression conditions, with IK,basal representing ∼10% of the total GIRK current with GαoA(C351G) expression compared with ∼45% with Gαi2(C352G) expression (Fig. 4A). The fractional IK,basal amplitudes for each of the GαoA/Gαi2 chimeras indicated a significant effect of the switch region substitutions (Fig. 4A). Expression of the Gioi chimera produced a significantly lower fractional IK,basal amplitude (22 ± 4%, n = 6) compared with the parental Gαi2(C352G) expression (45 ± 6%, n = 9). And conversely, expression of Goio significantly increased the fractional IK,basal amplitude to 28 ± 6% (n = 9) compared with 11 ± 1% (n = 10) for parental GαoA(C351G) expression (Fig. 4A). Again, the effects of the individual domain substitutions were partial, where substitutions of both the αN/αHD region plus the switch regions (Giio and Gooi) reconstituted the parental IK,basal amplitude (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the effects of the switch regions on IK,basal correlate well with the effects on receptor-evoked GIRK activation kinetics (Fig. 4C), with the exception of the GαoA αN/αHD region chimera (Goii), which displayed a slightly accelerated receptor-evoked GIRK activation time course without significantly effecting the fractional IK,basal amplitude. The deactivation time course of GIRK currents after rapid ACh washout, a process dependent on Gα GTPase activity, was previously found to be similar among all the PTX-insensitive Gαi/o isoforms (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However in the current set of experiments, the GIRK deactivation time constant with GαoA(C351G) expression (τdeact = 14.7 ± 0.4 s, n = 10) was different (p < 0.05) from the deactivation time constant derived with Gαi2(C352G) expression (τdeact = 23.2 ± 1.6 s, n = 9). Introducing either the Gαi2 αN/αHD region (Gioo) or the switch regions (Goio) into GαoA(C351G) was sufficient to convert the deactivation time constant to a Gαi2(C352G)-like value (Fig. 4D). Gαi2 Interdomain Contacts Affecting GIRK Channel Gating Properties—The GαoA/Gαi2 chimera results indicate the molecular determinants that mediate differences in GαoA(C351G) and Gαi2(C352G)-coupled GIRK currents reside in both the αN/αHD region and the switch regions. When both are present together from the same subunit (i.e. Giio and Gooi), the chimeras behave like their parental subunit. These findings lead us to examine a previously reported interdomain interaction in Gαi1, between the αD-αE loop located in αHD and the switch III loop located in the Ras-like domain (Fig. 5A), that mediates the 4-fold slower GDP release rate of recombinant Gαi1 versus Gαo subunits in vitro (5Remmers A.E. Engel C. Liu M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To disrupt the interdomain contact in Gαi2(C352G), the switch III loop was mutated to the corresponding Gαo switch III loop (Gαi2(GoSW3) chimera) that consists of a four amino acid substitution (Gαi2 L233Q/A236H/E240T/M241T). In addition, a conserved arginine residue in the Gαi2 αD-αE loop that forms a hydrophobic contact with the switch III loop was also mutated to an alanine (Gαi2(R145A)) to disrupt the interdomain interaction. Both of these mutations when introduced into Gαi1 accelerate the basal GDP release rate to levels similar to Gαo (5Remmers A.E. Engel C. Liu M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 5B, mutating the four switch III residues of Gαi2(C352G) to the corresponding Gαo switch III amino acids (L233Q/A236H/E240T/M241T) partially accelerated the ACh-evoked GIRK activation rate similar to the Gioi chimera (Fig. 6C), indicating isoform differences in the switch III loop contribute a significant part of the kinetic differences in GαoA and Gαi2-coupled GIRK currents. More dramatically, expression of the Gαi2(R145A) mutant fully replicated GαoA(C351G)-coupled GIRK activation kinetics (see Figs. 5B and 6C). Both the Gαi2 switch III loop mutation and the αD-αE loop R145A mutation reduced IK,basal amplitudes (Fig. 6A), consistent with the observations of the Gioi chimera, yet neither effected the GIRK current deactivation time constant (Fig. 6D). Thus in conjunction with the previous structure-function analysis of GDP release differences in Gαi and Gαo subunits (5Remmers A.E. Engel C. Liu M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results of the Gαi2(R145A) and switch III mutations on GIRK channel activation kinetics indicate Gαi/Gαo isoform differences are attributable to differences in receptor-catalyzed GDP release rates that determine the time course of Gβγ production and activation of GIRK channels. The goal of this study was to identify molecular determinants in Gαi and/or Gαo subunits that mediate differences in GIRK channel gating kinetics associated with selective Gα-GPCR coupling (4Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545.2: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our Gαi2/GαoA chimera results implicated an interdomain interface previously linked to Gαi/Gαo isoform differences in basal GDP release rates (5Remmers A.E. Engel C. Liu M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract"
https://openalex.org/W2161282857,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a crucial regulator of a large number of genes involved in glucose, cholesterol, and fatty acid metabolism. Unlike other members of the superfamily, HNF-4α activates transcription in the absence of exogenously added ligand. Recently published crystallographic data show that fatty acids are endogenous ligands for HNF-4. Transcriptional analysis of point mutations of the residues that are located in helices H3, H5, H10, and H11, which have been shown to come in contact with the ligand, resulted in a dramatic decrease in activity, without affecting DNA binding and dimerization. Our results show the importance of residues Ser-181, Met-182 in H3, Leu-219, Leu-220 and Arg-226 in H5, Ile-338 in H10, and Ile-346 in H11 that line the ligand-binding domain pocket in HNF-4α and impair its transactivation potential. Structural modeling reveals that the mutations do not cause any large scale structural alterations, and the observed loss in transactivation can be attributed to local changes, demonstrating that these residues play a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the HNF-4α ligand binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W2025588238,"Siah1a has been implicated in numerous signaling pathways because of its ability to induce ubiquitin-mediated degradation of many protein substrates. Siah1a knockout mice are growth-retarded, exhibit early lethality, and display spermatogenic defects. In this study we identified a striking low bone volume phenotype in these mice (trabecular bone volume was halved compared with wild type mice), linking Siah1a to bone metabolism for the first time. Markers of bone formation, including osteoblast numbers and osteoid volume, were decreased by up to 40%, whereas the number of osteoclasts was more than doubled in Siah1a mutant mice. However, ex vivo osteoclast formation occurs normally and hematopoietic osteoclast progenitor cell types were present in normal numbers in Siah1a mutant mice. Moreover, adoptive transfer of Siah1a mutant bone marrow into wild type mice failed to reproduce the osteopenia or increased osteoclast numbers observed in mutant mice. Although ex vivo osteoblast colony formation was normal in Siah1a mutant mice, mineralization from these cells was elevated in cultures from Siah1a mutant mice, which may explain the reduction in osteoid volume seen in vivo. These findings suggest that although Siah1a is clearly essential for normal bone metabolism, the bone defect in Siah1a mutant mice is not due to cell-autonomous requirements for Siah1a in osteoblast or osteoclast formation. We propose that bone metabolism defects in Siah1a mutant mice are secondary to an alteration in an unidentified systemic, paracrine, or metabolic factor in these mice.

Ubiquitination is increasingly recognized as an important regulatory mechanism in diverse cellular processes. Tagging proteins with chains of Lys48-linked ubiquitin induces their rapid degradation via the proteasome. It is therefore essential that the process of selecting substrates for ubiquitination is tightly controlled. One family of proteins that regulates this selection are Siah proteins, which are members of the RING domain-containing family of E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes. Mice have three highly homologous Siah proteins: Siah1a, Siah1b, and Siah2 (1Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D. Development. 1993; 117: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Siah1a and Siah1b (collectively Siah1) differ at only 6 of 282 amino acid residues, whereas the 325-amino acid Siah2 protein is distinguished by a longer N-terminal sequence but shares 85% amino acid identity with Siah1 proteins over the remainder of its length.Overexpression of Siah1 or Siah2 proteins has been shown to induce the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of diverse substrates including transcription factors, transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors, cell surface receptors, and intracellular signal transduction molecules, implicating the Siah family in numerous cellular processes (2Habelhah H.

To understand the physiological functions of Siah proteins, we have generated Siah1a and Siah2 knockout mice. Siah2 mutant mice are largely phenotypically normal, exhibiting a small increase in the number of myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow (4Frew I.J. Hammond V.E. Dickins R.A. Quinn J.M.W.

Sassoon D. Bowtell D.D. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5756-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, Siah1a mutant mice are post-natally growth-retarded, exhibit frequent early lethality, and display meiotic cell division defects during spermatogenesis (5Dickins R.A. Frew I.J. House C.M. O'Bryan M.K. Holloway A.J. Haviv I. Traficante N. de Kretser D.M. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mice lacking both Siah1a and Siah2 die within hours of birth, demonstrating that Siah1a and Siah2 have partially overlapping functions in vivo (4Frew I.J. Hammond V.E. Dickins R.A. Quinn J.M.W.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypes in Siah mutant mice have yet to be uncovered.In this manuscript we have identified a significant skeletal defect in Siah1a mutant mice. These mice exhibit high numbers of osteoclasts with low numbers of osteoblasts, resulting in severe osteopenia (low bone volume). We present evidence that this phenotype is not due to cell autonomous requirements for Siah1a in osteoclast or osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, analysis of the hematopoietic system also supports the conclusion that growth defects in Siah1a mutant mice are not due to a cell autonomous requirement for Siah1a in cellular proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Unless otherwise stated, antibodies were from BD Pharmingen. The following anti-mouse antibodies were used in this study: anti-B220 (RA3-6B2), anti-CD3 (145-2C11), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-CD28 (37.51), anti-CD40 (3/23), anti-CD45.2 (104), anti-F4/80 (Caltag), anti-Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), anti-IgM (Fab′)2 fragments (ICN), and anti-Mac-1 (M1/70).Mice—Siah1a-/- mice were generated as described previously (5Dickins R.A. Frew I.J. House C.M. O'Bryan M.K. Holloway A.J. Haviv I. Traficante N. de Kretser D.M. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Littermate controls were used for all experiments. All animal work was approved by an institutional ethics committee in compliance with National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) guidelines.Bone Histology and Histomorphometry—Tibiae and femora were collected for histology and histomorphometric analyses at 7-8 weeks of age. After fixation overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, legs were xrayed (Faxitron, Wheeling, IL) for measurements of bone length and width using ImageJ 1.23 analysis software as described previously (6Sims N.A. Clement-Lacroix P. Da Ponte F. Bouali Y. Binart N. Moriggl R. Goffin V. Coschigano K. Gaillard-Kelly M. Kopchick J. Baron R. Kelly P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Tibiae were processed into methylmethacrylate for histomorphometric analysis of undecalcified bone by standard protocols in the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibial metaphysis using the Osteomeasure image analysis system (Osteometrics, Decatur, GA), with the size of the region corrected for bone size as described previously (6Sims N.A. Clement-Lacroix P. Da Ponte F. Bouali Y. Binart N. Moriggl R. Goffin V. Coschigano K. Gaillard-Kelly M. Kopchick J. Baron R. Kelly P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).Lymphocyte Proliferation Assays—Single cell lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from spleen or lymph nodes (mesenteric, inguinal, axilliary) by crushing organs through a wire mesh and passing through a 40 μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Red blood cells were removed from spleen suspensions by incubation for 5 min at room temperature in red cell lysis buffer (0.15 m NH4Cl, 1 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2), followed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal bovine serum. Viable resting splenic B cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACStar, BD Biosciences) on the basis of low forward and side scatter, exclusion of propidium iodide, and failure to stain for CD4 and CD8. Lymph node T cells were purified using nylon wool columns. Nylon wool (Robbins Scientific Corp.) was soaked overnight in 0.2 m HCl and washed with water until neutral pH was obtained. Approximately 1-2 g (dry weight) of wool was packed into the barrel of a 10-ml syringe and autoclaved. Prior to use, columns were washed with 20 ml each of 0.9% saline, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and growth medium. Lymph node cell suspensions were loaded onto the column in a volume of 4 ml, allowed to flow through, and washed with 1 ml of medium. The column was closed, and a further 2 ml of medium was added prior to incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. Non-adherent cells (T cells) were eluted from the column in a volume of 13 ml. B cells and T cells were typically enriched by these procedures to greater than 95% purity based on B220 and CD4/CD8 staining of purified cells. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 250 μm l-asparagine, 13 μm folic acid, penicillin (500 IU/ml), streptomycin (500 μg/ml), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cultures were initiated in 96-well plates (100 μl/well) at starting cell densities of 5 × 105 cells/ml and mitogenically stimulated by the addition of lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 0111: B4, Sigma), anti-IgM or anti-CD40 antibodies, or concanavalin A (Sigma) or by plating in wells that had been coated for several hours with anti-CD3 plus or minus anti-CD28 antibodies. After 2 days, 0.5 μCi of [6-3H]thymidine (29 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added for the final 16 h of culture before harvesting of the cells onto glass filter paper with several washes of water (Filtermate 196 Harvester, Packard). Incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting using Readysafe scintillant (Beckman-Coulter) and a Tri-carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard).Osteoclast and Colony-forming Assays—Bone marrow macrophages were obtained by flushing femurs with a 23-guage needle. Osteoclasts were generated from bone marrow cells by culturing at a starting density of 1 × 105 white blood cells/well of a 48-well plate. Cells were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (500 IU/ml), streptomycin (500 μg/ml), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. 100 ng/ml glutathione S-transferase-RANKL 1The abbreviations used are: RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear κB ligand; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF, granulocyte-CSF; M-CSF, macrophage-CSF; IL, interleukin; SCF, stem cell factor; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; Gy, gray. fusion protein (prepared using a construct kindly provided by F. Patrick Ross, Washington University School Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and 20 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added to cultures to induce osteoclastogenesis. Fresh medium was added every 3 days. After 7 days, cells were fixed for 5 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed in a 1:1 mixture of acetone and methanol, and dried before histochemical staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining (7Quinn J.M. Whitty G.A. Byrne R.J. Gillespie M.T. Hamilton J.A. Bone. 2002; 30: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were scored as TRAP+ multinucleated (more than two nuclei) cells.For agar colony-forming assays, 5 × 104 white blood cells were cultured in 0.3% agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and either recombinant human G-CSF (1000 units/ml, Amgen), recombinant murine GM-CSF (1000 units/ml, Peprotech), recombinant murine M-CSF (20 ng/ml, Peprotech), recombinant murine IL-3 (1000 units/ml, Peprotech) or SCF (∼100 ng/ml derived from baby hamster kidney-SCF conditioned media, gift of S. Collins, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA), and recombinant human G-CSF (1000 units/ml). Colonies were counted after 7 days of culture. For methylcellulose colony-forming assays, 5 × 104 white blood cells were cultured in 1.8% methylcellulose in Iscove's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, recombinant murine IL-3 (1000 units/ml, Peprotech), recombinant murine IL-6 (1000 units/ml, Peprotech), SCF (as above), and recombinant murine erythropoietin (2 units/ml, Janssen-Cilag). Colonies were counted after 12 days of culture.Osteoblast Cultures—The potential for mineralization by osteoblast precursors was assessed by two different systems. Firstly, bone marrow was obtained by flushing femurs with a 23-guage needle and culturing whole bone marrow preparations for 28 days at a starting density of 2 × 106 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Cells were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm ascorbic acid, 10-8m dexamethasone, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Medium was changed every 3-4 days until analysis (8Montero A. Okada Y. Tomita M. Ito M. Tsurukami H. Nakamura T. Doetschman T. Coffin J.D. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Secondly, mineralization by primary calvarial osteoblasts was assessed. For this method, calvariae from neonates were digested as described previously (9Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). After 5-6 days, primary osteoblasts were harvested and seeded at 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown under the same conditions as marrow mineralization cultures (described above). At 21 and 28 days (and 18 days for calvarial cultures), cultures were checked for the presence of osteoblasts by alkaline phosphatase staining, and percent mineralization was assessed in alkaline phosphatase-positive wells by von Kossa staining (10Sabatakos G. Sims N.A. Chen J. Aoki K. Kelz M.B. Amling M. Bouali Y. Mukhopadhyay K. Ford K. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The extent of mineralization (as a percentage of well area) was quantified using ImageJ 1.23 software as described previously (10Sabatakos G. Sims N.A. Chen J. Aoki K. Kelz M.B. Amling M. Bouali Y. Mukhopadhyay K. Ford K. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).Adoptive Transfer Experiments—For competitive reconstitution experiments, 5 × 105 whole bone marrow cells from femurs of wild type or Siah1a-/- mice (CD45.2 allotype) were injected intravenously along with 5 × 105 whole bone marrow cells from a B6.SJL-Ptprca mouse (CD45.1 allotype) into recipient B6.SJL-Ptprca mice (Animal Resources Centre, Canning Vale, Australia) that had been γ-irradiated (5 Gy followed 3 h later by 4.5 Gy, 137Cs source, 0.75 Gy/min). Flow cytometry was conducted 15 weeks after injection. For analysis of bones after adoptive transfer, 2 × 106 whole bone marrow cells from femurs of wild type or Siah1a-/- mice were injected into recipient B6.SJL-Ptprca mice as described above. Bones were harvested 8 weeks after injection, and flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow using anti-Mac-1 and anti-CD45.2 antibodies demonstrated that more than 99% of myeloid cells were derived from injected marrow.RESULTSOsteopenia in Siah1a Mutant Mice—While flushing bone marrow samples from femurs, we noticed that bones from Siah1a mutant mice appeared weaker than those from wild type mice. This prompted an investigation of the skeletal system of Siah1a-/- mice.Femurs from Siah1a-/- mice were significantly shorter and narrower than those from wild type littermate controls, consistent with overall growth retardation of these mutants (Fig. 1, A and B) (5Dickins R.A. Frew I.J. House C.M. O'Bryan M.K. Holloway A.J. Haviv I. Traficante N. de Kretser D.M. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, although growth plate width, an indicator of chondrocyte proliferation, was slightly elevated in Siah1a-/- mice, suggesting a delay in growth plate maturation, this did not reach statistical significance (mean growth plate width (μm) ± S.E. in 7-8-week-old mice: wild type, 107 ± 7; Siah1a-/-, 142 ± 22, p = 0.25; n ≥ 6/group).Histological sectioning of tibiae revealed a striking low trabecular and cortical bone volume (osteopenic) phenotype in Siah1a mutant mice (Fig. 1C). Histomorphometric quantitation of undecalcified tibial sections demonstrated thinner cortical bone (Fig. 1D), fewer and more dispersed trabeculae (Fig. 1, E and F), and decreased trabecular thickness and volume (Fig. 1, G and H) in Siah1a-/- compared with wild type tibiae.Although the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are usually coupled in vivo such that bone formation and bone resorption are co-regulated (11Sims N.A. Baron R. Canalis E. Skeletal Growth Factors. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 1-16Google Scholar) and trabecular bone volume is maintained at an appropriate level for mechanical strain, in the Siah1a mice, these activities seem to be dissociated. Histomorphometry revealed a low level of bone formation and low osteoblast numbers with a high level of osteoclastogenesis, leading to the osteopenia described above. Tibiae from Siah1a-/- mice have ∼40% fewer osteoblasts per unit of bone perimeter and bone surface than wild type mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Osteoblasts form new bone by first secreting an extracellular matrix, termed osteoid, and then participating in the mineralization of this matrix. The thickness and volume of osteoid is a measure of the rate of osteoblastic bone formation. Consistent with low osteoblast numbers, Siah1a-/- mice also display low osteoid volume and thickness (Fig. 2, C and D), but fluorochrome-derived markers of bone formation were not significantly altered (data not shown), possibly because of the high level of bone resorption, which may have masked any effect on these markers incorporated into the bone matrix during bone formation. In contrast to the low level of bone formation, however, Siah1a-/- tibiae displayed more than double the number of osteoclasts per unit of bone perimeter and bone surface than wild type tibiae (Fig. 2, E and F). To investigate whether defects in osteoblast and osteoclast number was related to altered calcium homeostasis at the systemic level, serum calcium was measured, but it was not altered in Siah1a-/- (10.7 ± 1.1 mg/dl; n = 6) compared with wild type mice (11.9 ± 2.8 mg/dl; n = 5).Fig. 2Decreased osteoblasts and increased osteoclasts in Siah1a-/- mice.

Siah1a-/- mice are postnatally growth-retarded, and most organs display a decrease in size and weight that is proportional to total body weight (5Dickins R.A. Frew I.J. House C.M. O'Bryan M.K. Holloway A.J. Haviv I. Traficante N. de Kretser D.M. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with reduced size, we found that spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow from Siah1a knockout mice contained only 30-50% of the number of white blood cells found in organs from wild type littermates (Table I). However, a reduction in cellularity of hematopoietic organs does not result from a change in a particular cellular lineage because the percentages of cells in each tissue expressing T cell markers (CD4, CD8), B cell markers (B220, IgM, IgD), and granulocyte and monocyte markers (Gr-1, Mac-1, F4/80) were unchanged in Siah1a-/- mice (Table I). Lymphocyte proliferation in vitro in response to a range of mitogens is unaffected by loss of Siah1a (Fig. 3, A and B), and wild type and Siah1a-/- bone marrow cells competed equally well with a reference bone marrow in the generation of T cell, B cell, and granulocyte lineages in a competitive hematopoietic adoptive transfer assay (Fig. 3C). These findings demonstrate that reduced overall hematopoietic cellularity of Siah1a-/- mice is unlikely to result from a cell-autonomous proliferative requirement for Siah1a.Table IFlow cytometry analysis of hematopoietic lineages in Siah1a mutant miceOrgan and lineage markerWild typeSiah1a−/−%%ThymusCellularity (107 WBC/ml)10.3 ± 2.34.6 ± 2.2CD4+ CD8+83.1 ± 2.385.1 ± 1.3CD4+ CD8−9.7 ± 1.09.1 ± 1.4CD8+ CD4−3.3 ± 1.02.7 ± 0.3SpleenCellularity (107 WBC/ml)10.2 ± 2.04.2 ± 1.0CD4+ CD8−11.4 ± 2.113.4 ± 1.3CD8+ CD4−13.2 ± 3.412.4 ± 3.4B220+ IgM+46.4 ± 0.737.7 ± 8.1B220+ IgD+46.2 ± 2.937.9 ± 8.3Mesenteric lymph nodeCellularity (107 WBC/ml)2.8 ± 0.71.0 ± 0.3CD4+ CD8−40.0 ± 4.437.9 ± 6.0CD8+ CD4−23.3 ± 3.525.1 ± 3.8B220+ IgM+24.8 ± 6.420.0 ± 4.0B220+ IgD+21.5 ± 5.317.3 ± 4.0Bone marrowCellularity (107 WBC/ml)2.6 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.2B220+ IgM−19.4 ± 3.415.7 ± 3.6B220+ IgM+9.8 ± 1.410.6 ± 1.1B220+ IgD+5.4 ± 1.55.6 ± 3.5Mac-1+44.9 ± 2.749.4 ± 3.8Gr-1+48.5 ± 2.551.5 ± 3.8Mac-1+ Gr-1high27.6 ± 2.028.7 ± 3.2F4/80+55.4 ± 1.361.3 ± 2.9Mac-1+ F4/80int45.0 ± 5.640.7 ± 4.4Mac-1− F4/80int28.7 ± 3.328.2 ± 5.1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Normal ex vivo and in vivo proliferation of Siah1a-/- hematopoietic cells.

C, comparison of the ability of wild type (black columns) and Siah1a-/- (white columns) bone marrow to competitively reconstitute the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice. Initial bone marrow samples were derived from three littermate-matched wild type or Siah1a-/- mice (CD45.2 allotype) and from a single B6.SJL-Ptprca mouse (CD45.1 allotype). Data represent the means ± S.D. from analysis of five reconstituted B6.SJL-Ptprca mice per genotype 15 weeks after injection of bone marrow.

Kaji K. Kudo A. J Bone Miner Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Precursors of these cells, termed pre-osteoclasts, are enriched in a myeloid population of the bone marrow that does not express Mac-1 and also exhibits intermediate F4/80 staining (Mac-1- F4/80int) (12Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J Bone Miner Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analysis showed that wild type and Siah1a-/- bone marrow contain similar percentages of cells that are Mac-1+ F4/80int and Mac-1- F4/80int (Table I), suggesting that the steady state distributions of the most immediate osteoclast precursor cells are not altered in Siah1a-/- mice. More primitive osteoclast progenitor cells are present in hematopoietic colonies elicited by M-CSF and GM-CSF (13Yamazaki H. Kunisada T. Yamane T. Hayashi S.I. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 68-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to the expanded numbers of myeloid precursors observed in Siah2-/- mice (4Frew I.J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 9150-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), bone marrow from Siah1a-/- mice yielded the same number of colonies as bone marrow from wild type mice in response to all cytokine stimulations (Fig. 4A). This indicates that the increased number of osteoclasts in Siah1a-/- mice does not result from increased numbers of osteoclast progenitors.Fig. 4Formation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in ex vivo cultures from Siah1a-/- and wild type mice. A, 7-day agar colony-forming cell assay of bone marrow from wild type (black bars) and Siah1a-/- (white bars) mice.

B, ex vivo osteoclast differentiation. Bone marrow cells from wild type (black bars) or Siah1a-/- (white bars) mice were cultured in 48-well plates in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL for 7 days. Osteoclast formation was assessed by TRAP staining. TRAP+ multinuclear cells (three or more nuclei) were scored as osteoclasts. Data represent the means ± S.E. derived from three independent experiments.

Whitty G.A. Byrne R.J. Gillespie M.T. Hamilton J.A. Bone. 2002; 30: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No significant differences in osteoclast numbers were noted between wild type and Siah1a-/- cultured bone marrow (Fig. 4B). This finding is consistent with the lack of increased osteoclast progenitors noted above, and furthermore it suggests that Siah1a does not function as a cell-autonomous inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation.Normal in Vitro Osteoblast Formation—In contrast to the hematopoietic origin of osteoclasts, osteoblasts derive from mesenchymal precursors. To investigate whether the observed in vivo reduction in osteoblast numbers is reproduced in in vitro conditions, we performed osteoblast colony formation and mineralization assays using either bone marrow or calvarial digests as a source of osteoblast precursors. The potential of the Siah1a-/- bone marrow precursor cells to differentiate into osteoblasts was similar to what is seen in wild type mice.

https://openalex.org/W1996721074,"DNA topoisomerase II is an essential enzyme that releases a topological strain in DNA by introduction of transient breaks in one DNA helix through which another helix is passed. While changing DNA topology, ATP is required to drive the enzyme through a series of conformational changes dependent on interdomain communication. We have characterized a human topoisomerase IIα enzyme with a two-amino acid insertion at position 351 in the transducer domain. The mutation specifically abolishes the DNA strand passage event of the enzyme, probably because of a sterical hindrance of T-segment transport. Thus, the enzyme fails to decatenate and relax DNA, even though it is fully capable of ATP hydrolysis, closure of the N-terminal clamp, and DNA cleavage. The cleavage activity is increased, suggesting that the transducer domain has a role in regulating DNA cleavage. Furthermore, the enzyme has retained a tendency to increase DNA cleavage upon nucleotide binding and also responds to DNA with elevated ATP hydrolysis. However, the DNA-mediated increase in ATP hydrolysis is lower than that obtained with the wild-type enzyme but similar to that of a cleavage-deficient topoisomerase IIα enzyme. Our results strongly suggest that the strand passage event is required for efficient DNA stimulation of topoisomerase II-mediated ATP hydrolysis, whereas the stimulation occurs independent of the DNA cleavage reaction per se. A comparison of the strand passage deficient-enzyme described here and the cleavage-deficient enzyme may have applications in other studies where a clear distinction between strand passage and topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage is desirable.

A comparison of the strand passage deficient-enzyme described here and the cleavage-deficient enzyme may have applications in other studies where a clear distinction between strand passage and topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage is desirable. Type II DNA topoisomerases are highly complex enzymes that are able to change the topological conformation of DNA by introducing a transient double strand break in one DNA helix, the G-segment, whereas another intact helix, the T-segment, is transported coordinately through the gated DNA (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). The process depends on ATP, which drives the enzyme through a series of conformational changes (2Osheroff N.

The homodimeric eukaryotic topoisomerase II enzyme contains two highly conserved catalytic entities, which also share homology with the bacterial DNA topoisomerase II counterpart, DNA gyrase. The ATPase activity is found in the N-terminal region, whereas the DNA cleavage and ligation activities are held by the central region (6Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extreme C termini of the type II topoisomerases are divergent and dispensable for catalytic activity in vitro (7Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21335-21343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell.

The structural data reveal that the N-terminal region of topoisomerase II forms an ATP-operated clamp, which closes upon ATP binding (10Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The dimeric N-terminal clamp contains two domains in each protomer (10Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The most N-terminal domain is responsible for dimer interactions during clamp closure and also holds the ATP-binding site. The second domain, called the transducer domain, forms the walls of the clamp and connects it to the enzyme core. Furthermore, communication between the ATP-binding domain and the central domain of the enzyme, responsible for DNA cleavage/ligation, has been suggested to go through the transducer domain (4Bjergbaek L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1684-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Upon clamp closure, the transducer domain of each protomer approaches one another, creating a very tight cavity that is actually too small to hold a T-segment (10Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The surprisingly small hole of the eukaryotic topoisomerase II has been suggested to enable the enzyme to couple T-segment interactions to G-segment cleavage and opening (10Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The core region of topoisomerase II that is responsible for DNA cleavage and ligation is comprised of two domains, A′ and B′, showing homology to the subunits of DNA gyrase, gyrase A and gyrase B, respectively (16Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The A′ domain contains both the active site tyrosine covalently attached to the 5′-end of the DNA during cleavage and the primary dimerization region (6Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The B′ domain constitutes the interface between the transducer domain and the A′ domain (16Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and is essential for DNA cleavage (16Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 17Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). At low ATP concentrations, the ATP consumption and the DNA strand passage activity of DNA topoisomerase II are coupled tightly (18Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic actions of both the cleavage/ligation site and the ATPase site are governed by extensive interdomain communication, which probably facilitates an appropriate temporal order of conformational changes in the complex catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II and thereby reduces the energy usage. Thus, the binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain stimulates the cleavage of the G-segment bound by the core region (19Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of DNA increases the turnover rate of ATP hydrolysis (2Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of a cleavage-deficient topoisomerase II enzyme have shown that an inability to cleave DNA severely reduces the stimulatory effect of DNA on ATP hydrolysis (20Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this enzyme, both DNA cleavage and strand passage were abolished. Therefore, it was suggested that the normal increase in ATP turnover either depends on the ability to cleave the G-segment or is mediated through T-segment binding/transfer (20Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to ATP-mediated stimulation of DNA cleavage, which only requires ATP binding, a full increase in ATP hydrolysis seems to depend on a catalytic action on DNA rather than just DNA binding. We have characterized a human topoisomerase IIα enzyme with two amino acids inserted at position 351 in the transducer domain (351i). The insertion abolishes the strand passage reaction of the enzyme but leaves both catalytic domains active. Based on the newly published structure of the N-terminal fragment of yeast topoisomerase II (10Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), we find it very likely that the insertion impairs the strand passage reaction via sterical hindrance. Our results show that the insertion at position 351 slightly increases topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage complex formation, consistent with a role of the transducer domain in controlling DNA cleavage (15Oestergaard V.H. Bjergbaek L. Skouboe C. Giangiacomo L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1684-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of 351i has revealed further that the enzyme retains DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, although at a lower level compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. The stimulatory effect of DNA in 351i, which lacks strand passage activity, is equal to that obtained with a cleavage-deficient topoisomerase IIα enzyme. Our results demonstrate that DNA-mediated stimulation of ATP hydrolysis is independent of DNA cleavage and rather requires the strand passage reaction per se. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains BJ201 (Matα ura3 trp1 pep4::HIS3 prb1 can1 top2::TRP1) and JEL1Δtop1 (kindly provided by J. C.

Plasmid pBY105 contains the yeast TPI promotor inserted into the polylinker region of the LEU2/ARS-CEN plasmid pRS315. pRS315 was used as the backbone for pHT300 and pHT351i (pHT350-2), carrying the wild-type human TOP2α cDNA and the human TOP2α cDNA with an insertion of 6 nucleotides encoding two amino acids (Val-Asp) at position 351, respectively. Modified versions of YEpWOB6 were used for overexpression of the hexahistidine-tagged human topoisomerase IIα and 351i enzymes.

To test the ability of 351i to complement the lack of endogenous topoisomerase II in BJ201, the LEU2-based construct pHT351i was transformed into BJ201 and cells were transferred to medium plates containing 5′-fluoro-orotic acid (1 mg/ml) to select against the URA3 plasmid carrying the Schizosaccharomyces pombe top2+ gene (8Jensen S.

The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and stopped after 10 min by the addition of SDS and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.1% and 10 mm, respectively. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TBE buffer. DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. Topoisomerase II-mediated Cleavage of Circular DNA—Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage was performed by incubating 100 nm topoisomerase II and 6.5 nm of negatively supercoiled pUC19 DNA in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 7 min, and cleavage products were trapped by the addition of SDS to 1%. After proteinase K digestion (0.8 mg/ml), samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 nm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA). DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining (1 μg/ml). When topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage was carried out in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP 1The abbreviation used are: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)-triphosphate; k-DNA, kinetoplast DNA. (Roche Applied Science), the concentration of the nucleotide was 1 mm. Oligonucleotides—DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from DNA Technology Corporation and purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Andersen et al. (22Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for suicide DNA cleavage and ligation were as described previously (15Oestergaard V.H. Bjergbaek L. Skouboe C. Giangiacomo L. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1684-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA Ligation—Hybridization and labeling of the synthetic oligonucleotides were done according to the procedures described by Andersen et al. (22Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study DNA ligation, kinetically competent topoisomerase II DNA cleavage complexes were generated by incubating 20 nm topoisomerase II with 0.02 pmol of labeled suicide substrate in 20 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. After incubation for 60 min, the cleavage reactions were stopped by the addition of NaCl to 0.4 m, thereby preventing further cleavage during the ligation reaction. Ligation was initiated by the addition of 4 pmol of a 45-mer ligation substrate. After further incubation (with incubation times as indicated in the figure legends), the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS to 1% and subjected subsequently to SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis. Covalent cleavage complexes were revealed by the transfer of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide to the topoisomerase polypeptide, and ligation was measured as the reduction in the amount of cleavage complexes with time. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) Clamp-closing Assay—For clamp-closing experiments, 10 nm topoisomerase II was preincubated with 6.5 nm of negatively supercoiled pUC19 DNA for 5 min in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2). After preincubation, AMP-PNP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and the reactions were incubated further for 5 min. The reactions were stopped next by the addition of either NaCl or SDS to final concentrations of 800 mm and 1%, respectively. The sample volume was increased to 70 μl by adding 50 μlof an 800 mm NaCl solution. To trap enzyme-DNA catenanes, phenol extraction was performed by adding 1 volume of phenol. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min. The waterphase was removed, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) for gel analysis. The combined phenol phase and phenol/water interphase were washed once in high salt washing buffer (2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2) and once in 0.6 m LiCl. Upon the removal of the waterphase after the last wash, the remaining material was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K. The samples were subjected next to electrophoresis in TBE in a 1% agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Clamp Closing Analyzed by Analytical CsCl Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation—The technique used is essentially that described previously by Morris et al. (20Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures of 30 μl containing 150 nm topoisomerase II, 250 nm relaxed pBR322 (topoGEN), or linearized pUC19 plasmid DNA in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2) were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. AMP-PNP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 10 min. To each sample, 130 μl of sample buffer and 334 μl of saturated CsCl were added. The samples were run at 20 °C and at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Scans were taken at 260 and 280 nm until equilibrium was reached (∼40 h). Topoisomerase II-mediated Hydrolysis of ATP—The ATPase assays were performed using an ADP-sensitive-linked enzyme assay (23Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 24Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21342-21349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained 30–200 nm topoisomerase II and, when indicated, 20 nm of negatively supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA. Reactions were carried out in volumes of 60 μl containing 1.25 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 110 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm phosphoenolpyrovate, and 0.2 mm NADH, 1.5 μl of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored spectrophotometrically for 10 min at 37 °C (Uvicon 923 spectrophotometer). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was monitored as the rate of oxidation of NADH and determined by the absorbance decrease at 340 nm. Insertion of Two Amino Acids at Position 351 in Human Topoisomerase IIα Abolishes the Strand Passage Activity of the Enzyme—In a previous study performed by Jensen et al. (8Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it was observed that insertion of two amino acids at position 351 in human topoisomerase IIα disrupted the ability of the enzyme to complement growth of a yeast strain in which the endogenous topoisomerase II gene was deleted. Fig. 1A verifies the complementation inability of the mutant enzyme (351i). The alignment with the crystallized S. cerevisiae topoisomerase II fragment suggests that the insertion in 351i is situated at the inner wall of the transducer domain in the DNA transport path of the enzyme as shown in Fig. 1B. To determine the underlying causes of the complementation inability, 351i was purified to near homogeneity as seen from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel in Fig. 1C and subjected to biochemical analysis. To investigate the DNA strand passage activity of the mutant enzyme, a decatenation assay was performed first (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Whereas wild-type topoisomerase IIα under the given reaction conditions decatenated k-DNA, no release of mini-circles occurred with 351i even at high enzyme concentrations. A similar lack of DNA strand passage activity was observed in a DNA relaxation assay (Fig. 1D, lower panel) and in a DNA cleavage assay performed in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2A, lane 6). In the latter experiment, the enzyme was present in an ∼15-fold excess, which excludes that 351i can perform even a single round of strand passage. Thus, consistent with the lack of in vivo complementation, 351i has lost its overall catalytic activity.Fig. 2351i retains DNA cleavage/ligation activity.A, upper panel, 351i or wild-type human topoisomerase IIα was incubated with supercoiled plasmid DNA at 37 °C in the absence or presence of ATP or the ATP analog, AMP-PNP.

Middle panel, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA ligation was tested using the topoisomerase II suicide system. In this system, kinetically competent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were formed by incubating topoisomerase II and a substrate designed to prevent ligation due to the release of a trinucleotide 5′ to the cleavage position on the top strand upon DNA cleavage. Cleavage reactions were stopped by the addition of NaCl to 0.4 m, and ligation was initiated by the addition of a 45-mer ligation substrate. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated time points and subjected subsequently to electrophoresis in an 8% SDS gel and visualized on a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). DNA ligation is revealed as a disappearance of cleavage complexes due to release of topoisomerase II from the labeled oligonucleotide upon ligation to the 45-mer ligation substrate.

The two activities reside in different regions of the enzyme and can work independent of each other; however, a strict coordination is required to obtain topoisomerase activity. Coordination of the two catalytic activities of topoisomerase II is obtained through domain communication. When investigating topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, domain communication can be revealed by the addition of a nucleotide that binds to the N terminus of the enzyme and thereby increases the DNA cleavage activity of the cleavage/ligation domain (19Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the lack of topoisomerase II activity seen with 351i is caused by an inability of the enzyme to perform DNA cleavage, 351i and the wild-type enzyme were incubated first with supercoiled plasmid DNA in the absence of nucleotide. The reactions were stopped by SDS, which immediately denatures the enzyme. After proteinase K treatment, cleavage products were separated from uncleaved plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, upper panel, compare lanes 2 and 5). In the absence of the nucleotide, 351i actually displays a DNA cleavage level higher than that of the wild-type enzyme as also shown in the histogram in Fig. 2A, lower panel. The result shows that the mutant enzyme indeed has retained its cleavage activity. The addition of the ATP analog, AMP-PNP, to the cleavage reaction increases the DNA cleavage level obtained by 351i (Fig. 2A). However, the stimulatory effect of the nucleotide is low compared with the effect obtained with the wild-type enzyme. In the presence of ATP, the wild-type enzyme relaxes the DNA. Even with these high enzyme concentrations, ATP only allows 351i to cleave DNA in support of its lack of overall catalytic activity. In the assay described above, the DNA cleavage level reflects an equilibrium between topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and ligation. To investigate the DNA ligation ability of 351i, an advantage was taken of the topoisomerase II suicide system, which allows a separation of the DNA cleavage and ligation half-reactions (Fig. 2B, upper panel) (22Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the topoisomerase II cleavage complex generated upon cleavage of a suicide substrate is kinetically competent (22Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is able to perform ligation if a suitable ligation substrate is added to the cleavage mixture. Topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes were prepared for the ligation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After an increase in the salt concentration to inhibit further cleavage, ligation was initiated by the addition of a 45-mer DNA oligonucleotide able to hybridize to the bottom strand of the cleaved substrate. Ligation reactions were stopped with SDS at different time points and subjected to electrophoresis in an 8% SDS gel. The cleavage complexes were identified because of the covalent linkage of labeled DNA, whereas ligation was revealed as a disappearance of cleavage products upon the addition of ligation substrate (Fig. 2B, middle panel). The results obtained in the ligation assay shows that 351i and the wild-type enzyme have very similar ra"

On the other hand, replacement of the corresponding region of TC10 with the AB region enabled TC10 to acquire ACK-binding ability. Eight residues are different between the AB region and the corresponding region of TC10. The mutational analysis indicated that all eight residues contribute to the binding to ACK2. The assays for the Cdc42-mediated activation of ACK2 indicated that the AB region is essential for Cdc42 to activate ACK2 in cells.

Some of the target molecules including WASP, PAK, ACK, and MRCK share a Cdc42-interactive motif named “CRIB” domain (18Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, the interactive specificity of Cdc42 with these target molecules is largely unknown. Determination of the specificity becomes critical for us in understanding the mechanisms underlying the multiple cellular function of Cdc42. ACK, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, is a specific downstream target molecule of Cdc42 (19Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The ACK family has two members, ACK1 and ACK2, which contain similar functional domains (19Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Cdc42-interactive domain (the CRIB domain) in ACK1 and ACK2 are 100% identical (19Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), indicating that ACK1 and ACK2 have the same biochemical property when interacting with Cdc42. Indeed, both ACK1 and ACK2 interact exclusively with Cdc42 (not Rac or Rho) (19Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Functionally, both ACK1 and ACK2 are activated by cell adhesion through integrin β1 and proteoglycan (21Yang W. Lin Q.

Herrera R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that both ACK1 and ACK2 possess a clathrin-binding motif and directly interact with clathrin, a coating protein for receptor endocytic vesicles (10Yang W. Lo C.G. Despenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that ACK may play a role in clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, ACK2 phosphorylates SH3PX1, a sorting nexin, and facilitates the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (24Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, Ark-1 (a homologue of ACK) genetically interacts with UNC101 (the homologue of the mammalian clathrin-associated protein AP47) and SLI-1 (the homologue of mammalian Cbl that is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination of epidermal growth factor receptor) and negatively regulates epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (25Hopper N.A. Lee J. Sternberg P.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These data indicate the role of ACK in epidermal growth factor receptor degradation. The structural studies of the complex of Cdc42 and the CRIB domain of ACK by NMR suggest that Val-42 and Leu-174 of Cdc42 are the residues that interact with the CRIB domain of ACK (26Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Manser E Lim L Laue E.D. Nature. 1999; 399: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Further mutational analysis of the interaction of Cdc42 with the CRIB domains derived from ACK, PAK, and WASP identified additional residues, such as Met-45 and Ile-46, for binding to ACK (27Owen D. Mott H.R. Laue E.D. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the residues Val-42 and Leu-174 are conserved in TC10, the closest member to Cdc42 in the Rho family of small GTPases that does not interact with ACK (28Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Val-42 and Leu-174 may not be the residues determining the binding specificity of Cdc42 to ACK. Our initial mutagenesis studies also indicated that Met-45 and Ile-46 alone affected little of the binding of Cdc42 to ACK2. Therefore, there should be additional residues or regions that determine the binding specificity of Cdc42 to ACK. To define the specific ACK-binding region in Cdc42, we utilized TC10 to construct Cdc42/TC10 chimeras as GST fusion proteins and screen the ACK-binding region in Cdc42. By this approach, we identified a specific ACK-binding (AB) region in Cdc42. This AB region sits between the switch I and switch II regions and possesses a structure containing one U-turn and two β-sheets (β2 and β3). Our studies provide a molecular basis for generating the ACK binding-defective mutants of Cdc42 to delineate the ACK-mediated signaling pathway. Construction of Cdc42/TC10 Chimeras and Point Mutants of Cdc42 and TC10—Wild type pcDNA3-Cdc42 and pcDNA3-TC10 were used as templates to construct chimera and point mutations. The chimera constructs were made by PCR. In the chimera primers, one-half of the primer sequence was from Cdc42 and the other half from TC10. The T7 and SP6 primers were used for the flanking primers. The chimera fragments from PCR were digested by BamHI/EcoRI and cloned into the GST fusion protein vector pGEX-4T3. The point mutations of Cdc42 or TC10 were made using the mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The pGEX4T3-Cdc42 or TC10 was used as the template. The mutagenesis was performed according to the instructions provided by Stratagene. The sequences of the chimera and point mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (JM109) and affinity purified with glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (10Yang W.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Preparation of Lysates—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For transfection, the cells were cultured overnight to 90% confluency. The pcDNA3-HA-tagged ACK2 or Myc-tagged WASP were transfected into COS-7 cells with the LipofectAMINE transfection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were lysed with pre-cold mammalian cell lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) by rocking the plates at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 4 min at 4 °C before use. GTPγS Loading—The glutathione-agarose bead-bound GST chimeras Cdc42 and TC10 or their mutants were rinsed once with 10 mm EDTA and incubated with 10 mm EDTA for 10 min at 22 °C. These same chimeras or their mutants were washed three times with bacterial lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) plus 10 mm MgCl2 and incubated in 1 μm GTPγS at 22 °C for 5 min. After the unloaded GTPγS was removed, the bead-bound GST chimeras Cdc42 and TC10 or the mutants were washed once with the bacterial lysis buffer plus 10 mm MgCl2 and were then ready for the binding assays. The Binding Assays with GST Fusion Proteins—The GTPγS-loaded glutathione-agarose bead-bound GST chimeras Cdc42 and TC10 or their mutants were incubated with HA-tagged ACK2-, Myc-tagged ACK1-, or Myc-tagged WASP-overexpressed COS-7 cell lysates in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the mammalian cell lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The co-precipitated HA-tagged ACK2 or Myc-tagged WASP was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody or an anti-Myc antibody. The GST fusion proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—For immunoprecipitation, the pre-cleared cell lysate was incubated with primary antibody on ice for 30 min, protein A beads were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. The beads were washed with lysis buffer three times, and the immunoprecipitation complexes were either made ready for enzymatic assays or directly dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The immunoblots were performed as instructed using ECL immunoblot kits (Amersham Biosciences). ACK2 Interacts with Cdc42 (Not TC10)—As shown in Fig. 1A, TC10 is highly homologous to Cdc42, and its primary sequence is 66.7% identical to that of Cdc42. In addition, TC10 shares multiple binding partners with Cdc42, such as PAK, WASP, and the Cdc42 interactive protein CIP4 (28Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 1B, although the GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 strongly interacted with ACK2, the GTPγS-loaded TC10 did not bind to ACK2. Thus, determination of the binding of the Cdc42/TC10 chimera proteins to ACK2 will enable us to define the AB region in Cdc42. The AB Region of Cdc42 Is Located between Residues 36 and 68—To construct the Cdc42/TC10 chimeras, we replaced the portions of TC10 starting from the amino terminus with the corresponding portions of Cdc42 or the portions of Cdc42 starting from the amino terminus with the corresponding portions of TC10 (Fig. 2A). The chimeras were subcloned into a GST fusion protein vector, expressed in bacteria, and purified and immobilized by glutathione-conjugated agarose beads. The immobilized chimera GTPase proteins were loaded with GTPγS and then incubated with HA-tagged ACK2-overexpressed COS-7 lysates. The amount of ACK2 precipitated by the GTPγS-loaded Cdc42/TC10 chimeras was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. When the first 49 amino acid residues at the amino terminus of TC10 were replaced by the corresponding portion of Cdc42 (the first 35 amino acid residues at the amino terminus), the resulting chimera C35T50 did not gain any ACK2-binding capacity (Fig. 2B, lane 3), indicating that the first 35 amino acid residues in Cdc42 are not critical for interaction with ACK. When the first 82 amino acid residues of TC10 were replaced, the resulting chimera, C68T83, acquired full ACK2-binding capacity (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Further replacement of the residues toward the carboxyl terminus of TC10 with the corresponding region of Cdc42 yielded the same ACK2-binding capacity as that of C68T83 (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8). These data suggest that (i) the region between amino acid residues 36 and 68 of Cdc42 is the ACK2-binding domain and (ii) the region after amino acid residue 69 of Cdc42 (i.e. amino acid residues 69–191) is not the determinant region for interaction with ACK2. To confirm these conclusions, we replaced the portions of Cdc42 at the amino terminus with the corresponding regions of TC10. As shown in lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 2B, replacement of the first 35 amino acid residues of Cdc42 did not change the ACK2-binding capacity (lane 1), whereas replacement of the first 68 amino acid residues of Cdc42 with the corresponding region of TC10 completely lost the binding to ACK2 (lane 2). These data supported the conclusion that the region in Cdc42 containing amino acid residues 36–68 determines the binding to ACK2. Thus, we designated the region between amino acid residues 36 and 68 in Cdc42 as the ACK-binding region or the AB region. The AB Region Confers the Binding Specificity to ACK—To determine sufficiency of the AB region in binding to ACK, we replaced the AB region with the corresponding region of TC10 and yielded a chimera, Cdc42[T50–82]. As shown in lane 3 of Fig. 2C, Cdc42[T50–82] did not interact with ACK2, indicating that the AB region determines ACK2-binding ability. Furthermore, the chimera TC10[C36–68], in which the corresponding region of TC10 was replaced by the AB region, acquired the same ACK2-binding capacity as that of Cdc42 (Fig. 2C, lane 2). We also determined the binding of both Cdc42[T50–82] and TC10[C36–68] to ACK1 and observed the same results as the binding to ACK2 (data not shown). However, the replacement of the AB region with the corresponding region of TC10 did not affect the binding of Cdc42 to WASP (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Thus, the AB region confers the binding specificity of Cdc42 to ACK. The Binding to ACK by the AB Region Is Co-determined by Multiple Residues—The alignment of the amino acid sequence of the AB region with the corresponding region of TC10 shows only eight residues that are different between Cdc42 and TC10 (Fig. 3A). These residues should determine the binding to ACK. To identify the residues in the AB region that specifically interact with ACK, we made point mutations for each residue among the eight residues in the AB region and mutated the residue to the corresponding residue in TC10 (Fig. 3B). To avoid GTPγS loading, we used Cdc42Q61L, a GTPase-defective mutant, as the template for the point mutation. The ACK2 pull-down assays with these point mutants of Cdc42, as shown in Fig. 3C, indicated that no mutation of a single residue among the eight residues significantly affected the binding to ACK2, suggesting that the binding involves multiple residues. To further identify the residues for binding to ACK2, we replaced the residues in the corresponding region of TC10 with the residues in the AB region of Cdc42 and determined the ACK2-binding capacity of the mutants (Fig. 4A). Replacement of five of the eight residues from either the amino terminus or the carboxyl terminus of the AB-corresponding region of TC10 with the residues in the AB region of Cdc42 partially recovered ACK2-binding ability compared with TC10[C36–68], the AB region substitution (Fig. 4B, lanes 2, 4, and 13). The three-residue substitutions of TC10, such as TC10[C44–49] and TC10[C50–68], also partially recovered ACK2-binding capacity (Fig. 4B, lanes 11 and 12). However, TC10[S57T/T59M/V60I], a three-residue substitution, did not recover any of the binding capacity (Fig. 4B, lane 8). Only a two-residue substitution chimera, TC10[36–43], partially recovered ACK2-binding capacity (Fig. 4B, lane 3). The other two-residue substitution (TC10[K63E/Q64P]) and all of the single-residue substitutions, such as TC10[S57T], TC10[T59M], TC10[V60I], and TC10[K63E], did not recover any of the ACK2-binding capacity (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–7, 9, and 10). The data suggest that the binding to ACK2 is mediated by all of the eight residues in the AB region. No single residue dominates the binding. The AB Region Localizes between Switch I and Switch II and Has a Unique Structure—The eight residues in the AB region that determine the binding specificity to ACK start from Asn-39 and end at Phe-56. Residues 39–56 sit between switch I and switch II. Mott et al. (26Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Manser E Lim L Laue E.D. Nature. 1999; 399: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have solved the structure of a complex between Cdc42 and the ACK CRIB domain by NMR. Part of the structure is shown in Fig. 5. From the amino acid sequence of the AB region (39NYAVTVMIGGEPYTLGLF56), we noticed that the eight residues, i.e. Asn-39, Thr-43, Met-45, Ile-46, Glu-49, Pro-50, Thr-52, and Phe-56 (in bold), were distributed symmetrically centered by Gly-47 and Gly-48. From the structure in Fig. 5A, the AB region resembles a U-shaped structure that contains two β-sheets (β2 and β3). The Gly-47 and Gly-48 residues constitute the turn structure. The eight residues that involve binding to ACK sit in pairs on the two β-sheets of the U-shaped structure (Fig. 5B). The interactions between the four pairs of residues, Ile-46 with Glu-49, Met-45 with Pro-50, Thr-43 with Thr-52, and Asn-39 with Phe-56, may be necessary to sustain the U-shaped structure of the AB region and stabilize the binding surface to the ACK-CRIB domain. This model may provide an explanation as to why all eight residues in the AB region are required for the binding to ACK. From the structure of the complexes of Cdc42/PAK·CRIB, Cdc42/WASP·CRIB, and Cdc42/PAR-6·semi-CRIB/PDZ determined by either NMR or x-ray diffraction (29Morreale A. Venkatesan M. Mott H.R. Owen D.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we noticed that the β2-sheet in the AB region is the binding surface for interaction with all of the CRIB domains. However, the β3-sheet does not interact with any residue on the CRIB domain. Our data show that the residues on the β3-sheet also determine the binding to ACK, suggesting an important role for the β3-sheet in interaction with effectors. Our data also suggest that the eight residues identified in the AB region are specific for the binding to ACK. Replacement of these eight residues with corresponding residues of TC10 did not change the binding affinity to WASP. The residue Leu-174 on the α5 helix of Cdc42 has been proposed as a key residue for binding to ACK and WASP. Our data suggest that Leu-174 alone is not sufficient to bind to ACK, because replacement of the amino acid terminus of Cdc42, which contains the residues 1–68, with the corresponding region of TC10 diminished the binding to ACK2 (Fig. 2B). In addition, the corresponding residue of TC10 to the residue Leu-174 is Ile-188. This change does not affect the binding to ACK, as the replacement of residues 1–82 of TC10 with the corresponding residues of Cdc42 gained the full binding to ACK2 (Fig. 2B). The AB Region of Cdc42 Determines the Activation of ACK2 in Cells—To examine whether the AB region determines the interaction of Cdc42 with ACK2 in cells, we co-transfected HA-tagged ACK2 with Myc-tagged Cdc42 wild type, the GTPase-defective mutant Q61L, and the GTPase- and AB region-defective mutant Cdc42[T50–82]Q61L into COS-7 cells. We immunoprecipitated HA-ACK2 with an anti-HA antibody and detected the co-precipitated Cdc42 by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, although the GTPase-defective mutant Cdc42Q61L was co-immunoprecipitated with ACK2 (lane 5), the AB region-defective mutant Cdc42[T50–82]Q61L was not (lane 4), indicating that the AB region determines the binding of Cdc42 to ACK2 in cells. To examine whether the AB region-conferred interaction has physiological function, we determined the effects of Cdc42Q61L and Cdc42[T50–82]Q61L on the activation of ACK2 in COS-7 cells. Our previous studies have shown that SH3PX1 (sorting nexin 9) is the phosphorylation substrate of ACK2 in cells (24Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the activation assays, we used the tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3PX1 as a read-out. As shown in Fig. 6B, co-transfection of SH3PX1 with Cdc42Q61L and ACK2 yielded much stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3PX1 (top panel, lane 6) than the controls (co-transfection with Cdc42 WT and ACK2 (top panel, lane 4)) or ACK2 alone (top panel, lane 3), indicating that ACK2 kinase activity is stimulated by Cdc42Q61L in the cells. However, co-transfection of SH3PX1 with Cdc42[T50–82]Q61L and ACK2 yielded much less tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3PX1 (Fig. 6B, top panel, lane 5) than the controls (top panel, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the AB region-defective mutant Cdc42[T50–82]Q61L has a dominant negative effect on the tyrosine kinase activity of ACK2. These data conclude that the interaction of the AB region of Cdc42 with ACK2 plays an essential role in ACK2 activation in cells, and the disruption of the function of the AB region results in defection of ACK2-mediated signaling. Conclusions—Cdc42 has multiple downstream effectors. Determination of the binding specificity to these effectors becomes a challenge in the dissection of Cdc42-mediated signal pathways. Here we show that the AB region, between amino acid residues 36 and 68 in Cdc42, confers the binding specificity to ACK. The eight residues in the AB region that sit in pairs on the β2- and β3-sheets may be necessary for the structure of the ACK-binding surface. No single residue in the AB region determines the binding to ACK. Our data have proposed a model that shows that the binding specificity of Cdc42 to its downstream effectors is conferred by a set of residues, not by a single residue. Our studies have provided a molecular basis for the delineation of the ACK2-mediated signaling pathway. We have proven that overexpression of chimera Cdc42[T50–82] disrupts the biological function of ACK2 in cells. Next we will determine the biological effects of Cdc42[T50–82] on cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, cellular transformation, and epidermal growth factor receptor degradation. The outcome of the studies will help us to define the ACK-mediated intracellular signaling pathway."

The diminished levels of altered holo-iso-1-cytochrome c are due to the rapid degradation that is carried out by a novel proteolytic pathway in the IMS of mitochondria. SUE1, a nuclear gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein, was identified with a genetic screen for mutants that diminish RDD. The levels of RDD and certain other types of altered holo-iso-1-cytochrome c were elevated in ρ– sue1 strains. Also, ρ+ sue1 strains containing certain altered holo-iso-1-cytochromes c grew better on non-fermentable carbon sources than the corresponding ρ+ SUE1 strains. These results indicate that Sue1p may play an important role in the degradation of abnormal holo-iso-1-cytochrome c in the mitochondria.

These results indicate that Sue1p may play an important role in the degradation of abnormal holo-iso-1-cytochrome c in the mitochondria. Intracellular proteolysis plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the proper folded state of proteins. It ensures removal of damaged and misfolded polypeptides because they are prone to aggregation. A basic mechanism for control of protein degradation is compartmentalization (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, proteases have been detected in four compartments: the cytoplasm, nucleus, lysosome, and mitochondrion. The mitochondria have various subcompartments that possess ATP-dependent proteases as a quality control system for selectively removing unassembled or misfolded polypeptides. Several ATP-dependent proteases such as the Pim1 protease in the matrix or AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) proteases in the inner membrane of mitochondria have been identified (2Goldberg A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 3Goldberg A.L. Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Lee D.H. Rohrwild M. Biol.

Additional proteolytic pathways may exist in the other two subcompartments of mitochondria: the intermembrane space (IMS) 1The abbreviations used are: IMS, intermembrane space; holo-1, holo-iso-1-cytochrome(s) c; holo-2, holo-iso-2-cytochrome(s) c; iso-1, iso-1-cytochrome(s) c; iso-2, iso-2-cytochrome(s) c; RDD, ρ–-dependent degradation; LDD, labile dependent degradation; ADD, amphipathic dependent degradation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Nfs–, diminished or lack of growth on media containing non-fermentable carbon sources as the sole source of energy, such as glycerol and ethanol. and outer membrane. The existence of an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity in the mitochondrial IMS in mammals has been reported, although the ATP-dependent protease so far has not been identified (6Sitte N. Dubiel W. Kloetzel P.M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 7Granot Z. Geiss-Friedlander R. Melamed-Book N. Eimerl S. Timberg R. Weiss A.M. Hales K.H. Hales D.B. Stocco D.M. Orly J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2461-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We report herein a proteolytic pathway in the IMS of mitochondria acting on certain altered holo-iso-1-cytochromes c (holo-1) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae contains two forms of cytochrome c, iso-1-cytochrome c (iso-1) and iso-2-cytochrome c (iso-2), which are encoded by the nuclear genes CYC1 and CYC7, which normally compose 95 and 5% of total cytochrome c, respectively, in aerobically grown, derepressed cells (8Sherman F. Taber H. Campbell W. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and which are 80% identical. The isocytochromes c are synthesized in the cytosol as apocytochromes c and subsequently imported into mitochondria. Heme is covalently attached to the apocytochromes c by cytochrome c heme lyase, which is encoded by the gene CYC3, resulting in the formation of the mature holocytochromes c (9Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Import of the apocytochromes c is dependent on the action of cytochrome c heme lyase, and cyc3-Δ mutants lacking cytochrome c heme lyase accumulate apocytochromes c in the cytosol (10Dumont M. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, apo-iso-1-cytochrome c is not detected in cyc3-Δ mutants, whereas apo-iso-2-cytochrome c is present at the corresponding level of holo-iso-2-cytochrome c (holo-2) in related normal CYC3 strains (11Matner R.R. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9811-9821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dumont et al. (12Dumont M.E. Mathews A.J. Nall B.T. Baim S.B. Eustice D.C. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated with pulse-chase experiments that unimported apo-iso-1-cytochrome c is rapidly degraded, and Pearce and Sherman (13Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this apo-iso-1-cytochrome c degradation requires functional proteasomes and is mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. In contrast, holo-1 and holo-2 are highly stable. We have been identifying and characterizing mitochondrial protein degradation systems by investigating mutant forms of iso-1 that are rapidly degraded and by determining mutations of other genes that diminish the degradation. Downie et al. (14Downie J.A. Stewart J.W. Brockman N. Schweinruber A.M. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 369-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) observed that certain mutated holo-2 are at normal or nearly normal levels in ρ+ strains, but are absent in ρ– strains, although wild-type isocytochromes c are present at normal levels in both ρ+ and related ρ– strains. Subsequently, Pearce and Sherman (15Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) generated equivalent mutants of holo-1 and showed that amino acid replacements at several positions of holo-1 diminish the levels of holo-1, preferentially in ρ– strains. This phenomenon is referred to as the ρ–-dependent degradation (RDD) phenotype. The iso-1 that shows RDD is referred to as RDD iso-1. In addition, pulse-chase experiments with a variety of altered forms of cytochrome c revealed two other degradation pathways acting on other altered forms of cytochrome c, labile dependent degradation (LDD) and amphipathic dependent degradation (ADD). LDD, exemplified by Gly6 replacements, does not have diminished levels in ρ– strains (15Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). ADD, containing amphipathic structures in the N-terminal region, also does not have diminished levels in ρ– strains. 2X. Chen, R. P. Moerschell, D. A. Pearce, D. D. Ramanan, and F. Sherman, unpublished data. The cytochromes c degraded by these pathways are designated LDD and ADD cytochromes c, respectively. The introduction of the global suppressor N52I (18Das G. Hickey D.R. McLendon D. McLendon G. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) into both RDD and LDD holo-1 partially restores the levels of RDD holo-1 in ρ– strains (17Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and gives rise to better growth on a non-fermentable carbon source for LDD holo-1 in ρ+ strains (17Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Moreover, Pearce and Sherman (15Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the absence of either cytochrome aa3 or cytochrome c1, the physiological partner of cytochrome c in the IMS of mitochondria, causes increased sensitivity of RDD holo-1 to degradation. These observations suggest that the degradation of RDD and LDD holo-1 may occur in the IMS of mitochondria. All known ATP-dependent mitochondrial proteases (Yme1p, Afg3p, and Rca1p) are not involved in the degradation of T78I RDD holo-1 (15Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, the protease responsible for the degradation of RDD holo-1 in the IMS of mitochondria could be a novel protease. We investigated this novel protease system genetically by using strain cyc1-1388 with T78S RDD holo-1 for detecting mutants with diminished degradation. Strain cyc1-1388 was mutagenized, and colonies containing increased levels of cytochrome c were detected by the benzidine staining procedure, in which the color intensity is proportional to the level of holo-1 (19Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Parker J.H. Inhaber E. Shipman N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5446-5456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of cytochrome c were subsequently quantified by low temperature spectroscopic examination of intact cells. High levels of RDD holo-1 in these ρ– mutants could be due to the direct or indirect diminution of a protease. One recessive nuclear mutation was characterized and used to identify SUE1. The degradation of three classes of altered holo-1 (RDD, LDD, and ADD holo-1) was investigated in sue1-Δ strains. Elevated levels of altered holo-1 (T78S RDD, G6I LDD, and ADD holo-1) were observed in ρ– sue1-Δ strains. Furthermore, better growth was observed in ρ+ sue1-Δ strains containing G6I LDD or ADD holo-1. These results indicate that Sue1p plays an important role in the degradation of some labile forms of altered holo-1 in the mitochondria. Genetic Nomenclature—CYC1 and CYC7 encode iso-1 and iso-2, respectively, the two isozymes of cytochrome c in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Dominant alleles are denoted with uppercase letters, and recessive alleles with lowercase letters. CYC1 refers to the wild-type allele, whereas the mutant allele of the CYC1 gene is designated cyc1-X, such as the cyc1-1388 mutant allele. The cyc7-67 allele corresponds to a partial deletion that results in the loss of iso-2. SUE1, identified in this study, refers to the wild-type gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein. The sue1-Δ mutant allele completely lacks Sue1p, and the sue1-2 mutant allele contains a combined nonsense and frameshift mutation at position 9, resulting in a nonfunctional Sue1p. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I, and the cyc1 alleles used in this study are listed in Table II. Iso-1 encoded by, for example, cyc1-1388 is designated Cyc1-1388p.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeParental strainSource/Ref.B-7528ρ+ MATa cyc1-31 cyc7-67 ura3-52 lys5-1016Moerschell R.P.

Open table in a new tab Table IIcyc1 alleles Open table in a new tab Media—Escherichia coli cells containing plasmids were as grown in LB medium (10 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 10 g/liter NaCl, and 5 g/liter yeast extract plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 25–50 μg/ml kanamycin) (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Standard YPD, YPS, YPG, and YPE media; synthetic minimal medium; synthetic complete medium, synthetic complete medium/Ura–, and synthetic complete medium/Leu–; and other omission media have been described by Sherman (21Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The media contained 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and either 2% ethanol (YPE) or 2% sucrose (YPS). Medium A was composed of synthetic minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids, 20 μg/ml uracil, and 2% Bactoagar. Synthetic lactate contained 0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% Bacto-agar, and 3.3% of a 30% lactate solution. Medium B was composed of synthetic lactate supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids and 20 μg/ml uracil. Synthetic complete medium/Ura– and supplemented with 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid (22Boeke J.D. Lacroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) was also used. Construction of a Yeast Strain Containing the cyc1-1388 Allele—The desired CYC1 mutations were obtained by transforming the defective cyc1 mutant strain B-7528 (MATa cyc1-31 cyc7-67 ura3-52 lys5-10) directly with PCR-generated fragments and selection of at least partially functional cyc1 transformants, followed by sequencing the CYC1 locus of these transformants to confirm that the selected transformants contained the desired cyc1 alleles. First, the primer pair OL256 and OL257 (Table III) was used to amplify 1.7-kb fragments containing either cyc1-1209 (T78S/C102A) or CYC1-820 (C102A). Subsequently, a primer of 92 oligonucleotides was designed that contained five amino acids (RRASV) inserted between residues 4 and 5 of the CYC1 gene (primer RRASV-cyc1). Primer RRASV-cyc1 (Table III) was paired with primer OL257 to generate 653-bp fragments containing either the cyc1-1388 or CYC1-1389 allele (Table II). The B-7528 yeast strain was then transformed with either the cyc1-1388 or CYC1-1389 fragments following the procedures described by Yamamoto et al. (23Yamamoto T. Moerschell R.P. Wakem L.P. Ferguson D. Sherman F.

The OL256 and OL257 primer pair (Table III) was used to amplify the 1.7-kb fragments containing the cyc1 allele of interest. Three host strains (B-7528, B-7889, and B-8354) were transformed with these 1.7-kb fragments carrying the cyc1 allele of interest. The procedures were described by Yamamoto et al. (23Yamamoto T. Moerschell R.P. Wakem L.P. Ferguson D. Sherman F. Yeast. 1992; 8: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The corresponding ρ– strains were obtained by growing the ρ+ mutant strains in YPD plates containing ethidium bromide.Table IVConstruction of three sets of isogenic strains bearing different cyc1 alleles with or without SUE1B-7528 derivativesB-7889 derivativesB-8354 derivativesTemplate strainsNormalCYC1+CYC1+CYC1+B-8514LDDcyc1-1120 (G6I)cyc1-1120 (G6I)Not recoveredB-8312LDDcyc1-1113 (G6A)cyc1-1113 (G6A)B-8301RDDcyc1-1209 (T78S)cyc1-1209 (T78S)cyc1-1209 (T78S)B-8634RDDcyc1-1195 (T78I)cyc1-1195 (T78I)cyc1-1195 (T78I)B-8513RDDcyc1-1205 (T78G)cyc1-1205 (T78G)B-8630RDDcyc1-1206 (T78L)cyc1-1206 (T78L)B-8631ADDcyc1-868cyc1-868cyc1-868B-7734ADDcyc1-865B-7735ADDcyc1-860B-7686 Open table in a new tab Construction of the sue1-Δ1::kanR Mutant Strain by the PCR-based One-step Disruption Method—A sue1-Δ1::kanR mutant strain was purchased from Research Genetics (24Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The chromosomal DNA was prepared from this strain and served as a template, and the primer pair SUEF1 and SUER1 (Table III) was used to amplify the PCR-based disruption fragments carrying the sue1-Δ1::kanR mutant gene flanked by 100 bp homologous to the region directly upstream of the start codon and downstream of the stop codon of the SUE1 gene. Three sets of isogenic ρ+ cyc1 mutant strains, which were constructed as described above (see Table IV), were transformed with the amplified fragments, and G418-resistant colonies were obtained on YPD plates containing 300 μg/ml G418. Construction of the sue1-2 Mutant Strain by Site-directed Mutagenesis—The primer pair OL150WF and OL150WR (Table III) was used to produce the 1.5-kb fragments encompassing YPR150w and ∼1 kb of DNA sequence downstream of the termination codon of this gene. The 1.5-kb fragments were then inserted into the TA vector (Invitrogen). The construction was carried out with 10 ng of TA vector containing the 1.5-kb insert as a template and 125 ng of both 150FS1 and 150FS2 (Table III) as two complementary oligonucleotide primers for amplification in the presence of 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The 40 nucleotides of primers 150FS1 and 150FS2 contained the desired sue1-2 mutation, a deletion of an A residue corresponding to nucleotide 9 of the YPR151c gene and to a position outside the open reading frame of YPR150w, 147 nucleotides downstream of the chain termination codon. The sue1-2 deletion of an A residue was introduced into the TA vector containing the 1.5-kb insert using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The TA vector with the 1.5-kb insert containing the sue1-2 allele was obtained. The 1.5-kb insert containing the sue1-2 gene was transferred to the pAB621 vector, a yeast shuttle vector containing the URA3 gene. Subsequently, the pAB621 vector with the desired insert containing the sue1-2 gene was linearized with the NheI restriction enzyme within the insert and integrated at the chromosomal SUE1 locus of the constructed yeast strain B-14746, an isogenic strain of B-7889 containing the cyc1-868 allele. The sequence of the sue1-2 allele was verified by examining the appropriate PCR product. Construction of a Series of Subclones in the YCp50 Vector—Plasmids pAB2930, pAB2931, and pAB2933 (see Fig. 1) were constructed by digestion of pAB2927 with SphI, NruI, and EcoRI, respectively, followed by gel purification of large fragments of ∼11, 13, and 11 kb, respectively, and subsequent recircularization with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Plasmids pAB2930, pAB2931, and pAB2933 are YCp50-based centromere plasmids containing the URA3 gene. For plasmids pAB2932 and pAB2934, ∼4.5-kb BamHI and 2.7-kb HindIII fragments of pAB2927, respectively, were gel-purified and ligated into their corresponding sites in the polylinker of the YCp50 vector (see Fig. 1). Construction of the C-terminal Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-fused SUE1 Gene—Approximately 640-bp fragments containing the SUE1 gene (YPR151c without a stop codon) flanked with EcoRI restriction sites were amplified using the primer pair 151ADHF and 151GFPR (Table III) and subsequently digested with the EcoRI restriction enzyme. The gel-purified EcoRI fragments were then ligated to the EcoRI site in the polylinker of plasmid pGFP-C-FUS (pAA1931), giving rise to the C-terminal GFP-fused SUE1 gene under the control of the Pmet25 promoter. Plasmid pAB1931 carrying C-terminal GFP-SUE1 (pAB2935) was obtained from the ampicillin-resistant colonies. Both plasmids pAB1931 and pAB2935 were transformed into strain B-14705, an isogenic strain of B-7528 containing the CYC1 and sue1-Δ1::kanR genes. Colonies containing plasmid pAB1931 or pAB2935 were selected on synthetic complete medium/Ura– plates. Construction of the C-terminal Myc-tagged SUE1 Gene—Initially, the yeast strain bearing the C-terminal (Myc)3-tagged SUE1 gene was constructed. A (Myc)3-tagging cassette in plasmid pMPY-3×Myc (pAA1869) (25Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) was used as a template, and the following primer pair was designed: CmycF, with the 5′ 60 bases homologous to sequences immediately prior to the stop codon of SUE1 and the 3′ 18 bases complementary to unique sequences in the (Myc)3-tagging cassette; and CmycR, with the 5′ 63 bases homologous to sequences immediately 3′ of the stop codon of SUE1 and the 3′ 16 bases complementary to unique sequences in the (Myc)3-tagging cassette. PCR conditions were as described by Schneider et al. (25Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The gel-purified 1.5-kb fragments were transformed into strain B-14803. Ura+ colonies were selected and then grown overnight in YPD medium, and cultures were washed with water and spread onto 5-fluoroorotic acid plates. The 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant colonies were selected and subsequently confirmed by sequencing to contain the integrated C-terminal (Myc)3-tagged SUE1 gene without the URA3 gene. We did not detect any signal of Myc-tagged SUE1 in whole cell extracts using monoclonal antiserum (purchased from NeoMarkers) against the Myc tag. Thus, we tried to construct C-terminal (Myc)3-tagged SUE1 in the 2μ-based yeast expression vector pBEVY containing the URA3 gene (pAB2324) (26Miller III, C.A. Martinat M.A. Hyman L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3577-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and we also constructed SUE1 in the same vector (pAB2324) as a control. The total DNA prepared from the strain containing (Myc)3-tagged SUE1 was used as a template, and the primer pair 151ADHF and 151MYCR (Table III) was designed. Approximately 820-bp fragments containing C-terminal (Myc)3-tagged SUE1 flanked by EcoRI restriction sites were amplified, subsequently digested with the EcoRI restriction enzyme, and ligated to the EcoRI site in the polylinker of the pAB2324 vector. Meanwhile, wild-type SUE1 was also amplified using the primer pair 151ADHF and 151ADHR (Table III). Approximately 650-bp fragments containing SUE1 flanked by EcoRI restriction sites were amplified, digested, and ligated to the EcoRI site in the polylinker of pAB2324 as well. The plasmids containing either (Myc)3-tagged SUE1 (pAB2936) or SUE1 (pAB2937) under the control of the ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase-1) promoter were obtained from the ampicillin-resistant colonies and transformed into strain B-14705, an isogenic strain of B-7528 containing the CYC1 and sue1-Δ1::kanR genes. Strain B-14705 with pAB2936 or pAB2937 was selected on plates of synthetic dropout medium/Ura–. Determination of holo-1 Content—holo-1 levels in intact cells were screened by the benzidine staining method (17Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and examined visually with a spectroscope as described by Sherman and Slonimski (27Sherman F. Slonimski P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 90: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). More accurate estimation was performed by the method of low temperature (–196 °C) spectrophotometric recording with a modified Aviv Model 14DS spectrophotometer as described by Hickey et al. (28Hickey D.R. Jayaraman K. Goodhue C.T. Shah J. Clements J.M. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Immunological Procedures—Samples were electrophoresed on an SDS-4–20% gradient acrylamide gel, transferred to a Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with antiserum, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). Anti-cytochrome c polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:4000 in 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 137 mm NaCl); anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies were diluted 1:100 in 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS; and anti-His monoclonal antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. A Hybond-ECL membrane was incubated with diluted antibodies for 1 h in 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. The secondary antibodies were used at 1:2000 for 1 h. The membrane was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS, followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Yeast Mitochondria and the IMS of Mitochondria— Yeast strain B-14705 with plasmid pAB2936 or pAB2937 containing the SUE1 constructs was expressed at high levels under the control of the constitutive ADH1 promoter. Mitochondrial purification and subfractionation were carried out following the method described by Zinser and Daum (29Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Detection of GFP-fused Sue1p in Yeast Cells—Yeast strain B-14705 containing either pAB1931 or pAB2935 was grown overnight on synthetic complete medium/Ura– plates and diluted with distilled water to the appropriate concentration, followed by continuous growth in synthetic complete medium/Ura– overnight to A600 = 0.1–0.2. Cells were harvested and suspended at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 5% glucose. Rhodamine B (hexyl ester; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to a final concentration of 100 nm. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 s; washed; suspended in a small volume of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 5% glucose; and visualized by confocal microscopy on a Leica TCS SP microscope equipped with argon, krypton/argon, and ultra"
