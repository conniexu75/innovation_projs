https://openalex.org/W2075817888,"A large case-control study of malaria in West African children shows that a human leucocyte class I antigen (HLA-Bw53) and an HLA class II haplotype (DRB1*1302–DQB1*0501), common in West Africans but rare in other racial groups, are independently associated with protection from severe malaria. In this population they account for as great a reduction in disease incidence as the sickle-cell haemoglobin variant. These data support the hypothesis that the extraordinary polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex genes has evolved primarily through natural selection by infectious pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2091455173,"The structure of a 20-amino acid peptide inhibitor bound to the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and its interactions with the enzyme, are described. The x-ray crystal structure of the complex is the basis of the analysis. The peptide inhibitor, derived from a naturally occurring heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor, contains an amphipathic helix that is followed by a turn and an extended conformation. The extended region occupies the cleft between the two lobes of the enzyme and contains a five-residue consensus recognition sequence common to all substrates and peptide inhibitors of the catalytic subunit. The helical portion of the peptide binds to a hydrophobic groove and conveys high affinity binding. Loops from both domains converge at the active site and contribute to a network of conserved residues at the sites of magnesium adenosine triphosphate binding and catalysis. Amino acids associated with peptide recognition, nonconserved, extend over a large surface area."

https://openalex.org/W2162508156,"DNA-labeling studies in αβ T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice show that the lifespan of immature CD4+8+ thymocytes is 3.5 days irrespective of whether they are selected for maturation or not. While nonselected cells die, the binding of the TCR to thymic major histocompatibility complex molecules rescues CD4+8+ cells from programmed cell death and induces first upregulation of the TCR level and then differentiation into CD4+8− or CD4−8+ cells in the absence of any cell division. When most CD4+8+ thymocytes express a selectable transgenic TCR the formation of mature cells with high TCR levels is 10–20 times as efficient as observed in normal mice, yet still only 20% of the CD4+8+ cells become mature. This is due to the limited availability of selecting ‘niches’: most CD4+8+ thymocytes with a selectable transgenic TCR will undergo maturation when they represent only 5% or less of all CD4+8+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980711521,"The three-dimensional crystal structure of the copper-containing nitrite reductase (NIR) from Achromobacter cycloclastes has been determined to 2.3 angstrom (A) resolution by isomorphous replacement. The monomer has two Greek key beta-barrel domains similar to that of plastocyanin and contains two copper sites. The enzyme is a trimer both in the crystal and in solution. The two copper atoms in the monomer comprise one type I copper site (Cu-I; two His, one Cys, and one Met ligands) and one putative type II copper site (Cu-II; three His and one solvent ligands). Although ligated by adjacent amino acids Cu-I and Cu-II are approximately 12.5 A apart. Cu-II is bound with nearly perfect tetrahedral geometry by residues not within a single monomer, but from each of two monomers of the trimer. The Cu-II site is at the bottom of a 12 A deep solvent channel and is the site to which the substrate (NO2-) binds, as evidenced by difference density maps of substrate-soaked and native crystals."

https://openalex.org/W2046062059,"The proteins encoded by the myc gene family are involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, and aberrant expression of myc proteins has been implicated in the genesis of a variety of neoplasms. In the carboxyl terminus, myc proteins have two domains that encode a basic domain/helix-loop-helix and a leucine zipper motif, respectively. These motifs are involved both in DNA binding and in protein dimerization. In addition, myc protein family members share several regions of highly conserved amino acids in their amino termini that are essential for transformation. We report here that an N-terminal domain present in both the c-myc and N-myc proteins mediates binding to the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb. We show that the human papilloma virus E7 protein competes with c-myc for binding to pRb, indicating that these proteins share overlapping binding sites on pRb. Furthermore, a mutant Rb protein from a human tumour cell line that carried a 35-amino-acid deletion in its C terminus failed to bind to c-myc. Our results suggest that c-myc and pRb cooperate through direct binding to control cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1503363172,"Fibrillin, a connective tissue macromolecule (Mr = 350,000) which is normally insoluble in its tissue form, has been purified from the medium of human skin fibroblast and ligament cells in culture. Analysis of the amino acid composition indicates that fibrillin contains approximately 14% cysteine, of which one-third appears to be in the free reactive sulfhydryl form. Electron microscopic images of fibrillin reveal an extended, flexible molecule approximately 148 nm long and 2.2 nm wide. These length measurements are consistent with shape calculations based upon velocity sedimentation data. It is likely that the material we have purified from cell culture medium represents monomeric fibrillin consisting of a single polypeptide chain. Additional ultrastructural immunohistochemical data presented here suggest a model for the parallel, head-to-tail alignment of fibrillin molecules in microfibrils."

The 68-residue protein consists of a series of tightly packed loops held together by six disulfide bonds and has almost no regular secondary structure. Kistrin has an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) adhesion site recognition sequence important for binding to GP IIb-IIIa that is located at the apex of a long loop across the surface of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1979040385,"The engrailed gene product of Drosophila specifies the fate of a subset of cells in each segment. Our studies of engrailed regulation suggest that fate determination is an elaborate, multistep process. At the time in embryogenesis when the engrailed-dependent cell fate is probably determined, four modes of control act in an overlapping progression to govern engrailed expression. After activation by pair-rule genes, both an extracellular signal, wingless, and autoregulation are required for engrailed expression. Autoregulation graduates to wingless independence, but is transient, and is superseded by an engrailed- independent mode of maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W2076300921,"CAP is a component of the S. cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase complex. The N-terminal domain is required for cellular RAS responsiveness. Loss of the C-terminal domain is associated with morphological and nutritional defects. Here we report that cap- cells bud randomly and are defective in actin distribution. The morphological and nutritional defects associated with loss of the CAP C-terminal domain are suppressed by over-expression of PFY, the gene encoding profilin, an actin- and polyphosphoinositide-binding protein. The phenotype of cells lacking PFY resembles that of cells lacking the CAP C-terminal domain. Study of mutated yeast profilins and profilins from Acanthamoeba suggests that the ability of profilin to suppress cap- cells is dependent upon a property other than, or in addition to, its ability to bind actin. This property may be its ability to bind polyphosphoinositides. We propose that CAP and profilin provide a link between growth signals and remodeling of the cellular cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1551296854,"The cross-linking of membrane IgM on the surface of splenic B lymphocytes or WEHI 231 cells leads to the rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine of a 72-kDa protein as detected in Western blotting experiments using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The 72-kDa phosphoprotein detected in this manner comigrates, in both one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems, with PTK72, a 72-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase characterized previously in this laboratory (Zioncheck, T. F., Harrison, M. L., Isaacson, C. C., and Geahlen, R. L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19195-19202). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and anti-PTK72 antibodies immunoprecipitate the same protein-tyrosine kinase from extracts of anti-IgM-activated cells as determined by immune complex kinase assays and one-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. These results indicate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 72-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase is an early event in the activation of B lymphocytes via the antigen receptor."

Furthermore, native hsp25 was phosphorylated by the endogenous kinase(s) in a cell-free system as well as recombinant hsp25 was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C and catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The two major phosphorylation sites of native and recombinant hsp25 were determined as Ser-15 and Ser-86. There are no differences in the hsp25 phosphorylation sites phosphorylated by the protein kinase C, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the unknown intracellular kinase(s). The serine residues identified exist in all known small mammalian stress proteins and are located in the conserved kinase recognition sequence Arg-X-X-Ser."

https://openalex.org/W1983688537,"The effects of short-term phorbol ester treatment of CHO cells that stably express 900 fmol of recombinant human serotonin 5-HT1A receptor/mg of protein on coupling to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and on phosphorylation of the receptor were studied. Pretreatment of cell monolayers with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a dose- and time-dependent shift of the half-maximal dose of serotonin (5-HT) required to inhibit membrane adenylyl cyclase (from IC50 approximately 100 nM to approximately 400 nM). This desensitization (shift in IC50) was rapid, occurring with 5 min of pretreatment and being maximal by 10-15 min; it was also dose-dependent, being half-maximal at approximately 300 nM PMA. Desensitization was also induced by sn-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8) and blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors sphingosine and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7). In detached permeabilized cells, PMA pretreatment caused a rapid phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated 5-HT1A receptors, with an approximately 3-4-fold increase that was maximal after 15 min and persisted for 90 min. The phosphorylation occurred at a similar dose of PMA as that which induced desensitization (half-maximal at approximately 300 nM, maximal at 500 nM to 1 microM), could be reproduced by pretreatment with the PKC activators DiC8 or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and could be blocked by the PKC inhibitors sphingosine or H-7. The stoichiometry of the phosphorylation was approximately 2 mol of [32P]ATP/mol of receptor, suggesting the involvement at least two of three putative PKC sites within the 5-HT1A receptor. The close concordance between the PKC-induced desensitization and phosphorylation suggests a potential causative link between these two effects of PKC on the human 5-HT1A receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1518539185,"An antiserum raised against a delta-protein kinase C (delta-PKC)-specific peptide recognized the purified calcium-unresponsive 76-kDa protein kinase of porcine spleen in the native and the denatured form. This antiserum was used to demonstrate the delta-PKC-like enzyme in spleen of different species, in various cell types and in murine tissues by immunoblotting of the respective extracts. Due to species differences, delta-PKC-like kinases with slightly different molecular weights were observed. The enzyme was found to be present in primary murine keratinocytes, primary bovine endothelial cells, and many cell lines originating from human, rat, and murine tissues. It was present also in all murine tissues tested, predominantly in epidermis, uterus, placenta, lung, brain, spleen, and kidney. In contrast to the conventional alpha, beta, gamma-PKC, it was located almost exclusively in the particulate fraction. The delta-like PKC could be demonstrated in the epidermis and brain of newborn mice, and in both tissues its concentration increased dramatically between day 7 and 14 after birth. The delta-PKC-like kinase of mouse epidermis (p82-kinase) was down-regulated after topical application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to mouse skin. The amount of the enzyme decreased to less than 20% of the controls within 16 h and recovered almost completely within 72 h after TPA. The existence of the delta-PKC-like kinase in mouse skin, papillomas, and carcinomas could also be demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining of the respective sections. The enzyme was observed predominantly in epithelial layers. A remarkable immunostaining of nuclei in skin sections disappeared after TPA treatment of the animals."
https://openalex.org/W2165434282,"The magainin peptides of Xenopus laevis are broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Upon discharge from the skin glands, these basic, amphipathic peptides are each further processed at a single Xaa-Lys bond into half-peptides by a cosecreted protease. We describe the characterization and purification to homogeneity of this endopeptidase from Xenopus skin. The enzyme is a metalloprotease 110 kd in size. Analyses of substrate specificity revealed that the endopeptidase recognizes peptides that share the ability to adopt an amphipathic, alpha-helical motif composed of at least 12 residues, with one face strongly hydrophobic. Cleavage occurs on the amino side of a specific lysine that must be precisely positioned relative to the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix. This enzyme, which we propose to call ""magaininase,"" represents a novel class of endopeptidases that hydrolyzes peptides on the basis of specific secondary structure rather than primary amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1585944099,"The physiologic substrates of cytotoxic T lymphocyte granule-associated serine esterases (referred to hereafter as proteases or granzymes), and the role of these enzymes in cell-mediated activity remain unclear. We have developed an assay for possible ligands of the trypsin-like dimeric serine protease granzyme A based on Western immunoblotting techniques. This protein-binding assay demonstrates the selective binding of granzyme A to several proteins present in the target cell P815. The binding specificity is preserved when enzyme binding is performed in the presence of excess competing proteins, including such cationic species as lysozyme and RNase. Enzyme binding is inhibited, however, by heat or detergent inactivation of granzyme A. Subcellular fractionation of target cells shows that the nuclear fraction contains most granzyme A binding reactivity, which is recovered in the nuclear salt wash fraction. A protein with Mr = 100,000 and two closely migrating proteins with Mr = 35,000 and 38,000 are the predominant reactive moieties, and the N-terminal sequence of the 100-kDa protein confirmed that this protein was murine nucleolin. Incubation of granzyme A with nucleolin generates a discrete proteolytic cleavage product of Mr = 88,000. Since nucleolin is known to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm, the interaction of granzyme A and nucleolin may be important in the process of apoptosis which accompanies cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated lysis of target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1566106855,"Interleukin 6 levels are increased in a variety of clinical conditions including bacterial and viral infections, HIV infection, autoimmune diseases, certain neoplasias, and traumatic injury. In general, all these conditions are characterized by suppression of one or more manifestations of the immune response. Concentrations of IL 6 comparable to those found in the sera of immunosuppressed, thermally injured patients selectively inhibit T cell proliferative responses. This suppression is independent of IL 2-mediated responses, is dependent on macrophage activity, and is reversed by antisera specific for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β).—Zhou, D.; Munster, A.; Winchurch, R.

https://openalex.org/W1978032024,"We present an in vitro assay for yeast centromere function; isolated yeast minichromosomes require a functional centromere to bind to bovine microtubules and sediment with them. Centromere-bovine microtubule complexes form at physiological microtubule concentrations. Two of the three centromere DNA elements, which are necessary for centromere function in vivo, are also necessary for centromeres to bind microtubules in vitro. However, purified centromere DNA alone does not bind to microtubules. These results suggest that microtubule binding must be mediated by the two centromere DNA elements and factors that associate with one or both of them. The percent of centromeres with microtubule-binding activity is 7- to 10-fold higher in lysates made from nocodazole-arrested G2-M cells than from α factor G1 cells, suggesting that this centromere activity is regulated during the cell cycle. The potential of this assay for dissecting centromere assembly, function, and regulation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2135387911,"Reactive oxygen species contribute to the tissue injury seen after reperfusion of ischemic myocardium. We propose that toxicity originates from the effect that mitochondrial peroxide metabolism has on substrate entry into oxidative pathways. To support our contention, cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes were incubated with physiological concentrations of peroxide. The cellular extract and incubation medium were analyzed for adenine nucleotides and purines by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Cellular glutathione efflux was determined by enzymatic analysis of the incubation medium. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity was determined in the cultured myocytes as well as in freshly isolated cardiac mitochondria using [1-C14]pyruvate. Extracellular glutathione rose 3.3-fold in response to small doses of peroxide (≈ 108 nmol/mg protein). Likewise, small quantities of peroxide reduced total cellular adenine nucleotides to 50–60% of control values with only a modest (0.95–0.91) reduction in energy charge ((ATP+ ½ ADP)/(ATP+ADP+AMP)). Peroxide-treated myocytes selectively release inosine and adenosine, as only these two purine degradation products were detected in the incubation medium. The most dramatic response was a peroxide dose-dependent inhibition of PDH activity in cultured myocytes as well as freshly isolated mitochondria; just 65 and 30 nmol peroxide/mg protein induced a 50% reduction in cellular and mitochondrial PDH activity, respectively. In conclusion, physiological quantities of peroxide potently inhibit PDH in cultured cardiomyocytes and isolated cardiac mitochondria. PDH inhibition blocks the aerobic oxidation of glucose and inhibits the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP, which in turn leads to cellular adenine nucleotide degradation.—Vlessis, A. A.; Muller, P.; Bartos, D.; Trunkey, D. Mechanism of peroxide-induced cellular injury in cultured adult cardiac myocytes. FASEB J. 5: 2600-2605; 1991."
https://openalex.org/W1525857681,"Two genes encode Rbu-P2-carboxylase activase in barley (RcaA and RcaB): RcaA encodes polypeptides of 46 and 42 kDa, which are generated by the alternatively spliced RcaA1 and RcaA2 mRNAs, respectively; RcaB encodes a 42-kDa polypeptide (Rundle, S. J., and Zielinski, R. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4677-4685). In the cellular differentiation gradient of the first leaf of barley, the three Rca mRNAs accumulate differentially. RcaA1 and A2 mRNAs accumulate predominantly in the mature, most photosynthetically active regions of the leaf in a pattern that parallels accumulation of total Rbu-P2-carboxylase activase protein. However, the kinetics of accumulation of RcaA1 and RcaA2 mRNA differ slightly, indicating that either changes in RcaA pre-mRNA splicing or mRNA turnover occur during development. RcaB mRNA, in contrast, accumulates in the youngest and oldest cell populations at the base and tip of the leaf, respectively. In the mid-region of the leaf, the difference in accumulation between RcaA and RcaB mRNAs is largely attributable to differences in the rates of transcription of the two Rca genes. In this region of the leaf, the three Rca mRNAs accumulate differentially throughout the course of the diurnal cycle. Steady state levels of the three Rca mRNA species increase in parallel in response to increasing irradiance; these changes were accompanied by increased Rbu-P2-carboxylase activase protein accumulation."

https://openalex.org/W1935460296,"E-64-c, a synthetic cysteine protease inhibitor designed from E-64, binds to papain through a thioether covalent bond. The x-ray diffraction data for 2.1-A resolution were used to determine the three-dimensional structure of this complex and refined it to R = 0.159. 0.159. In the complex structure, the configurational conversion from S to R took place on the epoxy carbon of E-64-c, implying that the nucleophilic attack of the Cys-25 thiol group occurs at the opposite side of the epoxy oxygen atom. The leucyl and isoamylamide groups of E-64-c were strongly fixed to papain S subsites by specific interactions, including hydrogen bonding to the Gly-66 residue. The carboxyl-terminal anion of E-64-c formed an electrostatic interaction with the protonated His-159 imidazole ring (O-...HN+ = 3.76 A) and consequently prevented the participation of this residue in the hydrolytic charge-relay system. No significant distortion caused by the binding of E-64-c was shown in the secondary structure of papain. It is important to note that inhibitor and substrate have opposite binding modes for the peptide groups. The possible relationship between the binding mode and inhibitory activity is discussed on the basis of the crystal structure of this complex."

In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of MSUD, we isolated and characterized the cDNA of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH. Using the cDNA as a probe, a chromosomal gene related to E1 beta subunit of human BCKDH was isolated from human gene libraries. The gene of E1 beta subunit is over 100 kilobases long and is split into 10 exons. All of the splice donor and acceptor sites conform to the GT/AG rule. The transcription initiation site was determined by nuclease S1 mapping and primer extension and was located 47 bases upstream from the initiation codon. A CAAT box and its reverse complement sequences were present at 39 bases and 75 bases upstream from the cap site, but there was no TATA box-like sequence. There were three sets of sequences resembling the transcription factor Sp1-binding sites and two sets of sequences resembling the enhancer core sequence. We also analyzed the chromosomal localization of the gene for the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH. The gene was mapped to chromosome 6. Knowledge of the gene structure of human BCKDH E1 beta subunit will facilitate further studies on the expression and regulation of this gene and provide necessary information for analyses of mutations in patients with MSUD."

https://openalex.org/W1581016567,"Synthetic peptides described as dog renin inhibitors were found to effectively inhibit the aspartyl protease of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The selection of oligopeptides for the HIV protease inhibition study was based on 1) the current strategy of inhibiting aspartyl proteases with transition state analogs, and 2) our previous observations regarding optimal structural differentiation at the P2 position among human, dog, and rat renin inhibitors. In an in vitro assay system consisting of recombinant HIV protease and a synthetic decapeptide substrate (at pH 5.5), results show that HIV protease was unaffected by statine-containing analogs carrying histidine at the P2 position whereas analogs containing valine at the same position yielded anti-protease IC50 values ranging from 50 to 500 nm. As anticipated, some analogs were also shown to inhibit processing of recombinant polyprotein substrate by HIV protease in vitro. The antiviral activity of three inhibitors was studied in HIV-infected CEM and MT-2 cells. Results showed that one compound, Ac-Naphthylalanyl-Pro-Phe-Val-Statine-Leu-Phe-NH2 (antiprotease IC50 value = 0.4 μm), protected the infected cells effectively with IC50 values (0.73 μm for CEM cells and 0.88 μm for MT-2 cells). This antiviral effect is comparable to those obtained with AZT and ddC in parallel studies of MT-2 cells.—Hui, K. Y.; Manetta, J. V.; Gygi, T.; Bowdon, B. J.; Keith, K. A.; Shannon, W. M.; Lai, M.-H.

https://openalex.org/W1593618445,"Abstract To study the functional and structural roles of the epsilon subunit in adult muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR), we have co-expressed the alpha and epsilon subunits of the mouse receptor in transfected fibroblasts. Ligand binding studies suggest that association of epsilon with alpha subunit results in a lower association rate constant for 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin binding than that of the unassembled alpha subunit, approaching that for toxin binding to the AChR. Furthermore, alpha epsilon complexes contain high affinity binding sites for competitive antagonists and agonists not present in the unassembled alpha subunit, but similar to one of the two nonequivalent binding sites in the adult AChR. Structural analysis of alpha epsilon complexes by sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation suggests that some of the complexes formed are trimers or tetramers of alpha and epsilon subunits. Comparison of these data with those previously obtained for alpha gamma complexes suggests that gamma and epsilon have homologous functional roles and identical structural positions in the fetal and adult AChRs, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2136033558,"Studies of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA translation products suggest synthesis as a high Mr precursor, larger than circulating forms. To search for a precursor, we characterized IGF-1 immunoreactivity and IGF bioactivity in extracts from the liver and other body tissues. Sequential extraction with neutral followed by acid buffer was superior to extraction with acid/ethanol or acid alone in yield of immunoreactivity and specific activity. Extracts of normal rat liver exhibited both immuno- and bioactivity parallel to that of recombinant IGF-1 and serum IGFs over a 25-fold concentration range. Based on immunoreactivity, the liver of a 134-g rat appears to contain 1.2 micrograms of IGF-1 equivalents, 50% of the 2.45 micrograms in the circulation. Diaphragm, spleen, and kidney contained no significant IGF bioactivity and 8, 17, and 32% of the IGF-1 immunoreactivity of normal liver, respectively. Although serum IGFs were found at 7.5 kDa after size exclusion chromatography at pH 3, hepatic extracts contained a predominant peak of immuno- and bioactivity of apparent molecular mass of 30-35 kDa; both sizes were present in liver perfusates. Both immunoaffinity chromatography followed by Western blotting and IGF-binding protein affinity chromatography followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two predominant species, at 18-19 and 12 kDa. The 18-19-kDa species is consistent with the apparent size of the glycosylated propeptide encoded by IGF-1A mRNA, while the 12-kDa species may be nonglycosylated propeptide. Extract activity was pituitary-dependent; the livers of hypophysectomized rats contained 15.4 and 48.8% of normal immuno- and bioactivity, respectively. During fasting and refeeding of rats, fluctuations in hepatic extract IGF-1 immunoreactivity generally paralleled changes in serum IGF-1 (r = 0.93, p less than 0.001). These studies demonstrate that the liver contains a pituitary- and nutrition-dependent, high Mr form of IGF-1 with immunological and biological properties similar to circulating IGF-1. Processing of this 18-19-kDa molecule through a 12-kDa intermediate may contribute IGF-1 to the circulation."
