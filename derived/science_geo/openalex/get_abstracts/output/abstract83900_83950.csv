https://openalex.org/W1576014737,"Forskolin, a novel diterpene activator of adenylate cyclase in membranes and intact cells, activates the enzyme in membranes from mutant cyc-S49 murine lymphoma cells and the soluble enzyme from rat testes. Each of these enzymes consists only of the catalytic subunit and does not have a functional guanine nucleotide-binding protein. In both cases forskolin converts the manganese-dependent enzymes to a form which does not require manganese for activity. Forskolin can also stimulate a detergent-solubilized preparation of adenylate cyclase from rat cerebral cortex. Activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin is therefore not dependent on a perturbation of membrane structure nor does it require a functional guanine nucleotide-binding subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1987145868,"Sera from rabbits bearing tumors induced by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) were previously found to contain antibody to the RSV transforming protein, pp60src. Two additional transformation-specific phosphoproteins from RSV-transformed avian cells are immunoprecipitated with these sera. These proteins, having molecular weights of 90,000 (pp90) and 50,000 (pp50), are not precipitated from uninfected or transformation-defective virus-infected cells and are not related to any RSV structural proteins. Neither pp50 nor pp90 shares any partial or complete proteolytic cleavage peptides with pp60src, suggesting that pp90 and pp50 do not represent either a precursor or a cleavage product of pp60src. Sedimentation analysis of RSV-transformed cell lysates on glycerol gradients revealed that the RSV pp60src protein is present as two forms, one of which represents the majority (95%) of pp60src and sediments as a monomer, 60,000 molecular weight protein and the other of which sediments with pp90 and pp50 as an apparent 200,000 molecular weight complex. Lysates from cells transformed by viruses containing a temperature-sensitive defect in the src gene contain a greater percentage of pp60src associated with pp90 and pp50 under both permissive (35°C) and nonpermissive (41°C) conditions compared to wild-type virus-infected cell lysates. Phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine were found associated with pp60src molecules that sedimented as a monomer, whereas pp60src molecules that are complexed with pp90 and pp50 contain phosphoserine and greatly reduced amounts of phosphotyrosine. Only the monomer form of pp60src is capable of phosphorylating IgG in the immune complex phosphotransferase reaction. Normal uninfected chicken cells contain a protein that shares identical partial proteolytic cleavage peptides with the pp90 protein immunoprecipitated from RSV-transformed cells. This pp90 protein is one of the major cytoplasmic proteins in uninfected cells. Antibody directed against pp90 also immunoprecipitates pp60src and pp50 from lysates of RSV-transformed chicken cells."
https://openalex.org/W1566761847,"Using kinetoplast DNA networks as a substrate in a decatenation assay, we have purified to apparent homogeneity a type II DNA topoisomerase from HeLa cell nuclei. The most pure preparations contain a single polypeptide of 172,000 daltons as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the native protein, based on sedimentation and gel filtration analyses, is estimated to be 309,000. These results suggest that the enzyme is a dimer of 172,0090-dalton subunits. The enzyme is a type II topoisomerase as demonstrated by its ability to change the linking number of DNA circles in steps of two and to decatenate or unknot covalently closed DNA circles. No gyrase activity is detectable. ATP is required for the relaxation, decatenation, and unknotting of DNA, and a DNA-dependent ATPase activity is present in the most pure fractions. ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP in this properties to T4 DNA topoisomerase (Liu, L. F., Liu, C. C., and Alberts, B. M. (1979) Nature 281, 456-461)."
https://openalex.org/W2086996422,"We describe a general method for inactivation and deletion of genes at specific sites in large DNA genomes. In the first step of the procedure, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase is inserted into the genome at a specific site. In the second step, the thymidine kinase gene and desired sequences flanking the insertion site are deleted. Both steps involve recombination of the genomes with cloned chimeric fragments and utilize the available selection for or against thymidine kinase to select the desired genomes. We have applied the procedure to inactivate and to delete portions of an a gene of herpes simplex virus 1 specifying protein 22. The recombinant virus carrying the thymidine kinase inserted into the gene 22 and viruses exhibiting 0.1 kb and 0.7 kb deletions in the gene 22 specify new α polypeptides with molecular weights approximately 30% of the wild-type gene 22 product and grown normally in Vero cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2009524705,"Integration of retroviral DNA appears to occur randomly in host genomes, suggesting that retroviruses can act as insertion mutagens. We have confirmed this prediction by showing that the nontransforming retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), can insert its provirus within the selectable target provided by a single provirus in a clonal rat cell line (B31) transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Analysis of over 60 morphological revertants of M-MuLV-superinfected B31 cells revealed two lines with inserts of M-MuLV proviruses within the RSV provirus but outside the transforming gene of RSV (src), at sites 0.6 and 4.0 kb from the 5' end. The inserts did not inactivate initiation of RSV RNA synthesis but did affect elongation or processing, or both, generating species with the 5' end of RSV RNA linked to sequences that presumably derive from the inserted M-MuLV DNA. In one mutant line, most of the insert was excised at low frequency, apparently by homologous recombination between repeated sequences at the ends of M-MuLV DNA. After excision, RSV src mRNA was present in normal amounts, and the cells resumed a transformed appearance. In at least four independent lines, large portions of the left end of the RSV provirus (from 1 to 6 kb) and variable amounts of leftward flanking cellular DNA (from 0.5 to 10-15 kb or more) were deleted, without nearby insertions of M-MuLV NA. The deletions removed the putative promoter for synthesis of RSV RNA; in the two cases examined, no RSV RNA was detected. These deletions may represent a second mutational effect of the superinfection by M-MuLV."
https://openalex.org/W2039559232,The effects of long-term lithium administration on pre- and postsynaptic processes involved in serotonergic neurotransmission were measured in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Long-term lithium administration increased both basal and potassium chloride-stimulated release of endogenous serotonin from the hippocampus but not from the cortex. Serotonergic receptor binding was reduced in the hippocampus but not in the cortex. These results suggest a mechanism by which lithium may stabilize serotonin neurotransmission.

https://openalex.org/W1499127215,"We have isolated recombinant lambda phage carrying the genes for 14 of the ribosomal proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of these and of the plasmid carrying the gene tcm1, which codes for the ribosomal protein responsible for resistance to trichodermin, demonstrates that in general the genes for ribosomal proteins are unlinked. One exceptional recombinant carries the genes for two ribosomal proteins within a 2-kilobase region. DNA fragments bearing individual ribosomal protein genes were used to probe restriction digests of the yeast genome to determine whether any of the genes were duplicated. Only 3 of 12 of the genes are present unequivocally as a single copy. Similar fragments were used to probe blots of mRNA separated on denaturing agarose gels to determine the size of the mRNA for each protein. In each case, the mRNA is near the minimum size necessary to code for its protein. In certain temperature-sensitive mutants which fail to synthesize functional mRNA for ribosomal protein, Rosbash et al. (Rosbash, M., Harris, P. K. W., Woolford, J., and Teem, J. L. (1981) Cell, 24, 679-686) have demonstrated the accumulation of a larger RNA molecule, homologous to a ribosomal protein gene, that appears to be a transcript which retains an intervening sequence. We find that for 8 of the 11 ribosomal protein genes examined, a larger molecule accumulates in such a mutant strain, suggesting that in general transcripts of ribosomal protein genes may have introns."
https://openalex.org/W1515625266,"The catalytic and guanine nucleotide regulatory (G/F) units of solubilized bovine brain adenylate cyclase were separated by gel filtration as described by Strittmatter, S., and Neer, E. J. ((1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 6344-6348). The isolated catalytic unit is activated 4 +/- 1-fold (n = 11) by pure bovine brain calmodulin and is stabilized by calmodulin against thermal inactivation. The separated G/F unit can be freed of endogenous calmodulin by gel filtration in buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and no divalent cations. The calmodulin-free G/F unit still activates the catalytic unit. Re-addition of calmodulin does not affect the rate or extent of activation of the G/F unit by guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate. The activation by calmodulin and the G/F unit together is additive, not synergistic. These studies show that calmodulin interacts with the adenylate cyclase catalytic unit but does not seem to affect the function of the G/F unit."

https://openalex.org/W1503899242,"In an earlier report we described the identification of an alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase that is capable of cleaving the outer phosphodiester-linked alpha-N-acetylglucosamine residues present on the high mannose oligosaccharides of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes (Varki, A., and Kornfeld, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8398-8401). We have now purified this enzyme 1800-fold with a 24% yield from rat liver, using subcellular fractionation, differential extraction with Triton X-10, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, heparin-Sepharose chromatography, concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. The purified preparation is free of lysosomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The enzyme exhibited a single form on both the ion exchange and gel filtration steps. It has a broad pH optimum between 6.0-8.0 and is unaffected by divalent cations or reducing agents. The enzyme cleaves alpha-N-acetylglucosamine residues from five different locations on the high mannose oligosaccharide. In the case of molecules with one phosphodiester, the rate of cleavage is not affected by the size of the underlying oligosaccharide or the presence or absence of an asparagine-linked peptide. Molecules with two phosphodiesters are cleaved in a nonrandom manner. The enzyme has no activity toward p-nitrophenyl-alpha-N-acetylglucosamine but is capable of cleaving phosphodiester-linked N-acetylglucosamine in molecules such as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, indicating that it can only hydrolyze N-acetylglucosamine residues that are alpha-linked to a phosphate group."

https://openalex.org/W2021895364,"The growth in vitro of human breast cancer cells, line MCF-7, was inhibited by a daily supplement of L-arginine (1 milligram per milliliter). Arginine acted synergistically with dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) (10-6 molar) to enhance the growth inhibitory effect: the cell replication ceased completely within 2 days after treatment. The growth arrest accompanied a change in cell morphology and was preceded by increases in the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP, adenylate cyclase, and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activities as well as a decrease of estrogen binding activity. The results suggest that growth of human breast cancer cells is subject to cyclic AMP-mediated regulation and that arginine may play a specific role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2104910021,"The arrangement of the human insulin gene in DNA from 87 individuals was analyzed by the Southern blot hybridization technique with a cloned genomic human insulin probe. Insertions of 1.5 to 3.4 kilobase pairs in the 5′-flanking region of the gene were found in DNA from 38 individuals. These insertions occurred within 1.3 kilobase pairs of the transcription initiation site. In contrast, no insertions were observed in the region 3′ to the coding sequence. The prevalence of these insertions in type 2 diabetes was significantly greater than in the other groups (P < .001). The limitation of this striking length polymorphism to a potential promoter region suggests that these insertions may play a role in insulin gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1562567109,"Abstract The specific photoaffinity labeling of membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized benzodiazepine binding sites has been investigated using UV irradiated [3H] flunitrazepam as a photochemical probe. The time course and the regional and pharmacological specificity of the photolabeling reaction has been determined for brain-specific benzodiazepine binding sites; peripheral-type binding sites treated in an identical manner were not specifically labeled. Comparison of the number of sites labeled and blocked by [3H]flunitrazepam photolabeling of detergent-solubilized preparations indicated that about one site was blocked and unavailable for reversible binding for each site photolabeled. In contrast, when membrane-bound sites were photolabeled, about four sites were inactivated for each site photolabeled. Examination of photolabeled binding sites from various brain regions including cortex, striatum, and hippocampus using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave only a single labeled band of apparent Mr = 48,000."
https://openalex.org/W1992960053,"Morphine has been found in cow and human milk at concentrations of 200 to 500 nanograms per liter. Multistep purification yields a material that has immunological, biological, pharmacological, and chemical properties identical to those of morphine. Similar morphine-like material, which has been tentatively identified in some common plant sources, may be a ubiquitous dietary constituent and a possible source for the material in milk. Since morphine (mu) receptors have a low affinity for enkephalins, and since morphine-like materials have been described in brain and intestine, it is possible that morphine in food may be the source of this material and a normal ligand specific for mu receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1500868688,"The physical properties and binding characteristics of the solubilized transferrin receptor isolated from the placental brush-border membrane of a human trophoblast cell were investigated. The receptor protein was isolated from solubilized 125I-labeled membranes by immunoprecipitation with anti-human transferrin in the presence of saturating amounts of human transferrin. Gel filtration on acrylamide agarose (AcA-22) at 23 degrees C in the absence of transferrin indicates the transferrin receptor has a Stokes radius of 4.6 nm. In the presence of transferrin, the Stokes radius of the receptor shifts to 6.3 nm. Sucrose density centrifugation studies indicate that it has a sedimentation coefficient of 9.8 S in the absence of transferrin and 11.2 S in the presence of transferrin. The molecular weight for the transferrin free receptor is calculated to be 213,000. Upon incubation with transferrin, it increases to 364,000. This is consistent with the idea that the active form of the solubilized receptor is a dimer and the dimer is in turn capable of binding two transferrin molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2080971739,"Anterior pituitary tissue from ovariectomized cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) contains a single class of high-affinity receptor for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Exogenous estradiol causes a twofold increase in the tissue concentration of GnRH receptor within 36 hours without affecting receptor affinity. Release of luteinizing hormone in response to exogenous GnRH is initially suppressed by estradiol, but pituitary responsiveness is restored within 36 hours of introduction of estradiol. The pituitary tissue concentration of GnRH receptor is positively correlated with estradiol-induced release of luteinizing hormone only during the phase of potentiated response, an indication that although the augmentation of responsiveness by estradiol may reflect an increased GnRH receptor concentration, the suppression of the luteinizing hormone response by estradiol probably reflects estradiol actions at loci other than the pituitary GnRH receptor."

https://openalex.org/W10791611,"We have found opiate receptors enriched in two distinct subcellular fractions obtained from rat brain cellfree homogenates. By several criteria, one fraction contains synaptic plasma membranes, while the other represents predominantly smooth microsomes. Using marker enzyme analysis, we determined that the occurrence of opiate receptors in the smooth microsomal fraction cannot be attributed to synaptic plasma membrane cross-contamination. Electron microscopic examination revealed that the two fractions enriched in opiate receptors differed markedly in morphology. In particular, smooth microsomes appeared to lack synaptic junctional complexes, postsynaptic densities, or membranes identifiable as presynaptic. Also, opiate receptors in microsomes were localized on membranes which were distinctly lighter ( p = 1.08-1.14 g/ml) than synaptic plasma membrane receptors (p = 1.13-1.18 g/ ml) when either agonist or antagonist binding was measured. We also studied the characteristics of binding of opiate agonists to both receptor populations. AIthough both microsomal and synaptic membrane opiate receptors were sensitive to NaCl when agonist binding was assessed, microsomal receptors were considerably less sensitive to guanine nucleotides than were synaptic membrane receptors. The subsensitivity appeared due to the inability of relatively low concentrations of guanine nucleotides (10 w) to accelerate the dissociation rate of bound peptide ligand. Finally, microsomal opiate receptors displayed faster rates of dissociation (K-l = 0.077 min”) than did synaptic membrane receptors (ZL1 = 0.017 min”). The data are discussed in relation to the concepts that microsomal opiate receptors either represent a distinct population of synaptic membranes or newly synthesized receptors in transit to synaptic membrane sites."
https://openalex.org/W2017068960,"We have constructed a plasmid that selectively integrates adjacent to the CYC1 locus, which determines iso-1-cytochrome c in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Different CYC1 alleles can be conveniently recovered by digestion of total DNA from transformed strains with BgI II, a restriction endonuclease that does not cut the vector or the CYC1 gene, followed by transformation of Escherichia coli, selecting the ampicillin resistance gene carried on the original vector. This procedure was used to clone the cyc1-362 gene, which contains an alteration in front of the AUG initiation codon. The cyc1-362 mutational causes a deficiency of the iso-1-cytochrome c protein but still allows transcription of the iso-1-cytochrome c mRNA. DNA sequence analysis showed that the cyc1-362 mutation consisted of two single-base-pair substitutions, producing an A leads to G change 18 nucleotides and a G leads to A change 30 nucleotides in front of the AUG initiation codon in the mRNA. The A leads to G change at position -18 resulted in the creation of an AUG triplet, which is proximal to the normal initiation site and out of phase with the normal reading frame. The deficiency of iso-1-cytochrome c is most simply explained by assuming that translation initiates at the more proximal abnormal AUG site but not at the normal AUG site."

https://openalex.org/W1539683484,"We have studied hepatocytes cultured from Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, animals that display striking elevation of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL), spontaneous atherosclerosis, and an absence of LDL receptor activity in cultured fibroblasts. Degradation of LDL by WHHL hepatocytes differed from degradation by normal hepatocytes in several ways: 1) degradation by normal hepatocytes as a function of LDL concentration was curvilinear with a saturable component, while degradation by WHHL hepatocytes was a linear function of concentration; 2) degradation of 125I-labeled LDL by mutant cells was not decreased by excess unlabeled LDL, while degradation by normal cells was; 3) degradation of LDL by normal cells was inhibited by colchicine and chloroquine while degradation by the mutant cells was not; 4) both cell types catabolized LDL at nearly equal rates, but activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was suppressed only in the normal cells. These differences are analogous to those previously reported in describing the qualitatively different pathways for receptor-dependent and receptor-independent catabolism of lactosylated and native human LDL in rat hepatocytes. Thus, hepatocytes from WHHL rabbits lack LDL receptor activity. The peripheral and hepatic LDL receptors most likely are products of the same gene or depend for their activity on a single gene product."

https://openalex.org/W1604110888,"The reaction of reduced cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) from Paracoccus denitrificans (American Type Culture Collection 13543) with dioxygen has been followed by laser flash photolysis of the CO derivative. In detergent-stabilized solutions the reaction showed at least two distinct kinetic components, the faster of which was oxygen concentration dependent and had a rate of approximately 60 X 10(6) M-1 s-1. The slower reaction was independent of oxygen concentration and had a rate of 9 X 10(2) s-1. These rates are about 1.5 times greater than comparable rates for ox heart oxidase reported by C. Greenwood and Q. H. Gibson (J. Biol. Chem. (1967) 242, 1782-1787). The kinetic components have markedly different optical spectra which agree precisely in form with those for ox heart enzyme (Greenwood, C., and Gibson, Q. H. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 1782-1787) but are shifted by 2 nm toward the red. In phospholipid vesicles, the spectral contribution of the faster component was augmented. The dissociation constant for CO at 20 degrees C is 1.6 microM, 6 times greater than for the ox heart enzyme. The bacterial enzyme binds one CO per 2 heme a. The enzyme has an absorption band at 830 nm in the oxidized form similar to that of the ox heart enzyme."

BsuRIb, whose isolation was described in the preceding paper (Gunthert, U., Freund, M., and Trautner, T. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9340-9345) were compared. Both enzymes recognize the same target sequence in double-stranded DNA, leading to methylation of the internal cytosine: 5'GGCC. The enzymes have identical reaction constants with their substrates, DNA (km = 2.7 nM for the 5' GGCC sequence), and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (km = 0.7 microM). Initial rates of methyl group transfer were proportional to enzyme concentration over a range of 50-fold, indicating absence of aggregation. The enzymes are different in their ionic strength requirements using Tris-HCl, pH 8.4. M. BsuRIa is most active at 100 mM, M. BsuRIb at 440 mM. As measured by incorporation kinetics and heat inactivation, M. BsuRIa is the more stable enzyme of the two. Equilibrium dialysis was used to study the mode of methyl group transfer to the DNA with either enzyme. The data indicate that initially S-adenosyl-L-methionine binds to methyltransferase. This complex attaches to either modified or nonmodified DNA. The methyl group will then be transferred to a nonmodified target sequence, leading to the dissociation of enzyme and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine from the DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1605820500,"Bacteriophage SP-15, which infects Bacillus subtilis, contains a highly modified DNA in which 62% of its thymine residues are replaced by 5-(4',5'-dihydroxypentyl)uracil to which is attached a phosphoglucuronate via a phosphodiester linkage to one of the hydroxyl groups of the pentyl side chain. Glucose is also bound to this residue probably by glycosidic linkage to the other hydroxyl group of the pentyl side chain. In 0.3 M KOH at 37 degrees C, glucuronic acid 1-phosphate is slowly released from this DNA. After enzymatic or acid-induced dephosphorylation, this sugar was identified by chromatography in two thin layer chromatography systems, conversion to glucuronolactone under conditions known to lactonize glucuronic acid, and reaction in four colorimetric assays for hexuronic acids. Phage SP-15 DNA is the first DNA found to have a uronic acid moiety or a phosphate which is not part of the phosphodiester backbone.

L., Poyton, R. O., Wharton, D. C., and Schatz, G. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1346-1354), we have isolated yeast cytochrome c oxidase preparations which are low in contaminating polypeptides and which have been successfully used for the large scale purification of subunits. Subunits have been purified from this preparation by a simple two-step procedure which involves: 1) the release of subunits IV and VI from an insoluble composed of subunits I, II, III, V, and VII; and 2) gel filtration of the core subunits in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Molecular weights of the isolated subunits, obtained from sodium dodecyl sulfate gel retardation coefficients (KR) derived from Ferguson plots, were: I, 54,000; II, 31,000; III, 29,500; IV, 14,500; V, 12,500; VI, 9,500; VII, 4,500. In their purified state all subunits, except for subunit V, exhibited electrophoretic behavior similar to that exhibited by unpurified subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated holoenzyme preparations. As purified, subunit V exhibits a slightly smaller apparent molecular weight than its counterpart in the holoenzyme. Amino acid analysis of the isolated subunits revealed that subunit III, a mitochondrial translation product, contained 41.9% polar amino acids, whereas subunits V and VII, cytoplasmic translation products, each contained 47.7% polar amino acids.

Competitive experiments using both nitrate and cyanide demonstrate that two different binding sites are present on the enzyme. Chloride appears to bind at the sixth coordination position as do both fluoride and cyanide. Temperature jump experiments indicate that it is likely the nitrate anion and not undissociated nitric acid which is the binding species. Competitive stopped flow experiments indicate that the bound nitrate slows both the association rate and dissociation rate of cyanide, indicating that nitrate binds close to the sixth coordination position."
https://openalex.org/W2106319169,"Recently developed techniques allow rapid and accurate determination of protein-induced DNA unwinding. We have used such techniques to determine whether SV40 T antigen unwinds DNA. Assays were performed with purified wild type T antigen, D2 protein and the SV80 T protein over a wide range of protein concentrations. Additionally, several DNA templates were used, including SV40 DNA, pBR322 DNA, and two plasmid DNAs containing one and three copies of the SV40 origin of replication. None of the purified proteins showed unwinding activity either in the presence or absence of ATP and Mg2+. As a positive control, we found that unwinding of pBR322 DNA by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase occurred under identical assay conditions. Protein-DNA interactions that involve unwinding of the helix are sensitive to the superhelical density of the DNA. Using a filter binding assay, we found that the efficiency of the binding of T antigen to the viral origin of replication does not depend upon the topological state of the DNA. This result further supports our conclusion that SV40 T antigen is not an unwinding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1573329428,"The intestinal receptor for intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex integrates preferentially with cationic liposomes in such a way that its ligand binding sites are exposed to proteases and to antibody to the receptor. After integration the receptor could be solubilized from the liposomes by detergents and chaotropic salts. Kinetically, the brush-border and the liposome-bound receptor behaved similarly, and Triton X-100 had no effect either on Ka or Vmax, suggesting the absence of any effects of a lipid domain on ligand binding activity. However, acidic phospholipids caused inhibition when added to the receptor-ligand assay system in the absence of liposomes."
https://openalex.org/W2109814183,"Analogs of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) inhibit the growth of cultured cell lines. The effects of 8-bromo- and N6-butyryl-substituted analogs of cyclic and noncyclic AMP on six cell lines were examined and were equally inhibitory. Variant cell lines with altered cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase were more resistant to both cyclic and noncyclic nucleotides. We conclude that growth inhibition by analogs of cyclic AMP (i) does not require a 3′,5′ phosphodiester bond and (ii) may be mediated by a pathway involving endogenous cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1545708158,"A plasma membrane preparation from Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae which contains the high affinity cAMP receptor is described. Ligand specificity and the kinetics of cAMP association and dissociation using isolated plasma membranes were similar to those of intact cells. The changes in cAMP binding activity which occur as cells proceed through their aggregation program were also reflected in the membrane preparations. However, neither the low affinity cAMP binding site nor the oscillatory cAMP binding behavior observed on intact cells was detected with the membrane preparations."
