https://openalex.org/W2003126320,"Studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been hindered by lack of access to affected human dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Here, we report generation of induced pluripotent stem cells that carry the p.G2019S mutation (G2019S-iPSCs) in the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase-2 (LRRK2) gene, the most common PD-related mutation, and their differentiation into DA neurons. The high penetrance of the LRRK2 mutation and its clinical resemblance to sporadic PD suggest that these cells could provide a valuable platform for disease analysis and drug development. We found that DA neurons derived from G2019S-iPSCs showed increased expression of key oxidative stress-response genes and α-synuclein protein. The mutant neurons were also more sensitive to caspase-3 activation and cell death caused by exposure to stress agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, MG-132, and 6-hydroxydopamine, than control DA neurons. This enhanced stress sensitivity is consistent with existing understanding of early PD phenotypes and represents a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1972009144,"Based on pre-DNA racial/color methodology, clinical and pharmacological trials have traditionally considered the different geographical regions of Brazil as being very heterogeneous. We wished to ascertain how such diversity of regional color categories correlated with ancestry. Using a panel of 40 validated ancestry-informative insertion-deletion DNA polymorphisms we estimated individually the European, African and Amerindian ancestry components of 934 self-categorized White, Brown or Black Brazilians from the four most populous regions of the Country. We unraveled great ancestral diversity between and within the different regions. Especially, color categories in the northern part of Brazil diverged significantly in their ancestry proportions from their counterparts in the southern part of the Country, indicating that diverse regional semantics were being used in the self-classification as White, Brown or Black. To circumvent these regional subjective differences in color perception, we estimated the general ancestry proportions of each of the four regions in a form independent of color considerations. For that, we multiplied the proportions of a given ancestry in a given color category by the official census information about the proportion of that color category in the specific region, to arrive at a ""total ancestry"" estimate. Once such a calculation was performed, there emerged a much higher level of uniformity than previously expected. In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South. We propose that the immigration of six million Europeans to Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries--a phenomenon described and intended as the ""whitening of Brazil""--is in large part responsible for dissipating previous ancestry dissimilarities that reflected region-specific population histories. These findings, of both clinical and sociological importance for Brazil, should also be relevant to other countries with ancestrally admixed populations."
https://openalex.org/W2037278032,"The high and sometimes inappropriate use of antibiotics has accelerated the development of antibiotic resistance, creating a major challenge for the sustainable treatment of infections world-wide. Bacterial communities often respond to antibiotic selection pressure by acquiring resistance genes, i.e. mobile genetic elements that can be shared horizontally between species. Environmental microbial communities maintain diverse collections of resistance genes, which can be mobilized into pathogenic bacteria. Recently, exceptional environmental releases of antibiotics have been documented, but the effects on the promotion of resistance genes and the potential for horizontal gene transfer have yet received limited attention. In this study, we have used culture-independent shotgun metagenomics to investigate microbial communities in river sediments exposed to waste water from the production of antibiotics in India. Our analysis identified very high levels of several classes of resistance genes as well as elements for horizontal gene transfer, including integrons, transposons and plasmids. In addition, two abundant previously uncharacterized resistance plasmids were identified. The results suggest that antibiotic contamination plays a role in the promotion of resistance genes and their mobilization from environmental microbes to other species and eventually to human pathogens. The entire life-cycle of antibiotic substances, both before, under and after usage, should therefore be considered to fully evaluate their role in the promotion of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2090942992,"Background Soil bacteria are important drivers for nearly all biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems and participate in most nutrient transformations in soil. In contrast to the importance of soil bacteria for ecosystem functioning, we understand little how different management types affect the soil bacterial community composition. Methodology/Principal Findings We used pyrosequencing-based analysis of the V2-V3 16S rRNA gene region to identify changes in bacterial diversity and community structure in nine forest and nine grassland soils from the Schwäbische Alb that covered six different management types. The dataset comprised 598,962 sequences that were affiliated to the domain Bacteria. The number of classified sequences per sample ranged from 23,515 to 39,259. Bacterial diversity was more phylum rich in grassland soils than in forest soils. The dominant taxonomic groups across all samples (>1% of all sequences) were Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Significant variations in relative abundances of bacterial phyla and proteobacterial classes, including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Alphaproteobacteria, between the land use types forest and grassland were observed. At the genus level, significant differences were also recorded for the dominant genera Phenylobacter, Bacillus, Kribbella, Streptomyces, Agromyces, and Defluviicoccus. In addition, soil bacterial community structure showed significant differences between beech and spruce forest soils. The relative abundances of bacterial groups at different taxonomic levels correlated with soil pH, but little or no relationships to management type and other soil properties were found. Conclusions/Significance Soil bacterial community composition and diversity of the six analyzed management types showed significant differences between the land use types grassland and forest. Furthermore, bacterial community structure was largely driven by tree species and soil pH."
https://openalex.org/W2016656923,"SIRT6 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases and functions in genomic stability and transcriptional control of glucose metabolism. Early reports suggested that SIRT6 performs ADP-ribosylation, whereas more recent studies have suggested that SIRT6 functions mainly as a histone deacetylase. Thus, the molecular functions of SIRT6 remain uncertain. Here, we perform biochemical, kinetic, and structural studies to provide new mechanistic insight into the functions of SIRT6. Utilizing three different assays, we provide biochemical and kinetic evidence that SIRT6-dependent histone deacetylation produces O-acetyl-ADP-ribose but at a rate ∼1,000 times slower than other highly active sirtuins. To understand the molecular basis for such low deacetylase activity, we solved the first crystal structures of this class IV sirtuin in complex with ADP-ribose and the non-hydrolyzable analog of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, 2′-N-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The structures revealed unique features of human SIRT6, including a splayed zinc-binding domain and the absence of a helix bundle that in other sirtuin structures connects the zinc-binding motif and Rossmann fold domain. SIRT6 also lacks the conserved, highly flexible, NAD+-binding loop and instead contains a stable single helix. These differences led us to hypothesize that SIRT6, unlike all other studied sirtuins, would be able to bind NAD+ in the absence of an acetylated substrate. Indeed, we found that SIRT6 binds NAD+ with relatively high affinity (Kd = 27 ± 1 μm) in the absence of an acetylated substrate. Isothermal titration calorimetry and tryptophan fluorescence binding assays suggested that ADP-ribose and NAD+ induce different structural perturbations and that NADH does not bind to SIRT6. Collectively, these new insights imply a unique activating mechanism and/or the possibility that SIRT6 could act as an NAD+ metabolite sensor.

Sirtuins comprise an ancient and diverse family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylases that are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes (1Michan S. Sinclair D. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Unlike other classes of histone deacetylases, which utilize an active site Zn2+ and involve direct attack of a water molecule on acetylated lysines, sirtuins transfer the acetyl group from the lysine side chain of a protein or peptide substrate to the co-factor NAD+, generating nicotinamide, 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) 3The abbreviations used are: OAADPr, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose; NAADPr, N-acetyl-ADP-ribose; ADPr, ADP-ribose; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PDB, Protein Data Bank.

This unique requirement of NAD+ suggests that sirtuins might act as sensors of the cellular metabolic state (4Haigis M.C. Guarente L.P.

The founding member of the sirtuin family, yeast Sir2 (silent information regulator 2), has emerged as an important regulator in extending the life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). In other organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, sirtuin-activated pathways promote longevity (6Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L.

It was recently demonstrated that mammalian SIRT3 deacetylates isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, reduces oxidative damage, and prevents age-related hearing loss in response to caloric restriction (8Someya S.

This result provides a direct mechanistic link between mammalian sirtuins and aging. There are seven members in the human sirtuin family, SIRT1 to -7; these exhibit diversity and complexity in their cellular localization patterns and targets (9Michishita E. Park J.Y. Burneskis J.M. Barrett J.C. Horikawa I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4623-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). SIRT1, being the putative ortholog to yeast Sir2, has been the most studied. A recent study reported that SIRT6-deficient mice have a striking degenerative phenotype leading to shortened life span (10Mostoslavsky R. Chua K.F. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W. Fischer M.R. Gellon L.

At the cellular level, SIRT6 deficiency leads to marked metabolic and genomic instability caused by hypoglycemia and potential defects in base excision repair or DNA double strand break repair (10Mostoslavsky R.

However, the molecular mechanism of the protective role of SIRT6 in preventing these processes is not fully understood. The early in vitro analysis suggested that SIRT6 was not an active deacetylase and instead could undergo intramolecular mono-ADP-ribosylation utilizing NAD+ as a substrate (11Liszt G. Ford E. Kurtev M. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21313-21320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).

Crystal structures of the class IV sirtuins, which include mammalian SIRT6 and SIRT7, have not been solved. Here we explore the biochemical function and structural details of human SIRT6 protein. We provide the first quantitative assessment of SIRT6 deacetylation and give direct evidence for OAADPr as one of the end products of a very inefficient SIRT6-catalyzed reaction. We also report the first sets of crystal structures of human SIRT6: a complex structure of SIRT6 with ADP-ribose (ADPr) and another complex with a synthetic OAADPr analog, 2′-N-acetyl-ADP-ribose (NAADPr) (33Comstock L.R. Denu J.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2007; 5: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Comparison of SIRT6 with other sirtuin structures reveals several unique features that provide a rationale for the low deacetylase activity and the ability to bind NAD+ with high affinity in the absence of acetylated substrate. Furthermore, isothermal titration binding and tryptophan fluorescence assays suggest that NAD+ and ADPr may induce different structural changes upon binding. These novel features provide insight into the class IV sirtuins, which have poorly defined molecular functions. NAD+, NADH, ADP-ribose, dithiothreitol (DTT), TCEP, glutamate dehydrogenase from bovine liver, and α-ketoglutarate were purchased from Sigma. Tris-HCl, Tris base, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and sodium chloride were purchased through Fisher. [3H]Acetic anhydride (50–100 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. Site-directed mutagenesis kits from Stratagene were utilized to introduce a point mutation at His131 of SIRT6. 2′-NAADPr was synthesized as described previously (33Comstock L.R. Denu J.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2007; 5: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pQE-80L (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) His-tagged WT or H131Y SIRT6 were transformed into the competent Escherichia coli strain, BL21 DE3. Overexpression was initiated by growing cells to an A600 of 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C. To induce expression, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside was added, and cells were grown at room temperature for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min and stored at −20 °C. For purification, cells were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, lysed by sonication, and purified by nickel resin affinity chromatography. WT and H131Y SIRT6 were further purified via a HiTrap SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient from 50 to 750 mm NaCl in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing purified WT or H131Y SIRT6 were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (4 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm TCEP, and 5% (w/v) glycerol. Hst2 was expressed and purified as described previously (34Borra M.T. Langer M.R. Slama J.T. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9877-9887Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford reagent assay. A peptide corresponding to residues 5–13 of histone H3 (QTARKSTGG) was synthesized by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center and purified over a preparative C18 HPLC column. The chromatographic purity of the peptide was determined to be ≥95%, and mass spectrometric analysis on a Bruker REFLEX II: MALDI-TOF instrument confirmed the identification of the peptide. To produce a 3H-labeled H3K9Ac peptide, 4 mm H3K9 peptide was reacted with 20 mm tritium-labeled acetic anhydride in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (final concentration). During synthesis, the N terminus was left unblocked, and therefore acetic anhydride reacted with the ϵ-amine of the lysine residue as well as the N-terminal amine to produce a peptide that was acetylated at both the lysine residue and the N terminus. The presence of the doubly acetylated peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis on a Bruker REFLEX II: MALDI-TOF of a peptide acetylated with unlabeled acetic anhydride. The molar concentration of [3H]H3K9Ac (3.7 mm) was determined by the amount of tritium in 2–3 μl of the resuspended peptide and calculated as described previously (35Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The charcoal-binding assay was performed as described previously (35Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in 400 μl containing 600 μm NAD+, 300 μm [3H]H3K9Ac, 1 mm DTT, and 4 μm WT SIRT6 or H131Y SIRT6 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Time points (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 h) were taken by adding 60 μl of the reaction mixture to 60 μl of activated charcoal, pH 9.5 (1:3 (w/v) of charcoal (Sigma, C3345) and 2:3 (v/v) of 2 m glycine, pH 9.5). Reactions were performed in 40 μl containing 2 mm NAD+, 300 μm [3H]H3K9Ac, 1 mm DTT, and 4 μm WT SIRT6, Hst2, or no enzyme in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at room temperature. The reaction was quenched after 3 h by the addition of 1% (v/v) TFA to 20 μl of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was separated on an analytical C18 HPLC column by a gradient separation at 0.5 ml/min: 0–8% solvent B (0.02% TFA in acetonitrile) over 25 min and 8–100% solvent B over 3 min, followed by 100% solvent B for 10 min. Fractions (1 min) were collected, and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting 150 μl of each fraction and plotted versus the fractions. The peak corresponding to [3H]OAADPr was confirmed by alignment with purified OAADPr. SIRT6 activity was measured continuously using the method previously reported (36Smith B.C. Hallows W.C. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 394: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with minor variations. The assay solution contained 2 μm maltose-binding protein fused-PncA (nicotinamidase), 0.2 mm NADH, 0.6 mm NAD+, 3.3 mm α-ketoglutarate, 1 mm DTT, 2 units of glutamate dehydrogenase from bovine liver, 300 μm H3K9Ac peptide, and 0 or 8 μm SIRT6 enzyme in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Continuous readings were taken every 20 s for a total duration of 1 h and 30 min. The rate of nicotinamide formation was determined by the use of the coupled enzymes nicotinamidase and glutamate dehydrogenase. Nicotinamidase converts nicotinamide, formed by the cleavage of NAD+, into nicotinic acid and ammonia. The ammonia is then utilized by glutamate dehydrogenase to convert α-ketoglutarate to glutamate, consuming NADH in the process. The oxidation/consumption of NADH was monitored continuously at 340 nm, and subsequently the rate of nicotinamide formation could be determined. Human SIRT6(3–318) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pET28a-LIC vector downstream of the polyhistidine coding region. The recombinant protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-R3-pRARE2 cells in Terrific Broth in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration 0.5 mm, and the cells were then incubated overnight at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. During purification, the cell paste was thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% glycerol) with protease inhibitor (0.1 mm PMSF). Cell lysis was accomplished by sonication (Virtis408912, Virsonic) on ice; the sonication protocol was a 10-s pulse at 80% maximal frequency (8.0) and a 10-s rest for a 5-min total sonication time. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation using a Beckman JLA-16.250 rotor at 15,500 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with 10 column volumes (5Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol, and the protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 250 mm imidazole). The protein was loaded onto a Superdex200 column (2.6 × 60 cm) (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mm Pipes buffer, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Thrombin was added to combined fractions containing SIRT6 at 4 °C overnight to cleave off the N-terminal poly-His tag. The protein was further purified to apparent homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography on a Source 30S column (1.0 × 10 cm) (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mm Mes buffer, pH 6.5, and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl up to 500 mm concentration (30 column volumes). The H3K9Ac peptide (TKQTARKAcSTGGKAPY; Tufts University Core Facility, Peptide Synthesis Service) was dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm Mes, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl and then adjusted to pH 7.0 with a final concentration of 100 mm. Subtilisin A (Sigma) was dissolved in 10 mm NaOAC and 5 mm Ca(OAC)2 to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The protein solution contained 10 mg/ml purified SIRT6 mixed with 10 mm NAD+/ADPr (Sigma)/NAADPr and 3 mm H3K9Ac and 0.01 mg/ml subtilisin A (37Dong A. Xu X. Edwards A.M. Chang C. Chruszcz M. Cuff M.

SIRT6·ADPr and SIRT6·NAADPr crystals were obtained using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C by mixing 2 μl of the protein mix with 2 μl of the reservoir solution containing 1.8–1.9 m (NH4)2SO4, 2% PEG 400, BisTris, pH 5.6–6.2. All crystals were soaked in the corresponding mother liquor supplemented with 15% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant before freezing in liquid nitrogen.

Open table in a new tab ITC measurements were taken using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter from MicroCal, LLC (Northampton, MA). Binding experiments were all performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (25 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm TCEP, and 5% (w/v) glycerol. Purified WT and H131Y SIRT6 were dialyzed against the previously described buffer, and ligands were suspended in the dialysis buffer. Experimental data were fitted to a one-site binding model using Origin scientific plotting software. Enthalpy (ΔH), binding constant (Ka), and number of binding sites (n) were all flexible parameters, whereas the free energy (ΔG) and entropy (ΔS) were calculated according to the following equation. ΔG=ΔH−TΔS=−RTlnKa(Eq. 1) For each experiment, 37 automatic injections (1–8 μl) were titrated into the cell (initial cell volume 1.42 ml) while being stirred at 300 rpm. NAD+ (1.40 mm) was titrated into 27 μm WT SIRT6. NAD+ (1.63 mm) was titrated into 50 μm Hst2. NADH (450 μm) was titrated into 25 μm WT SIRT6. ADPr (300 μm) was titrated into 28 μm WT SIRT6. 2′-NAADPr (2.96 μm) was titrated into 38 μm WT SIRT6. NAD+ (767 μm) was titrated into 33 μm H131Y SIRT6, and 1.45 mm ADPr was titrated into 37 μm H131Y SIRT6. All titrations were also performed in the absence of enzyme to account for the heat caused by ligand dilution. Fluorescence emission was monitored on a FluoroMax®-4 spectrofluorometer from HORIBA Jobin Yvon. Samples were excited at 295 nm (slit width 2 mm), and emission was monitored from 320 to 390 nm (slit width 3 mm). Experiments under native conditions were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Increasing concentrations of NAD+ from 0 to 600 μm or ADPr from 0 to 400 μm were added to 1 μm WT SIRT6, and the emission spectrum was monitored. Likewise, increasing concentrations of NAD+ (0–200 μm) or ADPr (0–1.2 mm) were added to 1 μm H131Y SIRT6. The peak maximum was determined for each concentration. To account for decreases in fluorescence from nonspecific quenching due to increasing concentration of ligand, the same experiments were carried out in 7 m urea. The peak maxima were obtained, and the correction factor was determined by (Fobs/F0) where Fobs is the maximum intensity at each concentration, and F0 is the maximum intensity at 0 μm ligand. The intensities from experiments under native conditions were divided by their correction factors, and the fraction of substrate bound (FSB) was determined by Equation 2, FSB=Fobs−F0FS−F0(Eq. 2) where Fs represents"

The term “presumptive mesendoderm” is sometimes used to describe this early-migrating population of cells, as they are thought to contribute to either the mesodermal or endodermal germ layer. Studies from zebrafish embryonic development (Rodaway et al., 1999Rodaway A. Takeda H. Koshida S. Broadbent J. Price B. Smith J.C. Patient R. Holder N. Induction of the mesendoderm in the zebrafish germ ring by yolk cell-derived TGF-beta family signals and discrimination of mesoderm and endoderm by FGF.Development. 1999; 126: 3067-3078PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Gouon-Evans et al., 2006Gouon-Evans V. Boussemart L. Gadue P. Nierhoff D. Koehler C.I. Kubo A. Shafritz D.A. Keller G. BMP-4 is required for hepatic specification of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) support this idea. NODAL, BMP, WNT, and FGF signaling pathways and transcription factors T, MIXL1, LHX1, and EOMES are all involved in primitive streak development (Tam and Loebel, 2007Tam P.P. Loebel D.A. Gene function in mouse embryogenesis: get set for gastrulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 368-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). For example, both Xenopus and mouse studies have demonstrated a critical role for BMP signaling in mesoderm formation and dorsal-ventral patterning (Jones et al., 1996Jones C.M. Dale L. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V. Smith J.C. Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) acts during gastrula stages to cause ventralization of Xenopus embryos.Development. 1996; 122: 1545-1554PubMed Google Scholar, Winnier et al., 1995Winnier G.

Bone morphogenetic protein-4 is required for mesoderm formation and patterning in the mouse.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). However, in human ESC and mouse epiblast stem cell studies, BMP4 has been shown to induce extraembryonic lineage differentiation (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L.

Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. BMP4 initiates human embryonic stem cell differentiation to trophoblast.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The outcome of BMP signaling is context dependent, but exactly why BMP signaling induces extraembryonic lineage in one context and mesoderm in another has not been previously explained. T (brachyury homolog) is a transcription factor expressed in the nascent mesendoderm and is required for primitive streak development (Wilkinson et al., 1990Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. Herrmann B.G. Expression pattern of the mouse T gene and its role in mesoderm formation.Nature. 1990; 343: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). T was first identified from a mouse strain in which heterozygous carriers exhibit a short-tail (brachyury) phenotype (Dobrovolskaia-Zavadskaia, 1927Dobrovolskaia-Zavadskaia N. Sur la mortification spontanee de la queue chez la souris nouveau-nee et sur l'existence d'un caractere hereditaire ‘non viable.’.C. R. Hebd. Seances Soc. Biol. 1927; 97: 114-116Google Scholar). In mice homozygous null for T, severe abnormalities are observed from about day 8 of gestation, and death occurs by day 10 of gestation (Chesley, 1935Chesley P. Development of the short-tailed mutant in the house mouse.J. Exp. Zool. 1935; 70: 429-459Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The abnormalities observed result from a lack of cells migrating through the primitive streak, leading to reduced mesoderm (Yanagisawa et al., 1981Yanagisawa K.O. Fujimoto H. Urushihara H. Effects of the brachyury (T) mutation on morphogenetic movement in the mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 1981; 87: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Experiments in Xenopus have shown that injecting FGF2 into the animal cap induces primitive streak formation and Xbra (a T homolog) expression (Smith et al., 1991Smith J.C. Price B.M. Green J.B. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Expression of a Xenopus homolog of Brachyury (T) is an immediate-early response to mesoderm induction.Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and that activation of MAP kinases is required for Xbra induction (Umbhauer et al., 1995Umbhauer M. Marshall C.J. Mason C.S. Old R.W. Smith J.C. Mesoderm induction in Xenopus caused by activation of MAP kinase.Nature. 1995; 376: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that overexpression of Xbra in Xenopus is sufficient to drive mesendoderm formation (Cunliffe and Smith, 1992Cunliffe V. Smith J.C. Ectopic mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos caused by widespread expression of a Brachyury homologue.Nature. 1992; 358: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Exactly how MAP kinase activation is linked to Xbra induction and primitive streak formation in Xenopus is unclear. In contrast, FGF2 promotes self-renewal of human ESCs (Xu et al., 2005Xu R.H. Peck R.M. Li D.S. Feng X. Ludwig T. Thomson J.A. Basic FGF and suppression of BMP signaling sustain undifferentiated proliferation of human ES cells.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), though the downstream effectors of FGF2 signaling responsible for this are not clearly defined. This is partly due to the complexity of the pathways influenced by FGF signaling and the varying culture conditions employed by different laboratories. The majority of the FGF downstream effectors are expressed in human ESCs at the mRNA level, and the PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK downstream pathways are reportedly active and important for human ESC self-renewal (Armstrong et al., 2006Armstrong L. Hughes O. Yung S. Hyslop L. Stewart R. Wappler I. Peters H. Walter T. Stojkovic P.

How these downstream FGF pathways intersect with the transcriptional regulators of self-renewal and pluripotency is largely unknown, though blocking FGF signaling causes NANOG expression level to decline rapidly (Greber et al., 2010Greber B.

Nanog is the gateway to the pluripotent ground state.Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Human NANOG is part of a core transcriptional regulatory network in ESCs (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L.

Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (8146) Google Scholar). NANOG downregulation by RNA interference in human ESCs leads to extraembryonic lineage differentiation in serum-containing medium (Hyslop et al., 2005Hyslop L. Stojkovic M. Armstrong L. Walter T. Stojkovic P. Przyborski S. Herbert M. Murdoch A. Strachan T. Lako M. Downregulation of NANOG induces differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to extraembryonic lineages.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and to upregulation of certain neuronal marker genes in a chemically defined medium with ACTIVIN A and FGF2 supplements (Vallier et al., 2009Vallier L. Mendjan S. Brown S. Chng Z. Teo A. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Cho C.H. Martinez A. Rugg-Gunn P. et al.Activin/Nodal signalling maintains pluripotency by controlling Nanog expression.Development. 2009; 136: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Forced expression of NANOG enables a feeder-independent culture of human ESCs (Darr et al., 2006Darr H. Mayshar Y. Benvenisty N. Overexpression of NANOG in human ES cells enables feeder-free growth while inducing primitive ectoderm features.Development. 2006; 133: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All of these studies support the idea that NANOG plays a central role in acquiring and maintaining pluripotency. Here, we show that FGF maintenance of NANOG levels during BMP-induced differentiation of human ESCs switches lineage outcome to mesendoderm. We previously reported that in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium, BMP4 induced differentiation of human ESCs to an extraembryonic tissue enriched for trophoblast-specific genes (Xu et al., 2002Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. BMP4 initiates human embryonic stem cell differentiation to trophoblast.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). However, in defined mTeSR medium (Ludwig et al., 2006aLudwig T.E. Bergendahl V. Levenstein M.E. Yu J. Probasco M.D. Thomson J.A. Feeder-independent culture of human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we did not detect expression of hCG or other trophoblast-specific markers after BMP4 addition. Utilizing whole-genome expression microarray analysis, we found that removal of FGF2 from mTeSR caused upregulation of hCG genes (CGB, CGB5, and CGA) by day 5 of BMP4 treatment; the resulting cells were very similar to those previously described in conditioned medium. However, with FGF2 present in mTeSR, BMP4 resulted in the upregulation of primitive streak (T, MIXL1, LHX1, WNT3), endoderm (SOX17, CXCR4), and mesoderm (TWIST1, FOXF1) marker genes, but not of hCG or other trophoblast-specific genes (Figure 1A ). FOXA2 transcripts were undetectable, and only weak expression of GSC was observed in the +FGF2+BMP4-treated cells, which is more characteristic of posterior streak cells. Upregulation of ectoderm-specific genes was undetectable in either condition. To investigate the timing of differentiation, we performed two time course experiments with either high (50 ng/ml) or low (5 ng/ml) BMP4 in the presence or absence of FGF2 (Figures 1B and S1A–S1C). In both cases, hCG expression was detected after 96 hr in the −FGF2+BMP4 group, while primitive streak gene expression was detected after 18 hr in the +FGF2+BMP4 group. Most endoderm and mesoderm genes were upregulated subsequent to the rise of primitive streak genes. Low levels of T mRNA detected in the −FGF2 with low BMP4 group were likely due to endogenous FGF2 signaling, as an FGF receptor inhibitor (PD173074) abolished detectable T expression (Figure 1C) in similar conditions. Compared to treatment with 50 ng/ml BMP4, 5 ng/ml BMP4 treatment produced a much wider time frame for the expression of primitive streak marker genes. Thus, we used 5 ng/ml BMP4 to induce differentiation for subsequent experiments. Doses of FGF2 25 ng/ml or higher did not show significant differences in maintaining the expression level of NANOG or in inducing T expression after 36 hr of BMP4 addition (Figure S1D). Since standard mTeSR medium contains 100 ng/ml FGF2 (Ludwig et al., 2006aLudwig T.E. Bergendahl V. Levenstein M.E. Yu J. Probasco M.D. Thomson J.A. Feeder-independent culture of human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we maintained that concentration for the experiments in this study. In order to determine the percentage of individual cells expressing T protein, we performed immunostaining and flow cytometry. Immunostaining data showed that T protein was present in the nucleus of most cells after 48 hr of +FGF2+BMP4 treatment (Figure 1D). Few T-positive cells were present after −FGF2+BMP4 treatment, even though endogenous FGF signaling was not blocked in these experiments. Flow cytometry confirmed a uniform shift to increased T expression from the −FGF2+BMP4 to +FGF2+BMP4 treatments (Figure 1E). It should be noted that because the IgG for intracellular staining consistently demonstrated lower signal intensity compared to that of the anti-T antibody in all cells tested, including undifferentiated human ESCs, Figure 1E cannot exclude some low T expression in the −FGF2+BMP4-treated cells. Western blot data confirmed that T protein was not detected from the −FGF2+BMP4-treated cells (Figure S1E). These results show that treatment of human ESCs in defined conditions with BMP4 and high concentrations of FGF2 results in a uniform differentiation of cells expressing the mesendoderm marker T. In each of the time points examined before the onset of T expression, DUSP6 was consistently upregulated in the +FGF2+BMP4-treated cells compared to the −FGF2+BMP4-treated cells (Table S1). DUSP6, also known as MKP3, encodes a cytoplasmic phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1/2, but not ERK5 (Arkell et al., 2008Arkell R.S. Dickinson R.J. Squires M. Hayat S. Keyse S.M. Cook S.J. DUSP6/MKP-3 inactivates ERK1/2 but fails to bind and inactivate ERK5.Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Dusp6 null mice are viable and have a higher basal phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with unchanged levels of phosphorylation of ERK5, p38, or JNK (Maillet et al., 2008Maillet M. Purcell N.H. Sargent M.A. York A.J. Bueno O.F. Molkentin J.D. DUSP6 (MKP3) null mice show enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation at baseline and increased myocyte proliferation in the heart affecting disease susceptibility.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31246-31255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). DUSP6 expression is induced by phosphorylated ERK1/2 and functions in a negative feedback loop, regulating ERK activity (Li et al., 2007Li C. Scott D.A. Hatch E. Tian X. Mansour S.L. Dusp6 (Mkp3) is a negative feedback regulator of FGF-stimulated ERK signaling during mouse development.Development. 2007; 134: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, increased DUSP6 expression is a reliable indicator of ERK1/2 activity in response to FGF signaling. To test whether the inactivation of ERK1/2 blocks T induction, we overexpressed DUSP6 in human ESCs while using DUSP10 overexpression as a control. DUSP10 (also known as MKP5) encodes a structurally related phosphatase that dephosphorylates p38 and JNK, but not ERK1/2 (Tanoue et al., 1999Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel dual specificity phosphatase, MKP-5.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, Theodosiou et al., 1999Theodosiou A. Smith A. Gillieron C. Arkinstall S. Ashworth A. MKP5, a new member of the MAP kinase phosphatase family, which selectively dephosphorylates stress-activated kinases.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6981-6988Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Transgene expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 2A ). Western blot detecting phosphorylated ERK confirmed that overexpressed DUSP6 was functional. Although significantly reduced, ERK phosphorylation is not completely blocked by DUSP6 overexpression (Figure 2B). DUSP6 overexpression suppressed T induction in +FGF2+BMP4-treated human ESCs, whereas DUSP10 overexpression had no effect (Figure 2C). Flow cytometry data (Figure 2D) confirmed that at the protein level, DUSP6 overexpression reduced T induction. Because ERK1/2 are the targets of DUSP6 dephosphorylation, these data suggest that ERK1/2 are key components of the FGF-mediated switch to mesendoderm differentiation. To verify the importance of ERK1/2 in mesendoderm induction, we added chemical inhibitors against different pathways downstream of FGF signaling to +FGF2+BMP4-treated human ESCs (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2). U0126 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor) and PD173074 (an FGF receptor inhibitor) completely blocked T induction, while inhibitors of other downstream pathways (GF109203X against PKC, SP600125 against JNK, LY294002 against PI3K, and SB203580 against p38) had no effect. Also, we induced the expression of a constitutively activated MEK1 (MAP2K1) mutant in H9 cells in the −FGF2+BMP4 condition and found significant T upregulation by real-time quantitative PCR compared to the wild-type MAP2K1 and EGFP controls (Figure 2G). Together, these findings demonstrate that the MEK-ERK pathway is essential for the FGF-mediated switch in BMP4-induced differentiation. In examining the time course of POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG expression during −FGF2+BMP4 and +FGF2+BMP4 treatments, we noticed that though the timing of SOX2 downregulation was similar in the presence or absence of FGF2, NANOG or POU5F1 downregulation was delayed considerably with FGF2 present (Figures 1B and S1C). Downregulation of POU5F1 did not begin until the maximum induction of T, even in the absence of FGF2, suggesting that POU5F1 is unlikely to contribute to the FGF2 switch. Further, although NANOG expression was prolonged in the presence of FGF2, transcript levels eventually decreased, closely paralleling the downregulation of T. When ERK activity was suppressed by DUSP6 overexpression during BMP4 treatment, or when MEK was inactivated by the U0126 inhibitor, FGF2 did not prolong NANOG expression (Figures S3A and S3B), suggesting that maintenance of NANOG by FGF2 requires ERK. Considering the temporal relationship between T and NANOG during BMP4 treatment, we hypothesized that the maintenance of NANOG by FGF signaling was directly related to the induction and eventual downregulation of T. To test this, we used lentiviral vectors to express NANOG constitutively in human ESCs, followed by treatment with +FGF2+BMP4 and −FGF2+BMP4. These conditions resulted in T induction, even in the absence of FGF2 (Figures 3A and 3B ). In addition, we found that expression of T was prolonged in cells overexpressing NANOG. Although T expression normally peaked at 36–48 hr at the mRNA level (48–72 hr at the protein level) and then declined, in cells constitutively expressing NANOG, T was still elevated at 5 days (Figure 3C). Western blot data revealed that the total NANOG protein level was not increased by lentiviral overexpression (Figure S3C). Instead, the overall NANOG protein was maintained around the same level, even under the −FGF2+BMP4 condition, where it would normally be significantly reduced. Since long-term NANOG knockdown reportedly induces extraembryonic lineage differentiation, we simultaneously introduced NANOG siRNA and treated cells with BMP4 to investigate the short-term effect of NANOG knockdown on T expression. Compared to control cells after 36 hr of treatment, NANOG siRNA-treated cells lost around 80% of endogenous NANOG mRNA and had significantly less T induction from +FGF2+BMP4 condition (Figure 3D). The knockdown data showed that NANOG contributes to successful T induction. Taken together, our results suggest that NANOG is a critical downstream target of FGF signaling responsible for switching BMP4-induced differentiation of human ESCs to mesendoderm. This study suggests that NANOG, in addition to its role in the initiation and maintenance of pluripotency, is involved in mesendoderm specification. Unlike the inner cell mass, later expression of Nanog in the primitive ectoderm is nonuniform. In situ hybridization data demonstrate that high Nanog expression in the egg cylinder-stage mouse embryo is restricted to the site of the presumptive streak and is later restricted to the region of the streak itself (Hart et al., 2004Hart A.H. Hartley L. Ibrahim M. Robb L. Identification, cloning and expression analysis of the pluripotency promoting Nanog genes in mouse and human.Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As cells migrate through the streak, Nanog is downregulated. It was therefore suggested that Nanog's highly restricted expression pattern is consistent with a role in pattern formation. Because Nanog null embryos lack epiblast, the involvement of Nanog in later primitive streak formation could not be examined in those null embryos (Mitsui et al., 2003Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. The homeoprotein Nanog is required for maintenance of pluripotency in mouse epiblast and ES cells.Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). More recently, Nanog null mouse ESCs have been successfully generated, and unexpectedly, these ESCs propagated for long periods and contributed to all three germ layers in chimeras (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). If Nanog's role is conserved in mouse and human development—and this is not yet clear—these results suggest that there is not an absolute requirement for Nanog for the induction of primitive streak genes. In this context, results from our work and earlier mouse ESC works are more consistent with a protective effect of Nanog, where Nanog prevents pluripotent stage cells from responding to spurious signals that would otherwise induce them to inappropriate lineages. In our case, it is not clear why BMP signaling induces the expression of trophoblast genes in human ESCs that otherwise appear epiblast-like, as epiblast cells in the mouse do not contribute to trophoblast. It is possible that trophoblast differentiation in our experiments reflects real species-specific differences in lineage specification, but it is also possible that it represents an in vitro effect in response to a nonphysiological signaling context. Our results may then simply reflect a wider role for NANOG in buffering against signaling noise that would otherwise result in inappropriate differentiation outcomes. Our results demonstrated a positive effect of NANOG on T expression, but the mechanism connecting the two remains unknown. Preliminary ChIP-seq data failed to detect significant NANOG binding in the T locus region, and ChIP-PCR data (Figure S3E) did not show significant binding at a published putative NANOG binding site 4.6 kb upstream of the transcriptional starting site of T (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. et al.Core transcriptional regulatory circuitry in human embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2005; 122: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar). This suggests that NANOG may not directly regulate T expression. Our findings seem to differ from a previous mouse ESC study, which suggests that by binding to Smad1, Nanog blocks T induction from BMP signaling (Suzuki et al., 2006Suzuki A. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Morita M. Matsui T. Nakashima K. Gage F.H. Rodríguez-Esteban C. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Nanog binds to Smad1 and blocks bone morphogenetic protein-induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10294-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, mouse and human ESCs respond differently to BMP signaling, since BMPs promote the self-renewal of mouse ESCs (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. BMP induction of Id proteins suppresses differentiation and sustains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in collaboration with STAT3.Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) but induce differentiation of human ESCs. These apparent species differences might be related to the differences between the two cell states, as it is currently thought that mouse ESCs closely resemble inner cell mass cells, but human ESCs more closely resemble epiblast cells (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L. Derivation of pluripotent epiblast stem cells from mammalian embryos.Nature. 2007; 448: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). In addition, the blocking effect of Nanog on T in the Suzuki study was supported by a luciferase assay based on 396 bp and 204 bp regions upstream of the mouse T promoter. These regions may not include regulatory elements further upstream that might be used differently in inner cell mass versus epiblast cells. Short-term BMP treatment was also reported to induce mesoderm differentiation of human ESCs (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang P. Li J. Tan Z. Wang C. Liu T. Chen L. Yong J. Jiang W. Sun X. Du L. et al.Short-term BMP-4 treatment initiates mesoderm induction in human embryonic stem cells.Blood. 2008; 111: 1933-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although no exogenous FGF was used in that study, differentiation was induced from human ESCs cultured in MEF-conditioned medium, which could act as a source of a variety of growth factors, including FGF. This could explain the requirement for only short-term BMP exposure, as it is possible that the endogenous FGF was not enough to sustain NANOG and a mesodermal fate with longer exposure. Precisely how the MEK-ERK pathway regulates NANOG expression remains unknown. A candidate link from MEK-ERK to NANOG might be SMAD2/3, as recent reports suggested direct regulation of NANOG by SMAD2/3 binding on the promoter region (Greber et al., 2008Greber B. Lehrach H. Adjaye J. Control of early fate decisions in human ES cells by distinct states of TGFbeta pathway activity.Stem Cells Dev. 2008; 17: 1065-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Vallier et al., 2009Vallier L. Mendjan S. Brown S. Chng Z. Teo A. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Cho C.H. Martinez A. Rugg-Gunn P. et al.Activin/Nodal signalling maintains pluripotency by controlling Nanog expression.Development. 2009; 136: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2008Xu R.H. Sampsell-Barron T.L. Gu F. Root S. Peck R.M. Pan G. Yu J. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Tian S. Stewart R. Thomson J.A. NANOG is a direct target of TGFbeta/activin-mediated SMAD signaling in human ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 196-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Both SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 pathways were reportedly required for mesendoderm differentiation, and FGF2 appeared to sustain SMAD2/3, activating TGF-β ligand expression (Greber et al., 2008Greber B. Lehrach H. Adjaye J. Control of early fate decisions in human ES cells by distinct states of TGFbeta pathway activity.Stem Cells Dev. 2008; 17: 1065-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with their findings, our data showed that mesendoderm differentiation was inhibited in +FGF2+BMP4 condition when SMAD2/3 pathway was blocked by SB431542 (Figure S1I) and that NODAL expression was better maintained in the presence of FGF2 during BMP4-induced differentiation (Figures S1A and S1B). Also, the MEK-ERK pathway is capable of modulating SMAD signaling through phosphorylation of the linker region of various SMAD proteins (Kretzschmar et al., 1997Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Opposing BMP and EGF signalling pathways converge on the TGF-beta family mediator Smad1.Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, Matsuura et al., 2005Matsuura I. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Identification and characterization of ERK MAP kinase phosphorylation sites in Smad3.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12546-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the link between MEK-ERK and NANOG expression might be indirect. For example, the dominant early phenotypic effect on undifferentiated human ESCs of FGF2 withdrawal is a slowed proliferation (Ludwig et al., 2006bLudwig T.E. Levenstein M.E. Jones J.M. Berggren W.T. Mitchen E.R. Frane J.L. Crandall L.J. Daigh C.A. Conard K.R. Piekarczyk M.S. et al.Derivation of human embryonic stem cells in defined conditions.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the level of NANOG is related to cell-cycle progression. A causal link between cell-cycle progression and NANOG expression is unfortunately difficult to test, as cell-cycle inhibitors generally result in the apoptosis of human ESCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a mesendodermal outcome of BMP4-induced human ESC differentiation depends on FGF signaling, that MEK-ERK is the relevant downstream pathway involved, and that NANOG is a key transcription factor responsible for determining this outcome in our culture conditions (Figure 4). These findings are particularly important, as they demonstrate that NANOG is not only involved in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency, but can serve a role in determining lineage outcome as cells exit the pluripotent state. H1, H9, and H14 human ESCs were cultured in mTeSR (Ludwig et al., 2006aLudwig T.E. Bergendahl V. Levenstein M.E. Yu J. Probasco M.D. Thomson J.A. Feeder-independent culture of human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) on Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Cells were karyotyped using G-banding chromosome analysis prior to experiments. Low-passage (<50) ESCs were dissociated by TrypLE (Invitrogen) and seeded at the density of 4 × 104/cm2 for all experiments. To induce differentiation, human BMP4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added from 0 hr time point, when dissociated single cells were plated, and was maintained in medium thereafter. The lentiviral vector and packaging of the virus were as described in Yu et al., 2007Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V.

Detailed methods are included in the Supplemental Information. NANOG ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA and negative control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). siRNA transfection mixture was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and introduced at the same time BMP4 was added to the cell culture. Cells were collected for RNA extraction after 36 hr of treatment. Wild-type and a constitutively active MAP2K1 were PCR cloned from plasmids pENTR1A-W1 and pENTR1A-CC2, developed by Paul A. Khavari's lab (Scholl et al., 2004Scholl F.A. Dumesic P.A. Khavari P.A. Mek1 alters epidermal growth and differentiation.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6035-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Genes were placed under the control of pTight promoter in a vector that contains the rtTA-expressing cassette and a puromycin-resistant element. Elements of the doxycycline-inducible system were cloned from plasmids purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Vectors were introduced into EBNA1-expressing H9 cells with the help of FuGENE HD (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Puromycin (1 ng/ml) was used to select positive cells 2 days after transfection. Surviving cells were individualized with TrypLE and plated into −FGF2+BMP4 medium to initiate differentiation for 48 hr in the presence or absence of doxycycline (0.5 μg/ml). Adherent cells were washed three times with PBS before being fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, then blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100, 10% normal horse serum, and 1% BSA at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with 0.2 μg/ml of anti-T antibody (R&D Systems) in PBS with 0.2% BSA and 0.01% Triton X-100 at 4°C overnight followed by FITC-conjugated anti-goat IgG in dark at room temperature for 1 hr. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.01% Triton X-100 three times between each step. Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added before visualizing and taking photos under the microscope. Cells were individualized by Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 90% methanol at −20°C overnight. Cells were resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide (FACS buffer) and later blocked with PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA at room temperature for 30 min. Anti-T antibody (0.5 μg/ml; R&D Systems) or goat IgG (0.5 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added in FACS buffer with 0.01% Triton X-100 at 4°C overnight, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody in dark at room temperature for 1 hr. Between each step, cells were washed with FACS buffer three times. A PE-conjugated anti-T antibody from R&D Systems was later used in this study at 1:400 dilutions. Cells were analyzed on a FACSAria flow cytometer (BDIS, San Jose, CA) using FACSDiva Software. Final data were prepared in FlowJo 6.3 software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).

Previously, we identified rare pancreas-derived multipotent precursor (PMP) cells in the mouse with the intriguing capacity to generate progeny in the pancreatic and neural lineages. Here, we establish the embryonic pancreas as the developmental source of PMPs through lineage-labeling experiments. We also show that PMPs express insulin and can contribute to multiple pancreatic and neural cell types in vivo. In addition, we have isolated PMPs from adult human islet tissue that are also capable of extensive proliferation, self-renewal, and generation of multiple differentiated pancreatic and neural cell types. Finally, both mouse and human PMP-derived cells ameliorated diabetes in transplanted mice. These findings demonstrate that the adult mammalian pancreas contains a population of insulin(+) multipotent stem cells and suggest that these cells may provide a promising line of investigation toward potential therapeutic benefit."

In addition, we demonstrate that RORA transcriptionally regulates aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen. We further show that aromatase protein is significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of autistic subjects relative to sex- and age-matched controls, and is strongly correlated with RORA protein levels in the brain. These results indicate that RORA has the potential to be under both negative and positive feedback regulation by male and female hormones, respectively, through one of its transcriptional targets, aromatase, and further suggest a mechanism for introducing sex bias in autism."

We engineer an inducible mice system and show that when miR-125b is sustained in SC progenies, tissue balance is reversibly skewed toward stemness at the expense of epidermal, oil-gland, and HF differentiation. Using gain- and loss-of-function in vitro, we further implicate miR-125b as a repressor of SC differentiation. In vivo, transcripts repressed upon miR-125b induction are enriched >700% for predicted miR-125b targets normally downregulated upon SC-lineage commitment. We verify some of these miR-125b targets, and show that Blimp1 and VDR in particular can account for many tissue imbalances we see when miR-125b is deregulated."

Leukocyte costimulatory blockade enables allogeneic mouse ESC and iPSC engraftment Blockade strategy promotes xenogeneic engraftment of hESCs/iPSCs and derivatives Short costimulatory blockade treatment does not impair subsequent antigen response Blockade mechanism involves induction of T cell apoptosis and anergy In recent years, there has been much interest in using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to regenerate tissues and organs. However, despite the potential of hESCs, important issues surrounding immunogenicity have not been fully addressed, and strategies to avoid rejection remain largely untested. Previous studies have demonstrated that traditional immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil) provide only marginal improvements in embryonic stem cells (ESC) survival, with little evidence of cell engraftment past 3–4 weeks after transplantation (Swijnenburg et al., 2008Swijnenburg R.J.

We investigated these agents because blocking various combinations of these costimulatory molecules has demonstrated promise for hESCs in the immune-privileged environment of the testis (Grinnemo et al., 2008Grinnemo K.H. Genead R. Kumagai-Braesch M. Andersson A. Danielsson C. Månsson-Broberg A. Dellgren G. Strömberg A.M. Ekberg H.

An optimal T cell response requires two signals, ligation of the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) (signal 1) and an accessory signal from a non-antigen-specific costimulatory molecule (signal 2) (Jenkins, 1994Jenkins M.K. The ups and downs of T cell costimulation.Immunity. 1994; 1: 443-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When only signal 1 is provided without signal 2, T cell activation is disturbed, and the cell may adopt a state of anergy or undergo apoptosis, abortive proliferation, or immunoregulation (Ford and Larsen, 2009Ford M.L.

Immunol. 2003; 3: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Among the most important costimulatory interactions for T cell activation are the interaction between CD80/CD86 on antigen presenting cells (APC) and CD28 on T cells and the engagement between CD40 on APCs and CD40 ligand on T cells (Lafferty et al., 1983Lafferty K.J. Prowse S.J. Simeonovic C.J. Warren H.S. Immunobiology of tissue transplantation: a return to the passenger leukocyte concept.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1983; 1: 143-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Negatively regulating costimulatory molecules have also been described, particularly CTLA4, which is expressed by activated T cells and binds to CD80/CD86 with 10- to 20-fold greater affinity than CD28 (Thompson and Allison, 1997Thompson C.B. Allison J.P. The emerging role of CTLA-4 as an immune attenuator.Immunity. 1997; 7: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Upon engagement, CTLA4 delivers an inhibitory signal to the T cell. Lastly, LFA-1 is involved in the formation of the immunological synapse as well as the trafficking and costimulation of T cells (Van Seventer et al., 1990Van Seventer G.A. Shimizu Y. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. The LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 provides an important costimulatory signal for T cell receptor-mediated activation of resting T cells.J.

Finding or creating the right techniques to evaluate transplanted cell survival is essential for the accurate assessment of immunologic rejection and drug discovery (Niu and Chen, 2008Niu G. Chen X. Has molecular and cellular imaging enhanced drug discovery and drug development?.Drugs R D. 2008; 9: 351-368Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Until recently, the majority of studies evaluating ESC survival depended on immunohistochemical staining for β-galactosidase (LacZ) (Caspi et al., 2007Caspi O. Huber I. Kehat I. Habib M. Arbel G. Gepstein A. Yankelson L. Aronson D. Beyar R. Gepstein L. Transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes improves myocardial performance in infarcted rat hearts.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2007; 50: 1884-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) or detection of GFP (Li et al., 2004Li L. Baroja M.L. Majumdar A. Chadwick K. Rouleau A. Gallacher L. Ferber I. Lebkowski J. Martin T. Madrenas J. Bhatia M. Human embryonic stem cells possess immune-privileged properties.Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). But these methods only provide a snapshot of cell survival. In contrast, in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) provides longitudinal evaluation of the spatiotemporal kinetics of ESC rejection. In this study, mouse ESCs (mESCs) and hESCs were transduced with a double fusion (DF) reporter gene construct carrying firefly luciferase (Fluc) and enhanced green florescent protein (eGFP) (Figure 1A ). ESCs robustly expressed Fluc, which correlated with ESC number (r2 = 0.99) and displayed a tight cluster morphology with robust GFP expression (Figure S1A, available online). We next investigated longitudinal survival after intramuscular (gastrocnemius muscle) transplantation of mESCs into syngeneic (SV129, H-2kb) and allogeneic (BALB/c, H-2kd) mice by in vivo BLI. mESC survival was significantly limited in allogeneic compared to syngeneic mice (p < 0.001), with BLI signal decreasing to background levels in allogeneic animals by 21 days after transplantation. In contrast, syngeneic hosts accepted mESC grafts, resulting in teratoma formation (Figures 1B and 1C). Having previously demonstrated that the immune response to hESCs is primarily CD4+ T cell-mediated, we therefore investigated the efficacy of immunosuppressive agents that largely target T cells (Swijnenburg et al., 2008Swijnenburg R.J. Schrepfer S. Govaert J.A. Cao F. Ransohoff K. Sheikh A.Y. Haddad M. Connolly A.J. Davis M.M. Robbins R.C. Wu J.C. Immunosuppressive therapy mitigates immunological rejection of human embryonic stem cell xenografts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12991-12996Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Two immunosuppressive agents were chosen on the basis of different mechanisms of action, specifically calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus; TAC) and target of rapamycin inhibitors (sirolimus; SIR) (Table S1). Additionally, three costimulatory receptor-blocking antibodies (CTLA4-Ig, anti-LFA-1, and anti-CD40L) were evaluated in an attempt to induce immune tolerance. Importantly, costimulatory blockade was only administered for a brief interval of time spanning days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after transplantation. Whereas daily administration of TAC/SIR prolonged mESC survival only out to 28 days after transplantation, a surprisingly brief course of costimulatory blockade was sufficient to prevent mESC rejection at all time points assayed (p < 0.001 costimulatory blockade treatment versus TAC/SIR or no treatment) (Figures 1B and 1C). To exclude the possibility that the immune reaction was exclusively targeted toward antigens produced by the DF reporter genes, we transplanted nontransduced mESCs that do not express Fluc-eGFP. Similar to mESCs expressing Fluc-eGFP, costimulatory blockade treatment permitted engraftment of nontransduced mESCs. Survival of nontransduced mESCs was limited in both untreated and TAC/SIR-treated allogeneic hosts with no evidence of transplanted mESC survival at 28 days after transplantation (Figure 1D). We next investigated whether costimulatory blockade could prevent immune rejection of hESCs in the more hostile xenogeneic transplantation environment. Without immunosuppression, hESC survival was significantly limited as BLI signal reached background intensity by day 10–14, whereas BLI signal steadily increased at each time point assayed in the costimulatory blockade treatment group (p < 0.01, Figure 1E). Consistent with BLI data, histological evaluation of the graft site at 5 days following hESC transplantation demonstrated a robust infiltration of CD3 T cells surrounding GFP+ hESCs, which was severely diminished in the costimulatory blockade-treated group (Figure S1B). At 28 days there was no histological evidence of hESC survival in untreated animals, whereas animals treated with costimulatory blockade demonstrated teratoma formation (Figure 1F). Having shown that the combination of three costimulatory blockade agents is capable of inducing hESC engraftment, we next tested whether monotherapy is sufficient. By day 28, BLI signal decreased to background intensity in all monotherapy groups, with the greatest prolongation of hESC survival observed in the anti-LFA-1 group (Figure 1E). Undifferentiated ESCs have low levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression (Figure S1C), which increases upon differentiation (Figures 2A and 2B ). These differentiated ESC-derivatives may have impaired survival capacity compared to undifferentiated ESCs when transplanted across histocompatibility barriers. This represents a problem, as it is unlikely that ESC-based therapy will utilize an undifferentiated cell population because of safety concerns regarding potential teratoma formation or uncontrolled cellular proliferation. It is likely that prior to transplantation, cells will need to be differentiated into a lineage appropriate for their intended therapy and thus may encounter a heightened immune response. We therefore tested the ability of costimulatory blockade to permit engraftment of (1) an in vivo spontaneously differentiated cell population isolated from an explanted hESC-derived teratoma and (2) in vitro differentiated hESC-derived endothelial cells (hESC-ECs). Both cell populations demonstrated increased MHC-I expression relative to undifferentiated cells (Figures 2A and 2B). Immunosuppressive treatment with costimulatory blockade permitted engraftment of in vivo differentiated cells (p < 0.01 untreated versus costimulatory blockade treated, Figure 2C and Figure S2A) and in vitro differentiated hESC-ECs comparable to that observed in immunodeficient nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice (p < 0.05 untreated versus costimulatory blockade treated, Figure 2D and Figure S2B). Transplantation of in vivo differentiated hESCs without immunosuppression resulted in limited cell survival as indicated by BLI signal diminishing to background level by 7 to 14 days. In contrast, treatment with costimulatory blockade permitted engraftment of in vivo differentiated hESC as indicated by steadily increasing BLI signal at every time point assayed. Transplantation of hESC-ECs demonstrated limited survival in all groups tested, including the immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice. At day 4 following hESC-EC transplantation, the BLI signal was 18.5% ± 6.0% of baseline in the untreated group, compared to 46.7% ± 16% in the costimulatory blockade-treated group. By day 7, the BLI signal decreased to background intensity in the untreated group compared to 7.9% ± 3.1% in the costimulatory blockade-treated group (p < 0.05, Figure 2D and Figure S2B). Finally, we extended our analysis of the immunosuppressive efficacy of costimulatory blockade to include the transplantation of bone marrow mononuclear stem cells (BMMCs). This cell type was chosen because it represents a well-characterized and potentially clinically relevant stem cell population (Assmus et al., 2006Assmus B. Honold J. Schächinger V. Britten M.B. Fischer-Rasokat U. Lehmann R. Teupe C. Pistorius K. Martin H. Abolmaali N.D. et al.Transcoronary transplantation of progenitor cells after myocardial infarction.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Mouse BMMCs were rejected by untreated allogeneic recipients by 10 days following transplantation, whereas costimulatory blockade-treated mice demonstrated persistent BLI signal at 100 days following transplantation (p < 0.01, Figure S2C). For regenerative medicine purposes, an alternative source of pluripotent cells is human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). hiPSCs can be generated by delivering transcription factors to reprogram somatic cells toward a state of pluripotency (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13481) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2007Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (7581) Google Scholar). To assess the immunogenic properties of hiPSCs and the efficacy of costimulatory blockade to induce long-term engraftment of hiPSCs, we created four hiPSC lines from human adipose stem cells (hASC) isolated from four different patients. These hiPSC colonies stained positive for the pluripotency markers alkaline phosphatase (AP), Nanog, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, and Oct4 (Figure 3A ). Compared to undifferentiated hESCs, the hiPSCs demonstrated similar surface expression levels of pluripotency marker SSEA-4, lack of MHC-II, and slightly higher levels of MHC-I (Figure 3B). We performed microarray gene expression analyses that demonstrated that the four hiPSC lines are similar to H7 hESCs (Wicell) and distinct from hASCs (Figures S3A). The pluripotency of hiPSCs was examined through the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs). hiPSC-EBs expressed multiple markers corresponding to each of the three embryonic germ layers (Figure S3B). The hiPSC-EBs demonstrated the capacity for multilineage differentiation as we were able to derive neurons, endothelial cells, and beating cardiomyocytes (Figures S3B and S3C and Movie S1). Upon transplantation into immunocompetent mice, hiPSC survival was significantly limited in untreated compared with costimulatory blockade-treated mice because the BLI signal decreased to background levels in untreated animals by 7 days after transplantation, whereas engraftment with steadily increasing BLI signal and teratoma formation were observed in costimulatory blockade-treated animals (p < 0.01, Figure 3C and Figure S3D). To assess efficacy of costimulatory blockade in an allogeneic transplant model, we generated mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) from transgenic FVB (H-2kq) mice that constitutively express eGFP-Fluc under an ubiquitin promoter and followed survival in BALB/c (H-2kd) mice by in vivo BLI. In the absence of immunosuppression, transplanted miPSC survival was significantly limited to 14 to 21 days after transplantation. However, when allogeneic mice were treated with costimulatory blockade, prolonged engraftment with steadily increasing BLI signal and teratoma formation were observed in all animals (Figure 3D and Figure S3E). Similar to ESC-based therapy, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-based therapy will probably utilize a differentiated rather than undifferentiated cell population. Hence we generated miPSC-derived neural stem cells (miPSC-NSC) (Figure S3C) to investigate the survival of this cell population in untreated and costimulatory blockade-treated allogeneic recipients. Survival of miPSC-NSCs was significantly limited in untreated compared to costimulatory blockade-treated mice (p < 0.01, Figure 3E). At day 14 following transplantation, the BLI signal in the untreated group was 24.7% ± 6.8% of the initial BLI intensity, compared to 60.9% ± 6.5% in the costimulatory blockade-treated group (p < 0.01). By day 21, the BLI signal in the untreated group had diminished to background intensity whereas the BLI signal was 51.1% ± 5.3% of the initial BLI intensity in the costimulatory blockade-treated group (p < 0.001). To address the mechanism by which costimulatory blockade permits engraftment of pluripotent cells and their differentiated derivatives, we next examined the effect of costimulatory blockade on both the ESCs and the host. One possible mechanism by which the agents support engraftment is to stimulate increased ESC proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted undifferentiated hESCs into immunodeficient mice randomized to receive either costimulatory blockade or saline as control. Between the two groups, we observed no significant difference in the kinetics of hESC proliferation and teratoma formation (Figure 4A ), suggesting these agents do not improve survival by stimulating increased cell proliferation. We next investigated the effect of costimulatory blockade on ESC viability by comparing the percentage of ESCs undergoing early versus late apoptosis. There was no significant difference between ESCs exposed to costimulatory blockade versus unexposed controls (Figure S2D). To evaluate the toxicity of the costimulatory blockade agents on the host, we compared hematologic, renal, hepatic, and metabolic parameters between costimulatory blockade and untreated mice. For all parameters assayed, costimulatory blockade mice demonstrated similar laboratory values as untreated mice (Table S2). The low toxicity of costimulatory blockade immunosuppression highlights another advantage of costimulatory blockade over traditional immunosuppressive approaches (e.g., TAC and SIR). Another advantage is that costimulatory blockade requires only a short period of administration. However, if costimulatory blockade diminishes the ability of the host to mount a robust immune response to future antigens, then the potential for clinical translation of this approach would be severely decreased. To address the ability of costimulatory blockade-treated hosts to reject third party antigens, we injected hESCs into immunocompetent mice that had previously accepted miPSC-NSC grafts. The transplanted hESCs were rejected, indicating that despite previous costimulatory blockade treatment, the mice were fully capable of rejecting third party antigens (Figure S4A). To characterize the effect of costimulatory blockade on the host immune response, we next performed mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) with MHC mismatched splenocytes as stimulators and responders. Relative to untreated controls, costimulatory blockade significantly mitigated both CD4+ (p < 0.0001) and CD8+ (p = 0.0002) T cell proliferation (Figure 4B). To determine the contribution of T regulatory (Treg) cells toward the costimulatory blockade induced survival of hESCs, we compared the absolute number of CD4+FoxP3+ T cells in costimulatory blockade and untreated mice 21 days after hESC transplantation. Relative to untreated controls, costimulatory blockade significantly decreased the total number of CD4+FoxP3+ T cells (p = 0.002) (Figure 4C), as well as the percent of CD4+ T cells that were CD4+FoxP3+ cells (p = 0.006) (Figure 4D). To assess the immunosuppressive ability of the Treg cells that develop in costimulatory blockade-treated mice, we performed MLRs as described above with or without the inclusion of CD4+CD25hi T cells. The inclusion of CD4+CD25hi T cells significantly mitigated the proliferation of CD8+ T cells (p = 0.0005) (Figure S4B). However, the CD4+CD25hi T cells isolated from costimulatory blockade mice did not possess a significantly different immunosuppressive potency than CD4+CD25hi T cells isolated from untreated mice (p = nonsignificant). Certain genetic regulatory programs have previously been described for anergic (Safford et al., 2005Safford M. Collins S. Lutz M.A. Allen A. Huang C.T. Kowalski J. Blackford A. Horton M.R. Drake C. Schwartz R.H. Powell J.D. Egr-2 and Egr-3 are negative regulators of T cell activation.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) or for optimally activated T cells (Diehn et al., 2002Diehn M. Alizadeh A.A. Rando O.J. Liu C.L. Stankunas K. Botstein D. Crabtree G.R. Brown P.O. Genomic expression programs and the integration of the CD28 costimulatory signal in T cell activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 11796-11801Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To elucidate the gene expression footprint of costimulatory blockade-treated T cells, we performed microarray gene expression analysis comparing the expression profile of costimulatory blockade-treated and untreated responder T cells. Relative to untreated, the costimulatory blockade-treated group had 96 and 40 genes significantly (p < 0.05) down- and upregulated, respectively (Figure 4E and Table S3). Next, we analyzed these genes in terms of their functional relationships with Ingenuity Network software that correlates these significantly expressed genes to the signaling and metabolic pathways, molecular networks, and biological processes that are most significantly affected in the costimulatory blockade-treated group (Table S3). The key genes implicated in the establishment of costimulatory blockade induced allograft tolerance and host anergy were identified thereafter. Figure 4F represents the fold change of those genes, which include Egr2, GPNMB, BCL2, IL-2, Ccl3, Lta, Stat1, Cdkn1a, Socs2, Gzmb, and TNFRSF9. Finally, we predicted the probable gene regulatory network that is responsible for inhibiting T cell activation, proliferation, and survival in the costimulatory blockade-treated group (Figure S4C). The field of regenerative medicine is quickly advancing. Therapeutic applications of hESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (www.geron.com) and hESC-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (www.advancedcell.com) have recently been initiated in patients with acute spinal cord injury and Stargardt's macular dystrophy, respectively. More Phase I clinical trials are expected within the next 5–10 years (Lomax et al., 2007Lomax G.P. Hall Z.W. Lo B. Responsible oversight of human stem cell research: the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine's medical and ethical standards.PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e114Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One issue critical to the realization of such goals is the elimination of the immunologic barrier that presently precludes the successful application of cell-based regenerative therapy (Carpenter et al., 2009Carpenter M.K. Frey-Vasconcells J. Rao M.S. Developing safe therapies from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Chidgey et al., 2008Chidgey A.P. Layton D. Trounson A. Boyd R.L. Tolerance strategies for stem-cell-based therapies.Nature. 2008; 453: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The focus of this study was to characterize the immunogenic properties of ESCs, iPSCs, and their differentiated derivatives and to evaluate the efficacy of blockade of leukocyte costimulatory molecules as a way to induce transplanted cell engraftment and survival. Future clinical applications of pluripotent cells for regenerative therapy will probably involve allogeneic transplantation setting. However, at the present time a comprehensive study of hESC immunogenicity in humans is not yet feasible due to ethical reasons and safety constrains. As a next best option, we initially focused on the allogeneic transplantation scenario. We demonstrated that costimulatory blockade is an effective approach to induce engraftment of mESCs in a murine host. However, conclusions drawn from mESCs possibly may not reliably be extrapolated to hESCs. One major difference between the two cell populations is that in the undifferentiated state mESCs express undetectably low levels of MHC-I (H2-Kb) (Abdullah et al., 2007Abdullah Z. Saric T. Kashkar H. Baschuk N. Yazdanpanah B. Fleischmann B.K. Hescheler J. Krönke M. Utermöhlen O. Serpin-6 expression protects embryonic stem cells from lysis by antigen-specific CTL.J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3390-3399Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Bonde and Zavazava, 2006Bonde S. Zavazava N. Immunogenicity and engraftment of mouse embryonic stem cells in allogeneic recipients.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2192-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas hESCs demonstrate low but detectable levels of MHC-I expression. Similarly, differentiation of hESCs induces increased MHC-I expression. For these reasons, it was important to also demonstrate the immunosuppressive efficacy of costimulatory blockade to prevent the rejection of undifferentiated hESCs as well as spontaneously differentiated hESCs and in vitro differentiated hESC-ECs and miPSC-NSCs. Both undifferentiated and spontaneously differentiated hESCs were rejected in the absence of immunosuppression and demonstrated stable engraftment at all time points assayed in the presence of costimulatory blockade treatment. In the absence of immunosuppression, hESC-ECs were rejected by day 7, whereas treatment with costimulatory blockade permitted hESC-EC survival similar to NOD/SCID mice. Overall, costimulatory blockade is more advantageous than more common forms of immunosuppression (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus) because it involves only a brief period of administration, produces minimal systemic toxicity, and induces superior long-term engraftment of murine and human pluripotent cells. As an alternative approach to circumvent cellular rejection following transplantation, the use of hiPSCs has been suggested because they can be derived from the recipient and thus may not provoke an immune response (Byrne, 2008Byrne J.A. Generation of isogenic pluripotent stem cells.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: R37-R41Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, it may not be economically feasible to offer this type of treatment to the population at large, nor logistically feasible to safely develop autologous hiPSCs for transplantation in patients with acute injury such as spinal cord trauma, stroke, or myocardial infarction. In the future, it is possible that allogeneic hiPSC transplantation would be necessary in certain scenarios, which therefore would necessitate the development of immunotolerance strategies. At present, the immunogenic properties of hiPSCs remain largely unknown, as no data exist regarding the immune response toward hiPSCs. The only prior study to investigate the immune properties of iPSCs focused on miPSCs and their susceptibility to NK-cell-mediated immune rejection (Dressel et al., 2010Dressel R. Nolte J. Elsner L. Novota P. Guan K. Streckfuss-Bömeke K. Hasenfuss G. Jaenisch R. Engel W. Pluripotent stem cells are highly susceptible targets for syngeneic, allogeneic, and xenogeneic natural killer cells.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 2164-2177Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This study investigates the immunogenic properties of hiPSCs. We demonstrate that xenogeneic hiPSCs are rejected under similar kinetics as hESCs and that immunosuppression with costimulatory blockade successfully mitigates this immune rejection. Similarly, allogeneic transplantation of undifferentiated miPSCs or differentiated miPSC-NSCs results in immune rejection by 21 days after transplantation, whereas engraftment in animals treated with costimulatory blockade was similar to NOD/SCID mice. This is important because if future clinical applications of iPSC-based therapies involve an allogeneic transplantation setting, costimulatory blockade may be a viable immunosuppressive approach to mitigate the allogeneic immune response. In summary, this study demonstrates that a short course of costimulatory blockade treatment is sufficient to induce engraftment of allogeneic mESCs and miPSCs as well as xenogeneic hESCs, hiPSCs, and their differentiated derivates. Our data suggest that costimulatory blockade permits transplanted cell engraftment by decreasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-2, Tnfrsf9), decreasing the polarization of naive T cells toward a type I phenotype, increasing the establishment of a proapoptotic phenotype, and inducing clonal anergy. Further demonstrations of successful management of transplant rejection as shown here will help realize the full potential of stem cell-based regenerative therapies in the future. Formation of miPSCs and hiPSCs was performed as previously described (Kim et al., 2009Kim J.B. Zaehres H. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Schöler H.R.

For cell transplantation experiments, 1 × 106 human-derived and 5 × 105 mouse-derived cells were injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of recipient mice. Transplanted cell survival was longitudinally monitored via BLI by using the Xenogen In Vivo Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Briefly, D-Luciferin (Promega) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 375 mg/kg of body weight. Animals were placed in a light-tight chamber, and photons emitted from luciferase-expressing cells were collected with integration times of 5 s to 2 min, depending on the intensity of the bioluminescence emission. BLI signal was quantified in maximum photons per second per centimeter square per steradian (p/s/cm2/sr) and presented as log10[photons per second]. For immunosuppressive therapy protocol, female BALB/c mice (8–10 weeks old) were randomized to receive TAC (Sigma- Aldrich), SIR (Rapamune oral solution; Sigma- Aldrich), anti-CD40L (MR-1), anti-LFA-1 (M17/4), or CTLA4-Ig (BioXCell). TAC and SIR were administered once daily by oral gavage, 4 mg/kg/d for TAC and 3 mg/kg/d for SIR. Anti-CD40L, anti-LFA-1, and CTLA4-Ig were administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after transplantation. For statistical analysis, comparisons between groups were done by independent sample t tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) post hoc or Bonferroni post-tests, where appropriate. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05. All procedures performed were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Stanford University. For microarray data analysis and functional annotation, the RNA samples were hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse 430_2 chips. Data sets were analyzed with GeneSpring GX 10.0 software as detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Data normalization was followed by Student's t test (p value < 0.05; fold change cut off of 2.0) and hierarchical clustering to obtain the significantly expressed genes. Their functional annotation was carried out with Ingenuity IPA pathway analysis software. More detailed protocol information is available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Despite their utility for modeling development and disease, the relationship of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell states to one another remains largely undefined. We have shown that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are distinct, pluripotent states isolated from pre- and post-implantation embryos respectively. Human ES cells are different than mouse ES cells and share defining features with EpiSCs, yet are derived from pre-implantation human embryos. Here we show that EpiSCs can be routinely derived from pre-implantation mouse embryos. The preimplantation-derived EpiSCs exhibit molecular features and functional properties consistent with bona fide EpiSCs. These results provide a simple method for isolating EpiSCs and offer direct insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that regulate the acquisition of distinct pluripotent states.

Modified conditions allow EpiSC derivation from preimplantation embryos Pre- and postimplantation EpiSCs have very similar characteristics ES-refractory mouse strains can yield preimplantation EpiSCs Intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence EpiSC derivation The in vitro derivation of pluripotent stem cells both from embryonic and adult tissues holds tremendous promise for biology and medicine. Until recently, access to the pluripotent state in vitro was thought to be limited to the derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells from preimplantation blastocysts and the reprogramming of cells in the germ cell lineage. Reports of new pluripotent cell types including induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) provided a major impetus for recent studies that evaluate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms regulating a cell's acquisition of a pluripotent state (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G.

However, we still have only a primitive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling the acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency. Equally unclear is how distinct pluripotent states relate to one another as well as to cells in vivo in the developing embryo. The archetypal pluripotent stem cells, mouse ES cells, are routinely derived from preimplantation morula and blastocyst-stage embryos (Brook and Gardner, 1997Brook F.A. Gardner R.L.

Mouse ES cells are remarkably able to differentiate into all cell types of the embryo proper both in vitro and in chimeras in vivo. Mouse ES cells, however, do not directly recapitulate the molecular or signaling properties of their tissue of origin and instead rely on some genes and signaling pathways not expressed or required in vivo in the blastocyst including genes such as Nr3b2/Esrrb and Nr0b1/Dax1 and the LIF/Jak/Stat signaling pathway (Chenoweth et al., 2010Chenoweth J.G.

While mouse ES cells have been widely employed in laboratories across the world, their developmental origin and properties still remain unclear. EpiSCs, on the other hand, are routinely isolated from the epiblast of early postimplantation rodent embryos and recapitulate the defining properties of their in vivo tissue of origin (Bao et al., 2009Bao S.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). EpiSCs are regulated by a stable pluripotent state that is distinct from that of preimplantation-derived mouse ES cells. Similar to mouse ES cells, human ES cells are derived from preimplantation embryos (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts.Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11509) Google Scholar). Due to their common origin, the pluripotent state of mouse and human ES cells was generally thought to be identical. We previously showed that human ES cells are distinct from mouse ES cells and, paradoxically, share defining features with the postimplantation epiblast state (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the molecular and cellular events that promote ES cell derivation remain poorly described. It remains unclear why pluripotent cell lines isolated from explanted mouse preimplantation embryos can attain a mouse ES cell state, while pluripotent cell lines isolated from explanted human preimplantation embryos attain a state similar to that of the postimplantation epiblast. To address these issues, we analyzed the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms on the acquisition of in vitro pluripotent states when starting from preimplantation mouse embryos. Our results show that both the mouse ES cell and EpiSC states can be derived from the preimplantation blastocyst stage. The acquisition of these states is dependent on extrinsic signals in the culture medium as well as strain-intrinsic genetic elements. The preimplantation blastocyst-stage embryo consists of two overtly distinct tissues types, the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass (ICM) (Gardner and Rossant, 1979Gardner R.L. Rossant J. Investigation of the fate of 4-5 day post-coitum mouse inner cell mass cells by blastocyst injection.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1979; 52: 141-152PubMed Google Scholar, Rossant et al., 1978Rossant J. Gardner R.L. Alexandre H.L. Investigation of the potency of cells from the postimplantation mouse embryo by blastocyst injection: a preliminary report.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1978; 48: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar). The ICM contains precursors that will generate the epiblast, which, after implantation, will differentiate into all of the somatic and germ cell lineages of the embryo proper (Lawson et al., 1991Lawson K.A. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Clonal analysis of epiblast fate during germ layer formation in the mouse embryo.Development. 1991; 113: 891-911PubMed Google Scholar). The ICM of the blastocyst has therefore served as a source of cells for the in vitro derivation of pluripotent ES cells from both mice and man (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos.Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6067) Google Scholar, Martin, 1981Martin G.R. Isolation of a pluripotent cell line from early mouse embryos cultured in medium conditioned by teratocarcinoma stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar, Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts.Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11509) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, blastocyst-derived mouse ES cells exhibit a mix of molecular features consistent with the epiblast precursors in the ICM and early germ cell state in vivo, while blastocyst-derived human ES cells share defining features with the postimplantation epiblast state. These results suggest that the blastocyst may serve as a source for multiple, distinct pluripotent states. We modified the classical mouse ES cell derivation conditions to test the ability of preimplantation mouse blastocysts to directly generate EpiSCs, which are normally only derived from postimplantation mouse embryos. Strain 129 blastocysts at embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5) were explanted into separate wells onto a feeder layer in K15F5 medium (see Experimental Procedures), which was optimized to support both mouse ES-like and epiblast-like pluripotent states (Figure 1A ). Embryos hatched from their zona pellucidae and attached to the feeder layer overnight. The ICM was allowed to outgrow for 6 days, at which time it was dissociated into small clusters and replated. By day 16 two distinct colony types predominated in the cultures: mouse ES-like (domed) or EpiSC-like (flat) (Figure 1B). These colonies were easily distinguished from differentiating extraembryonic cells such as trophectoderm or extraembryonic endoderm. The origin of the mouse ES-like and EpiSC-like colonies appeared to diverge early as conversion of morphology was never observed. When domed colonies were picked and individually expanded by dissociation to a single cell suspension in mouse ES cell growth conditions, they could be readily propagated as mouse ES cell lines (Figure 1C). Flat colonies exposed to the same treatments failed to expand as they did not typically survive after single cell dissociation. We were, however, able to propagate the flat colonies by employing conditions developed for the growth of postimplantation-derived EpiSCs and human ES cells (Figure 1D). In experiments where all media and feeder cells were identical and carefully controlled, strain 129 blastocysts (n = 42) yielded 12 mouse ES cell lines (28%) and 11 EpiSC lines (26%) (Figure 1E). In only one instance were both an EpiSC line and a mouse ES cell line derived from the same blastocyst (shown in Figure 1B). These results show that both mouse ES-like and epiblast-like pluripotent states can be derived from the preimplantation blastocyst and maintained as stable cell lines. Previous work has elucidated gene expression and epigenetic signatures that define and distinguish pluripotent states (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Core pluripotency genes such as Oct3/4, Nanog, and Sox2 are expressed in both mouse ES cell and EpiSC states while other, nonoverlapping sets embody one or the other state. While global gene expression has proven to be a general indicator of pluripotent state, metastable fluctuations in the mouse ES cell pluripotent state often blur the boundaries (Furusawa et al., 2004Furusawa T. Ohkoshi K. Honda C. Takahashi S. Tokunaga T. Embryonic stem cells expressing both platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 differentiate predominantly into epiblast cells in a chimeric embryo.Biol.

Surani M.A. Dynamic equilibrium and heterogeneity of mouse pluripotent stem cells with distinct functional and epigenetic states.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For example, Dppa3, which is not expressed in EpiSCs or human ES cells, is considered a defining marker of the mouse ES cell state, but its expression is heterogeneous in mouse ES cell cultures. It is thought that the Dppa3-negative mouse ES cells are more “epiblast-like” but have not been stably committed to this transition since they readily revert to Dppa3-positive. These metastable fluctuations highlight that gene expression patterns are not sufficient to distinguish or define the two pluripotent states. Previous studies have established that global epigenetic differences exist between these two pluripotent states (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). These marks are stable and can be reliably used to ascertain cell state identity. For example, Dppa3 hypermethylation is a defining mark of the EpiSC state, where, regardless of transcriptional status, Dppa3 is hypomethylated in mouse ES cells (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F. Surani M.A. Dynamic equilibrium and heterogeneity of mouse pluripotent stem cells with distinct functional and epigenetic states.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We tested whether preimplantation-derived EpiSCs (E3.5) shared molecular features with preimplantation-derived mouse ES cells (E3.5) or postimplantation-derived EpiSCs (E5.5). Using quantitative RT-PCR, we tested the expression of core pluripotency genes as well as those previously described to define the mouse ES cell or EpiSC state (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Preimplantation-derived EpiSCs shared gene expression patterns consistent with postimplantation-derived EpiSCs and not mouse ES cells (Figure 2A ). Using Agilent microarrays, we further analyzed global gene expression patterns. Preimplantation-derived EpiSCs showed high correlation with postimplantation-derived EpiSCs and a clear distinction from mouse ES cells and other blastocyst-derived stem cells such as FAB-SCs (Figure 2B). To confirm these defining expression patterns, we analyzed DNA methylation at the promoter region of Oct3/4, a core pluripotency gene, and Dppa3, whose methylation pattern provides one of the most reliable markers to differentiate between the mouse ES cell and EpiSC states. Bisulfite pyrosequencing revealed that the Oct3/4 promoter was hypomethylated in preimplantation-derived EpiSCs consistent with all other known pluripotent cells (Figure 2C). Dppa3 however was hypermethylated in both pre- and postimplantation-derived EpiSCs while being hypomethylated in mouse ES cells (Figure 2D). These results show that preimplantation-derived EpiSCs share molecular features with postimplantation-derived EpiSCs. While the expression of specific genes provides a good indicator of cellular state, analysis of the functional regulation of pluripotency affords a better indicator. We first utilized a standard assay of pluripotency by injecting preimplantation-derived EpiSCs subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice. Preimplantation-derived EpiSCs readily formed teratomas consisting of a mixture of cells representing all three classical germ layers. Extensive differentiation was evident and included neural rosettes, ganglion cells, gastrointestinal epithelium, hepatocytes, muscle, and adipocytes among others (Figure 3A and Figure S1, available online). These results show that preimplantation-derived EpiSCs are pluripotent. We previously identified the regulation of activin/Nodal signaling as a distinguishing characteristic of the mouse ES cell and EpiSC states (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). EpiSCs rely on activin/Nodal signaling to maintain the pluripotent state and when inhibited rapidly differentiate into the neurectodermal lineage. In sharp contrast, mouse ES cells do not rely on activin/Nodal signaling to maintain pluripotency and its inhibition does not result in differentiation. We tested the functional regulation of activin/Nodal signaling in preimplantation-derived EpiSCs. In response to treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of Alk-4/5/7 (SB431542) to effectively block activin/Nodal signaling, preimplantation-derived EpiSCs rapidly downregulated core pluripotency genes, upregulated genes specific to the neurectodermal lineage, and formed neural rosettes by day 4 (Figure 3B). This response was indistinguishable from that of postimplantation-derived EpiSCs. Further analysis of global gene expression changes in response to activin/Nodal inhibition confirmed a high correlation of pre- and postimplantation-derived EpiSC lines in both the undifferentiated and the differentiating states (Figure 3C). These results show that preimplantation-derived EpiSCs are molecularly and functionally equivalent to postimplantation-derived EpiSCs. Previous studies demonstrated that the efficiency of deriving mouse ES cells is dependent on genetic background (Brook et al., 2003Brook F.A. Evans E.P. Lord C.J. Lyons P.A. Rainbow D.B. Howlett S.K.

Biol. 1997; 41: 235-243PubMed Google Scholar). Under standard conditions, one of the only mouse strains to yield ES cell lines with an appreciable frequency is the inbred strain 129. Interestingly, and probably not coincidentally, strain 129 is one of the only mouse strains to show a significant and heritable frequency of pluripotent, testicular germ cell tumors (Stevens and Little, 1954Stevens L.C. Little C.C. Spontaneous testicular teratomas in an inbred strain of mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1954; 40: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most other mouse strains are refractory to both the acquisition of the pluripotent mouse ES cell state in vitro under standard conditions and the acquisition of pluripotent tumors within the germline. Recently, mouse ES cells were reproducibly derived for the first time from the prototypical “nonpermissive” nonobese diabetic (NOD) strain blastocysts and through iPS cell-based reprogramming from fibroblasts (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Mitalipova M. Cheng A.W. Cassady J.P. Staerk J. Carey B.W. Lengner C.J. Foreman R.

Jones K. Phillips J.M. Newland S.A. Roode M. Mansfield W. Smith A. Cooke A. Validated germline-competent embryonic stem cell lines from nonobese diabetic mice.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). While providing an exciting opportunity to utilize the power of mouse ES cells (gene targeting, chimera generation, etc.) in this widely employed model, these new NOD mouse ES cells proved to be highly unstable in that they required continual stimulation of c-myc or Klf4 through inducible transgene overexpression or other exogenous means. Conversely, the isolation of EpiSCs from postimplantation mouse embryos is not dependent on strain-specific modulators. EpiSCs have been derived from a plethora of mouse strains under standard conditions. We tested the ability to isolate EpiSCs from preimplantation embryos of strains that do not readily yield mouse ES cell lines such as NOD and the consomic strain 129-Chr18MOLF in which the MOLF/EiJ strain chromosome 18 homozygously replaced the strain 129 chromosome 18 on an inbred 129 background (Anderson et al., 2009Anderson P.D. Nelson V.R. Tesar P.J. Nadeau J.H. Genetic factors on mouse chromosome 18 affecting susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors and permissiveness to embryonic stem cell derivation.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while failing to yield mouse ES cell lines at any appreciable frequency, NOD and 129-Chr18MOLF blastocysts yielded EpiSCs at a frequency equivalent to strain 129, ∼25% (Figure 1E). These results show that strain-specific genetic elements restricting access to the mouse ES cell pluripotent state do not impact access to the EpiSC state and suggest that intrinsic genetic elements in a limited number of strains such as 129 modulate entry or stabilization of the mouse ES cell state. External signals could also modulate access to distinct pluripotent states. In fact, recent work has shown that inhibition of both MAPK and GSK3β (referred to as 2i) and activation of the Jak/Stat3 pathway via LIF can enhance the efficiency of mouse ES cell line derivation and allow for derivation in some previously nonpermissive strains (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). We tested whether inhibition of Jak/Stat signaling, a pathway required for mouse ES cells but not EpiSCs, would alter the ability to isolate either pluripotent state. Inhibition of Jak/Stat signaling with a small molecule inhibitor of Jak resulted in a failure of strain 129 blastocysts to yield mouse ES cell lines while EpiSC lines could be readily derived (Figure 1E). These results show that extrinsic cues can modulate the acquisition of distinct pluripotent states. Additionally, these results raise interesting questions about the lineage relationship of distinct pluripotent cell types and renews interest in the possibility that mouse ES cells could be of germ cell origin (Zwaka and Thomson, 2005Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. A germ cell origin of embryonic stem cells?.Development. 2005; 132: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (see model in Figure S2). Understanding of both intrinsic and extrinsic modifiers will provide critical insight into the acquisition of pluripotency (see Figure 4). In fact, a recent study has shown that simple modulation of the extrinsic signaling conditions determines whether overexpression of Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-myc gives rise to either iPS cells or induced EpiSCs (iEpiSCs) (Han et al., 2011Han D.W. Greber B. Wu G. Tapia N. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Ko K. Bernemann C. Stehling M. Schöler H.R. Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into epiblast stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Further knowledge should advance efforts to create defined pluripotent cell lines, whether from embryos, somatic cells, or germ cells, and reliably control their differentiation to functional derivatives for laboratory and clinical use. Timed natural matings were used for all experiments. Twelve hours from the middle of the dark period was termed embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from E13.5 fetuses from the CF1 strain (Charles River). Preimplantation blastocyst-stage embryos from 129S1/SvImJ (Jackson Laboratories), 129-Chr18MOLF (Anderson et al., 2009Anderson P.D. Nelson V.R. Tesar P.J. Nadeau J.H. Genetic factors on mouse chromosome 18 affecting susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors and permissiveness to embryonic stem cell derivation.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), or nonobese diabetic (NOD) strains were flushed from the uterine horns on E3.5 into FHM HEPES-buffered medium (Millipore). Individual blastocysts were explanted into 1.9 cm2 wells containing γ-irradiated MEFs preincubated with K15F5 medium, which consisted of Knockout DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR; Invitrogen), 5% ES cell-qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO lot: 52207), 2 mM Glutamax (Invitrogen), 1× nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) with no additional growth factor additives. After 5–6 days the ICMs had reached a suitable size and were picked off the plate with a pulled glass pipette and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in an 8 μl drop of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. The ICMs were partially dissociated individually with a pulled glass pipette. Caution was taken not to produce a completely single-cell suspension. The partial dissociates were plated individually into a 1.9 cm2 well containing a feeder layer of irradiated MEFs and cultured for an additional 6 days in K15F5 medium without additional growth factor additives. At this point each culture was passaged by a brief exposure (2–3 min) to 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, inactivation of trypsin with FBS-containing MEF medium, gentle tritration to prevent complete single-cell dissociation of any pluripotent clusters, and plating into a 9.6 cm2 well containing feeders in K15F5 medium. Morphologically distinct mouse ES cell and/or EpiSC colonies became evident over the next 4–8 days (16–20 total days from initial blastocyst explants). These colony types were separately expanded in medium designed to support either mouse ES cells or EpiSCs. Mouse ES cell colonies were individually picked from the plate and dissociated to a single-cell suspension in 8 μl drops of trypsin/EDTA and plated into 1.9 cm2 wells containing feeders in K15F5 medium supplemented with 103 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Millipore). EpiSC colonies were manually dissociated into small clusters using a glass needle and plated into 1.9 cm2 wells containing feeders in EpiSC cell medium consisting of Knockout DMEM supplemented with 20% KSR, 2 mM glutamax, 1× nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/ml FGF2 (R&D Systems). For experiments testing the impact of Jak inhibition on pluripotent stem cell derivation, Jak Inhibitor I (Calbiochem) was provided to the cultures starting at day 0 (blastocyst explant) and added daily until colony picking (day 16–20). Mouse ES cells were passaged every third day as a single-cell suspension using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and seeded at 3.0 × 104 cells/cm2 for routine culture. EpiSCs were passaged every third day using 1.5 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Invitrogen) and trituration into small clumps of ∼10–100 cells. MEFs were maintained with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamax, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. MEFs were irradiated with 30–60 gray and seeded as feeders at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/cm2. All cells were grown on Nunclon Δ-treated dishes or multiwell plates (Fisher Scientific) coated for 2 hr at 37°C with 0.1% (w/v) porcine gelatin (Sigma). Antibiotics at concentrations of 50 units/ml and 50 μg/ml for penicillin and streptomycin, respectively, were used only for primary explants of MEFs and blastocysts. SB431542 was maintained as a 20 mM stock solution in DMSO (vehicle) and was provided at 20 μM to the cultures at the time of plating and every day thereafter with the media change. JAK inhibitor I (Calbiochem) was maintained as a 10 mM stock in DMSO and provided at 0.6 μM every day. Cells were prepared for immunostaining by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 15 min and subsequent permeabilization for 10 min with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS. Cells were then blocked for nonspecific binding with 10% normal goat or donkey serum (Abcam) in PBS for 1–2 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the samples overnight at 4°C. Samples were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labeled Alexa secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal IgG2b Oct3/4 (C-10; Santa Cruz, 1:400), mouse monoclonal IgG1 Cdx2 (CDX2-88; Biogenex, 1:50), and rabbit polyclonal Blimp1 (kindly provided by Reuben Tooze, Leeds, UK, 1:100). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Sigma, 1 μg/ml). Genomic DNA was isolated from preimplantation-derived mES cells, preimplantation-derived EpiSCs, and postimplantation-derived EpiSCs after their separation from the feeders. Bisulfite modification of 500 ng of genomic DNA was done using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research). Bisulfite converted DNA was used with gene-specific primers (Epigendx) to amplify promoter regions of Pou5f1 (ASY585; 11 CpGs sites analyzed) and Dppa3 (ADS1399; 6 CpG sites analyzed) using HotStar Taq polymerase (QIAGEN). Methylation of the amplified regions was quantified by pyrosequencing using a PyroMark Q96 ID platform (QIAGEN). Unmethylated and in vitro methylated DNA (Epigendx) served as controls. Percentage of methylation was determined by the percentage of C to T conversion at the analyzed CpG sites. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and samples were treated with DNase (turbo DNA-free, Applied Biosystems). RNA (400 ng) was reverse transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) with random primers. Real-Time PCR was performed using 8 ng of cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7300 Real-Time PCR System with the ABI TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix and Taqman preoptimized gene expression assays: Zfp42 (Mm01194090_g1), Dppa3 (Mm01184198_g1), Oct3/4 (Mm00658129_gH), Nanog (Mm02019550_s1), Cer1 (Mm00515474_m1), and FGF5 (Mm00438919_m1). Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1) served as an endogenous control for normalization. Blastocyst-derived EpiSCs were tested for their ability to form teratomas in immunocompromised hosts. Colonies were triturated to produce small cell clusters and cells were resuspended in Knockout DMEM supplemented with 30% growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml . One hundred microliters of cell suspension (∼1 × 106 cells) was injected subcutaneously into the left flank of female, athymic NCr-nu/nu mice (bred in house; n = 4 per line). Tumors were allowed to develop for 4–8 weeks at which time they were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 36 hr. Teratomas were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). RNA samples were isolated and analyzed using whole-genome Agilent 4 × 44K Mouse arrays (G4122F) as described previously (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P.

Bioengineered cell culture environments that combine microenvironmental control with tissue-specific transport and signaling are critical tools in our efforts to study tissue development, regeneration, and disease under conditions that predict the human in vivo context. We propose that experimentation at the interfaces of biology, engineering, and medical sciences is critical for unlocking the full potential of stem cells. Here, we focus on the design and utilization of in vitro platforms that recapitulate the environments associated with tissue development, disease, and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2096948670,"<h2>Summary</h2> Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can provide insights into development of inaccessible human tissues such as embryonic endoderm. Progress in this area has been hindered by a lack of methods for isolating endodermal cells and tracing fates of their differentiated progeny. By using homologous recombination in human ESCs, we inserted an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgene into the <i>SOX17</i> locus, a postulated marker of human endoderm. FACS purification and gene expression profiling confirmed that SOX17<sup>+</sup>-hESC progeny expressed endodermal markers and unveiled specific cell surface protein combinations that permitted FACS-based isolation of primitive gut tube endodermal cells produced from unmodified human ESCs and from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Differentiating SOX17<sup>+</sup> endodermal cells expressed markers of liver, pancreas, and intestinal epithelium in vitro and gave rise to endodermal progeny in vivo. Thus, prospective isolation, lineage tracing, and developmental studies of SOX17<sup>+</sup> hESC progeny have revealed fundamental aspects of human endodermal biology."

This study describes a fatal epidemic of P. aeruginosa that occurred in a hematology unit in Italy. Methods Retrospective cohort study, prospective surveillance, auditing, extensive testing on healthcare workers and environmental investigation were performed to define the dynamics and potential causes of transmission. RAPD, macrorestriction analyses and sequence typing were used to define relationships between P. aeruginosa isolates. Results Eighteen cases of infection were identified in the different phases of the investigation. Of these, five constitute a significant molecular cluster of infection. A P. aeruginosa strain with the same genetic fingerprint and sequence type (ST175) as clinical isolates strain was also isolated from a heavily contaminated triclosan soap dispenser. Discussion and Conclusions Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that patients became indirectly infected, e.g., during central venous catheter handling through contaminated items, and that the triclosan soap dispenser acted as a common continuous source of P. aeruginosa infection. Since P. aeruginosa is intrinsically unsusceptible to triclosan, the use of triclosan-based disinfectant formulations should be avoided in those healthcare settings hosting patients at high risk of P. aeruginosa infection."
https://openalex.org/W2054317403,"The use of human braincases as drinking cups and containers has extensive historic and ethnographic documentation, but archaeological examples are extremely rare. In the Upper Palaeolithic of western Europe, cut-marked and broken human bones are widespread in the Magdalenian (∼15 to 12,000 years BP) and skull-cup preparation is an element of this tradition.Here we describe the post-mortem processing of human heads at the Upper Palaeolithic site of Gough's Cave (Somerset, England) and identify a range of modifications associated with the production of skull-cups. New analyses of human remains from Gough's Cave demonstrate the skilled post-mortem manipulation of human bodies. Results of the research suggest the processing of cadavers for the consumption of body tissues (bone marrow), accompanied by meticulous shaping of cranial vaults. The distribution of cut-marks and percussion features indicates that the skulls were scrupulously 'cleaned' of any soft tissues, and subsequently modified by controlled removal of the facial region and breakage of the cranial base along a sub-horizontal plane. The vaults were also 'retouched', possibly to make the broken edges more regular. This manipulation suggests the shaping of skulls to produce skull-cups.Three skull-cups have been identified amongst the human bones from Gough's Cave. New ultrafiltered radiocarbon determinations provide direct dates of about 14,700 cal BP, making these the oldest directly dated skull-cups and the only examples known from the British Isles."
https://openalex.org/W2079075107,"Human adults typically respond faster to their own face than to the faces of others. However, in Chinese participants, this self-face advantage is lost in the presence of one's supervisor, and they respond faster to their supervisor's face than to their own. While this “boss effect” suggests a strong modulation of self-processing in the presence of influential social superiors, the current study examined whether this effect was true across cultures. Given the wealth of literature on cultural differences between collectivist, interdependent versus individualistic, independent self-construals, we hypothesized that the boss effect might be weaker in independent than interdependent cultures. Twenty European American college students were asked to identify orientations of their own face or their supervisors' face. We found that European Americans, unlike Chinese participants, did not show a “boss effect” and maintained the self-face advantage even in the presence of their supervisor's face. Interestingly, however, their self-face advantage decreased as their ratings of their boss's perceived social status increased, suggesting that self-processing in Americans is influenced more by one's social status than by one's hierarchical position as a social superior. In addition, when their boss's face was presented with a labmate's face, American participants responded faster to the boss's face, indicating that the boss may represent general social dominance rather than a direct negative threat to oneself, in more independent cultures. Altogether, these results demonstrate a strong cultural modulation of self-processing in social contexts and suggest that the very concept of social positions, such as a boss, may hold markedly different meanings to the self across Western and East Asian cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1971340033,"Recent clinical trials have established B cell depletion by the anti-CD20 chimeric antibody Rituximab as a beneficial therapy for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The impact of Rituximab on T cell responses remains largely unexplored. In the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS in mice that express human CD20, Rituximab administration rapidly depleted peripheral B cells and strongly reduced EAE severity. B cell depletion was also associated with diminished Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) and a reduction in T cell proliferation and IL-17 production during recall immune response experiments. While Rituximab is not considered a broad immunosuppressant, our results indicate a role for B cells as a therapeutic cellular target in regulating encephalitogenic T cell responses in specific tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2086569631,"Two-pore domain potassium (K(2P)) channels play a key role in setting the membrane potential of excitable cells. Despite their role as putative targets for drugs and general anesthetics, little is known about the structure and the drug binding site of K(2P) channels. We describe A1899 as a potent and highly selective blocker of the K(2P) channel TASK-1. As A1899 acts as an open-channel blocker and binds to residues forming the wall of the central cavity, the drug was used to further our understanding of the channel pore. Using alanine mutagenesis screens, we have identified residues in both pore loops, the M2 and M4 segments, and the halothane response element to form the drug binding site of TASK-1. Our experimental data were used to validate a K(2P) open-pore homology model of TASK-1, providing structural insights for future rational design of drugs targeting K(2P) channels."
https://openalex.org/W1968033606,"To understand how two organisms that have not previously been in contact can establish mutualism, it is first necessary to examine temporal changes in their phenotypes during the establishment of mutualism. Instead of tracing back the history of known, well-established, natural mutualisms, we experimentally simulated the development of mutualism using two genetically-engineered auxotrophic strains of Escherichia coli, which mimic two organisms that have never met before but later establish mutualism. In the development of this synthetic mutualism, one strain, approximately 10 hours after meeting the partner strain, started oversupplying a metabolite essential for the partner's growth, eventually leading to the successive growth of both strains. This cooperative phenotype adaptively appeared only after encountering the partner strain but before the growth of the strain itself. By transcriptome analysis, we found that the cooperative phenotype of the strain was not accompanied by the local activation of the biosynthesis and transport of the oversupplied metabolite but rather by the global activation of anabolic metabolism. This study demonstrates that an organism has the potential to adapt its phenotype after the first encounter with another organism to establish mutualism before its extinction. As diverse organisms inevitably encounter each other in nature, this potential would play an important role in the establishment of a nascent mutualism in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2083337775,"Sialoadhesin is exclusively expressed on specific subpopulations of macrophages. Since sialoadhesin-positive macrophages are involved in inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and potentially in the generation of immune responses, targeted delivery of drugs, toxins or antigens via sialoadhesin-specific immunoconjugates may prove a useful therapeutic strategy. Originally, sialoadhesin was characterized as a lymphocyte adhesion molecule, though recently its involvement in internalization of sialic acid carrying pathogens was shown, suggesting that sialoadhesin is an endocytic receptor. In this report, we show that porcine sialoadhesin-specific antibodies and F(ab')2 fragments trigger sialoadhesin internalization, both in primary porcine macrophages and in cells expressing recombinant porcine sialoadhesin. Using chemical inhibitors, double immunofluorescence stainings and dominant-negative constructs, porcine sialoadhesin internalization was shown to be clathrin- and Eps15-dependent and to result in targeting to early endosomes but not lysosomes. Besides characterizing the sialoadhesin endocytosis mechanism, two sialoadhesin-specific immunoconjugates were evaluated. We observed that porcine sialoadhesin-specific immunotoxins efficiently kill sialoadhesin-expressing macrophages. Furthermore, porcine sialoadhesin-specific albumin immunoconjugates were shown to be internalized in macrophages and immunization with these immunoconjugates resulted in a rapid and robust induction of albumin-specific antibodies, this compared to immunization with albumin alone. Together, these data expand sialoadhesin functionality and show that it can function as an endocytic receptor, a feature that cannot only be misused by sialic acid carrying pathogens, but that may also be used for specific targeting of toxins or antigens to sialoadhesin-expressing macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2076203903,"Deforestation rates in Sumatra are amongst the highest in the tropics. Lowland forests, which support the highest densities of orangutans, are particularly vulnerable to clearance and fragmentation because they are highly accessible. Consequently, many orangutans will, in the future, live in strictly or partially isolated populations. Whilst orangutans have been extensively studied in primary forests, their response to living in human-dominated landscapes remains poorly known, despite it being essential for their future management. Here, we focus on an isolated group of critically endangered Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) that co-exist with farmers in a mixed agroforest system consisting of degraded natural forest, smallholder (predominantly rubber) farms and oil palm plantations. Over 24 months we conducted the first ever spatial assessment of orangutan habitat use in the human-transformed landscape of Batang Serangan, North Sumatra. From 1,204 independent crop-raiding incidents recorded, orangutans showed strong foraging preference for mixed farmland/degraded forest habitat over oil palm patches. The core home range areas of the eight adult orangutans encompassed only 14% of the available study area. Monthly home range sizes averaged 423 ha (±139, SD) for males, and 131 ± 46 ha for females, and were positively influenced by wild and cultivated fruit presence, and by crop consumption. The average daily distance travelled was similar for both adult males (868 m ± 350, SD) and females (866 m ± 195), but increased when orangutans raided crops. These findings show that orangutans can survive, demographically, in certain types of degraded landscapes, foraging on a mixture of crops and wild fruits. However, the poor quality habitat offered to orangutans by oil palm plantations, in terms of low food availability and as a barrier to female movements, is cause for concern since this is the land use type that is most rapidly replacing the preferred forest habitat across both Sumatran and Bornean orangutan ranges."

The Cys loop receptor family of neurotransmitter-gated channels encompasses anionic channels that mediate inhibitory signaling (e.g. GABAA and glycine receptors) and cationic channels that mediate excitatory signaling (e.g. nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) 2The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; pCMBS, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. and serotonin type 3 receptors) (1Karlin A.

These channels are pentameric assemblies in which each subunit has an extracellular domain, four transmembrane α-helices (M1–M4), and a large cytoplasmic domain between the M3 and M4 helices. The channel pore is formed along the radial axis and is lined by the five M2 segments, one from each subunit (6Imoto K. Busch C. Sakmann B. Mishina M. Konno T. Nakai J. Bujo H. Mori Y. Fukuda K.

Ligand binding in the extracellular domain induces conformational changes in the transmembrane domain that open the gate and allows ions to pass through the channel. The gate is located in the middle of the membrane (11Panicker S. Cruz H. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Unwin N. J. Mol.

Using cryo-electron microscopy, Unwin (12Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) solved the Torpedo marmorata nAChR structure in the absence of agonist at 4 Å resolution. The structure was consistent with the subunit organization and topology proposed by earlier studies (1Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 2Akabas M.H. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2004; 62: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Miller P.S. Smart T.G.

Toxicol. 2010; 50: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To date, a high resolution crystal structure of a full-length eukaryotic Cys loop receptor is not available. Recently, prokaryotic Cys loop receptor homologues were identified based on predicted structural similarities in the extracellular ligand-binding domain (15Tasneem A. Iyer L.M. Jakobsson E. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Gloeobacter violaceus homologue (GLIC, the G. violaceus ligand-gated ion channel) was functionally expressed in eukaryotic cells and shown to be a proton-gated cation channel (16Bocquet N. Prado de Carvalho L. Cartaud J. Neyton J. Le Poupon C. Taly A. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Corringer P.J. Nature. 2007; 445: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). GLIC lacks some of the conserved features found in the eukaryotic Cys loop receptors, including the large cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop domain and the pair of Cys that form the eponymous extracellular disulfide-link in the Cys loop. GLIC was crystallized at pH 4.6 and 4, and the structures were solved to 2.9 and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively (17Bocquet N. Nury H. Baaden M. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Delarue M. Corringer P.J. Nature. 2009; 457: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 18Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2009; 457: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The GLIC structure shows substantial similarities to the nAChR structure, indicating that in spite of the low degree of amino acid sequence identity, GLIC is a Cys loop receptor homologue. Thus, GLIC may serve as a model in which to study the mechanisms of channel function and the conformational changes that the channels undergo as they transition between the closed, open, and desensitized states. However, there are some significant differences between the crystal structures of GLIC and the nAChR. 3R. B. Parikh, N. McKinnon, M. Bali, and M. H. Akabas, manuscript in preparation. The M2 segments are 1–2 helical turns longer in the nAChR than in GLIC. This alters the position of aligned residues in the M2-M3 loop and thus interactions between the extracellular and transmembrane domains. The interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains is critical for signal transduction from the binding site to the gate. Furthermore, although crystal structures provide a tremendous amount of information, it is unclear whether the GLIC structures correspond to an open or desensitized state of the channel. It was reported that GLIC does not desensitize (16Bocquet N. Prado de Carvalho L. Cartaud J. Neyton J. Le Poupon C. Taly A. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Corringer P.J. Nature. 2007; 445: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Bocquet N. Nury H. Baaden M. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Delarue M. Corringer P.J. Nature. 2009; 457: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This supported the contention that the crystal structures prepared in low pH solutions represent an open state. However, a recent report suggests that GLIC does desensitize (19Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Grosman C. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 403: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to crystallize GLIC, the protein was extracted from its native lipid membrane environment and crystallized from detergent solution at a pH that should activate the channel. The effects of detergent solubilization on the structure and desensitization rates are unknown for the GLIC channels. Detergent solubilization can have a significant impact on membrane protein structure (20Cross T.A. Sharma M. Yi M. Zhou H.X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, functional studies of GLIC channels in a lipid membrane environment can provide important information about the structure of the functional channel. In this study, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (21Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) to evaluate the chemical reactivity of Cys substituted, one at a time, for residues in the GLIC M2 segment and M2-M3 loop from Glu-221 (−2′) to Tyr-250 (27′). We screened each mutant for reactivity with the sulfhydryl-specific mercurial reagent p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS). We found that pCMBS reacted with almost every functional Cys mutant on the extracellular half of M2, from 10′ to 27′. This suggested that the extracellular half of the M2 helix is loosely packed with the adjacent transmembrane helices. This, combined with the desensitization of GLIC that we observed with prolonged exposure to pH < 5.0, suggests that the crystal structures may represent a desensitized or nonphysiological state of the channel. The GLIC coding sequence was cloned by PCR from a Gloeobacter violaceus (ATCC 29082) culture and inserted into the pXOON dual-function vector for protein expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes or mammalian cells (22Jespersen T. Grunnet M. Angelo K. Klaerke D.A. Olesen S.P. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The unique endogenous Cys at position 26 was mutated to leucine (C26L) by QuikChange (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) site-directed mutagenesis to produce a cysteine-free GLIC construct. An index numbering system is used to facilitate comparisons of M2 segment residues among family members (23Miller C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic family members, an absolutely conserved cationic residue near the N-terminal end of the M2 helix is numbered 0′. Residues toward the N terminus in the M1-M2 loop are numbered −1′, −2′, etc., whereas residues more C-terminal than 0′ are sequentially numbered 1′, 2′, etc. In GLIC, a cationic amino acid is not conserved at 0′. Therefore, we aligned the residues in GLIC M2 to an absolutely conserved proline at 23′. This alignment predicts that GLIC Asn-223 is the 0′ residue. Thirty individual Cys mutants from the −2′ through 27′ positions (E221C to Y250C), in and flanking the M2 region, were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis in the C26L GLIC background. Plasmid DNA linearized with NheI was used as a template for in vitro mRNA transcription using the mMachine mMessage T7 kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were prepared as described previously and injected with 10 ng of mRNA (24Jansen M. Akabas M.H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4492-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 1–3 days after mRNA injection, the currents were recorded using two-electrode voltage clamp at a holding potential of −40 or −60 mV via a TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) and digitized with a Digidata 1440A A-D converter and pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Agarose-tipped glass microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (∼0.3–0.8 MΩ tip resistance). The ground electrode was connected to the bath via a 3 m KCl-agar bridge. During recording, the oocytes were continuously perfused at 5 ml/min with GLV buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaOH, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm citric acid, pH adjusted with HCl) at room temperature. All of the reagents were dissolved in GLV buffer. Complete pH response curves could not be obtained because the oocytes became unstable at pH < 4. The oocytes tolerated repeated exposures to pH 5.0 or, to a lesser extent, pH 4.5. Proton-induced currents were measured for each mutant at pH 5.0 and 4.5 to determine whether the mutant was functional and to verify that pH 5.0 induced a submaximal current response. For mutants that had current amplitudes similar to those elicited from water-injected oocytes, we tested for the presence of spontaneously formed disulfide bonds between engineered Cys, by applying 10 mm DTT + 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 2 min at pH 7.5 followed by 2 min at pH 5.0. We evaluated the accessibility of each Cys substitution mutant in the resting (pH 7.5) and submaximally activated states (pH 5.0 for all Cys mutants except 12′, where we used pH 6.0 because of the increased pH sensitivity of this mutant). Given that the Cys thiol has a pKa of 8.14 in free solution (25.Lide, D., (ed) (2000) Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 81st Edition, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar), at pH 5.0 Cys thiols are unlikely to be significantly ionized. Therefore, we did not use methanethiosulfonate reagents because they react at a negligible rate with unionized thiols (26Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Because of the low pH activation of GLIC channels, we used p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) as our sulfhydryl reactive reagent because the organomercurial reagents react with both ionized thiolates (-S−) and with unionized thiols (-SH), albeit at different rates. pCMBS is an anion in the pH range 5.0 to 7.5. It is 313 times more soluble in water than in n-octanol (28Halbach S. Arch. Toxicol. 1985; 57: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). pCMBS is essentially impermeable through the lipid bilayer (29Vansteveninck J. Weed R.I. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 48: 617-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, its concentration in lipophilic regions of the protein should be negligible during application. Therefore, pCMBS should not react with buried Cys or should do so at a very slow rate. It should only modify sulfhydryl groups when they are in an aqueous environment. A potential problem with using pCMBS is that it is an anion and thus may have limited access to residues in the region of the charge selectivity filter in this cation-selective channel. pCMBS reaction with Cys mutants was assayed functionally. We measured the peak current amplitude evoked by low pH test pulses applied before and after pCMBS application. Low pH test pulses were applied for 2 min, with 2-min pH 7.5 washes between pulses to allow recovery from desensitization. Occasionally we saw run-up of the current amplitude induced by sequential low pH test pulses. When the current amplitudes of two consecutive low pH test pulses were within 10%, the response was considered stable, and the effect of pCMBS was tested. Following a 2-min prewash in buffer at the same pH as the pCMBS solution (pH 7.5, 6.0, or 5.0), 200 μm pCMBS was applied for 2 min. When pCMBS was applied at low pH, it was washed out for 20 s with buffer at the same pH before returning to the pH 7.5 buffer. Additional 2-min low pH test pulses were recorded at 2-min intervals until the response was stable, as was done before pCMBS treatment. The effect of modification was calculated as the ratio of the average peak current of the two pulses following pCMBS application to the average of the two pulses immediately before application. We measured the reaction rate of pCMBS with the reactive Cys mutants. Reaction rates at pH 7.5 were determined by alternating applications of pCMBS at pH 7.5 with 2-min low pH test pulses. Between the pCMBS and low pH test pulses, the oocytes were washed for 2 min with pH 7.5 buffer. The pCMBS exposure from each application could be controlled by varying the pCMBS concentration (0.2–200 μm) or the time of application (10–120 s). As expected, similar rates were obtained whether duration or concentration of pCMBS was varied. Five or more sequential pCMBS applications and test pulses were recorded. The test currents following pCMBS application were normalized to the initial pH 5.0 current and plotted against cumulative pCMBS exposure (in units of μm·s). Because GLIC is a homopentamer, there are five potential reactive sites in each mutant channel. The observed functional effect may require modification of only one Cys or may require reaction at several Cys before a functional effect occurs. The reaction rate data were fit to a single exponential function, representing a single bimolecular reaction, or to a kinetic model representing two consecutive reactions. f=ae−k1x+be−k1x−e−k2xk2−k1+c(1+−k2e−k1x+k1e−k2xk2−k1)(Eq. 1) Because pH 5.0 produced a stable current that did not appear to desensitize, reactions at pH 5.0 were observed in real time. pH 5.0 buffer alone was applied for 2 min, until a steady-state current was reached, and then pCMBS was added to the buffer at a concentration that would allow the reaction to proceed to completion during a 5–10-min period. Changes in the recorded current during pCMBS application at pH 5.0 were attributed to sulfhydryl modification, and the recorded curve was fit to single or sequential reaction kinetics. To identify spectral differences between pCMBS and the mercury-mercaptide product, UV-visible absorption spectra of pCMBS were measured before and after reaction with l-cysteine on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) over the pH range 3.0 to 12.0. The GLV buffer used for electrophysiological recordings had a strong optical absorption at wavelengths shorter than ∼240 nm. Therefore, reagents were prepared in phosphate acetate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaCH3COO-3H2O, 2.5 mm Na2HPO4, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4-H2O, pH adjusted with HCl or NaOH) to minimize the interference of buffer. We determined that the optical absorbance at 236 nm changed during reaction of pCMBS with Cys in phosphate acetate-buffered saline over the pH range from 3.0 to 12.0 (data not shown). The reaction between pCMBS and cysteine was followed at 236 nm on a π*180 stopped flow spectrometer equipped with a mercury-xenon lamp and a photomultiplier tube detector (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK). The reactions were carried out with a 10× excess of cysteine to give pseudo first order kinetics. The recorded curves were fit to a single exponential function, and second order rate constants were calculated. The reaction rate was measured over the pH range from 3.0 to 6.5. All of the experiments were performed in at least three oocytes from at least two separate frogs. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test using GraphPad Prism version 5.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Curve fitting to determine pCMBS reaction rates was performed with SigmaPlot 11 software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) or pClamp 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Curve fitting for stopped flow kinetics experiments was performed with Prism version 5.02 (GraphPad Software). Increasing the buffer proton concentration by decreasing the buffer pH to values under 6.5 elicited currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild type GLIC. For buffer pH ≥ 5.0, the pH-activated current response was similar to previously published results (16Bocquet N. Prado de Carvalho L. Cartaud J. Neyton J. Le Poupon C. Taly A. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Corringer P.J. Nature. 2007; 445: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 18Hilf R.J. Dutzler R. Nature. 2009; 457: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to previously published statements that GLIC does not desensitize, the wild type GLIC currents desensitized with prolonged (minutes) exposure to pH < 5.0 (Fig. 1A). The rate of desensitization was faster at pH 4.0 than at 4.5 (Fig. 1A). The desensitization induced at pH 4.0 at a holding potential of −50 mV was fitted with an exponential function with a mean time constant of 27.9 ± 2.9 s (n = 5). A recent report also noted that when expressed in HEK293 cells, macroscopic GLIC currents showed desensitization (19Gonzalez-Gutierrez G. Grosman C. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 403: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of a 2-min application of 200 μm pCMBS on wild type GLIC. pCMBS application significantly inhibited the subsequent pH 5.0 test currents (Fig. 1B). We inferred that pCMBS reacted with the sole endogenous cysteine in wild type GLIC, Cys-26. We mutated Cys-26 to leucine (C26L) to produce a Cys-free construct that was insensitive to pCMBS (Fig. 1D). Cys-26 lies in extracellular domain in the middle of the β1 strand. It faces into the β sandwich. Cys-26 is in close proximity to the β8-β9 loop and residues in the β2 and β9 strands (Fig. 2, A and B). There are several possible mechanisms by which pCMBS modification of Cys-26 might inhibit GLIC function. The β1-β2 loop plays an important role in signal transduction between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (30Reeves D.C. Jansen M. Bali M. Lemster T. Akabas M.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9358-9366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Modification of Cys-26 might disrupt this transduction pathway, or it might disrupt the β sandwich. At present we cannot distinguish between these possibilities. We could not measure a complete pH response curve to determine the proton EC50 (the pH that gives rise to 50% of the maximal current) because the oocytes did not tolerate prolonged (minutes) exposure to pH < 4. The Cys-free GLIC mutant had a pH response that was shifted to lower pH compared with wild type. Like the wild type, Cys-free GLIC did not appear to desensitize during a 2-min pH 5.0 pulse but did desensitize with exposure to pH < 5.0 (Fig. 1C). All of the subsequent Cys substitutions were made in the Cys-free background construct. For each of the 30 individual Cys mutants, we measured the currents induced by low pH test pulses to determine the effect of the mutation on proton-induced channel activation (Fig. 3). The currents induced by pH 5.0 application were not significantly different from those recorded from water-injected oocytes for nine of the 30 cysteine mutants: −1′ (A222C), 6′ (S229C), 11′ (H234C), 13′ (A236C), 15′ (N238C), 18′ (V241C), 20′ (T243C), 22′ (L245C), and 27′ (Y250C) (Figs. 2C and 3). Because each mutant channel possesses five engineered Cys, we sought to determine whether the lack of function was due to spontaneous disulfide bond formation between engineered Cys. We applied a solution containing the reducing agents DTT (10 mm) and TCEP (2 mm) at both pH 7.5 and 5.0, but this did not rescue channel function in any of the nonconducting mutants (data not shown). Either disulfide bonds were not responsible for the lack of function of these mutants or steric factors limited reducing agent access to the disulfide bonds so they could not be reduced or they reformed very rapidly after reduction. The 8′ (L231C), 9′ (I232C), and 10′ (A233C) mutants exhibited significant changes in the pH-dependent gating process. The 8′ (L231C) mutant was constitutively conductive at pH 7.5. Most oocytes injected with L231C mRNA were dead within 2 days. These oocytes displayed irregular patterns of pigmentation on their surface (31Braun T. Dar S. Vorobiov D. Lindenboim L. Dascal N. Stein R. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 186-194PubMed Google Scholar) or released their cytoplasmic contents into the storage medium. Electrophysiological recordings from 8′-expressing oocytes that appeared healthy on visual inspection >36 h after mRNA injection showed holding currents in excess of 6 μA when clamped at −60 mV. We recorded from oocytes injected with the 8′ L231C mutant 12–24 h after injection, when we expected lower expression levels. In these oocytes, holding currents ranged from 1 to 5 μA. The holding current was not significantly reduced by application of pH 9.0 buffer or 100 μm QX-222 at pH 7.5. Surprisingly, the holding currents were significantly reduced by application of pH 5.0 or 4.5 buffer (data not shown). Following pH 5.0 exposure, the currents in oocytes expressing the 9′ (I232C) mutant closed very slowly and did not return to the initial base-line current even after several minutes of pH 7.5 wash. The pH response of 12′ (I235C) was shifted to higher pH such that the pH 5.0 current amplitudes were of similar magnitude to those at pH 4.5. For this mutant, pH 6.0 was used to elicit a submaximally open state in subsequent experiments. We evaluated the ability of pCMBS to react with each Cys mutant in the closed (pH 7.5) and submaximally open (pH 5.0 or 6.0) states (Fig. 4). Covalent modification by pCMBS could have multiple effects on an individual mutant; the subsequent current amplitudes could be altered, and/or the channel gating kinetics or pH dependence could change. We infer that pCMBS reacted with Cys mutants whose subsequent currents or gating kinetics were significantly altered following pCMBS application. For the mutants ranging from 13′ to 27′, a 2-min application of 200 μm pCMBS at pH 7.5 significantly altered the subsequent pH 5.0 test pulse current amplitudes for 13′ (A236C), 14′ (F237C), 15′ (N238C), 16′ (I239C), 17′ (L240C), 19′ (E242C), 21′ (N244C), 25′ (T248C), and 26′ (P249C) (Fig. 4A). For the 13′ (A236C) and 15′ (N238C) mutants, prior to pCMBS application, the low pH test pulses did not elicit currents that were significantly different from water-injected oocytes. However, pCMBS modification significantly increased the subsequent currents elicited by low pH test pulses for both mutants (Fig. 2C, purple residues). Thus, we infer that the Cys substitutions at 13′ (A236C) and 15′ (N238C) inhibited channel function, but pCMBS modification of the engineered Cys restored channel function. This implies that for these two mutants, the lack of function prior to pCMBS modification was not due to disulfide bond formation between the engineered Cys. For the four other nonfunctional mutants between 13′ and 27′, 18′ (V241C), 20′ (T243C), 22′ (L245C), and 27′ (Y250C), there were no changes following pCMBS application at either pH 7.5 or 5.0. All of the mutants that reacted with pCMBS at pH 7.5 also reacted with 200 μm pCMBS applied at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4B). In addition, although pCMBS application at pH 7.5 did not have a significant effect on the 23′ (P246C) and 24′ (K247C) mutants, application of 200 μm pCMBS at pH 5.0 significantly altered the subsequent pH 5.0 test currents (Fig. 4B). Covalent modification of a Cys may potentiate or inhibit subsequent currents. At the 11 mutants between 13′ and 27′ where pCMBS modification significantly altered the currents, the currents were potentiated at 13′ (A236C), 14′ (F237C), 15′ (N238C), 17′ (L240C), and 25′ (T248C) and were inhibited at 16′ (I239C), 19′ (E242C), 21′ (N244C), 23′ (P246C), 24′ (K247C), and 26′ (P249C) (Figs. 2, D–G, and 4). It is difficult to infer the structural or mechanistic basis for the functional effects of modification, and we have not pursued such studies (Fig. 2D). Note that the pCMBS-reactive residues on the back side of M2 are not accessible from the lipid bilayer in the crystal structure (Fig. 2, compare F and G; M1, M3, and M4 removed in Fig. 2G to visualize the location of the M2 residues buried in the subunit interior). From −2′ to 12′, the only pCMBS-reactive residue was A233C (10′) where pCMBS application caused a change in gating kinetics (Fig. 5). Application of pCMBS at pH 7.5 slowed down subsequent channel deactivation after the pH was changed from 5.0 to 7.5 and increased the amplitude of the holding current at pH 7.5. Proton-induced currents were increased by 23 ± 7% following pCMBS application (n = 4), but this change was not statistically significant (Fig. 5A). In contrast, following application of pCMBS at pH 5.0, the current remained stable with little reduction in the holding current after the bath pH was returned to pH 7.5 over a 10-min period"

Understanding how these environmental stressors have impacted coral skeletal growth should improve our ability to predict how they may affect coral reefs in the future. We investigated century-scale variations in skeletal extension for the slow-growing massive scleractinian coral Siderastrea siderea inhabiting the forereef, backreef, and nearshore reefs of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) in the western Caribbean Sea. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirteen S. siderea cores were extracted, slabbed, and X-rayed. Annual skeletal extension was estimated from adjacent low- and high-density growth bands. Since the early 1900s, forereef S. siderea colonies have shifted from exhibiting the fastest to the slowest average annual skeletal extension, while values for backreef and nearshore colonies have remained relatively constant. The rates of change in annual skeletal extension were −0.020±0.005, 0.011±0.006, and −0.008±0.006 mm yr−1 per year [mean±SE] for forereef, backreef, and nearshore colonies respectively. These values for forereef and nearshore S. siderea were significantly lower by 0.031±0.008 and by 0.019±0.009 mm yr−1 per year, respectively, than for backreef colonies. However, only forereef S. siderea exhibited a statistically significant decline in annual skeletal extension over the last century. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that forereef S. siderea colonies are more susceptible to environmental stress than backreef and nearshore counterparts, which may have historically been exposed to higher natural baseline stressors. Alternatively, sediment plumes, nutrients, and pollution originating from watersheds of Guatemala and Honduras may disproportionately impact the forereef environment of the MBRS. We are presently reconstructing the history of environmental stressors that have impacted the MBRS to constrain the cause(s) of the observed reductions in coral skeletal growth. This should improve our ability to predict and potentially mitigate the effects of future environmental stressors on coral reef ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2048650052,"While the perception of size-related acoustic variation in animal vocalisations is well documented, little attention has been given to how this information might be integrated with corresponding visual information. Using a cross-modal design, we tested the ability of domestic dogs to match growls resynthesized to be typical of either a large or a small dog to size-matched models. Subjects looked at the size-matched model significantly more often and for a significantly longer duration than at the incorrect model, showing that they have the ability to relate information about body size from the acoustic domain to the appropriate visual category. Our study suggests that the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms at the basis of size assessment in mammals have a multisensory nature, and calls for further investigations of the multimodal processing of size information across animal species."

Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). The functional Na/K-ATPase consists of α and β subunits. The α subunit is the catalytic subunit, and four isoforms have been identified. Although the α1 isoform is found in all cells, the expression of other isoforms is tissue-specific (2Sweadner K.J.

For example, Na/K-ATPase interacts with Src kinase, forming a functional signaling complex capable of transducing extracellular signals into activation of intracellular kinase cascades (9Tian J.

Interestingly, the signaling Na/K-ATPase mainly resides in the specialized membrane microdomains called caveolae and interacts with caveolin-1, a caveolae protein marker (7Wang H. Haas M. Liang M.

In addition to its role in biogenesis of caveolae, caveolin-1 is involved in cholesterol trafficking to and from the plasma membrane (10Uittenbogaard A. Everson W.V. Matveev S.V. Smart E.J. J. Biol.

Reciprocally, the plasma membrane cholesterol controls the mobility and trafficking of caveolin-1 (11Park E.K. Park M.J. Lee S.H. Li Y.C. Kim J. Lee J.S. Lee J.W. Ye S.K. Park J.W. Kim C.W. Park B.K.

Na/K-ATPase is a key regulator of transmembrane transport processes and a receptor for endogenous cardiotonic steroids (26Schoner W. Scheiner-Bobis G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C509-C536Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane cholesterol is important for many cellular activities, including the formation of lipid rafts and the regulation of ER cholesterol content and, thus, cholesterol synthesis and metabolism (27Parton R.G. Hanzal-Bayer M. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that the Na/K-ATPase regulates the content of cholesterol in the plasma membrane through a highly conserved N-terminal caveolin-1 binding motif (6Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y. Cai T. Wang H. Li Z. Loreaux E. Lingrel J.B. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14881-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alteration in the expression of Na/K-ATPase affects the formation of caveolae and cholesterol synthesis and trafficking in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that the plasma membrane pool of cholesterol regulates membrane trafficking and expression of Na/K-ATPase. A decrease in cholesterol leads to the activation of Src kinase, which promotes the endocytosis of and degradation of α1 Na/K-ATPase. In view of the fact that reduction of α1 Na/K-ATPase activates cellular Src, resulting in a decrease in caveolin-1 and cholesterol in the plasma membrane (6Cai T. Wang H. Chen Y. Liu L. Gunning W.T. Quintas L.E. Xie Z.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y. Cai T. Wang H. Li Z. Loreaux E. Lingrel J.B. Xie Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it appears that cells have acquired a Src-dependent interplay among Na/K-ATPase, cholesterol, and caveolin-1. This functional interplay may establish a highly efficient feed-forward mechanism that detects the change in cellular cholesterol or/and α1 Na/K-ATPase and then alters the structure and function of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). For example, a decrease in cholesterol could initiate a Src-dependent endocytosis and degradation of α1 Na/K-ATPase, which in turn would reduce the number of Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane, causing further activation of Src and, consequently, a further decrease in the membrane cholesterol. Interestingly, activation of Src has been noted in the target organs of NPC1 mice (30Garver W.S. Hossain G.S. Winscott M.M. Heidenreich R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1453: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and contributed to neurodegeneration (31Khanna S. Roy S. Park H.A. Sen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23482-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the proposed feed-forward mechanism could be functional, resulting in a significant decrease in neuronal and hepatic Na/K-ATPase in NPC1 mice. It is important to note that the effect of cholesterol on the activity of Na/K-ATPase has been well documented (32Cornelius F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Cornelius F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8842-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, several reports show a decrease in Na/K-ATPase activity in diseases that are associated with abnormal cholesterol metabolism (34Chen M. Mason R.P. Tulenko T.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35De Luise M. Blackburn G.L. Flier J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).An unresolved issue in our proposed model is how cholesterol reduction activates Src kinase. Because it is well known that cholesterol reduction results in an increase in caveolin mobility and endocytosis (11Park E.K. Park M.J. Lee S.H. Li Y.C. Kim J. Lee J.S. Lee J.W. Ye S.K. Park J.W. Kim C.W. Park B.K. Kim Y.N. J. Pathol. 2009; 218: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Hayer A. Stoeber M. Ritz D. Engel S. Meyer H.H. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 615-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 22Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Nature. 2005; 436: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 36Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one possibility is that cholesterol reduction attenuates the inhibitory effect of caveolin-1 on Src kinase (37Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated before that α1 Na/K-ATPase directly interacts and inhibits Src kinase activity (9Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Li Z. Cai T. Tian J. Xie J.X. Zhao X. Liu L. Shapiro J.I. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21066-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that a reduction in the membrane Na/K-ATPase could further the Src activation (Fig. 7). Undoubtedly, further experiments are required to test our hypothesis and resolve this issue. Finally, it is important to mention that Mβ-CD was also found to reduce the phosphorylation of Src in breast cancer cells (39Raghu H. Sodadasu P.K. Malla R.R. Gondi C.S. Estes N. Rao J.S. BMC Cancer. 2010; 10: 647Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that cholesterol reduction may have a different effect on the α1 Na/K-ATPase in these cancer cells.Although it remains to be investigated how reduction of cell surface cholesterol induces the endocytosis and degradation of α1 Na/K-ATPase, it would be of interest to compare the α1 Na/K-ATPase with two well studied membrane proteins, SREB cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and caveolin-1. SCAP is a cholesterol sensor embedded in the ER membrane. It is in complex with SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein). The interaction between the cholesterol and the ER SCAP enables the binding of Insig to the complex, which stabilizes the complex in the ER and prevents the transport of SCAP/SREBP to the Golgi apparatus (28Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Similarly, the binding of plasma membrane cholesterol to the α1 Na/K-ATPase could promote the association of α1 Na/K-ATPase to another protein, resulting in the inhibition of budding and endocytosis of α1 Na/K-ATPase. On the other hand, because the Na/K-ATPase is highly enriched in caveolae, it may go through a pathway similar to that of caveolin-1. In this case, removal of cholesterol stimulates Src and other protein kinases, which increases the mobility and endocytosis of caveolin-1 (11Park E.K. Park M.J. Lee S.H. Li Y.C. Kim J. Lee J.S. Lee J.W. Ye S.K. Park J.W. Kim C.W. Park B.K. Kim Y.N. J. Pathol. 2009; 218: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Nature. 2005; 436: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the regulatory effect of cholesterol on α1 Na/K-ATPase required the activation of Src kinase (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5).The NPC1 disease is characterized by accumulation of intracellular cholesterol within the late endosome/lysosomes, which is believed to be due to a defect of the cholesterol trafficking between internal membranes and the plasma membrane. The disease is marked by neuronal dysfunction and cell death in the central nervous system (23Sturley S.L. Patterson M.C. Balch W. Liscum L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1685: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, it is not well understood how these two events are connected. On the other hand, Na/K-ATPase is known to be a major force in maintaining the resting membrane potential and neuron excitability. Recent studies have further demonstrated that it also regulates cell growth (13Tian J. Li X. Liang M. Liu L. Xie J.X. Ye Q. Kometiani P. Tillekeratne M. Jin R. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14921-14929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 40Desfrere L. Karlsson M. Hiyoshi H. Malmersjö S. Nanou E. Estrada M. Miyakawa A. Lagercrantz H.

Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, our new findings warrant a need of further investigation as to whether the down-regulation of α1 Na/K-ATPase contributes to the pathogenesis of NPC1 disease. Moreover, these studies are also relevant to many other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer and Parkinson) because deregulation of cholesterol metabolism has been well documented in the central nervous system of these patients.Peripherally, the liver represents the most affected organ in NPC1−/− mouse. Hepatic enlargement and dysfunction are well documented. Interestingly, although total hepatic cholesterol has increased several-fold in the NPC1−/− liver, cholesterol synthesis and uptake are continuously increased. This abnormality is apparently due to the decrease in cholesterol content in the plasma and ER membranes and the subsequent activation of SREBP (28Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 42Garver W.S. Jelinek D. Oyarzo J.N. Flynn J. Zuckerman M. Krishnan K. Chung B.H. Heidenreich R.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 498-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in cellular α1 Na/K-ATPase in the NPC1−/− liver. This decrease may be relevant to the abnormal regulation of cholesterol metabolism. We reported that knockdown of hepatic α1 Na/K-ATPase activated SREBP and consequently increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Moreover, it also enlarged the liver (8Chen Y. Cai T. Wang H. Li Z. Loreaux E. Lingrel J.B. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14881-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These changes are similar to the phenotypic changes observed in the NPC1−/− liver. At the molecular level, it is known that most of the cellular cholesterol localizes and functions in the plasma membrane and that the ER cholesterol pool is controlled by the plasma membrane cholesterol content (29Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Abi-Mosleh L. Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19316-19321Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that the Na/K-ATPase/cholesterol interaction could act as a cholesterol sensor in the plasma membrane. Disruption of this interaction would impair the ability of cells to properly regulate intracellular cholesterol trafficking and, consequently, cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. On the other hand, the proper operation of the feed-forward mechanism described above would provide cells with a robust signaling mechanism to activate SREBP pathways and, thus, cholesterol synthesis.

The resulting knottin peptide was comprised of 38 amino acids, and contained 11- and 10-residue loops compared to wild-type EETI-II, which naturally contains 6- and 5-residue loops, respectively. This knottin peptide bound to αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins with affinities in the low nanomolar range, but bound weakly to the related integrins α5β1 and αiibβ3. In addition, the engineered knottin peptide inhibited tumor cell adhesion to vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein that binds to αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. A 64Cu radiolabeled version of this knottin peptide demonstrated moderate serum stability and excellent tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-blood ratios by positron emission tomography imaging in human tumor xenograft models. Tumor uptake was ∼3–5% injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at one hour post injection, with rapid clearance of probe through the kidneys. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated that multiple loops of EETI-II can be mutated to bind with high affinity to tumor-associated integrin receptors. The resulting knottin peptide contained 21 (>50%) non-native amino acids within two mutated loops, indicating that extended loop lengths and sequence diversity were well tolerated within the EETI-II scaffold. A radiolabeled version of this knottin peptide showed promise for non-invasive imaging of integrin expression in living subjects. However, reduced serum and metabolic stability were observed compared to an engineered integrin-binding EETI-II knottin peptide containing only one mutated loop."
https://openalex.org/W2006986870,"The neurofilament light subunit (NF-L) binds to myosin Va (Myo Va) in neurons but the sites of interaction and functional significance are not clear. We show by deletion analysis that motor domain of Myo Va binds to the NF-L rod domain that forms the NF backbone. Loss of NF-L and Myo Va binding from axons significantly reduces the axonal content of ER, and redistributes ER to the periphery of axon. Our data are consistent with a novel function for NFs as a scaffold in axons for maintaining the content and proper distribution of vesicular organelles, mediated in part by Myo Va. Based on observations that the Myo Va motor domain binds to intermediate filament (IF) proteins of several classes, Myo Va interactions with IFs may serve similar roles in organizing organelle topography in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2071927334,"Knowing where people look when viewing faces provides an objective measure into the part of information entering the visual system as well as into the cognitive strategy involved in facial perception. In the present study, we recorded the eye movements of 20 congenitally deaf (10 male and 10 female) and 23 (11 male and 12 female) normal-hearing Japanese participants while they evaluated the emotional valence of static face stimuli. While no difference was found in the evaluation scores, the eye movements during facial observations differed among participant groups. The deaf group looked at the eyes more frequently and for longer duration than the nose whereas the hearing group focused on the nose (or the central region of face) more than the eyes. These results suggest that the strategy employed to extract visual information when viewing static faces may differ between deaf and hearing people."
https://openalex.org/W2070627782,"The evolutionary implications of recombination in HIV remain not fully understood. A plausible effect could be an enhancement of immune escape from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In order to test this hypothesis, we constructed a population dynamic model of immune escape in HIV and examined the viral-immune dynamics with and without recombination. Our model shows that recombination (i) increases the genetic diversity of the viral population, (ii) accelerates the emergence of escape mutations with and without compensatory mutations, and (iii) accelerates the acquisition of immune escape mutations in the early stage of viral infection. We see a particularly strong impact of recombination in systems with broad, non-immunodominant CTL responses. Overall, our study argues for the importance of recombination in HIV in allowing the virus to adapt to changing selective pressures as imposed by the immune system and shows that the effect of recombination depends on the immunodominance pattern of effector T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2001822006,"The gene product of Vaccinia virus gene H1, VH1, is the first identified dual specificity phosphatase (DSP). The human genome encodes 38 different VH1-like DSPs, which include major regulators of signaling pathways, highly dysregulated in disease states. VH1 down-regulates cellular antiviral response by dephosphorylating activated STAT1 in the IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling pathway. In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis for VH1 catalytic activity. Using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), we determined that VH1 exists in solution as a boomerang-shaped dimer. Targeted alanine mutations in the dimerization domain (aa 1-27) decrease phosphatase activity while leaving the dimer intact. Deletion of the N-terminal dimer swapped helix (aa 1-20) completely abolishes dimerization and severely reduces phosphatase activity. An engineered chimera of VH1 that contains only one active site retains wild-type levels of catalytic activity. Thus, a dimeric quaternary structure, as opposed to two cooperative active sites within the same dimer is essential for VH1 catalytic activity. Together with laforin, VH1 is the second DSP reported in literature for which dimerization via an N-terminal dimerization domain is necessary for optimal catalytic activity. We propose that dimerization may represent a common mechanism to regulate the activity and substrate recognition of DSPs, often assumed to function as monomers."
https://openalex.org/W2054725755,"Studies of cross-cultural variations in the perception of emotion have typically compared rates of recognition of static posed stimulus photographs. That research has provided evidence for universality in the recognition of a range of emotions but also for some systematic cross-cultural variation in the interpretation of emotional expression. However, questions remain about how widely such findings can be generalised to real life emotional situations. The present study provides the first evidence that the previously reported interplay between universal and cultural influences extends to ratings of natural, dynamic emotional stimuli.Participants from Northern Ireland, Serbia, Guatemala and Peru used a computer based tool to continuously rate the strength of positive and negative emotion being displayed in twelve short video sequences by people from the United Kingdom engaged in emotional conversations. Generalized additive mixed models were developed to assess the differences in perception of emotion between countries and sexes. Our results indicate that the temporal pattern of ratings is similar across cultures for a range of emotions and social contexts. However, there are systematic differences in intensity ratings between the countries, with participants from Northern Ireland making the most extreme ratings in the majority of the clips.The results indicate that there is strong agreement across cultures in the valence and patterns of ratings of natural emotional situations but that participants from different cultures show systematic variation in the intensity with which they rate emotion. Results are discussed in terms of both 'in-group advantage' and 'display rules' approaches. This study indicates that examples of natural spontaneous emotional behaviour can be used to study cross-cultural variations in the perception of emotion."
https://openalex.org/W2025273662,"Histidine Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (His-HDX-MS) determines the HDX rates at the imidazole C(2)-hydrogen of histidine residues. This method provides not only the HDX rates but also the pK(a) values of histidine imidazole rings. His-HDX-MS was used to probe the microenvironment of histidine residues of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme proposed to undergo multiple conformational changes during catalysis.Using His-HDX-MS, the pK(a) values and the half-lives (t(1/2)) of HDX reactions of five histidine residues of apo-DHFR, DHFR in complex with methotrexate (DHFR-MTX), DHFR in complex with MTX and NADPH (DHFR-MTX-NADPH), and DHFR in complex with folate and NADP+ (DHFR-folate-NADP+) were determined. The results showed that the two parameters (pK(a) and t(1/2)) are sensitive to the changes of the microenvironment around the histidine residues. Although four of the five histidine residues are located far from the active site, ligand binding affected their pK(a), t(1/2) or both. This is consistent with previous observations of ligand binding-induced distal conformational changes on DHFR. Most of the observed pK(a) and t(1/2) changes could be rationalized using the X-ray structures of apo-DHFR, DHFR-MTX-NADPH, and DHFR-folate-NADP+. The availability of the neutron diffraction structure of DHFR-MTX enabled us to compare the protonation states of histidine imidazole rings.Our results demonstrate the usefulness of His-HDX-MS in probing the microenvironments of histidine residues within proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1999748940,"Caveolin (Cav) proteins in the plasma membrane have numerous binding partners, but the determinants of these interactions are poorly understood. We show here that Cav-3 has a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) consensus motif (ΨKX(D/E, where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue)) near the scaffolding domain and that Cav-3 is SUMOylated in a manner that is enhanced by the SUMO E3 ligase PIASy (protein inhibitor of activated STAT-y). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the consensus site lysine is the preferred SUMOylation site but that mutation of all lysines is required to abolish SUMOylation. Co-expression of a SUMOylation-deficient mutant of Cav-3 with β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) alters the expression level of β(2)ARs but not β(1)ARs following agonist stimulation, thus implicating Cav-3 SUMOylation in the mechanisms for β(2)AR but not β(1)AR desensitization. Expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS3) was not altered by the SUMOylation-deficient mutant. Thus, SUMOylation is a covalent modification of caveolins that influence the regulation of certain signaling partners."
https://openalex.org/W2064185725,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling pathways are involved in the stress response, and there is growing evidence supporting hair growth inhibition of murine hair follicle in vivo upon stress exposure. We investigated whether the blockade of CRF receptors influences the development of hair loss in CRF over-expressing (OE)-mice that display phenotypes of Cushing's syndrome and chronic stress, including alopecia. The non-selective CRF receptors antagonist, astressin-B (5 µg/mouse) injected peripherally once a day for 5 days in 4-9 months old CRF-OE alopecic mice induced pigmentation and hair re-growth that was largely retained for over 4 months. In young CRF-OE mice, astressin-B prevented the development of alopecia that occurred in saline-treated mice. Histological examination indicated that alopecic CRF-OE mice had hair follicle atrophy and that astressin-B revived the hair follicle from the telogen to anagen phase. However, astressin-B did not show any effect on the elevated plasma corticosterone levels and the increased weights of adrenal glands and visceral fat in CRF-OE mice. The selective CRF₂ receptor antagonist, astressin₂-B had moderate effect on pigmentation, but not on hair re-growth. The commercial drug for alopecia, minoxidil only showed partial effect on hair re-growth. These data support the existence of a key molecular switching mechanism triggered by blocking peripheral CRF receptors with an antagonist to reset hair growth in a mouse model of alopecia associated with chronic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2025064031,"Sld3 is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, but Sld3 does not travel with a replication fork. GINS binds to Cdc45 and Mcm2-7 to form the replication fork helicase in eukaryotes. We purified Sld3, Cdc45, GINS, and Mcm2-7 and studied their interaction and assembly into complexes. Sld3 binds tightly to Cdc45 in the presence or absence of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Furthermore, Sld3 binds tightly to the Mcm2-7 complex, and a ternary complex forms among Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and Sld3, with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (CMS complex). GINS binds directly to Mcm2-7, and GINS competes with Sld3 for Mcm2-7 binding. GINS also binds directly to Cdc45, and GINS competes with Sld3 for Cdc45 binding. Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and GINS form a ternary complex with a stoichiometry of 1:1:1 (CMG complex). Size exclusion data reveal that when Sld3, Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and GINS are added together, the result is a mixture of CMS and CMG complexes. The data suggest that GINS and Sld3 compete with one another for Mcm2-7 and Cdc45 binding. Our results are consistent with a model wherein GINS trades places with Sld3 at a replication origin, contributing to the activation of the replication fork helicase."
https://openalex.org/W2081576989,"During each catalytic cycle, DNA polymerases select deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrates complementary to a templating base with high fidelity from a pool that includes noncomplementary dNTPs and both complementary and noncomplementary ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs). The Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (KF) achieves this through a series of conformational transitions that precede the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation. Kinetic evidence from fluorescence and FRET experiments indicates that discrimination of the base and sugar moieties of the incoming nucleotide occurs in distinct, sequential steps during the selection pathway. Here we show that KF-DNA complexes formed with complementary rNTPs or with noncomplementary nucleotides can be distinguished on the basis of their properties when captured in an electric field atop the α-hemolysin nanopore. The average nanopore dwell time of KF-DNA complexes increased as a function of complementary rNTP concentration. The increase was less than that promoted by complementary dNTP, indicating that the rNTP complexes are more stable than KF-DNA binary complexes but less stable than KF-DNA-dNTP ternary complexes. KF-DNA-rNTP complexes could also be distinguished from KF-DNA-dNTP complexes on the basis of ionic current amplitude. In contrast to complementary rNTPs, noncomplementary dNTPs and rNTPs diminished the average nanopore dwell time of KF-DNA complexes in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that binding of a noncomplementary nucleotide keeps the KF-DNA complex in a less stable state. These results imply that nucleotide selection proceeds through a series of complexes of increasing stability in which substrates with the correct moiety promote the forward transitions."

https://openalex.org/W1991347309,"Memory CD4 T cells play a vital role in protection against re-infection by pathogens as diverse as helminthes or influenza viruses. Inducible costimulator (ICOS) is highly expressed on memory CD4 T cells and has been shown to augment proliferation and survival of activated CD4 T cells. However, the role of ICOS costimulation on the development and maintenance of memory CD4 T cells remains controversial. Herein, we describe a significant defect in the number of effector memory (EM) phenotype cells in ICOS−/− and ICOSL−/− mice that becomes progressively more dramatic as the mice age. This decrease was not due to a defect in the homeostatic proliferation of EM phenotype CD4 T cells in ICOS−/− or ICOSL−/− mice. To determine whether ICOS regulated the development or survival of EM CD4 T cells, we utilized an adoptive transfer model. We found no defect in development of EM CD4 T cells, but long-term survival of ICOS−/− EM CD4 T cells was significantly compromised compared to wild-type cells. The defect in survival was specific to EM cells as the central memory (CM) ICOS−/− CD4 T cells persisted as well as wild type cells. To determine the physiological consequences of a specific defect in EM CD4 T cells, wild-type and ICOS−/− mice were infected with influenza virus. ICOS−/− mice developed significantly fewer influenza-specific EM CD4 T cells and were more susceptible to re-infection than wild-type mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a role for ICOS costimulation in the maintenance of EM but not CM CD4 T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2105377698,"Understanding the foraging ecology and diet of animals can play a crucial role in conservation of a species. This is particularly true where species are cryptic and coexist in environments where observing feeding behaviour directly is difficult. Here we present the first information on the foraging ecology of a recently identified species of dolphin (Southern Australian bottlenose dolphin (SABD)) and comparisons to the common bottlenose dolphin (CBD) in Victoria, Australia, using stable isotope analysis of teeth. Stable isotope signatures differed significantly between SABD and CBD for both δ13C (−14.4‰ vs. −15.5‰ respectively) and δ15N (15.9‰ vs. 15.0‰ respectively), suggesting that the two species forage in different areas and consume different prey. This finding supports genetic and morphological data indicating that SABD are distinct from CBD. In Victoria, the SABD is divided into two distinct populations, one in the large drowned river system of Port Phillip Bay and the other in a series of coastal lakes and lagoons called the Gippsland Lakes. Within the SABD species, population differences were apparent. The Port Phillip Bay population displayed a significantly higher δ15N than the Gippsland Lakes population (17.0‰ vs. 15.5‰), suggesting that the Port Phillip Bay population may feed at a higher trophic level - a result which is supported by analysis of local food chains. Important future work is required to further understand the foraging ecology and diet of this newly described, endemic, and potentially endangered species of dolphin."
https://openalex.org/W2028966442,"Microarray studies of chronic hepatitis C infection have provided valuable information regarding the host response to viral infection. However, recent studies of the human transcriptome indicate pervasive transcription in previously unannotated regions of the genome and that many RNA transcripts have short or lack 3' poly(A) ends. We hypothesized that using ENCODE tiling arrays (1% of the genome) in combination with affinity purifying Pol II RNAs by their unique 5' m⁷GpppN cap would identify previously undescribed annotated and unannotated genes that are differentially expressed in liver during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Both 5'-capped and poly(A)+ populations of RNA were analyzed using ENCODE tiling arrays. Sixty-four annotated genes were significantly increased in HCV cirrhotic as compared to control liver; twenty-seven (42%) of these genes were identified only by analyzing 5' capped RNA. Thirty-one annotated genes were significantly decreased; sixteen (50%) of these were identified only by analyzing 5' capped RNA. Bioinformatic analysis showed that capped RNA produced more consistent results, provided a more extensive expression profile of intronic regions and identified upregulated Pol II transcriptionally active regions in unannotated areas of the genome in HCV cirrhotic liver. Two of these regions were verified by PCR and RACE analysis. qPCR analysis of liver biopsy specimens demonstrated that these unannotated transcripts, as well as IRF1, TRIM22 and MET, were also upregulated in hepatitis C with mild inflammation and no fibrosis. The analysis of 5' capped RNA in combination with ENCODE tiling arrays provides additional gene expression information and identifies novel upregulated Pol II transcripts not previously described in HCV infected liver. This approach, particularly when combined with new RNA sequencing technologies, should also be useful in further defining Pol II transcripts differentially regulated in specific disease states and in studying RNAs regulated by changes in pre-mRNA splicing or 3' polyadenylation status."
https://openalex.org/W2056187526,"Gifted adolescents are considered to have high IQs with advanced mathematical and logical performances, but are often thought to suffer from social isolation or emotional mal-adaptation to the social group. The underlying mechanisms that cause stereotypic portrayals of gifted adolescents are not well known. We aimed to investigate behavioral performance of gifted adolescents during social decision-making tasks to assess their affective and social/non-social cognitive abilities. We examined cooperation behaviors of 22 gifted and 26 average adolescents during an iterative binary public goods (PG) game, a multi-player social interaction game, and analyzed strategic decision processes that include cooperation and free-riding. We found that the gifted adolescents were more cooperative than average adolescents. Particularly, comparing the strategies for the PG game between the two groups, gifted adolescents were less sensitive to loss, yet were more sensitive to gain. Additionally, the behavioral characteristics of average adolescents, such as low trust of the group and herding behavior, were not found in gifted adolescents. These results imply that gifted adolescents have a high cognitive ability but a low ability to process affective information or to adapt in social groups compared with average adolescents. We conclude that gain/loss sensitivity and the ability to adapt in social groups develop to different degrees in average and gifted adolescents."

Oncogenic mutations of the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases are present in the majority of GIST, leading to ligand-independent activation of the intracellular signal transduction pathways. We previously investigated the gene expression profile in the murine KitK641E GIST model and identified Ntsr1 mRNA, encoding the Neurotensin receptor 1, amongst the upregulated genes. Here we characterized Ntsr1 mRNA and protein expression in the murine KitK641E GIST model and in tissue microarrays of human GIST. Ntsr1 mRNA upregulation in KitK641E animals was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Ntsr1 immunoreactivity was not detected in the Kit positive ICC of WT mice, but was present in the Kit positive hyperplasia of KitK641E mice. In the normal human gut, NTSR1 immunoreactivity was detected in myenteric neurons but not in KIT positive ICC. Two independent tissue microarrays, including a total of 97 GIST, revealed NTSR1 immunoreactivity in all specimens, including the KIT negative GIST with PDGFRA mutation. NTSR1 immunoreactivity exhibited nuclear, cytoplasmic or mixed patterns, which might relate to variable levels of NTSR1 activation. As studies using radio-labeled NTSR1 ligand analogues for whole body tumor imaging and for targeted therapeutic interventions have already been reported, this study opens new perspectives for similar approaches in GIST."
https://openalex.org/W2088384240,"Background Physiological adaptations that allow air-breathing vertebrates to remain underwater for long periods mainly involve modifications of the respiratory system, essentially through increased oxygen reserves. Physiological constraints on dive duration tend to be less critical for ectotherms than for endotherms because the former have lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Moreover, comparative studies between marine and terrestrial ectotherms have yet to show overall distinct physiological differences specifically associated with oxygen reserves. Methodology/Principal Findings We used phylogenetically informed statistical models to test if habitat affects hematocrit (an indicator of blood oxygen stores) in snakes, a lineage that varies widely in habitat use. Our results indicate that both phylogenetic position (clade) and especially habitat are significant predictors of hematocrit. Our analysis also confirms the peculiar respiratory physiology of the marine Acrochordus granulatus. Conclusion/Significance Contrary to previous findings, marine snakes have significantly–albeit slightly–elevated hematocrit, which should facilitate increased aerobic dive times. Longer dives could have consequences for foraging, mate searching, and predation risks. Alternatively, but not exclusively, increased Hct in marine species might also help to fuel other oxygen-demanding physiological adaptations, such as those involved in osmoregulation."

Lake Baikal in Siberia is not only the world's largest and most biologically diverse lake, but it has exceptionally strong seasonal structure in ecosystem dynamics that may be dramatically affected by fluctuations in seasonal timing. We applied time-frequency analysis to a near-continuous, 58-year record of water temperature from Lake Baikal to examine how seasonality in the lake has fluctuated over the past half century and to infer underlying mechanisms. On decadal scales, the timing of seasonal onset strongly corresponds with deviation in the zonal wind intensity as described by length of day (LOD); on shorter scales, these temperature patterns shift in concert with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Importantly, the connection between ENSO and Lake Baikal is gated by the cool and warm periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Large-scale climatic phenomena affecting Siberia are apparent in Lake Baikal surface water temperature data, dynamics resulting from jet stream and storm track variability in central Asia and across the Northern Hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W1982489891,"To evaluate the role of cellular infiltrates in CNS demyelination in immunocompetent mice, we have used a model of multiple sclerosis (MS) in which different strains of mice are infected with a recombinant HSV-1 expressing IL-2. Histologic examination of the mice infected with HSV-IL-2 demonstrates that natural killer cells, dendritic cells, B cells, and CD25 (IL-2rα) do not play any role in the HSV-IL-2-induced demyelination. T cell depletion, T cell knockout and T cell adoptive transfer experiments suggest that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells contribute to HSV-IL-2-induced CNS demyelination with CD8+ T cells being the primary inducers. In the adoptive transfer studies, all of the transferred T cells irrespective of their CD25 status at the time of transfer were positive for expression of FoxP3 and depletion of FoxP3 blocked CNS demyelination by HSV-IL-2. The expression levels of IL-12p35 relative to IL-12p40 differed in BM-derived macrophages infected with HSV-IL-2 from those infected with wild-type HSV-1. HSV-IL-2-induced demyelination was blocked by injecting HSV-IL-2-infected mice with IL-12p70 DNA. This study demonstrates that suppression of the IL-12p70 function of macrophages by IL-2 causes T cells to become auto-aggressive. Interruption of this immunoregulatory axis results in demyelination of the optic nerve, the spinal cord and the brain by autoreactive T cells in the HSV-IL-2 mouse model of MS."

Hrs (Vps27 in yeast) is associated with STAM (Hse1 in yeast) (14Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 14: 3675-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because Hrs and STAM complexes recruit ESCRT-I during the process for endosomal sorting of ubiquitylated cargo or receptor proteins, these complexes are sometimes referred to as ESCRT-0 (19Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Nature. 2009; 458: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Mutations of the UIM domain of Hrs abrogate its ability to bind to ubiquitylated proteins (20Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and consequently prevent ubiquitylated cargo proteins from being sorted into the vacuolar lumen (21Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Hrs appears to function as a critical transporter in the early stage of ubiquitin-dependent endosomal sorting. IL-2 is a cytokine that is mainly produced by T cells and promotes T cell growth, differentiation, and activation of various types of hematopoietic cells through its interactions with IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) complexes. Functional IL-2R complexes are composed of α, β, and γc chains or β and γc chains, indicating that the β and γc chains are indispensable for the formation of functional IL-2R complexes (22Sugamura K. Asao H. Kondo M. Tanaka N. Ishii N. Ohbo K. Nakamura M. Takeshita T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We previously found a direct interaction between bacterially expressed IL-2Rβ and Hrs, indicating that this binding is independent of ubiquitin (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an IL-2Rβ mutant lacking the Hrs binding region exhibited impaired endosomal sorting to LAMP1-positive late endosomes, and the degradation rate of the IL-2Rβ mutant was diminished compared with that of wild-type IL-2Rβ (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These findings led us to propose the following two hypotheses; 1) there is a group of cytokine receptors that interact with Hrs in a ubiquitin-independent manner, because it does not follow that only IL-2Rβ interacts with Hrs in this manner, and 2) there is a motif that interacts with Hrs in the cytoplasmic region of such receptors. In the present study, we tried to identify a ubiquitin-independent Hrs binding motif present in cytokine receptors. Expression vectors containing HA-tagged wild-type Hrs (pKU-HrsHA) and its derivative mutants HrsHAd257–277 (dUIM) and HrsHAd428–466 were used (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). pME18s-IL-4Rα, which contains a human IL-4Rα cDNA, was kindly provided by S. Watanabe (The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). An expression vector for FLAG-tagged IL-4Rα (FLAG-IL4Rα) was generated by inserting the FLAG epitope (DYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) between amino acid positions Met-90 and Asp-91 in the IL-4Rα coding region of pME18s-IL4Rα using PCR. A series of IL-4Rα mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using FLAG-IL-4Rα as a template. FLAG-IL-4Rαd379, FLAG-IL-4Rαd399, FLAG-IL-4Rαd435, FLAG-IL-4Rαd400–418, FLAG-IL-4Rαd400–436, FLAG-IL-4RαmH, and FLAG-IL-4RαmA were IL-4Rα mutants with C-terminal truncations at positions 379, 399, and 435, deleted regions at positions 400–418 and 400–436, or mutations at positions 410–415 (410LFLDLL/AAADAA415) and 372–380 (372EEEEVEEE/AAAAVAAA380), respectively. Expression vectors containing FLAG-tagged wild-type IL-2Rβ (FLAG-IL-2Rβ) and its derivative mutants FLAG-IL-2Rβd268–348 and FLAG-IL-2Rβd349–410 were used (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additional IL-2Rβ mutants were created by PCR using FLAG-IL-2Rβ as a template. FLAG-IL-2RβmH1, FLAG-IL-2RβmH2, FLAG-IL-2RβmH3, FLAG-IL-2RβmA, and FLAG-IL-2RβmY were IL-2Rβ mutants with mutations at positions 336-338 (336LLL/AAA338), 365–369 (365FFFHL/AAAHA369), 407–411 (407PLQPL/AAQAA411), 389–394 (389EEDPDE/AAAPAA394) and 364–367 (364YFFF/AFFF367), respectively. pSRB5 is a human IL-2Rβ expression vector (24Takeshita T.

Non-tagged pME18s-IL-4RαmH and pSRβmH2 were also constructed by PCR using plasmids pME18s-IL4Rα and pSRβ5, respectively, as templates. pMXs-IL-4Rα, pMXs-IL-2Rα, and pMXs-IL-2Rγc were constructed by insertion of human IL-4Rα, IL-2Rα, and IL-2Rγc cDNAs, respectively, into a Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived vector, pMXs. pMXs-IL-2Rα-β269–551 and pMXs-IL-2Rα-β365–369 were generated by inserting the cytoplasmic tail (residues 269–551) and hydrophobic amino acid cluster (residues 365–369), respectively, of human IL-2Rβ at the C terminus of IL-2Rα. pMXsβ constructed by the insertion of human IL-2Rβ into pMXs was used (23Yamashita Y.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). pMXsβmHP2 and pMXs-IL-4RαmH were created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pMXsβ and pMXs-IL-4Rα, respectively, as templates. pcDNA3-HA-ubiquitin was generously provided by K. Miyazono (The University of Tokyo, Tokyo). All constructs were sequenced with an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) to verify the amino acid changes. HEK293T cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. MEFβ, MEFβ-mH2, MEF-IL4Rα, and MEF-IL4Rα-mH were stable cell clones expressing wild-type IL-2Rβ, IL-2RβmH2 mutant, wild-type IL-4Rα, and IL-4RαmH mutant, respectively. To introduce these genes into MEF cells, we used a pMXs retrovirus vector system (kindly provided by T. Kitamura, The University of Tokyo) and obtained single clones by the limiting dilution method. The mouse IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line BAF-B03 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% conditioned medium derived from WEHI-3 cell line cultures (as a source of IL-3), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. BAFβ, BAFβ-mH2, BAF-IL-4Rα, and BAF-IL-4Rα-mH were stable cell clones expressing wild-type IL-2Rβ, IL-2RβmH2 mutant, wild-type IL-4Rα, and IL-4RαmH mutant, respectively. Each gene and a hygromycin-resistance gene were co-introduced by electroporation into BAF-B03 cells, and positive clones were selected by their hygromycin resistance and the limiting dilution method. Cell surface marker expressions were examined by flow cytometry. Cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 10% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min on ice and then incubated with an anti-IL-2Rβ monoclonal antibody (TU11) (25Suzuki J. Takeshita T. Ohbo K. Asao H. Tada K. Sugamura K. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or anti-IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody (MAB230) (R&D Systems) for 30 min on ice. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (MP Biomedicals) for 30 min on ice. After washing, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS before analysis using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (14Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg of each vector using a calcium phosphate precipitation method and then lysed with Nonidet P-40 cell extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 mm aprotinin). After preclearing, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with various antibodies immobilized on Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with a buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate), boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated with various primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, washed, and incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) at room temperature for 1 h. After a thorough washing, the positive signals were visualized using the ImmobilonTM Western substrate (Millipore). The primary antibodies utilized were: rabbit anti-HA, anti-IL-2Rβ (C20), anti-IL-4Rα (C20), rabbit anti-STAT5 (C17), and rabbit anti-phospho-STAT6 (Y641) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-STAT6 antibody and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY100) (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) (Sigma), rabbit anti-phospho-STAT5 antibody (EPITOMICS), and rat anti-Hrs monoclonal antibody (Imos-1) (14Asao H.

Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature or iced methanol for 5 min on ice, and incubated with 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. For immunostaining, the cells were incubated with various primary antibodies at 30 °C for 1 h, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-rat IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488, Alexa 594, and FITC, respectively (Molecular Probes)) at 30 °C for 1 h. The coverslips were washed 5 times with PBS and mounted on glass slides with glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine. Fluorescence images were captured using a confocal microscope (TCS SP2 (Leica) or LSM EXCITER (Carl Zeiss)). The primary antibodies utilized were: rabbit anti-IL-2Rβ antibody (C20), rabbit anti-IL-4Rα antibody (C20), mouse anti-IL-2Rβ antibody (TU11), mouse anti-IL-4Rα antibody (MAB230), rabbit anti-Hrs antibody (14Asao H.

Tozawa H. Hayami M. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 29: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), rat anti-IL-2Rγc antibody (TUGh4) (27Ishii N. Takeshita T. Kimura Y. Tada K. Kondo M. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) monoclonal antibody (generously provided by T. Kobayashi, RIKEN Advanced Science Institute, Saitama, Japan). A His-tagged Hrs (His-Hrs) expression vector was constructed by insertion of wild-type Hrs into pCOLD® (TaKaRa). GST-tagged IL-2Rβ (GST-IL-2Rβcy) and IL-4Rα (GST-IL-4Rαcy) expression vectors were generated by ligating the cytoplasmic tails of IL-2Rβ (amino acids 296–551) and IL-4Rα (amino acids 257–825), respectively, into pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare). GST-IL-2RβcymH2 and GST-IL-4RαcymH were created by PCR using GST-IL-2Rβcy and GST-IL-4Rαcy, respectively, as templates. The BL21 strain of Escherichia coli was used to express the proteins, and the His-Hrs and GST fusion proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare), respectively. To investigate the interactions between Hrs and IL-2Rβ or IL-4Rα in vitro, glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads containing the immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated with His-Hrs in a buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) at 30 °C for 15 min. The beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA), and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Anti-IL-2Rβ antibody (TU-11) and anti-IL-4Rα antibody (MAB230) were radiolabeled with Na125I (MP Biomedicals) by the chloramine-T method. Recombinant IL-2 (Shionogi Co.) and recombinant IL-4 (PeproTech) were radiolabeled with Na125I using a modified iodogen method (28Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar). The specific activities of 125I-TU-11, 125I-MAB230, 125I-IL-2, and 125I-IL-4 were 4.8 × 106, 4.7 × 106, 2.0 × 106, and 9.5 × 105 dpm/pmol, respectively. For internalization assays, cells (2 × 106) were incubated with PBS, 10% FBS containing an 125I-labeled antibody or ligand at 0 °C for 15 min. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, resuspended in RPMI/10% FBS, and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for specified times. After centrifugation of the cell suspensions, the culture supernatants were collected, and the cell pellets were treated with chilled glycine buffer (200 mm glycine, pH 2.2, 150 mm NaCl) on ice for 10 min. The radioactivities of the culture supernatant fractions, acid-removable glycine buffer fractions, and acid-unremovable cell precipitates were counted. For degradation assays, cells (2 × 106) were incubated with PBS, 10% FBS containing an 125I-labeled antibody or ligand at 0 °C for 15 min and washed with a cross-linking buffer (PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.3). To cross-link cell surface receptors with the 125I-labeled components, the cells were incubated with 300 μm dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) in the cross-linking buffer on ice for 10 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, resuspended in RPMI, 10% FBS, and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for the specified times. After centrifugation of the cell suspensions, the radioactivities of the culture supernatants and cell pellets were counted. The culture supernatants were further treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The radioactivities of the TCA-soluble fractions were counted. Quantification of colocalization images captured with an LSM EXCITER confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) was carried out using the ZEN2009 software (Carl Zeiss). Confocal images of single cells were captured randomly (carefully avoiding signal saturation), and each image was redistributed into 0–255 intensity levels. The fluorescence signals of more than 100 intensity levels per pixel were counted (29Gillooly D.J. Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 120: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies utilized were: rabbit anti-IL-2Rβ antibody (C20), rabbit anti-IL-4Rα antibody (C20), rat anti-mouse LAMP1 monoclonal antibody (1D4B), and mouse anti-LBPA monoclonal antibody. We previously found that IL-2Rβ interacts with Hrs in a ubiquitin-independent manner (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, analyses of the cytoplasmic regions of both IL-2Rβ and another cytokine receptor that interacts with Hrs in the same manner will contribute to the identification of an Hrs binding motif in the ubiquitin-independent Hrs binding regions of the receptors. The receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 utilize the IL-2Rγc chain as an essential subunit (14Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T.

Takeshita T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that these receptors may have similar biological and biochemical characters for endosomal sorting. Therefore, we selected the IL-4 receptor α chain (IL-4Rα) and examined this possibility. The UIM domain of Hrs is necessary for ubiquitin binding and sorting of ubiquitylated cargo proteins into the MVB pathway (16Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 20Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 21Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). We previously reported that a UIM-deleted Hrs mutant can bind to IL-2Rβ (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Accordingly, to examine whether the UIM-deleted mutant can bind to IL-4Rα, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays. Human embryonic kidney-derived (HEK) 293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged IL-4Rα or IL-2Rβ and Hrs expression vectors (Fig. 1A). Lysates of the HEK293T cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-Hrs antibody. Similar to IL-2Rβ, wild-type Hrs and the UIM-deleted mutant were clearly coimmunoprecipitated with IL-4Rα (Fig. 1B). We also previously reported that amino acids 428–466 of Hrs are a key domain for its ubiquitin-independent binding to IL-2Rβ (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The association of Hrs lacking amino acids 428–466 with IL-4Rα was drastically reduced, similar to the case for IL-2Rβ (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the manner of IL-4Rα binding to Hrs is similar to that of IL-2Rβ. To define the region of IL-4Rα required for its interaction with Hrs, we constructed IL-4Rα mutants truncated at amino acids 379, 399, and 435 (Fig. 2A) and investigated their binding abilities toward Hrs by coimmunoprecipitation analyses (Fig. 2B). Hrs binding was clearly detected in the lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with the IL-4Rα mutant comprising amino acids 1–435 (d435) but was markedly reduced after coimmunoprecipitation with the mutants comprising amino acids 1–379 (d379) and 1–399 (d399). These observations suggested that amino acids 400–435 include an important region for Hrs binding. Further experiments revealed that deletion mutants lacking amino acids 400–418 (d400–418) and 400–436 (d400–436) (Fig. 2A) were hardly able to bind to Hrs (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest the possibility that there is an amino acid cluster or motif for Hrs binding within amino acids 400–418. We then aligned the amino acid sequences of human, bovine, swine, horse, rat, and mouse IL-4Rα and found a hydrophobic amino acid cluster within amino acids 400–418 (Fig. 2C). In addition, we detected an acidic cluster (amino acids 372–380) (Fig. 2C) that is often identified as a binding motif between proteins during endosomal sorting (1Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). We constructed an mH mutant in which the hydrophobic amino acids were substituted with alanine within residues 410–415 and an mA mutant in which the acidic amino acids were substituted with alanine within residues 372–380. Although significant binding was observed between Hrs and the mA mutant, an association of the mH mutant with Hrs was barely detectable (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, we aligned the amino acid sequences of human and other mammalian IL-2Rβ proteins and found three hydrophobic clusters and one acidic amino acid cluster (Fig. 3A). We then substituted the hydrophobic amino acids in the three hydrophobic amino acid clusters in IL-2Rβ with alanine and generated the mH1, mH2, and mH3 mutants with mutations located at residues 336–338, 365–369, and 407–411, respectively (Fig. 3B). In addition, we substituted the acidic amino acids of the Hrs binding region in IL-2Rβ with alanine and generated the mA mutant with mutations located at residues 389–394 (Fig. 3B). The deletion mutant lacking residues 349–410 was previously reported as an IL-2Rβ mutant lacking Hrs binding ability (23Yamashita Y. Kojima K. Tsukahara T. Agawa H. Yamada K. Amano Y. Kurotori N. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Takeshita T. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mH2 and d349–410 mutants were completely unable to bind to Hrs, although the mH1, mH3, and mA mutants strongly bound to Hrs (Fig. 3C). Thus, one of the three hydrophobic amino acid clusters is involved in the interactions between these proteins, suggesting that a steric structure beside the cluster may play an important part in Hrs binding. We further generated an mY mutant in which tyros"

In humans, a linkage between remembering the past and imagining the future has been recognised. While chimpanzees can plan for the future, their episodic-like memory has hardly been investigated. We tested chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with an adapted food-caching paradigm. They observed the baiting of two locations amongst four and chose one after a given delay (15 min, 1 h or 5 h). We used two combinations of food types, a preferred and a less preferred food that disappeared at different rates. The subjects had to base their choices on the time elapsed since baiting, and on their memory of which food was where. They could recover either their preferred food or the one that remained present. All animals failed to obtain the preferred or present foods above chance levels. They were like-wise unsuccessful at choosing baited cups above chance levels. The subjects, thus, failed to use any feature of the baiting events to guide their choices. Nonetheless, their choices were not random, but the result of a developed location-based association strategy. Choices in the second half of the study correlated with the rewards obtained at each location in the first half of the study, independent from the choices made for each location in the first half of the study. This simple location-based strategy yielded a fair amount of food. The animals' failure to remember the what-where-when in the presented set-up may be due to the complexity of the task, rather than an inability to form episodic-like memories, as they even failed to remember what was where after 15 minutes."

https://openalex.org/W2000859644,"Sensorimotor activity has been shown to play a key role in functional outcome after extensive brain damage. This study was aimed at assessing the influence of sensorimotor experience through subject-environment interactions on the time course of both lesion and gliosis volumes as well as on the recovery of forelimb sensorimotor abilities following focal cortical injury. The lesion consisted of a cortical compression targeting the forepaw representational area within the primary somatosensory cortex of adult rats. After the cortical lesion, rats were randomly subjected to various postlesion conditions: unilateral C5-C6 dorsal root transection depriving the contralateral cortex from forepaw somatosensory inputs, standard housing or an enriched environment promoting sensorimotor experience and social interactions. Behavioral tests were used to assess forelimb placement during locomotion, forelimb-use asymmetry, and forepaw tactile sensitivity. For each group, the time course of tissue loss was described and the gliosis volume over the first postoperative month was evaluated using an unbiased stereological method. Consistent with previous studies, recovery of behavioral abilities was found to depend on post-injury experience. Indeed, increased sensorimotor activity initiated early in an enriched environment induced a rapid and more complete behavioral recovery compared with standard housing. In contrast, severe deprivation of peripheral sensory inputs led to a delayed and only partial sensorimotor recovery. The dorsal rhizotomy was found to increase the perilesional gliosis in comparison to standard or enriched environments. These findings provide further evidence that early sensory experience has a beneficial influence on the onset and time course of functional recovery after focal brain injury."
