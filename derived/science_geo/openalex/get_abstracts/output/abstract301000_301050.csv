https://openalex.org/W2055198216,"A new form of solid germanium, of greater density than ordinary cubic germanium, can be formed by compressing cubic germanium at pressures exceeding 120 kilobars and reducing the pressure back to that of the atmosphere. The crystal structure is tetragonal, with a equal to 5.93 angstroms and c, to 6.98; 12 atoms per unit cell; and theoretical density, 5.91 grams per cubic centimeter. Electrically it behaves like a semiconductor. At temperatures above 200° C it reverts rather rapidly to the cubic form."
https://openalex.org/W2019233420,"A chemotactic response of the zoospores of a soil-inhabiting plant pathogenic fungus, Phytophthora cinnamomi, for roots of avocado seedlings was observed. The chemotaxis of the zoospores and chemotropy of their germ tubes were directly related to infection and disease production. Indications were obtained of specificity of the pathogen-attracting root exudate, and interesting implications are evident with regard to mechanisms of invasion and pathogenicity, and to disease resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2094202999,Radiocarbon-dated samples show that the Connecticut coast has submerged about 9 feet in the last 3000 years and about 33 feet in the last 7000 years. The rate of submergence is similar to rates reported from other coasts. The finding strengthens the hypothesis that a worldwide postglacial rise of sea level is the cause.

https://openalex.org/W1989511175,"Virgin females of Byrsotria fumigata (Guérin) and several other species of Blattidae produce volatile substances which attract males and release in them characteristic precopulatory behavior. The removal of the corpora allata from females shortly after the imaginal molt results in a failure of production of sex attractant, as assayed by male behavior. Implantation of corpora allata can effect recovery."

Seed production and seed viability were not significantly different in fruit from flowers pollinated by these agents. Pollination is not a limiting factor in saguaro repopulation."

https://openalex.org/W183203358,"S>An examination of low-frequency pressure waves generated by large thermonuclear explosions provided data on the relation of air wave propagation to atmospheric structure. These waves can be detected days after the time of detonation. Because these waves travel under the joint influence of the acoustic properties of the atmosphere and gravity, they are called acoustic-gravity waves, in distinction to pure acoustic waves and pure gravity waves. Information as to how they are propagated and detected as well as the theory behind these processes were included in order to predict theoretically the observed properties of the waves described and to gain an understanding of the mechanisms by which the waves propagate. Methods of making frequency analyses with respect to seismograms were applied to the analysis of pressure records from nuclear explosions. (C.E.S.)"
https://openalex.org/W1972714066,Electron-microscope studies of the interpseudotracheal papillae of the blowfly Phormia regina (Meigen) revealed that each papilla contains four nerve fibers. The nerve fibers are encased in a cuticular sheath located in the lumen of the papilla inside the vacuole of the trichogen cell.
https://openalex.org/W2070067285,"Pectic and cellulolytic enzymes caused browning and maceration of capsules of susceptible varieties of castor bean but not of resistant varieties. Results of tests in which pericarp tissue of the capsule was treated with vanillin and H(2)SO(4) and with an aqueous solution of FeCl(3) and K(3)Fe(CN)(6) showed that resistance to the hydrolytic enzymes was correlated with both a low concentration of flavanols and related compounds and the presence of oxidized compounds in injured tissue. Resistance appeared to be due to inactivation of pectic, cellulolytic, and other hydrolytic enzymes by oxidation products of phenolic compounds. The biochemical tests made rapid measurement of resistance possible."

Its probable terrestrial age is also discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1999254139,"IN an attempt to obtain uncontaminated slide cultures of various fungi in the biological laboratories of the University of Pittsburgh, where a sterile chamber is not available and where conditions are as yet particularly unfavorable because of unplastered walls and many cross-draughts, a technique was employed which permitted all stages of typical growth on one slide and also made available a slide culture particularly satisfactory for permanent mounting. Microscope slides were sterilized in 30 x 140 mm test-tubes, which were ordered from a local supply house to fit the regulation size slides. Sterile agar medium, tubed in quantities of 3 to 5 cc, was melted and cooled to the point of gelation. The agar was shaken to break up any lumps which were forming; the plug was removed, the mouth of the tube flamed, and the agar poured over the sterile slide in a similarly flamed tube. As the agar flowed down the slide it hardened and formed an uneven layer on which several light inoculations were made. A very dilute suspension of spores in the agar to be poured was sometimes substituted for the latter step. After about forty-eight hours of incubation at room temperature, the agar film was usually dry enough to permit the elimination of drying before mounting. The *unevenness of the film allowed for all stages of growth from spore germination to spore formation. Plasmolysis was exhibited only at the center of old colonies, or where the agar layer was insufficiently thick. No difference was observed between slides incubated without the addition of sterile water to the tube and those incubated with several cubic centimeters. A simple technique, recommended by Henrici,' was used for permanent mounting. After fixation for several minutes in a solution of 100 cc 50 per cent. alcohol, 6.5 cc formalin, and 2.5 cc glacial acetic acid, a change was made to 35 per cent. alcohol and then to distilled water. Staining five minutes in an acid dye was followed by washing in distilled water until all the stain was removed from the agar. The slide was then dried in air overnight and mounted in balsam."

https://openalex.org/W2002858932,"Summarizing, one can say that the construction of ultrahigh-energy accelerators will be justifiable even at presently predictable costs. There is little doubt that eventually physicists will push into the domain of superintensity as well as that of superenergy. If they do this, it will be because the information that will then become available will be needed in order to formulate a more complete picture of nature. For the time being, we should examine the results of the 30-Gev synchrotrons in the light of their bearing on these large constructions of the future. But if these projects are to be realized in a time comparable to our lifetime, then those study projects which have become a necessary prelude to actual construction should be started now (3)."
