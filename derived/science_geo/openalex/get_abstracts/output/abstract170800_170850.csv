https://openalex.org/W2015495840,"Stem cells generate many differentiated, short-lived cell types, such as blood, skin, and sperm, throughout adult life. Stem cells maintain a long-term capacity to divide, producing daughter cells that either self-renew or initiate differentiation. Although the surrounding microenvironment or ""niche"" influences stem cell fate decisions, few signals that emanate from the niche to specify stem cell self-renewal have been identified. Here we demonstrate that the apical hub cells in the Drosophila testis act as a cellular niche that supports stem cell self-renewal. Hub cells express the ligand Unpaired (Upd), which activates the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in adjacent germ cells to specify self-renewal and continual maintenance of the germ line stem cell population."
https://openalex.org/W1973728200,"The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is thought to drive daily rhythms of behavior by secreting factors that act locally within the hypothalamus. In a systematic screen, we identified transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) as a likely SCN inhibitor of locomotion. TGF-α is expressed rhythmically in the SCN, and when infused into the third ventricle it reversibly inhibited locomotor activity and disrupted circadian sleep-wake cycles. These actions are mediated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors on neurons in the hypothalamic subparaventricular zone. Mice with a hypomorphic EGF receptor mutation exhibited excessive daytime locomotor activity and failed to suppress activity when exposed to light. These results implicate EGF receptor signaling in the daily control of locomotor activity, and identify a neural circuit in the hypothalamus that likely mediates the regulation of behavior both by the SCN and the retina."

The momentum dependence of the superconducting gap was determined on different Fermi surface sheets. The results indicate Fermi surface sheet-dependent superconductivity in this low-transition temperature multiband system and provide a description consistent with thermodynamic measurements and the anomalous de Haas-van Alphen oscillations observed in the superconducting phase. The present data suggest the importance of Fermi surface sheet-dependent superconductivity in explaining exotic superconductivity in other multiband systems with complex Fermi surface topology, such as the borides and f-electron superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W141236769,"Greenhouse gas mitigation possibilities in the agricultural and forest sector represent a complex system of interlinked strategies. To assess their true economic implementation potential, major mitigation strategies are simultaneously examined with a U.S. agricultural sector model over a large range of hypothetical carbon prices. Soil carbon sequestration through reduced tillage appears most attractive for relatively low carbon prices. Afforestation and biofuel generation, however, dominate at higher price levels. For politically feasible prices, the competitive economic contribution of all major strategies is greatly below their technical potential. However, positive environmental and social coeffects may increase the importance of agricultural mitigation policies."
https://openalex.org/W2082432262,"The energy released in low-energy chemisorption or physisorption of molecules on metal surfaces is usually expected to be dissipated by surface vibrations (phonons). Theoretical descriptions of competing electronic excitations are incomplete, and experimental observation of excited charge carriers has been difficult except at energies high enough to eject electrons from the surface. We observed reaction-induced electron excitations during gas interactions with polycrystalline silver for a variety of species with adsorption energies between 0.2 and 3.5 electron volts. The probability of exciting a detectable electron increases with increasing adsorption energy, and the measured time dependence of the electron current can be understood in terms of the strength and mechanism of adsorption."
https://openalex.org/W2099235053,"In the uterus insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling can be initiated by estradiol acting through its nuclear receptor (estrogen receptor (ER)) to stimulate the local synthesis of IGF-1. Conversely, in vitro studies have demonstrated that estradiol-independent ER transcriptional activity can be induced by IGF-1 signaling, providing evidence for a cross-talk mechanism between IGF-1 and ER. To investigate whether ERα is required for uterine responses to IGF-1 in vivo, both wild-type (WT) and ERα knockout (αERKO) mice were administered IGF-1, and various uterine responses to IGF-1 were compared. In both WT and αERKO mice, IGF-1 treatment resulted in phosphorylation of uterine IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and formation of an IGF-1R/insulin receptor substrate-1/ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling complex. In addition, IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of uterine Akt and MAPK in both WT and αERKO mice. However, IGF-1 treatment stimulated BrdUrd incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in WT uteri only. To determine whether ERα can be activated in vivo by IGF-1 signaling, transgenic mice carrying a luciferase gene driven by two estrogen response elements (ERE-luciferase mice) were utilized. Treatment of ovariectomized ERE-luciferase mice with IGF-1 resulted in an increase in uterine luciferase activity that was attenuated in the presence of the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Together these data demonstrate that 1) functional signaling proximal to IGF-1R is maintained in the αERKO mouse uterus, 2) ERα is necessary for IGF-1 induction of uterine nuclear proliferative responses, and 3) cross-talk between IGF-1R and ER signaling pathways exists in vivo.

Among the genes identified as targets for regulation by the E2/ER complex in the uterus is that encoding insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Studies have demonstrated that rodent uterine IGF-1 mRNA levels increase after exposure to E2 (1Murphy L.C. Dotzlaw H. Wong M.S. Miller T. Mrockowski B. Gong Y. Murphy L.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kapur S. Tamada H. Dey S.K. Andrews G.K. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, presumably through increasing local production of IGF-1, E2has been shown to stimulate uterine IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling as measured by tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R and the formation of a signaling complex composed of IGF-1R, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (3Richards R.G.

DiAugustine R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that IGF-1 signaling is involved in E2-induced uterine growth, and in support of this mechanism, other studies have shown that, like E2, IGF-1 can induce DNA synthesis in cells of the rodent uterus (5Ghahary A. Chakrabarti S. Murphy L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A more recent study further demonstrated a role for IGF-1 in E2-induced uterine proliferation by demonstrating that IGF-1 is required for E2-induced uterine epithelial cell mitosis (6Adesanya O.O. Zhou J. Samathanam C. Powell-Braxton L. Bondy C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3287-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In that study, DNA synthesis occurred in IGF-1 knockout (IGF-1KO) mouse uteri in response to E2. However, there was a significant decrease in the E2-stimulated mitotic index in the uterine epithelium, indicating that IGF-1 is necessary for the cells to progress properly through mitosis in response to E2. Finally, a recent study by this laboratory has confirmed that increased synthesis of uterine IGF-1 mRNA and stimulation of uterine IGF-1R signaling by E2 are ERα-dependent events (7Klotz D.M. Hewitt S.C. Korach K.S. Diaugustine R.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies have illustrated that E2, by acting through ERα, stimulates IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling and increases uterine epithelial cell mitosis in the mouse uterus. Conversely related in vitro studies have described another level of integration between the ER and IGF-1 signaling pathways by demonstrating that ER-mediated responses can be induced or increased by IGF-1. An initial study showed that, in the absence of E2, IGF-1 can stimulate the phosphorylation of ER and induce the expression of an estrogen-responsive, ERE-containing reporter construct, an effect that was blocked by antiestrogen (8Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies confirmed these findings and further showed that IGF-1 activation of the ERE-reporter construct occurred only in the presence of ER, demonstrating that IGF-1 was indeed inducing reporter gene transcription through activation of ER (9Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Pimentel M. Parker M.G. McLachlan J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). More recently, the mechanism through which IGF-1 activates ER was investigated, and it was determined that IGF-1 activation of ER is mediated, at least in part, through a mechanism involving Akt (10Martin M.B. Franke T.F. Stoica G.E. Chambon P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stoica B.A. McLemore M.S. Olivo S.E. Stoica A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4503-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, a model develops in which it appears that E2, acting through its nuclear receptor, initiates responses that include the induction of IGF-1. The IGF-1, in turn, interacts with its cognate membrane receptor to initiate a signaling cascade that involves phosphorylation-dependent kinases, such as Akt. The membrane receptor-mediated IGF-1 signaling pathway further appears to be linked to the ERα pathway via a cross-talk mechanism whereby activation of the IGF-1R can stimulate “ligand-independent” ERα-mediated responses. Recently, the ERE-luciferase mouse was described as an innovative model system for profiling the in vivo dynamics of ER activity (11Di Ciana P. Luccio G. Belcredito S. Pollio G. Vegeto E. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Maggi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This mouse has been engineered to carry a luciferase transgene that is driven by two EREs from the vitellogenin promoter upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. As a result, the luciferase gene is expressed only in response to transcriptionally active ER. In an effort to further understand the cross-talk between the IGF-1/IGF-1R and E2/ERα signaling pathways, the current study was designed to evaluate the in vivo role of ERα in IGF-1-mediated uterine responses. By utilizing both the ERα knockout (αERKO) and ERE-luciferase mouse models, we establish the requirement for ERα in IGF-1-induced uterine nuclear responses and provide in vivomolecular evidence demonstrating the existence of cross-talk between the uterine IGF-1 and ER signaling pathways. 17β-Estradiol was purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). Long R3 IGF-1, a biologically active IGF-1 derivative with low affinity for IGF-1-binding proteins, was obtained from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (Webster, TX). The following antibodies were purchased: IGF-1R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH); anti-IRS-1 and anti-p85 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); Akt, phospho Akt, p42/44 MAPK, and phospho p42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); PCNA 19A2 (Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, FL), biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA); BrdUrd (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY). All animals were handled in accordance with an approved NIEHS, National Institutes of Health animal study protocol. Adult female WT, αERKO, and ERE-luciferase mice were ovariectomized, held for 10–14 days to clear endogenous ovarian hormones, and then used in studies. Animals were either injected intraperitoneally with 20 μg/kg estradiol (E2) in saline, or a mini-osmotic pump (Alza Corporation, Palo Alto, CA; 3 days, 1 μl/h) containing 100 μl of 2.4 μg/μl-long R3 IGF-1 dissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid was implanted in the peritoneal cavity. Control animals were injected with saline. For BrdUrd incorporation and PCNA immunohistochemistry, mice were injected with BrdUrd (1 mg/mouse) 16 h after E2 or IGF-1 treatments, and uteri were collected 1 h later. A segment of each uterine horn was frozen for Western analysis, and the rest of the uterine tissue, as well as a piece of the intestine, was fixed in 10% cold formalin and processed for BrdUrd or PCNA staining. For studies utilizing ERE-luciferase mice, ovariectomized mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 50 μg/kg E2, vehicle (vegetable oil), or two injections of 200-μg-long R3 IGF-1 in 200 μl vegetable oil, with the second injection of IGF-1 given 3 h after the first injection. Uteri were collected 6 h after injection with E2 or vehicle or 3 h following the second IGF-1 injection. IGF-1 signaling components were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot procedures as previously described (7Klotz D.M. Hewitt S.C. Korach K.S. Diaugustine R.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, frozen samples of uterine horns were homogenized at 4 °C in 200 μl of solubilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml a-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 0.05 mm Na2MoO4). Homogenates were normalized for protein concentration (BCA Protein Assay, Pierce), and equivalent amounts of protein were pre-cleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of anti-mouse IGF-1R polyclonal antibody with an equal volume of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C. Antigen-antibody complexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose for 3 h and subjected to three sequential washes (Wash 1: 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5; Wash 2: 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5; Wash 3: 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5). Precipitated antigen was eluted from the protein A-Sepharose by resuspending it the pellets in Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins or uterine extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in either Tris-buffered saline with 5% bovine serum albumin for detection of IGF-1R, phosphotyrosine, Akt, phospho-Akt, p42/44 MAPK, phospho-p42/44 MAPK, and p85, or phosphate-buffered saline with 3% nonfat dry milk for detection of IRS-1. Membranes with IGF-1R immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-IRS-1, anti-p85, or anti-IGF-1R antibodies. Membranes with total uterine proteins were probed with anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-p42/44 MAPK, or anti-phospho p42/44 MAPK antibodies. Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) was used for detection of immunoreactive proteins according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immunohistochemical staining of PCNA was performed as described previously (7Klotz D.M. Hewitt S.C. Korach K.S. Diaugustine R.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The primary antibody used was anti-mouse PCNA 19A2 (Beckman Coulter), and the secondary antibody used was biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (Vector Laboratories). ExtrAvidin peroxidase (Sigma) was added and detected with the NovaRed detection system (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BrdUrd was detected using the BrdUrd staining kit from Oncogene (Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunohistochemistry for luciferase was performed as described previously (11Di Ciana P. Luccio G. Belcredito S. Pollio G. Vegeto E. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Maggi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The primary antibody used was a polyclonal anti-luciferase antibody (Sigma, 1:1800 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% goat serum and 0.3% Tween 20) for 16 h; an anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% goat serum and 0.3% Tween 20) was also used. Antibody-antigen detection was performed with the ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) according to manufacturer's specifications. Immunostaining was visualized by exposure to 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Assays for uterine luciferase activity were performed as described previously (11Di Ciana P. Luccio G. Belcredito S. Pollio G. Vegeto E. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Maggi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, uterine extracts were prepared by homogenization in 500 μl of 100 mmKPO4 lysis buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by three cycles of freezing-thawing and 30 min of microcentrifugation at maximum speed. Supernatants containing luciferase were collected, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford's assay. Luciferase enzymatic activity in tissue extracts was measured by a commercially available kit (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The light intensity was measured with a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501/16, Berthold) over 10 s and was expressed initially as relative light units over 10 s/μg proteins. Luciferase activities were analyzed by analysis-of-variance followed by post hoc analyses with the Scheffé test. One indication of estrogen activity is the wave of DNA synthesis and mitosis that occurs in the uterine epithelium following administration of hormone. [3H]thymidine incorporation has been shown to increase to a maximal level at ∼16 h following E2 treatment of ovariectomized mice (12Quarmby V.E. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that this estrogen-dependent response is negligible in the αERKO mouse (13Couse J.F. Curtis S.W. Washburn T.F. Lindzey J. Golding T.S. Lubahn D.B. Smithies O. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1441-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether IGF-1 can initiate a similar DNA synthesis response in the αERKO uterus as well as to identify the specific uterine cell types that respond to IGF-1, immunohistochemical analysis of BrdUrd incorporation was performed. As expected, E2 treatment of WT animals resulted in extensive BrdUrd incorporation in the luminal and glandular epithelium (Fig. 1 A) 16 h following hormone treatment. Long R3 IGF-1 infusion also resulted in positive BrdUrd immunoreactivity in epithelial cells. However, the response was decreased compared with that of the E2treatment group (Fig. 1 A). This confirms that IGF-1 signaling initiates an estrogen-like DNA synthesis response in the uterine epithelium and that the response to this particular method of long R3 IGF-1 treatment is less extensive than the response to E2. Uteri from αERKO mice revealed no BrdUrd staining at 16 h following exposure to E2 or long R3 IGF-1 (Fig.1 A), indicating that DNA synthesis is not induced by either E2 or IGF-1 pathways in the absence of ERα. Adjacent tissue sections from WT and αERKO uteri were also stained with antibody for PCNA as a marker for cell proliferation. As with the BrdUrd staining, both E2 and long R3 IGF-1 induced an increase in PCNA immunoreactivity in the WT uterus, whereas neither E2 nor long R3 IGF-1 treatment resulted in increased PCNA staining in the αERKO uterus (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that ERα is an integral component in the IGF-1-stimulated uterine epithelial proliferative response. When WT mice were given long R3 IGF-1 together with E2, the response did not appear to be increased compared with E2 alone (data not shown), suggesting that both of these stimuli exert their effects on DNA synthesis and PCNA expression through a common pathway. The DNA synthesis observed in the wild-type uterus following IGF-1 infusion is less robust than that observed in response to E2, suggesting that ERα may not have full transcriptional activity in the absence of estrogen ligand. Although this finding is in agreement with in vitro data showing that ERE-driven reporter and endogenous genes are not as responsive to IGF-1 as to E2 (9Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Pimentel M. Parker M.G. McLachlan J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 34Stoica A. Saceda M. Fakhro A. Joyner M. Martin M.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it should also be considered that the peak time for DNA synthesis after IGF-1 exposure may be decreased compared with the peak time for DNA synthesis following exposure to E2. To eliminate the possibility that dysfunctional IGF-1R signaling was the basis for the lack of IGF-1-induced DNA synthesis and PCNA expression in the αERKO uterus, ovariectomized mice were treated with E2 or infused with long R3 IGF-1, and uterine extracts were isolated and analyzed for IGF-1-stimulated responses. Because E2-stimulated IGF-1 production is an induced response that occurs for only a fixed amount of time (14Murphy L.J. Murphy L.C. Friesen H.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of IGF-1R can only be measured from ∼3–6 h after exposure to E2(3Richards R.G. DiAugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12002-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, for this set of experiments extracts from E2-treated animals were prepared 6 h after injection with E2, whereas IGF-1-treated uteri were prepared 16 h after continuous infusion of long R3 IGF-1. Following long R3 IGF-1 treatment and in agreement with previously published data (7Klotz D.M. Hewitt S.C. Korach K.S. Diaugustine R.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), uterine IGF-1R was tyrosine-phosphorylated in αERKO mice, confirming that the delivery of long R3 IGF-1 was effective and that the IGF-1R in the αERKO uterus was responsive to IGF-1 (Fig.2 A). Also as previously described, treatment with long R3 IGF-1 increased the formation of an IGF-1R signaling complex comprising IGF-1R, IRS-1, and p85 ((Refs. 3Richards R.G. DiAugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12002-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholarand 4Richards R.G. Walker M.P. Sebastian J. DiAugustine R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, after long R3 IGF-1 treatment, the IRS-1 associated with IGF-1R was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.2 A). None of these responses occurred in the αERKO uterus after treatment with E2 (Fig. 2, A andB). In wild-type mice IGF-1R activation and recruitment of IRS-1 and p85 occur in response to either E2 or long R3 IGF-1 infusion (data not shown; Ref. 7Klotz D.M. Hewitt S.C. Korach K.S. Diaugustine R.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), confirming that in this mouse model either E2 or IGF can induce IGF-1R activation. The p85 component associated with the IGF-1R complex is the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, and the PI 3-kinase substrate Akt is phosphorylated and activated in response to IGF-1 by this pathway (10Martin M.B. Franke T.F. Stoica G.E. Chambon P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stoica B.A. McLemore M.S. Olivo S.E. Stoica A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4503-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,15Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). To further characterize the downstream IGF-1R signaling events in the αERKO, uterine Akt phosphorylation was monitored after treatment with E2 or long R3 IGF-1. As shown in Fig.3 A, E2 treatment increased phosphorylation of Akt on Ser 473 in the WT but not the αERKO uterus, whereas IGF-1 treatment stimulated uterine Akt phosphorylation in both genotypes. This indicates that activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by IGF-1 can occur in the αERKO but that E2-initiated Akt activation requires the presence of functional ERα. Taken together these data (Figs. 2 and3 A) demonstrate that the αERKO uterus is fully responsive to IGF-1 with respect to activation of signaling events proximal to IGF-1R. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been shown to be activated by E2 in vitro (16Di Migliaccio A. Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 17Improta-Brears T. Whorton A.R. Codazzi F. York J.D. Meyer T. McDonnell D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4686-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and activation of MAPK by IGF-1 has also been demonstrated in vitro in hormone-responsive cells (18Webster J. Prager D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of ER by MAPK has been reported (19Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar, 20Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H. Notides A.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In WT uteri IGF-1 increased the phosphorylation of uterine p44/42 MAPK (Fig. 3 B). In the αERKO uteri IGF-1 also increased p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, indicating that ERα is not required for MAPK activation by IGF-1 in the uterus. A basal level of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation was observed in the control groups of both genotypes (Fig. 3 B). Phosphorylation of MAPK by E2 above basal levels did not occur in the majority of the WT samples; however, the results varied, possibly because of a suboptimal sampling time for this response after E2 treatment, and further investigation is necessary to determine the effects of E2 on MAPK activity in vivo. MAPK was not activated above basal levels by E2in any of the αERKO uterine samples. The data described in the preceding sections demonstrate that IGF-1 alone can not reproduce E2-induced effects and indicate that ERα plays an active role in IGF-1-induced proliferative responses in the uterus rather than simply a permissive role through induction of IGF-1 synthesis. To determine whether long R3 IGF-1 can activate ER in vivo, ovariectomized adult ERE-luciferase mice were treated with E2 or long R3 IGF-1. Based on the initial data described for these mice (11Di Ciana P. Luccio G. Belcredito S. Pollio G. Vegeto E. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Maggi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), uteri were removed and assayed for luciferase activity 6 h following injection of E2. Additionally, a pilot study demonstrated that 3 h after injection of IGF-1 in oil, uterine IGF-1R was tyrosine-phosphorylated; 6 h after injection uterine IGF-1R was still tyrosine-phosphorylated, although to a lesser extent (data not shown). Therefore, giving two successive injections of long R3 IGF-1, 3 h apart, was chosen as the course for administering IGF-1 for these experiments. Treatment with E2 stimulated approximately an 8-fold increase in the amount of uterine luciferase activity compared with vehicle-treated controls. Treatment with long R3 IGF-1 increased the amount of luciferase activity by ∼6-fold above vehicle-treated controls (Fig.4). To verify that in this model system the IGF-1 was indeed inducing luciferase expression through an ER-dependent mechanism, mice were simultaneously treated with long R3 IGF-1 and the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Cotreatment with ICI 182,780 abrogated the induction of luciferase activity that was observed in response to both E2 and long R3 IGF-1 (Fig. 4). As a control for both E2 and IGF-1 activity, livers from treated mice were also sampled and assayed for luciferase activity. Both E2 and IGF-1 stimulated luciferase activity in liver, and ICI inhibited this stimulation (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the IGF-1-induced activation of ER-mediated transcription measured in the ERE-luciferase mouse was comparable with that observed in response to E2, unlike the stimulation of DNA synthesis, which may suggest that in this case ER was fully activated. However, it should be recognized that treatment of ovariectomized mice with E2 or IGF-1 is a form of pharmacological manipulation, and both experiments administered IGF-1 in separate ways and at different concentrations. In addition, the luciferase response measures a single reporter gene that has been engineered for maximal induction by ER and is not comparable with the mitotic response, which is the result of modulation of many necessary components and might have varying sensitivity to the growth factor activated ER. Therefore, differences between local concentrations of E2 and IGF-1 that may arise from endogenous versus exogenous hormone sources, methods of administration, and differences in the measured response preclude any firm conclusions being drawn with respect to the potency of E2 compared with IGF-1 in the activation of ER and downstream events. The incorporation of BrdUrd and elevated expression of PCNA in response to IGF-1 were observed only in the uterine epithelium (Fig. 1). To identify which cells within the uterus were responding to long R3 IGF-1 by inducing ER/ERE-driven luciferase expression, immunohistochemical localization of luciferase was performed. In agreement with the stimulation of DNA synthesis and expression of PCNA, long R3 IGF-1 induced expression of luciferase in the epithelial cells of the uterus (Fig. 5). To confirm that the long R3 IGF-1 treatment was activating signaling components of the IGF-1 pathway and, importantly, that ICI was not interfering with that activation, separate sections of the same uteri used in the above experiment were examined as described earlier. As expected, both E2 and IGF-1 stimulated IGF-1R and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6, A andB), confirming that IGF-1 signaling proximal to the IGF-1R was activated. At this 6-h time point, only residual IGF-1R phosphorylation in response to E2 could be observed. In the presence of ICI 182,780 IGF-1 also induced the activation of IGF-1R and AKT (Fig. 6, A and B), demonstrating that inhibition of IGF-1-stimulated luciferase activity by ICI 182,780 was mediated through ER antagonism and was not a result of interference between ICI 182,780 and proximal IGF-1 signaling events. ICI inhibited E2-induced activation of IGF-1R, presumably through inhibition of IGF-1 gene expression. Interestingly, ICI did not inhibit E2-stimulated Akt activity, indicating that E2may activate Akt through more than one mechanism, at least one of which may be IGF-1-independent and perhaps another of which is not affected by ICI inhibition of ER. The apparent increase in IGF-1R phosphorylation in the uteri of mice co-treated with IGF-1 and ICI, compared with IGF-1 alone, is most likely because of increased immunoprecipitation of IGF-1R and interanimal variation in the particular sample presented here (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). Growth factors such as EGF and IGF-1 are believed to be an integral component in the growth response of the rodent uterus to E2. Expression of EGF and IGF-1 as well as IGF-1R signaling can be induced by E2 (21Murphy L.J. Ghahary A. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Gardner R.M.

Studies utilizing the IGF-1 knockout mouse model have shown that although DNA synthesis occurs in the uterine epithelium in response to E2, there is a significant decrease in mitotic index after E2 treatment, indicating that estrogen must induce IGF-1 expression for a full uterine mitotic response to occur (6Adesanya O.O.

It is unknown, however, whether IGF-1 replacement would rescue normal mitosis in this model. A transgenic mouse that overexpresses IGFBP-1, resulting in lower serum IGF-1 levels, and possibly lower levels of locally produced IGF-1 in the uterus, was also shown to have an impaired uterine response to E2 (26Rajkumar K. Dheen T. Krsek M. Murphy L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both the thymidine incorporation and uterine weight increases that occur in response to E2 were blunted in IGFBP-1-overexpressing mice compared with nontransgenic mice. Although both of these studies underscore the importance of IGF-1 for a complete uterine response to E2, they provide no information about the specific role of IGF-1 in mediating the uterotropic effects of E2. The αERKO mouse provides an appropriate model for the expansion of parallel studies of the converse role of ERα in growth factor action to an in vivo system. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that treatment with EGF alone stimulated an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in the wild-type but not in the αERKO mouse uterus, providing in vivo evidence that ERα is necessary for growth factor-induced uterine DNA synthesis (32Curtis S.W. Washburn T. Sewall C. DiAugustine R. Lindzey J. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12626-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that both IGF-1 and E2 are capable of eliciting proliferative responses in the uterus. Furthermore, the data establish that ERα is required for a proper response to either stimulus and that the IGF-1 and ERα pathways have separate yet interacting functions. In cell culture models with defined and controlled components, both EGF and IGF-1 have been shown to stimulate ERα-mediated responses independent of E2 (8Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

These studies described the ability of growth factors to activate ER(α), allowing for the hypothesis that one role of the growth factors in the normal physiologic response of the uterus to E2 may be the amplification of ER signaling whereby signaling through growth factor membrane receptors may result in further or more persistent activation of ERα. The recent generation of the ERE-luciferase mouse model has provided a unique tool for examining the physiological activity of estrogen receptors in vivo. By using this model system in the present study, we are able to report the novel observation that, in agreement with the previously described in vitro studies, IGF-1 can indeed activate ER-mediated transcription of a target genein vivo. This transgenic mouse should provide a wealth of information regarding the role of growth factor signaling pathways in ligand-independent activation of ER as well as provide a model system for the dissection of the molecular mechanisms involved the activation of ER by growth factors. The identification of Akt as an integral component in the mechanism of ERα activation by IGF-1 is described in a recent report demonstrating that Akt is activated by IGF-1 and is required for stimulation of ERα functions in MCF-7 cells and COS-1 cells (10Martin M.B. Franke T.F. Stoica G.E. Chambon P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stoica B.A. McLemore M.S. Olivo S.E. Stoica A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4503-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). An additional study described the role of PI 3-kinase in ligand-independent activation of ERα, providing data suggesting that PI 3-kinase activates ERα through both Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms (33Campbell R.A. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Patel N.M. Constantinidou D. Ali S. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9817-9824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The failure of DNA synthesis to occur in the αERKO uterus even after full activation of proximal IGF-1R signaling by IGF-1, including Akt activation, suggests that the requirement of ERα for the mechanism to progress may be as a target for Akt, as the recentin vitro study indicates (10Martin M.B. Franke T.F. Stoica G.E. Chambon P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stoica B.A. McLemore M.S. Olivo S.E. Stoica A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4503-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The data herein do not demonstrate activation of MAPK by E2; however, the time after E2 exposure at which MAPK activation was measured may not be optimal. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that activation of MAPK by E2 occurred in a rapid fashion and returned to basal levels within 1 h after exposure (16Di Migliaccio A. Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 17Improta-Brears T. Whorton A.R. Codazzi F. York J.D. Meyer T. McDonnell D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4686-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Based on the results reported here that demonstrate the increased activation of uterine MAPK in response to IGF-1 in both the wild-type and αERKO uterus, a requirement for the MAPK signaling pathway in the activation of ER by IGF-1 has not been ruled out. Estrogen is a potent mitogen in the mouse uterus, and previous studies with the αERKO have shown that ERα is essential for hormone-initiated proliferation (7Klotz D.M. Hewitt S.C. Korach K.S. Diaugustine R.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Couse J.F. Curtis S.W. Washburn T.F. Lindzey J. Golding T.S. Lubahn D.B. Smithies O. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1441-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, it is apparent that the role of ERα in this mechanism is not merely to induce growth factors such as IGF-1, which then lead to proliferative responses. IGF-1 infusion does not restore uterine responses in the absence of ERα even in the presence of a functional IGF-1 signaling cascade, underscoring the importance of ERα as an active mediator of IGF-1 and possibly other growth factor proliferative actions in the uterus. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that IGF-1/ER cross-talk occurs in vivo by demonstrating that IGF-1 alone can activate ER-mediated transcription in the mouse uterus. Based on the data presented, we hypothesize that uterine DNA synthesis can be initiated by activation of ERα either directly by binding E2 or indirectly by IGF-1R pathway-mediated activation of ERα (Fig. 7). When E2 does not induce IGF-1 ligand, as in the IGF-1 knockout, ERα can still be activated directly by E2 and DNA synthesis occurs. In the αERKO not only is IGF-1 induction in response to E2disrupted but also ERα is not present as a target of either E2 binding or IGF-1R signaling; therefore, neither molecule can induce DNA synthesis. These observations, combined with those reported here in the ERE-luciferase mouse, demonstrating in vivo activation of ER by IGF-1, illustrate the role of ERα as a target for both E2 and IGF-1 and suggest that ERα activation by either mechanism is essential for a uterine proliferative response to occur. With respect to the relevance of these findings to normal in vivo physiology, it is important to consider the role of IGF-1 in disease. In light of the present findings demonstrating that IGF-1 can activate ER transactivation functions in the absence of E2, it may be worthwhile to consider that IGF-1 and perhaps other growth factors may affect endocrine-related cancers, even in the absence of steroid hormones, by circumventing the need for the hormone to elicit a proliferative response in target cells. It will, therefore, be both interesting and important to compare the gene expression profiles elicited by IGF-1 and E2 to determine whether IGF-1 induces unique genes or is simply one mediator of E2-stimulated gene expression. Additionally, a comparison of IGF-1 activation of genes regulated by ER through EREs to those regulated by ER through AP-1 sites will be informative with respect to the role of IGF-1, and potentially other growth factors, in the activation of ER-mediated gene expression. All three model systems mentioned here, the IGF-1KO, the αERKO, and the ERE-luciferase mice, can be outstanding tools for comparisons that will help broaden our understanding of the role(s) of IGF-1 in E2-induced responses in target tissues in the context of both normal and neoplastic conditions.

Barbara Davis and Sandra Dunn for thoughtful reading of and suggestions on the manuscript."

Activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) results in the phosphorylation of Peri A and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), the predominant lipase in adipocytes, with concurrent stimulation of adipocyte lipolysis. To investigate the relative contributions of Peri A and HSL in basal and PKA-mediated lipolysis, we utilized NIH 3T3 fibroblasts lacking Peri A and HSL but stably overexpressing acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) and fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1). When incubated with exogenous fatty acids, ACS1/FATP1 cells accumulated 5 times more triacylglycerol (TG) as compared with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Adenoviral-mediated expression of Peri A in ACS1/FATP1 cells enhanced TG accumulation and inhibited lipolysis, whereas expression of HSL fused to green fluorescent protein (GFPHSL) reduced TG accumulation and enhanced lipolysis. Forskolin treatment induced Peri A hyperphosphorylation and abrogated the inhibitory effect of Peri A on lipolysis. Expression of a mutated Peri AΔ3 (Ser to Ala substitutions at PKA consensus sites Ser-81, Ser-222, and Ser-276) reduced Peri A hyperphosphorylation and blocked constitutive and forskolin-stimulated lipolysis.

Stuhlsatz-Krouper S. Schaffer J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these proteins have been shown to increase long chain fatty acid (FA) import when expressed in mammalian cells (17Gargilulo C. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S. Schaffer J. J.

Although the exact mechanism of FA transport remains the subject of active investigation, ACS1 and possibly FATP1 contribute to formation of acyl-CoA esters upon cellular FA import (19Coe N. Smith A.

The present study demonstrates that in the ACS1/FATP1 cells, the exogenous fatty acids are stored within lipid droplets as TG.

For FA uptake assays, cells were seeded in 12-well plates, grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 45 mm glucose supplemented with 10% calf serum, and transduced with adenoviruses (as described below), followed by incubation for 48 h with 0.4 μCi/ml [14C]oleic acid in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5 mm glucose containing 10% calf serum and 1% fatty acid-free albumin bound to palmitic and oleic acid (120 μm of each). Incubation was terminated by discarding the labeling media and washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline. Mutagenesis of putative PKA recognition sites was carried out using Muta-Gene Phagemid in Vitro Mutagenesis version 2 (Bio-Rad).

Adenoviruses were amplified in HEK 293 cells and purified and concentrated to 1012plaque-forming units/ml by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Cells were transduced by incubation with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 plaque-forming units/cell. Adenoviruses expressing either green fluorescent protein or β-galactosidase were used as controls (Ad control). All adenoviruses used contained a cytomegalovirus promoter to express the cloned cDNA. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted by two 15-min incubations with 250 μl of hexane:isopropanol (3:2, v/v) at 4 °C. Solvent-containing lipid was dried at room temperature, and lipids were dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform. [14C]Triacylglycerol oleate was resolved by TLC using heptane:diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (90:30:1, v/v/v) and visualized by iodine (23Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar).14C-labeled TG spots were cut into vials and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. TG is expressed in nmol/mg protein and represents the average of triplicate values. NIH 3T3 ACS1/FATP1 cells were transduced with Ad control or Ad GFPHSL as described above. The next day, cells were transduced with Ad control or Ad Peri A, followed by incubation with FAs. 48 h later, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 4 h in the absence or presence of 20 μm forskolin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5 mm glucose + 2% FA-free bovine serum albumin. Media were collected, and glycerol was measured as an index of lipolysis. Glycerol content of the incubation medium was determined using a colorimetric assay (GPO-Trinder; Sigma). After lipid extraction, proteins were extracted as described previously (21Souza S.C. Yamamoto M. Franciosa M. Lien P. Greenberg A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and quantified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Total lysates (20 μg/sample) were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted as described previously (21Souza S.C. Yamamoto M. Franciosa M. Lien P. Greenberg A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For determination of Peri A immunofluorescence, cells were cultured in 35-mm coverslip-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and infected as described above. After treatment, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed, and treated with anti-Peri A polyclonal antibody (PREK antibody; 1:100 dilution) and a donkey anti-rabbit Cy-5-labeled antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). Neutral lipids were stained with Nile red (1 μm) (Molecular Probes) (24Greenspan P. Mayer E.P. Fowler S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). Cy-5 fluorescence imaging was assessed as described previously (25Moitoso de Vargas L. Sobolewski J. Siegel R. Moss L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26573-26577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean + S.E. Data were analyzed by using three-way analysis of variance with the presence or absence of forskolin, Ad GFPHSL, and Ad Peri A as study factors. Treatment effects were considered statistically significant if the attained significance levels (p values) were ≤0.05. When there were no statistically significant interactions between forskolin, Ad GFPHSL, and Ad PeriA, the overall (main) effects of each treatment were examined. When interactions were detected, two approaches were considered. First, the effect of one factor was examined in the presence and absence of the other factors. Second, different combinations of factors were regarded as distinct treatments in a one-way analysis of variance, and differences between these treatment means were evaluated post hoc by using the Tukey's honestly significant differences procedure for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed by using SYSTAT version 9.01 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of both ACS1 and FATP1 in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in a 25-fold increase in FA uptake (17Gargilulo C. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S. Schaffer J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the fate of the FAs inside the cell, NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3 ACS1/FATP1 cells were incubated with 14C-labeled FAs for 48 h. Analysis of the neutral lipids formed demonstrated that the vast majority of the incubated oleate and palmitate was incorporated into TG (>95%; data not shown) in both cell lines and that ACS1/FATP1 cells accumulated 5-fold more TG than parental NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that FA loading increased TG accumulation in ACS1/FATP1 cells. To understand the mechanisms involved in TG accumulation, we examined the endogenous expression of the perilipins and ADRP, a ubiquitous lipid droplet marker. ADRP localizes to the surface of lipid droplets and is thought to have a role in regulating lipid droplet metabolism (26Brasaemle D. Barber T. Wolins N. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Frolov A. Petrescu A. Atshaves B. So P. Gratton E. Serrero G. Schroeder F. J. Biol.

Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed that ACS1/FATP1 cells expressed ADRP at low levels in the absence of FAs and at ∼10-fold greater levels when cells were incubated with FAs for 48 h (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, ACS1/FATP1 cells did not express endogenous Peri A (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 2) or Peri B (data not shown) in the presence or absence of FAs. ACS1/FATP1 cells were therefore transduced with Ad Peri A. Western blotting of protein lysates revealed that in the absence of FA loading, Peri A expression was easily detectable as compared with nontransduced cells (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lane 3). An additional ∼4-fold increase in the level of Peri A expression was observed in cells loaded with FAs (Fig. 2,lane 3 versus lane 4). Peri A expression was associated with decreased expression of ADRP to levels comparable with those observed in the absence of FAs. Although FA loading and Peri A expression altered ADRP protein expression, Northern analyses showed that neither incubation with FAs for 48 h nor Peri A expression altered ADRP mRNA (data not shown). Our observation of decreased ADRP protein levels with Peri A expression is the converse of increased ADRP expression in adipocytes of mice with a targeted disruption of the perilipin gene (11Tansey J. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D. Zeo J. Gavrilova O. Reitman M. Deng C.-X. Ki C. Kimmel A. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The above observations demonstrate that ACS1/FATP1 cells are a suitable model to investigate the role of Peri A in lipolysis. To determine the effects of Peri A expression on lipid content, ACS1/FATP1 cells were transduced with Ad control or Ad Peri A. After infection, cells were incubated in media with albumin-bound FAs for 48 h, followed by 48 h without FAs. TLC analyses of cellular lipids extracted from cells demonstrated a ∼2-fold increase in TG accumulation in cells expressing Peri A (p < 0.001) as compared with control cells (Fig.3 A). Western blotting analyses of cell lysates demonstrated that Peri A expression was present in Ad Peri A-transduced cells as compared with Ad control-transduced cells (Fig. 3 B). ADRP levels decreased (∼70%) with expression of Peri A. Therefore, Peri A expression in ACS1/FATP1 cells results in increased TG accumulation. To determine the subcellular localization of expressed Peri A, ACS1/FATP1 cells were transduced with either Ad control or Ad Peri A and loaded with FAs for 48 h (Fig.4). Simultaneous fluorescent detection of Peri A and neutral lipids, using a specific Peri A antiserum (green fluorescence) and Nile red (red fluorescence) to stain neutral lipids, allowed us to correlate immunoreactivity with intracellular structure. These studies demonstrated that Peri A is located at the surface of the lipid droplet. Cells expressing Peri A had more Nile red fluorescence located in bigger and more numerous droplets than in control cells, consistent with the increased TG demonstrated biochemically. The clusters of droplets appeared to be distributed throughout the cell. In the majority of cells, Peri A immunostaining around the droplet did not appear to be evenly distributed in a ring-like fashion on the droplet surface; in fact, Peri A immunoreactivity often appeared somewhat patchy in its distribution. In summary, Peri A expression increased lipid droplet size and the number of droplets. To further characterize the role of Peri A in regulating lipid hydrolysis, ACS1/FATP1 cells were transduced with either Ad control, Ad GFPHSL, Ad Peri A, or combinations of these different adenoviruses (see “Experimental Procedures”). These cells were then incubated with FAs for 48 h. The FAs were then removed from the media, and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h in the absence or presence of 20 μm forskolin. Glycerol in the media was assayed to quantitate cellular lipolysis. Western blotting analyses of cell lysates (Fig.5 A) using HSL antiserum demonstrated that ACS1/FATP1 cells do not express endogenous HSL, whereas cells transduced with Ad GFPHSL showed a band of 111 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of the GFPHSL fusion protein (Fig.5 A, lanes 3,4,7, and8). Likewise, using Peri-A antisera, endogenous Peri A expression was not observed in ACS1/FATP1 cells, but Ad Peri A-transduced cells expressed a 62-kDa band that increased to 65 kDa with forskolin treatment (Fig. 5 A,lanes 5and 7 versus lanes 6 and 8). The alterations in Peri A migration in SDS-PAGE have been previously demonstrated to be due to hyperphosphorylation by PKA (7Greenberg A. Egan J. Wek S. Garty N. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.-K. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18769-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ad Peri A-transduced cells incubated with FAs accumulated ∼45% more TG than Ad control-transduced cells (p = 0.03, analysis of variance), consistent with the notion that Peri A can impede the hydrolysis of TG by non-HSL lipases (Fig. 5 B). Expression of GFPHSL reduced TG accumulation by ∼40% as compared with control cells (p = 0.03, analysis of variance). However, the combined expression of Peri A and GFPHSL significantly increased TG accumulation as compared with GFPHSL alone (∼72%; p= 0.0002, analysis of variance). It is likely that Peri A expression significantly blocks the effects of the unknown, endogenous lipase in ACS1/FATP1 cells and the effects of HSL to reduce TG accumulation. The extent of lipolysis in ACS1/FATP1 cells was determined by measuring glycerol release after the removal of the FAs from the media. Infection with Ad Peri A lowered basal (absence of forskolin) glycerol release by 38% as compared with cells infected with Ad control (p= 0.03) (Fig. 5 C). Expression of Ad GFPHSL increased basal lipolysis by 32% as compared with control cells (p = 0.03). The combination of Peri A and GFPHSL reduced the rate of lipolysis by ∼45% as compared with GFPHSL alone (p = 0.0002). We did not detect any significant effect of forskolin treatment on glycerol release in Ad control- or Ad GFPHSL-transduced cells. Forskolin-stimulated lipolysis was increased as compared with non-stimulated cells in ACS1/FATP1 cells expressing Peri A (p < 0.0001). The forskolin-mediated increase in lipolysis was more robust in cells expressing both Peri A and GFPHSL as compared with cells expressing Peri A alone (242% versus200%, respectively; p = 0.03). Essentially, forskolin abrogated the ability of Peri A to block the lipolytic effects of the endogenous lipase(s) and GFPHSL. In summary, expression of Peri A significantly blocked lipolysis in ACSI/FATP1 cells, and PKA reversed the actions of Peri A on lipolysis. In addition, a significant effect of forskolin on lipolysis was observed in ACS1/FATP1 cells only when Peri A was expressed. To further characterize the role of Peri A in PKA-mediated lipolysis, we mutated the amino-terminal PKA sites (16Kemp B. Pearson R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A; Ser-81, Ser-222, and Ser-276) in Peri A from serines to alanines (Peri AΔ3). These three PKA sites are common to both Peri A and Peri B, the major forms of perilipin expressed in adipocytes. Peri AΔ3 was cloned into an adenovirus and expressed in ACS1/FATP1 cells. Cells co-expressing GFPHSL and Peri A or Peri AΔ3 accumulated similar levels of TG in response to FA loading (Peri A + GFPHSL, 6.2 + 1.3 nmol TG/mg protein; Peri AΔ3 + GFPHSL, 6.5 + 1.8 nmol TG/mg protein; n = 4 in triplicate). As observed earlier with Peri A, expression of Peri AΔ3 down-regulated ADRP protein expression, and confocal microscopy demonstrated that the Peri AΔ3 protein localized to the surface of lipid droplets (data not shown). We next compared lipolysis in cells expressing GFPHSL and Peri A versus the rate of lipolysis in cells expressing GFPHSL and Peri AΔ3. The rate of basal (without forskolin) lipolysis was not significantly different in ACS1/FATP1 cells expressing GFPHSL and Peri A as compared with cells expressing GFPHSL and Peri AΔ3 (Fig. 6 B). Again we observed that forskolin significantly increased lipolysis, as compared with basal lipolysis, in cells expressing both Peri A and GFPHSL (Fig.6 B; p < 0.0001). However, when we co-expressed Peri AΔ3 protein and GFPHSL in ACS1/FATP1 cells, forskolin treatment did not significantly increase lipolysis as compared with basal lipolysis. Previously, it was hypothesized that phosphorylation of the PKA consensus sites in carboxyl-terminal Peri A (Ser-433, Ser-494, and Ser-517) (Fig. 6 A) caused Peri A to migrate slower in SDS-PAGE as a 65-kDa protein (15Greenberg A. Egan J. Wek S. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Both Peri A and Peri AΔ3 migrated to 65 kDa with forskolin treatment, consistent with activation of PKA-stimulated lipolysis and the fact that that the carboxyl-terminal PKA sites were not mutated in either protein (Fig.6 C). We next examined the effects of PKA activation on phosphoserine content in Peri A and Peri AΔ3 when co-expressed with GFPHSL in ACS1/FATP1 cells. Experiments demonstrated that in the absence of Peri A expression, we could not detect any significant amount of phosphoserine immunoreactivity in the 60–65-kDa regions of ACS1/FATP1 cells (data not shown). When Peri A was expressed and cells were treated with forskolin, phosphoserine immunoreactivity was significantly increased at 65 kDa, similar to prior observations in adipocytes (30Chaudhury A. Granneman J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R147-R153PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 C). In contrast with forskolin treatment, the phosphoserine content of the Peri AΔ3 protein was significantly reduced as compared with that of Peri A. The reduction in phosphoserine content was consistent with substitution of alanine for serine in the three amino-terminal PKA sites in Peri AΔ3 (Fig.6 C). The slight increase in Peri AΔ3 phosphoserine content, as compared with untreated cells, corresponds to phosphorylation of the remaining three PKA recognition sites. In this study, we were able to demonstrate that PKA phosphorylation of Peri A regulates the protein's actions to modulate lipolysis in response to PKA activation. Stimulation of adipocyte lipolysis by PKA is the critical pathway by which the body increases fatty acids in physiologic states such as fasting (31Arner P. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1988; 4: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Coppack S. Jensen M. Miles J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 177-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylates HSL, resulting in modest (∼2-fold) increases in HSL activity (33Anthonsen M. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Perhaps more importantly, phosphorylated HSL translocates to the surface of intracellular lipid droplets (3Brasaemle D. Levin D. Adler-Wailes D. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 2000: 251-262Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Clifford G. Londos C. Kraemer F. Vernon R. Yeaman S. J. Biol.

Using adenovirally engineered ACS1/FATP1 cells, we are able for the first time to directly assess the individual contributions of Peri A, HSL, and PKA to modulation of TG accumulation and breakdown. Our data demonstrate the importance of Peri A in regulating constitutive and PKA-stimulated lipolysis in ACS1/FATP1 cells. Moreover, our studies elucidate the critical role of Peri A phosphorylation state in PKA-stimulated lipolysis. In the ACS1/FATP1 cell model, Peri A expression increased TG accumulation and reduced lipolysis. Our data in ACS1/FATP1 cells are consistent with and extend the report by Brasaemle et al.(8Brasaemle D. Rubin B. Harten I. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) that expression of Peri A in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes increased TG accumulation. Although they did not directly measure lipolysis, Brasaemle et al. (8Brasaemle D. Rubin B. Harten I. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) found that Peri A decreased the rate of TG turnover, suggesting that perilipins block the actions of lipases. Preadipocytes, like ACS1/FATP1 cells, do not express HSL, and in both cell lines, the non-HSL lipase(s) that hydrolyzes TG is unknown. Consistent with our results, other laboratories have suggested that a neutral long chain lipase is present in fibroblasts and is not HSL (34Hilaire N. Salvayre R. Thiers J.-C. Bonnafe M.-J. Negre-Salvayre A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27027-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The identity of the lipase in fibroblasts is not known at the present time. We now find that expression of Peri A reduces the lipolytic actions of both HSL and non-HSL lipases, resulting in reduced glycerol release and increased TG accumulation. Importantly, when GFPHSL and Peri A were co-expressed, Peri A expression did not reduce GFPHSL protein expression, thus supporting the argument that the effects of Peri A are mediated by its ability to reduce TG hydrolysis. Expression of Peri A was necessary to demonstrate a statistically significant lipolytic response to forskolin treatment in ACS1/FATP1 cells. PKA increased lipolysis in cells expressing Peri A because it abrogated the inhibitory actions of Peri A on lipolysis. Specifically, forskolin-stimulated hyperphosphorylation of Peri A reduced its ability to block the lipolytic actions of both HSL and non-HSL lipases. In contrast, forskolin did not significantly increase lipolysis in ACS1/FATP1 cells expressing GFPHSL or untagged HSL (data not shown) in the absence of Peri A. Consistent with this observation, PKA stimulation did not increase lipolysis (glycerol/mg protein) in adipocytes from a perilipin knockout mouse (9Martinez-Botas J. Andreson J. Tessler D. Lapillojnne A. Hung-Junn Chang B. Quast M. Gorenstein D. Chen K.-H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Thus, in both our cell model and adipocytes from Peri-null mice, perilipin was necessary to demonstrate an effect of PKA on lipolysis. Perilipins have been proposed to modulate lipolysis by two distinct mechanisms: (i) regulation of perilipin protein expression (8Brasaemle D. Rubin B. Harten I. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A. Londos C. J.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and (ii) PKA-dependent hyperphosphorylation of perilipins (4Clifford G. Londos C. Kraemer F. Vernon R. Yeaman S. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that a reduction in perilipin protein expression in response to tumor necrosis factor α increased adipocyte lipolysis. Furthermore, maintenance of Peri A or Peri B protein levels with adenovirus overexpression blocked tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated lipolysis (10Souza S. Moitoso de Vargas L. Yamamato M. Line P. Franciosa M. Moss L. Greenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of either perilipin isoform did not block PKA-stimulated lipolysis in these studies. We now demonstrate the role of PKA-mediated hyperphosphorylation of perilipin in regulating lipolysis. In this study, we mutated the three consensus PKA sites in Peri A that are common to both Peri A and Peri B (Fig. 6; Ser-81, Ser-222, and Ser-276) (15Greenberg A. Egan J. Wek S. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). When the mutant protein (Peri AΔ3) was expressed in ACS1/FATP1 cells, like Peri A, it targeted itself to the surface of intracellular lipid droplets, increased TG accumulation, and decreased basal lipolysis. However, unlike Peri A, Peri AΔ3 blocked PKA-stimulated lipolysis in ACS1/FATP1 cells expressing GFPHSL. Our observations with Peri AΔ3 demonstrate that PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of Peri A is necessary to abrogate Peri A's inhibitory actions on lipolysis. Because Peri A and Peri B share the same PKA phosphorylation sites that were mutated in this study, we speculate that Peri B may also modulate PKA-stimulated lipolysis. It is unknown how perilipins modulate lipase hydrolysis of TG. Perilipin localizes specifically to the surface of intracellular lipid droplets (6Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A.

At the present time, it is unclear whether the perilipins physically block lipases from accessing the lipid droplet surface or alter the biophysical properties of the phospholipid monolayer surrounding lipid droplets. PKA phosphorylation of Peri A may facilitate lipase access to the lipid droplet by altering Peri A conformation and/or by causing Peri A to translocate off the lipid droplet.

https://openalex.org/W2169896143,"There is increasing evidence that p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> are requisite positive regulators of cyclin D1·CDK4 assembly and nuclear accumulation. Both Cip and Kip proteins can promote nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. We now provide evidence that p21<sup>Cip1</sup> promotes the nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 complexes via inhibition of cyclin D1 nuclear export. <i>In vivo</i>, we demonstrate that p21<sup>Cip1</sup> can inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3β-triggered cyclin D1 nuclear export and phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Furthermore, we find that cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation in p21/p27 null cells can be restored through inhibition of CRM1-depenendent nuclear export. The ability of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> to inhibit cyclin D1 nuclear export correlates with its ability to bind to Thr-286-phosphorylated cyclin D1 and thereby prevents cyclin D1·CRM1 association."
https://openalex.org/W1761234319,"In multiple myeloma (MM), migration is necessary for the homing of tumor cells to bone marrow (BM), for expansion within the BM microenvironment, and for egress into the peripheral blood. In the present study we characterize the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and β1integrin (CD29) in MM cell migration. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) α is translocated to the plasma membrane and activated by adhesion of MM cells to fibronectin and VEGF. We identify β1 integrin modulating VEGF-triggered MM cell migration on fibronectin. We show that transient enhancement of MM cell adhesion to fibronectin triggered by VEGF is dependent on the activity of both PKC and β1 integrin. Moreover, we demonstrate that PKCα is constitutively associated with β1 integrin. These data are consistent with PKCα-dependent exocytosis of activated β1 integrin to the plasma membrane, where its increased surface expression mediates binding to fibronectin; conversely, catalytically active PKCα-driven internalization of β1 integrin results in MM cell de-adhesion. We show that the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (p85) is constitutively associated with FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1). VEGF stimulates activation of PI 3-kinase, and both MM cell adhesion and migration are PI 3-kinase-dependent. Moreover, both VEGF-induced PI 3-kinase activation and β1 integrin-mediated binding to fibronectin are required for the recruitment and activation of PKCα. Time-lapse phase contrast video microscopy (TLVM) studies confirm the importance of these signaling components in VEGF-triggered MM cell migration on fibronectin.

It has been reported that the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins laminin, microfibrillar collagen type VI, and fibronectin are strong adhesive components for MM cells and that adhesion to laminin and fibronectin is β1integrin (CD29)-mediated (1Kibler C. Schermutzki F. Waller H.D. Timpl R. Muller C.A. Klein G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 307-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β1 integrins are typically expressed on MM cells, specifically α integrins VLA-4 (α4β1) and VLA-5 (α5β1) (2Damiano J.S. Cress A.E. Hazlehurst L.A. Shtil A.A. Dalton W.S. Blood. 1999; 93: 1658-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jensen G.S. Belch A.R. Mant M.J. Ruether B.A. Yacyshyn B.R. Pilarski L.M. Am. J. Hematol. 1993; 43: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). β1integrin-mediated adhesion of MM cells to fibronectin confers protection against drug-induced apoptosis and triggers NFκB-dependent transcription and secretion of interleukin-6, the major MM growth and survival factor (4Uchiyama H. Barut B.A. Chauhan D. Cannistra S.A. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 2306-2314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Uchiyama H. Barut B.A. Mohrbacher A.F. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1993; 82: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, chimeric mice (β1−/− → wild-type chimeras) lack β1-null cells in blood and in hematopoietic organs such as spleen, thymus, and BM as a consequence of the inability of β1-null cells to invade the fetal liver (6Fassler R. Meyer M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In addition to up-regulation of cell surface expression and induction of surface-clustering, integrin activity can be triggered by multiple agonists through “inside-out” signaling independent of changes in integrin expression levels (e.g. ligand binding to growth factor receptors is associated with changes in the way in which adhesion receptors on the cell surface engage the ECM). This concept is illustrated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in which VEGF stimulates β1 integrins and leads to markedly enhanced movement (7Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although VEGF induces migration as a key step in angiogenesis, the interplay between VEGF and integrins is not restricted to angiogenesis. VEGF and VEGFR are expressed by many tumor cell lines; moreover, elevated levels of VEGF are found in cancer patients, and inhibition of VEGF can suppress tumor growth (8Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Indeed, clinical studies are underway investigating VEGF as a novel therapeutic target (9Ferrara N. Alitalo K. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In MM VEGF is expressed and secreted by tumor cells as well as BM stromal cells (10Bellamy W.T. Richter L. Frutiger Y. Grogan T.M.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); moreover, binding of MM cells to BM stromal cells enhances both interleukin-6 and VEGF secretion (11Dankbar B. Padro T. Leo R. Feldmann B. Kropff M. Mesters R.M. Serve H. Berdel W.E. Kienast J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that in addition to stimulating angiogenesis, VEGF directly induces MM cell proliferation via a protein kinase C (PKC)-independent mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway and triggers MM cell migration on fibronectin via a PKC-dependent pathway (12Podar K.

To date, 11 isoenzymes of the serine/threonine kinase PKC have been identified and classified into three subgroups based on structure and cofactor regulation: conventional PKC, novel PKC, and atypical PKC (15Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2362) Google Scholar, 18Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). The conventional PKC isoforms participate in the inside-out signaling activation of cell adhesion mediated by β1, β2, and β3 integrins and are also required for cell spreading (23Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Hoxie J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 25Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G.A. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Moreover, PKCα associates with β1 integrins, thereby regulating cell trafficking (26Ng T. Shima D. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I. Gschmeissner S. Humphries M.J. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3909-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,27Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J.

In the present study, we describe the close interrelationship between integrin and growth factor-induced signaling pathways in MM. We identify PKCα as the primary PKC isozyme involved in VEGF-induced MM cell migration. By showing that VEGF-mediated MM cell migration is associated with β1 integrin- and PI 3-kinase-dependent PKCα activation, we further confirm the importance of tumor cell-BM microenvironment interaction as a pivotal process in the pathogenesis of MM. Moreover, our studies identify several potential targets for novel therapies to improve outcome in MM. Recombinant human VEGF165 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human plasma fibronectin was obtained from Invitrogen. β1 integrin-specific mAb was purified from P4C10 ascites (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). PKC isoforms were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The goat polyclonal Ab raised against the carboxyl terminus of PYK2, the mouse mAb raised against full-length β1 integrin (4B7R), and the rabbit polyclonal Ab directed against amino acids within the extracellular domain of Flt-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Tom Roberts (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The human MM cell line MM.1S (dexamethasone-sensitive) (28Moalli P.A. Pillay S. Weiner D. Leikin R. Rosen S.T. Blood. 1992; 79: 213-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were starved for 15–18 h in medium with 3% FBS overnight and then for 3 h without FBS prior to stimulation with indicated VEGF concentrations (recombinant human VEGF, R&D Systems) or 50 nm/300 nm PMA for 20–30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with either lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, Na-pyrophosphate, 1% Triton, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein inhibitor mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C). Immunocomplexes were collected following overnight incubation at 4 °C with 10–20 μl of 100% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For Western blotting, cell lysates (30–100 μg/lane) or immunoprecipitates (500 μg–1.5 mg total proteins) were separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE prior to electrophoretic transfer onto HybondTM-C super nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 buffer at room temperature for 1 h, membranes were sequentially blotted with the indicated specific primary Abs and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary mouse, rabbit, or goat Abs and were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were transferred into 200 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (HLB: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 20 min on ice. The cells were then lysed by 80 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and subjected to centrifugation at 1500 × g to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected (S100 fraction), and the pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of HLB containing 0.1% Triton X (P100 fraction). PKCα activity was measured with a PKC assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The phosphotransferase activity of PKCα was quantitated in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6500, multi-purpose scintillation counter) measuring the amount of the γ-phosphate of [γ-32P]ATP incorporated in a specific PKC substrate peptide (QKRPSQRSKYL) bound to P81 phosphocellulose paper. Endogenous phosphorylation of proteins in the sample was determined by substituting the assay dilution buffer for the substrate mixture. To assure that equal amounts of PKCα were used in the assay, immunoprecipitates were denaturated, eluted, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred, and immunoblotted with PKCα. PI 3-kinase assays were performed as described previously (29Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 50 μl. The radioactivity was visualized and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). These were performed using the VybrantTM cell adhesion assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after an 18-h starvation in RPMI/2% FBS, MM.1S cells (4 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested and labeled with calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (5 μm per cell loading) for 30 min. After washing with prewarmed (37 °C) RPMI 1640 (without serum), the cells were preincubated with or without blocking β1 integrin neutralizing mAb, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I, Calbiochem), or LY294002 (Calbiochem), respectively, and then stimulated with VEGF. The cell suspensions were immediately added to fibronectin- or polylysine (1 μg/ml)-coated or non-coated wells. After 90–120 min, nonadherent calcein-labeled cells were removed by gently washing twice with RPMI 1640 by inversion of the plates. Adherent cells were quantitated in a fluorescence multi-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and examined microscopically. All experiments were done in triplicate. Cell migration was assayed as described previously (12Podar K. Tai Y.T. Davies F.E. Lentzsch S. Sattler M. Hideshima T. Lin B.K. Gupta D. Shima Y. Chauhan D. Mitsiades C. Raje N. Richardson P.

After 2–5 h, cells that had migrated into the lower compartment of a Boyden-modified chamber were counted using a Coulter counter ZBII (Beckman Coulter). MM.1S cells were starved in RPMI medium containing 2% FBS for 16 h and plated to uncoated or fibronectin-coated tissue culture plates (35 × 10-mm plates, BD PharMingen), respectively, in the presence or absence of VEGF (100 ng/ml). For image capturing, an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus, Lake Success, NY) with Hoffman optics (×10/×20/×40) equipped with a temperature- (Therm-Omega-Tech, Warmington, PA) and CO2 (5%)-controlled chamber was connected to an Optronics Engineering DEI-750 3CCD digital video camera (Optronics, Galeta, CA). Animation and export to a Quick Time movie were performed using the QED Camera Standalone 145 software at 2-min intervals. Images were analyzed with the NIH Image 1.62 software. To generate migration tracks, the position of the centroid of individual cells on each image were marked. The migratory speed was calculated based on the sum of distances divided by the time of observation. Migration of at least 15 cells was analyzed for each experimental condition. Statistical significance of differences observed in VEGF-treated versus control cultures was determined using an unpaired Student's t test. The minimal level of significance was p < 0.05. Previously we showed that VEGF-triggered MM cell migration on fibronectin is mediated via a PKC-dependent signaling pathway (12Podar K. Tai Y.T. Davies F.E. Lentzsch S. Sattler M. Hideshima T. Lin B.K. Gupta D. Shima Y. Chauhan D. Mitsiades C. Raje N. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In the present study we define and characterize the interrelationship of VEGF- and integrin-signaling in activating PKC that ultimately leads to MM cell migration. Several PKC isoforms, including PKCα (32Platet N. Prevostel C. Derocq D. Joubert D. Rochefort H. Garcia M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), PKCδ (33Kiley S.C. Clark K.J. Goodnough M. Welch D.R. Jaken S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3230-3238PubMed Google Scholar), and PKCθ (34Tang S. Morgan K.G. Parker C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28704-28711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), have been implicated in a cell migratory phenotype. Additionally, overexpression of PKCα was shown to enhance cell motility/invasiveness of breast cancer cells (26Ng T. Shima D. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I. Gschmeissner S. Humphries M.J. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3909-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that MM cell migration is PKC-dependent because it can be selectively inhibited by the PKC inhibitor BIM I (12Podar K. Tai Y.T. Davies F.E. Lentzsch S. Sattler M. Hideshima T. Lin B.K. Gupta D. Shima Y. Chauhan D. Mitsiades C. Raje N. Richardson P. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). As a first step to identify the class of PKC mediating VEGF-induced migration in MM cells, we examined the expression of the PKC isoforms in MM cell lines and patient cells (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis revealed that PKCα, PKCγ, PKCε, and PKCζ are significantly expressed in all human MM cell lines and MM patient cells investigated, in contrast to PKCβ (low expression), PKCδ (variable expression), and PKCθ (no expression, data not shown). As in our previous studies we chose the MM.1S human MM cell line (28Moalli P.A. Pillay S. Weiner D. Leikin R. Rosen S.T. Blood. 1992; 79: 213-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a representative model system for this study. Because the activation of PKC occurs concomitantly with recruitment to the plasma membrane, we next performed immunoblotting of cell fractions with isoform-specific Abs against PKCα, PKCγ, PKCε, and PKCζ to delineate the intracellular distribution after VEGF stimulation (Fig.2). In non-treated MM cells all PKC isoforms were detected primarily in the cytosolic fraction. After VEGF stimulation of cells seeded on fibronectin, PKCα translocated into the membrane fraction after 30 min (Fig. 2 a), whereas no significant changes in distribution of PKC isoforms as PKCγ, PKCε, and PKCζ were observed. The activation of PKCα after VEGF treatment of cells attached to fibronectin was further supported by a 2-fold increase in PKCα-IP kinase activity; PKCα-IP kinase activation by PMA served as a positive control (Fig. 2 b). Although a cAMP-dependent protein kinase/calmodulin kinase (PKA/CaMK) inhibitor mixture was used, this assay (Upstate Biotechnology) may not exclude the phosphorylation of a specific substrate peptide (QKRPSQRSKYL) by unknown PKCα-coprecipitated kinases. Neither plating of cells on fibronectin alone nor stimulation of suspended cells with VEGF alone significantly changed the subcellular distribution of PKCα (Fig. 2, c andd). In contrast, treatment with PMA, a major PKC activator, induced translocation of responsive PKC (PKCα, PKCγ, and PKCε) into the detergent-soluble membrane fraction as expected (Fig.2 d) (35Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 36Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Cooper H.L. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13193-13196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Laminin, the microfibrillar collagen type VI, and fibronectin bind MM cells, and adhesion to laminin and fibronectin is β1 integrin (CD29)-mediated (1Kibler C. Schermutzki F. Waller H.D. Timpl R. Muller C.A. Klein G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 307-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β1 integrins expressed on MM cells include VLA-4 (α4β1) and VLA-5 (α5β1) (2Damiano J.S. Cress A.E. Hazlehurst L.A. Shtil A.A. Dalton W.S. Blood. 1999; 93: 1658-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jensen G.S. Belch A.R. Mant M.J. Ruether B.A. Yacyshyn B.R. Pilarski L.M. Am. J.

Blood. 1993; 82: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which mediate adherence to both the ECM and BM stromal cells. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, VEGF stimulates β1 integrins via inside-out signaling, leading to significantly increased motility (7Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because migration is a dynamic process of cell adhesion formation and release, we next investigated whether VEGF can modulate β1integrin-mediated MM cell adhesion. As shown previously, MM cells spontaneously adhered to fibronectin, and this adhesion was increased upon stimulation with VEGF (Fig.3 a). Maximal increments of VEGF-mediated cell adhesion were observed at fibronectin concentrations of 25–30 μg/ml, whereas adhesion decreased to baseline levels at higher fibronectin concentrations (Fig. 3 b). Notably, VEGF-mediated increments in adhesion were time-dependent, with maximal binding observed after 75–90 min of VEGF treatment and decreasing after 120 min (Fig. 3 c). We next examined whether the increment of adhesion observed at 90 min of VEGF stimulation was PKC- and β1integrin-dependent. As shown in Fig. 3,d–e, incubation with the PKC inhibitor BIM I (as well as with the β1-neutralizing mAb) blocked dose-dependent VEGF-induced cell adhesion to fibronectin. This involvement of PKC in MM cell adhesion to fibronectin was further confirmed by a dose-dependent increment of adhesion triggered by PMA stimulation (Fig. 3 d) similar to that induced by VEGF. Taken together, our results show that VEGF transiently enhances MM cell adhesion to fibronectin, dependent on both PKC and β1 integrin activity. We next sought to determine whether β1integrin modulates VEGF-mediated MM cell migration on fibronectin. As seen in Fig. 3 f, β1 integrin neutralizing mAb (but not irrelevant IgG) mediated dose-dependent inhibition of VEGF-triggered MM cell migration in a Boyden-modified microchemotaxis chamber. These data confirm that β1integrin (CD29) is the integrin primarily associated with VEGF-triggered MM cell migration on fibronectin. The control mechanisms leading to the various stages of the integrin receptor life cycle are largely unknown. Propagation of cell movement is thought to be regulated by the distribution and redistribution of integrins through surface diffusion, internalization, clustering at the leading front, and ripping release from the cell rear (37Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cells Nget al. (26Ng T. Shima D. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I.

PKCα induced up-regulation of the integrin-dependent cell migration of these cells, which was blocked under conditions that prevented the internalization of the receptor complex. We therefore next determined whether PKCα and β1 integrin are associated in MM cells. Constitutive complex formation between these two proteins was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.4 a). Upon activation and translocation, conventional PKCs associate with proteins of the transmembrane-4 superfamily (TM4SF or tetraspans) linking PKC to several subsets of integrins (38Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) including α4β1 (39Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Kraeft S.K. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. J.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Specificity of binding to TM4SF is dependent on the extracellular domain of the integrin α chain, and the integrin-TM4SF-PKC complex formation results in phosphorylation of the integrin α cytoplasmic tail (41Zhang X.A.

In ongoing studies, we are investigating the regulatory role of these integrin-associated proteins on VEGF-induced MM cell migration. In addition to influencing cell motility via controlling β1 integrin trafficking, catalytically active PKC also regulates other components of the focal complexes, including the small GTPases (Cdc42, Rho, Rac) and/or actin cytoskeleton-binding proteins. Calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK), also known as proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), calcium-dependent tyrosine-kinase β (CAKβ), and related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase homologous to focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Like FAK, CADTK is a platform kinase site for the coalescence of signaling and adaptor molecules, thereby facilitating the transmission of surface signals to the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways associated with cell growth, apoptosis, and migration. A number of studies have demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of CADTK in cells of hematopoietic origin (e.g. T and B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, granulocytes, bone marrow progenitors, mast cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets). Stimuli that activate CADTK in these cells are associated with cell motility or at least cytoskeletal rearrangement (e.g. CADTK activation is required for cytoskeletal reorganization and monocyte motility) (42Watson J.M.

In MM.1S cells, we have shown previously that CADTK is activated upon dexamethasone treatment, suggesting its role in dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (47Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P. Treon S.

However, molecular mechanisms underlying this activation remain elusive. Previous studies showed that methylprednisolone specifically increased Na+/H+ exchanger isoform (NHE) 3 mRNA in ileum and kidney without affecting NHE1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that glucocorticoids activate NHE3 activity by induction of NHE3 transcripts. We recently found in PS120 and opossum kidney cells that chronic incubation with dexamethasone activated NHE3 independent of gene induction, indicating that the transcriptional activation may not be the only determining factor in the NHE3 activation. Furthermore, dexamethasone activated NHE3 activity only in the presence of a NHE3 regulatory protein, NHERF2, which was previously shown to confer cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3. This activation of NHE3 could not be duplicated by NHERF1. We identified serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase, SGK1, as the protein interacting with PDZ domains of NHERF2 to regulate NHE3 activity. The expression of SGK1 enhanced NHE3 transport in PS120 fibroblasts. In addition, the “kinase-dead” SGK1 blocked activation of NHE3 by dexamethasone in opossum kidney cells. These data demonstrated that glucocorticoid activation of NHE3 requires the activation of SGK1 and the presence of NHERF2 acting as a scaffold protein.

Glucocorticoids such as prednisolone and methylprednisolone have been used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (4Spencer C.M. McTavish D. Drugs. 1995; 50: 854-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Campieri M. Ferguson A. Doe W. Persson T. Nilsson L.G. Gut. 1997; 41: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although in some of these circumstances the antidiarrheal effects of glucocorticoids may result from the direct effect on processes underlying the diseases, it is widely accepted that glucocorticoids have a direct effect on intestinal salt and water absorption. The fact that glucocorticoids have a direct effect on intestinal salt and water absorption has been known for more than two decades (2Meneely R. Ghishan F.K. Pediatr. Res. 1982; 16: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Charney A.N. Kinsey M.D. Myers L. Giannella R.A. Gots R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic doses of methylprednisolone have been shown to increase Na+, Cl+, and water absorption in vivo in both small intestine and colon of the rat. However, the molecular mechanisms by which this homeostasis is achieved at the cellular level remain to be elucidated.The small intestine and colon are major sites for NaCl absorption, and much of the Na+ absorption in the gastrointestinal tract appears to be mediated by coupled Na+/H+exchange and Cl−/HCO3−exchange (7Donowitz M. Welsh M.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 135-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian intestine, Na+/H+exchanger isoform (NHE)1 3 is a component of neutral NaCl absorption, which is a major constituent in basal Na+ absorption and a frequent target of inhibition in many diarrheal diseases (7Donowitz M. Welsh M.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 135-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NHE3 also plays an essential role in the maintenance of systemic pH homeostasis via Na+ and HCO3− reabsorptive processes in renal proximal tubules (8Aronson P.S. Igarashi P. Curr. Topics Membr. Transport. 1986; 26: 57-75Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Several years ago, we demonstrated that 1–3 days of treatment with methylprednisolone doubled rabbit ileal neutral NaCl absorption by specifically stimulating NHE3 mRNA expression by 4–6-fold without affecting NHE1 (9Yun C.H.C. Gurubhagavatula S. Levine S.A. Montgomery J.L.M. Cohen M.E. Cragoe E.J. Pouyssegur J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 206-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids also stimulate NHE3 in renal proximal tubules by increasing NHE3 mRNA level (10Baum M. Moe O.W. Gentry D.L. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F437-F442PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent genomic cloning of rat NHE3 revealed the presence of glucocorticoid response elements in the 5′-flanking promoter region (11Kandasamy R.A. Yu F.H. Harris R. Boucher A. Hanrahan J.W. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29209-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Na+/H+ exchangers display sensitivity to changes in intracellular pH and cell volume and are modulated by agents primarily targeting serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Despite a great deal of effort to understand protein kinase/growth factor-dependent regulation of Na+/H+ exchangers, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of transport activity are only partially defined. We have previously identified NHERF (also known as EBP50 and NHERF1) and E3KARP (also known as NHERF2 and TKA-1), each containing a pair of PDZ protein interaction modules (12Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Because NHERF and E3KARP are closely related in structure and sequence and appear to belong to the same family of proteins, E3KARP was also referred to as NHERF2. To be consistent with the nomenclature of the family, E3KARP will be referred to as NHERF2 in this report. We demonstrated that these proteins confer modulation of NHE3 activity in response to increased intracellular cAMP level. NHERF1/NHERF2 function as scaffold proteins clustering NHE3 and cytoskeletal ezrin (13Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 14Yun C.H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Ezrin itself is capable of binding filamentous actin, serving as a bridge between membrane-associated proteins and cytoskeletons. The importance of the linkage to cytoskeletal network by NHERF proteins was also demonstrated in a recent report that NHERF2 is necessary in maintenance of foot processes in glomerular epithelial cells by linking podocalyxin to ezrin-actin network (16Takeda T. McQuistan T. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is a serine/threonine kinase, which was originally identified through subtractive cloning of a serum and glucocorticoid-induced mammary tumor cell cDNA library (17Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In addition to serum and glucocorticoids, SGK1 is induced by various stimuli such as follicle-stimulating hormone, aldosterone, hyperosmolarity, protein kinase A, expression of p53, and injury to the brain (18Waldegger S. Barth P. Raber G. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4440-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Insulin and insulin-like growth factors stimulate SGK activity by a mechanism requiring the participation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (19Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SGK1 is ubiquitously expressed in a wide variety of tissue, including intestine and kidney. Recently two additional SGK isoforms, termed SGK2 and SGK3, have been cloned (19Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).In this study, we present new evidence that glucocorticoids result in NHE3 activation via a mechanism other than NHE3 gene activation. We show that glucocorticoid-dependent activation is mediated through activation of SGK1 and this activation requires the presence of NHERF2.DISCUSSIONGlucocorticoids chronically stimulate sodium absorption in ileum, proximal colon and renal proximal tubule. Treatment of animals with synthetic glucocorticoids led to a 2-fold increase in rabbit ileal electroneutral NaCl absorption (9Yun C.H.C. Gurubhagavatula S. Levine S.A. Montgomery J.L.M. Cohen M.E. Cragoe E.J. Pouyssegur J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 206-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Baum M. Moe O.W. Gentry D.L. Alpern R.J. Am. J.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C796-C803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of NHE3 transcripts following methylprednisolone administration in small animals suggested that NHE3 is the likely candidate responsible for the increased sodium absorption (9Yun C.H.C. Gurubhagavatula S. Levine S.A. Montgomery J.L.M. Cohen M.E. Cragoe E.J. Pouyssegur J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 206-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted the hypothesis that glucocorticoids increased ileal Na+/H+ exchange by increasing the NHE3 amount. Cho et al. (24Cho J.H. Musch M.W. DePaoli A.M. Bookstein C.M. Xie Y. Burant C.F. Rao M. Chang E.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C796-C803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also found that dexamethasone had a stimulatory effect on NHE3 in rat ileum, and proximal colon but not in jejunum, and distal colon. Unlike adult rats, sucking rats showed responsiveness to glucocorticoids in jejunum but not in ileum, and this difference in the glucocorticoid induction was attributed to differential expression of glucocorticoid receptors in adult and suckling rats (34Kiela P.R. Guner Y.S. Xu H. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C629-C637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wormmeester et al. (35Wormmeester L. Sanchez de Medina F. Kokke F. Tse C.M. Khurana S. Bowser J. Cohen M.E. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1261-C1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that methylprednisolone treatment in rabbit ileum led to an increased NHE3 activity by more than 4-fold by increasing both total amount of NHE3 in ileal brush border membrane and NHE3 turnover rate. Whether the increase in NHE3 activity is solely due to an increase in NHE3 in the brush border membrane or other mechanism such as phosphorylation of NHE3 protein is unclear. A similar mechanism appears to be responsible for renal proximal tubular sodium absorption, where administration of dexamethasone in rabbit for 1–2 days resulted in up to 2.5-fold increase in NHE3 transcript level, without an effect on NHE1 (10Baum M. Moe O.W. Gentry D.L. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F437-F442PubMed Google Scholar). As in ileum, glucocorticoids increased sodium absorption in renal brush border vesicles by increasing V max without altering the affinity for H+ or the Hill coefficient (36Kinsella J.L. Freiberg J.M. Sacktor B. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F233-F239PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, incubation of isolated proximal tubules in dexamethasone for 3 h resulted in a 33% increase in NHE3 activity without a significant change in NHE3 or NHE1 transcript levels. This temporal separation of NHE3 mRNA abundance and Na+/H+ transport was also observed at 4 h after intravenous administration of dexamethasone in rabbit (10Baum M. Moe O.W. Gentry D.L. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F437-F442PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a number of findings in the current studies show that NHE3 gene induction cannot fully explain activation of NHE3. 1) NHE3 was activated by dexamethasone in the absence of NHE3 mRNA induction in PS120 fibroblasts. 2) Dexamethasone failed to activate NHE3 in OK cells even though the NHE3 mRNA level was doubled. The absence of dexamethasone-induced activation of NHE3 in OK cells is in contrast to a previous report that 1 μm dexamethasone resulted in 40% stimulation of NHE3 activity in OKP cells (37Baum M. Cano A. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F1027-F1031PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for the discrepancy are not clear, but the studies were done using OKP cells, which are a subset of OK cells, and the difference in effect of dexamethasone may be the result of cell type difference. 3) In all cells used in the current studies, NHERF2 was necessary for dexamethasone-dependent activation of NHE3, and the NHE3 gene induction alone cannot explain the necessity of NHERF2 in NHE3 activation. Although the present studies suggest that NHE3 activation by glucocorticoids occur in the absence of NHE3 gene induction, our data do not completely exclude the NHE3 gene induction as a part of the activation. In OK/NHERF2 and Caco-2 cells, where the NHE3 transcript levels were increased 2-fold by dexamethasone, NHE3 activity was up-regulated by more than 100% compared with 40–70% in PS120 cells, where NHE3 is ectopically expressed. Although quantitative comparison of NHE3 activation in different cell lines is not possible, it is plausible that the difference in the magnitude of the NHE3 activation between Caco-2/OK cells and PS120 might arise from the NHE3 gene induction.Recent studies have demonstrated that PDZ domains play an essential role in signal transduction by targeting of proteins and compartmentalization/assembly of signaling proteins (38Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). By organizing assembly of signaling proteins, PDZ-containing proteins play a fundamental role in enhancing the specificity and efficiency of signal transduction. NHERF1 and NHERF2 were initially described as NHE regulatory proteins, which appear to be necessary for cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 (12Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 39Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Recent works showed that NHERF1 and NHERF2 interact with a number of proteins, including the β2-adrenergic receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (29Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 40Maudsley S. Zamah A.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Many of the studies indicated that NHERF1 and NHERF2 seemingly have the same functions, although potential differences in functions of NHERF1 and NHERF2 was suggested primarily based on difference in cellular localization of these proteins (15Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16Takeda T. McQuistan T. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Clin.

Physiol. 2001; 280: C192-C198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current studies show that SGK1 binds only NHERF2 but not NHERF1, despite the high identity between these two proteins. Consistent with the differential interaction, only NHERF2 was able to reconstitute glucocorticoid-induced activation of NHE3.SGK1 shows 54% homology in its catalytic domain to the proto-oncogene Akt/PKB (17Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The current consensus view of activation of Akt involves the recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane through its NH2-terminal lipid-binding pleckstrin homology domain (19Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,20Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Once properly positioned, Akt is phosphorylated by PDK, resulting in activation of Akt. Unlike Akt, SGK1 lacks a pleckstrin homology domain at its NH2 terminus and the mechanism recruiting SGK1 to the plasma membrane remains undefined. The interaction between SGK1 and NHERF2 raises the possibility that NHERF2 may play a role in anchoring SGK1 to the plasma membrane.Although our data demonstrate that SGK1 activates NHE3 activity, the mechanistic nature of this activation remains to be determined. The optimal consensus sequences for phosphorylation by SGK are RXRXX(S/T) and RRX(S/T), where S/T is the site of phosphorylation (20Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Within NHE3, there are three RRXS motifs at aa 555, 607, and 693, and a single RXRXXS motif at aa 663, all of which are conserved in all NHE3 cloned from rabbit, rat, human and opossum. It is plausible that SGK1 phosphorylates NHE3 at one or more of these sites to either directly increase its transport activity or to increase the plasma membrane distribution of NHE3. Preliminary studies showed that NHE3 is phosphorylated by SGK1 under in vitroconditions. 2C. C. Yun and Y. Chen, unpublished data.SGK1 is recently shown to activate the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in response to aldosterone (44Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P.

Co-injection of ENaC and SGK1 mRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes led to a significant increase in sodium conductance. Attempts to demonstrate direct phosphorylation of ENaC by SGK1 have failed (45Lang F. Klingel K. Wagner C.A. Stegen C. Warntges S. Friedrich B. Lanzendorfer M. Melzig J. Moschen I. Steuer S. Waldegger S. Sauter M. Paulmichl M. Gerke V. Risler T. Gamba G. Capasso G. Kandolf R. Hebert S.C. Massry S.G. Broer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F303-F313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this subunit does not bear a consensus sequence for SGK1. Instead, the α-subunit contains the only intracellular SGK1 consensus sequence within the ENaC protein. Replacement of the serine at this consensus sequence with alanine did not prevent the activation of ENaC by SGK1, suggesting that SGK1 regulates ENaC not by direct phosphorylation (45Lang F. Klingel K. Wagner C.A. Stegen C. Warntges S. Friedrich B. Lanzendorfer M. Melzig J. Moschen I. Steuer S. Waldegger S. Sauter M. Paulmichl M. Gerke V. Risler T. Gamba G. Capasso G. Kandolf R.

Taken together, these experiments suggest that SGK1 binds to the β-subunit but activates the channel by phosphorylation of a regulatory protein (45Lang F. Klingel K. Wagner C.A. Stegen C. Warntges S.

A recent report showed that SGK1 might modulate ENaC activity via phosphorylation of Nedd4 (48Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 5: 5Google Scholar).In addition to glucocorticoids, SGK1 is transcriptionally activated by aldosterone. However, the transcriptional activation of SGK1 by aldosterone shows a different time course than by glucocorticoids. SGK1 mRNA is rapidly activated by aldosterone, peaking at 1 h and declining thereafter (49Brennan F.E. Fuller P.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids also activate SGK1 mRNA as early as 30 min, but its expression is maintained at least for 24 h (50Kumar J.M. Brooks D.P. Olson B.A. Laping N.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2488-2494PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that neutral NaCl absorption in the colon is also stimulated by aldosterone (51Turnamian S.G. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G492-G498PubMed Google Scholar, 52Ikuma M.

The aldosterone level has been increased chronically by several different methods including chronic sodium depletion and chronic potassium depletion (52Ikuma M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J.

Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G539-G549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its effect in the distal colon remains unclear (52Ikuma M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Rajendran V.M. Am. J.

Physiol. 1990; 258: G492-G498PubMed Google Scholar) using aldosterone or glucocorticoid receptor-specific steroid RU28362 showed that aldosterone inhibited electroneutral NaCl absorption but activated electrogenic sodium absorption in the rat distal colon, whereas dietary depletion showed no change in electroneutral NaCl absorption in the distal colon (53Cho J.H. Musch M.W. Bookstein C.M. McSwine R.L. Rabenau K. Chang E.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C586-C594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Ikuma et al. (52Ikuma M. Kashgarian M. Binder H.J. Rajendran V.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G539-G549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that, in distal colon, NHE3 activity and mRNA levels decreased by dietary sodium depletion.The present data suggest that NHE3 induction by dexamethasone is not the sole determinant in the glucocorticoid-induced activation of NHE3. Fig. 9 depicts a putative model of glucocorticoids induced activation of NHE3 based on the current findings. Glucocorticoids transcriptionally activate NHE3 and increase the amount of NHE3. At the same time, glucocorticoids rapidly activate SGK1. The novel finding in the current work is that SGK1 interacts with NHERF2 via the PDZ domains to activate NHE3, and this is an essential step in stimulation of NHE3 activity by glucocorticoids. SGK1 may then facilitate translocation of NHE3 to the plasma membrane by a mechanism yet to be defined. Because NHERF2 is associated with the plasma membrane through the interaction with membrane proteins including transport proteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, the association of SGK1 with NHERF2 also suggests that NHERF2 or a protein similar to NHERF2 may be needed to anchor SGK1 to the plasma membrane. Adrenal steroids play a central role in the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance (1Sellin J.H. Field M. J. Clin.

Glucocorticoids such as prednisolone and methylprednisolone have been used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (4Spencer C.M. McTavish D. Drugs. 1995; 50: 854-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Campieri M. Ferguson A. Doe W. Persson T. Nilsson L.G. Gut. 1997; 41: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although in some of these circumstances the antidiarrheal effects of glucocorticoids may result from the direct effect on processes underlying the diseases, it is widely accepted that glucocorticoids have a direct effect on intestinal salt and water absorption. The fact that glucocorticoids have a direct effect on intestinal salt and water absorption has been known for more than two decades (2Meneely R. Ghishan F.K. Pediatr. Res. 1982; 16: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Charney A.N. Kinsey M.D. Myers L. Giannella R.A. Gots R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic doses of methylprednisolone have been shown to increase Na+, Cl+, and water absorption in vivo in both small intestine and colon of the rat. However, the molecular mechanisms by which this homeostasis is achieved at the cellular level remain to be elucidated. The small intestine and colon are major sites for NaCl absorption, and much of the Na+ absorption in the gastrointestinal tract appears to be mediated by coupled Na+/H+exchange and Cl−/HCO3−exchange (7Donowitz M. Welsh M.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 135-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian intestine, Na+/H+exchanger isoform (NHE)1 3 is a component of neutral NaCl absorption, which is a major constituent in basal Na+ absorption and a frequent target of inhibition in many diarrheal diseases (7Donowitz M. Welsh M.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 135-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NHE3 also plays an essential role in the maintenance of systemic pH homeostasis via Na+ and HCO3− reabsorptive processes in renal proximal tubules (8Aronson P.S. Igarashi P. Curr. Topics Membr. Transport. 1986; 26: 57-75Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2084282937,"In the present study, we studied the molecular mechanism underlying cell death induced by a cancer chemoprotective compound benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC). The cytotoxic effect of BITC was examined in rat liver epithelial RL34 cells. Apoptosis was induced when the cells were treated with 20 μm BITC, characterized by the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and caspase-3 activation, whereas no caspase activation and propidium iodide incorporation into cell were detected with 50 μm BITC that induced necrosis.

This was also implicated by the observations that intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species, including superoxide (O2) and hydroperoxides (HPOs), was indeed detected in the cells treated with BITC and that the intracellular HPO level was significantly attenuated by pretreatment withN-acetylcysteine. The treatment with a pharmacological scavenger of O2, Tiron, also diminished the HPO formation by ∼80%, suggesting that most of the HPOs were H2O2 derived from the dismutation of O2.

An important group of compounds that have this property are organosulfur compounds including isothiocyanates (ITCs).1 ITCs are compounds that occur as glucosinolates in a variety of cruciferous vegetables such as Brussica species. Many ITCs are effective chemoprotective agents against chemical carcinogenesis in experimental animals (1Wattenberg L.W. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2991-2994PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wattenberg L.W.

Previous studies have suggested that ITCs inhibit phase I enzymes that are required for the bioactivation of carcinogens and increase carcinogen excretion or detoxification by the phase II enzyme including glutathione (GSH) S-transferase in animal tissues (6Guo Z. Smith T.J. Wang E. Eklind K. Chung F.-L. Yang C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Talalay P. Adv.

In addition, treatment of ITCs induces a stress signaling pathway-, caspase-, and/or p53-dependent apoptosis, which may be one possible mechanism to achieve the anticarcinogenic function (9Yu R. Mandlekar S. Harvey K.J. Ucker D.S. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 402-408PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

On the other hand, we have recently reported the induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by benzyl-ITC (BITC) (14Nakamura Y. Ohigashi H. Masuda S. Murakami A. Morimitsu Y. Kawamoto Y. Osawa T. Imagawa M. Uchida K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar), one of the well known ITC derivatives having a potency for phase II enzyme induction (15Nakamura Y.

Therefore, it has been suggested that oxidative stress may be involved in the ITCs-induced apoptosis (10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).Apoptosis plays important roles in developmental processes, maintenance of homeostasis, and elimination of seriously damaged cells. The aberrant regulation of apoptosis has been observed in many disorders including cancer. The caspases are a novel class of at least 10 cysteine proteases, known to be a general mechanism in the induction of apoptosis. Especially, caspase-3 (CPP32) plays a crucial role in the process of apoptosis (16Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). Numerous therapeutic and preventive agents eliminate cancer cells by inducing apoptotic cell death through the caspase-3 pathway (17Simizu S. Takada M. Umezawa K. Imoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26900-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Involvement of mitochondria has been implicated in several types of stimuli-induced cell death upstream of caspase activation. Activators of apoptosis, such as caspase-9, cytochromec, and apoptosis-inducing factor, are all found in mitochondria (18Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G.

Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Mitochondria also contain proteins that regulate apoptosis, such as members of the Bcl-2 family, namely Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bad, which can prevent and accelerate apoptosis. ROS are recognized as mediators of the apoptotic signaling pathway. Mitochondria are also known to be a major physiological source of ROS, which are generated during mitochondrial respiration and have been implicated as mediators of apoptotic signaling pathway (20Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we studied the regulatory mechanism of cell death elicited by BITC. Here we examined the cell death pattern induced by BITC and found that the mitochondrial death pathway might be involved in BITC-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated for the first time that BITC directly modifies mitochondrial function including mitochondrial swelling and inhibition of respiration. We also indicate the important roles of intracellular defensive factors, including GSH, in the electrophile-induced activation of caspase-3 protease and apoptosis and discuss the redox-sensitive mechanism.DISCUSSIONDiverse types of cancer chemopreventive agents, including naturally occurring and pharmaceutical compounds, have been studied for efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Among the most extensively investigated are the ITCs, which occur naturally in a variety of cruciferous vegetables. BITC is an ITC that has been isolated from papaya fruit as the major phase II enzyme inducer present in organic solvent extracts of this fruit (15Nakamura Y. Morimitsu Y. Uzu T. Ohigashi H. Murakami A. Naito Y. Nakagawa Y. Osawa T. Uchida K. Cancer Lett. 2000; 157: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our interest in the molecular mechanism of the anticarcinogenic effect of BITC stemmed from the following observations: 1) BITC blocks chemical-initiated tumor formation in rats; 2) it is a monofunctional inducer of phase II enzymes in both cultured cells and mouse tissues; 3) the glutathioneS-transferase-inducing potencies of ITCs are closely correlated with their intracellular oxidative stress (14Nakamura Y. Ohigashi H. Masuda S. Murakami A. Morimitsu Y. Kawamoto Y. Osawa T. Imagawa M. Uchida K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) ROS production and the resulting cellular redox change can be part of the signal transduction pathway during apoptosis (10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here we further confirmed by the flow cytometric technique that BITC induced apoptosis in cultured rat liver epithelial cells. Because apoptosis is the end of the cell differentiation pathways of at least the epithelial cells in some tissues, a process that results in apoptosis should minimize the proliferative signal, an important determinant of the tumor promotion process.Caspase-3(-like) activity was markedly activated when RL34 cells were incubated with a limited range of BITC concentrations (Fig.7 C), although having inhibitory but not an enhancing effect on caspase activity. 2Y. Nakamura, A. Yoshihiro, H. Ohigashi, and K. Uchida, unpublished data. These results indicated that BITC-activated caspases not directly, but via some cellular event induced by BITC. Several pathways involved in ITC-triggered apoptosis have been reported; e.g. a JNK-dependent pathway found in Jurkat T-cells (10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), a p53-dependent pathway found in JB6 epidermal cells (11Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Hecht S.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4102-4106PubMed Google Scholar), a Bax, cytochrome c-dependent and p53-independent pathway found in HT29 colon cancer cells. In our system, one of the possibilities involved in the activation of a caspase-3(-like) protease by BITC is a mitochondrial death pathway. Canonical inducers of MPT, such as t-butylhydroperoxide or pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins including Bax, induce the release of cytochrome c, which upon entry into the cytosol forms a complex with other molecules, Apaf-1, and the unprocessed proform of caspase-9 (31Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). We demonstrated herein for the first time that the treatment of cells with BITC-induced caspase-9-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 3, A andB) and rapid ΔΨm alteration (Fig. 4). We observed that BITC in vitro induces cytochrome crelease, accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and inhibition of respiration, from isolated rat mitochondria (Figs. 5 and 6). Following a diverse array of apoptotic stimuli, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria to the cytosol where it participates in activating the caspase cascade leading to cell death. The results in the present study thus provide evidence that cytochrome crelease, through a morphological and functional alteration of the mitochondrial membrane, may be potentially involved in BITC-induced apoptotic responses.Zhang and Talalay (38Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4632-4639PubMed Google Scholar) have quantified the intracellular accumulation of ITCs measured by a probe specifically reacted with ITCs. When murine hepatoma cells were exposed to BITC for 30 min, the intracellular concentration of BITC was increased up to 300 μm (38Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4632-4639PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that BITC at a relatively higher concentration (∼300 μm) is localized around the mitochondria. This speculation was also supported by the present findings that treatment with BITC induced a rapid ΔΨmalteration accompanied by ROS generation. The change in redox potential regulated by thiol (-SH)/disulfide (-SS-) exchange or chemical modification of thiols may also at least in part serve as a regulator of BITC-induced apoptosis, because thiol antioxidants such as GSH, forming dithiocarbamates (R-NH-C(=S)-SR) by means of reaction with BITC, attenuate the intracellular active BITC level and several biological responses (14Nakamura Y. Ohigashi H. Masuda S. Murakami A. Morimitsu Y. Kawamoto Y. Osawa T. Imagawa M. Uchida K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar, 38Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4632-4639PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the pretreatment with DEM, which also blocks intracellular thiol groups including mitochondrial GSH (43Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Arai M. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29294-29302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 45Shrieve D.C. Bump E.A. Rice G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14107-14114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enhanced BITC-triggered apoptosis (Fig.7 B). The optimal concentrations of BITC required to enhance caspase activity were also lowered by DEM treatment (Fig.7 C). We more recently also observed that the pretreatment with NAC prevented apoptotic cell death by ITCs. 3Y. Nakamura, N. Miyoshi, T. Osawa, and K. Uchida, unpublished data. A thiol-alkylating agent such as an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde has been reported to induce respiratory impairment in rat brain mitochondria (36Picklo M.J. Montine T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1535: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Respiratory modulation in rat liver mitochondria by BITC is also likely the result of covalent attachment of BITC to multiple plausible targets. 4M. Kawakami, K. Kawai, and Y. Nakamura, unpublished data. These observations strongly suggested that thiol modification with BITC of a redox-sensitive molecule in the outer membrane of mitochondria may play some roles, although this is not sufficient to answer the question of which acts as a major messenger.Mitochondria are a major physiological source of ROS, which are generated during normal mitochondrial respiration or inhibition of the electron transport chain (46Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We confirmed herein that respiratory modulation of isolated mitochondria and rapid increases in the levels of intracellular ROS including O2 and HPO were induced by the exposure to BITC. It is likely that O2 is easily converted to H2O2 in RL34 cells because the accumulated level of O2 was much lower than that of the HPOs (Fig.8 A). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that treatment of cells with the O2 scavenger Tiron resulted in attenuation of HPO accumulation by at most 80% (Fig. 8 B). These results suggested that the most of the intracellular HPOs are comprised of H2O2, derived from the dismutation of O2. The HPOs other than H2O2 are believed to be lipid HPOs derived from oxidation of mitochondrial inner membrane phospholipids that contain significant amounts of highly unsaturated fatty acids (47Yamaoka S. Urade R. Kito M. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of BITC-triggered generation of ROS is not well understood, a mitochondrion is a potential source of intracellular ROS generated by the treatment of cells with BITC.ROS has also been implicated in the signaling pathways initiated by some apoptosis-inducing stimulants. For example, treatment of mammalian cells by TNF-α triggers the generation of various ROS and apoptosis in an ROS-dependent manner. Pharmacological experiments revealed that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the major source of TNF-α-induced ROS (48Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Antioxidants inhibit various actions of TNF-α, including activation of transcriptional factors, gene expression, and cytotoxicity, supporting the hypothesis that ROS serve as crucial second messengers. A recent report has indicated that O2, but not the secondary compounds downstream of O2, H2O2, and ONOO−, may be selectively involved in TNF-α-induced apoptosis of rat mesangial cells (49Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12684-12691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, apoptosis of MCF-7 cells upon treatment with TNF-α was completely suppressed by the overexpression of Mn-O2 dismutase (50Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Lipid HPOs have a limited role in apoptosis induced by agents, which can modulate a mitochondrial death pathway including 2-deoxyglucose, in rat leukemia cells (43Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Arai M. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29294-29302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the precise roles and source of individual ROS in the cytotoxic action of BITC are currently not well understood. A previous report showed that the pretreatment with NAC prevents JNK activation by ITCs (10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because JNK activation is involved in the process of ITC-triggered apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells, it is suggested that oxidative stress may play an important role. We demonstrated here that a thiol antioxidant, NAC, inhibited BITC-induced ROS generation (Fig.8 B). Although these observations are not sufficient to explain that BITC-triggered apoptosis is mediated mainly by ROS, it is likely that one of the most plausible messengers may be mitochondrion-derived ROS. Although ROS or pro-oxidative agents are well known to induce MPT, Scorrano et al. (51Scorrano L. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12295-12299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) has clearly demonstrated the membrane depolarization-dependent and ROS-independent pathway of permeability transition pore opening, allowing the escape of proapoptotic factors including cytochromec from mitochondria. Further mechanistic study on the relationship between mitochondrial ROS generation and MPT induced by ITCs is essential to provide supporting information.In conclusion, we demonstrate here that BITC dose dependently induces changes in the cell death pattern. BITC-induced apoptosis occurs through a mitochondrial damage-dependent pathway. It should be noted that higher concentrations of BITC produce a large amount of ROS, resulting in severe oxidative damage to caspase activity and/or other cellular components. These oxidative phenomena may lead to necrotic cell death and thus damage to the surrounding cells. Although ITCs are promising and effective candidates as anticarcinogens, some ITCs showed enhancement of carcinogenicity or lack of chemopreventive effects in rat liver and kidney especially dosed at the post-initiation phase (52Ogawa K. Futakuchi M. Hirose M. Boonyaphiphat P. Mizoguchi Y. Miki T. Shirai T. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 53Hirose M. Yamaguchi T. Kimoto N. Ogawa K. Futakuchi M. Sano M. Shirai T. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is very likely that the intracellular ROS generation plays an important role in unfavorable side effects of BITC on carcinogenesis. Because the cancer preventive or promoting potential, threshold, and target organ have to be distinguished in detail, further mechanistic studies on intracellular oxidative stress and the following events induced by ITCs are necessary. A number of studies support that certain food phytochemicals protect against cancer. An important group of compounds that have this property are organosulfur compounds including isothiocyanates (ITCs).1 ITCs are compounds that occur as glucosinolates in a variety of cruciferous vegetables such as Brussica species. Many ITCs are effective chemoprotective agents against chemical carcinogenesis in experimental animals (1Wattenberg L.W. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2991-2994PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wattenberg L.W. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 1971-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Morse M.A. Zu H. Galati A.J. Schmidt C.J. Stoner G.D.

Previous studies have suggested that ITCs inhibit phase I enzymes that are required for the bioactivation of carcinogens and increase carcinogen excretion or detoxification by the phase II enzyme including glutathione (GSH) S-transferase in animal tissues (6Guo Z. Smith T.J. Wang E. Eklind K. Chung F.-L. Yang C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Talalay P. Adv.

In addition, treatment of ITCs induces a stress signaling pathway-, caspase-, and/or p53-dependent apoptosis, which may be one possible mechanism to achieve the anticarcinogenic function (9Yu R. Mandlekar S. Harvey K.J. Ucker D.S. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 402-408PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

On the other hand, we have recently reported the induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by benzyl-ITC (BITC) (14Nakamura Y. Ohigashi H. Masuda S. Murakami A. Morimitsu Y. Kawamoto Y. Osawa T. Imagawa M. Uchida K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar), one of the well known ITC derivatives having a potency for phase II enzyme induction (15Nakamura Y. Morimitsu Y. Uzu T. Ohigashi H. Murakami A. Naito Y. Nakagawa Y. Osawa T. Uchida K. Cancer Lett. 2000; 157: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that oxidative stress may be involved in the ITCs-induced apoptosis (10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Apoptosis plays important roles in developmental processes, maintenance of homeostasis, and elimination of seriously damaged cells. The aberrant regulation of apoptosis has been observed in many disorders including cancer. The caspases are a novel class of at least 10 cysteine proteases, known to be a general mechanism in the induction of apoptosis. Especially, caspase-3 (CPP32) plays a crucial role in the process of apoptosis (16Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). Numerous therapeutic and preventive agents eliminate cancer cells by inducing apoptotic cell death through the caspase-3 pathway (17Simizu S. Takada M. Umezawa K. Imoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26900-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Involvement of mitochondria has been implicated in several types of stimuli-induced cell death upstream of caspase activation. Activators of apoptosis, such as caspase-9, cytochromec, and apoptosis-inducing factor, are all found in mitochondria (18Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar, 19Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Mitochondria also contain proteins that regulate apoptosis, such as members of the Bcl-2 family, namely Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bad, which can prevent and accelerate apoptosis. ROS are recognized as mediators of the apoptotic signaling pathway. Mitochondria are also known to be a major physiological source of ROS, which are generated during mitochondrial respiration and have been implicated as mediators of apoptotic signaling pathway (20Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we studied the regulatory mechanism of cell death elicited by BITC. Here we examined the cell death pattern induced by BITC and found that the mitochondrial death pathway might be involved in BITC-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated for the first time that BITC directly modifies mitochondrial function including mitochondrial swelling and inhibition of respiration. We also indicate the important roles of intracellular defensive factors, including GSH, in the electrophile-induced activation of caspase-3 protease and apoptosis and discuss the redox-sensitive mechanism. DISCUSSIONDiverse types of cancer chemopreventive agents, including naturally occurring and pharmaceutical compounds, have been studied for efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Among the most extensively investigated are the ITCs, which occur naturally in a variety of cruciferous vegetables. BITC is an ITC that has been isolated from papaya fruit as the major phase II enzyme inducer present in organic solvent extracts of this fruit (15Nakamura Y. Morimitsu Y. Uzu T. Ohigashi H. Murakami A. Naito Y. Nakagawa Y. Osawa T. Uchida K. Cancer Lett. 2000; 157: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our interest in the molecular mechanism of the anticarcinogenic effect of BITC stemmed from the following observations: 1) BITC blocks chemical-initiated tumor formation in rats; 2) it is a monofunctional inducer of phase II enzymes in both cultured cells and mouse tissues; 3) the glutathioneS-transferase-inducing potencies of ITCs are closely correlated with their intracellular oxidative stress (14Nakamura Y. Ohigashi H. Masuda S. Murakami A. Morimitsu Y. Kawamoto Y. Osawa T. Imagawa M. Uchida K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) ROS production and the resulting cellular redox change can be part of the signal transduction pathway during apoptosis (10Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237)"

Green fluorescent protein-tagged insulin transfected in MIN6 β cells was packed in insulin secretory granules, which appeared to preferentially dock to the plasma membrane. Upon fusion evoked by secretagogues, evanescent wave microscopy revealed that fluorescence of green fluorescent protein-tagged insulin brightened, spread (within 300 ms), and then vanished. Under KCl stimulation, which represents the 1st phase of release, the successive fusion events were seen mostly from previously docked granules for the first minute, followed by the recruitment of new granules to the plasmalemmal docking sites. Stimulation with glucose, in contrast, caused the fusion events from previously docked granules for the first 120 s, thereafter a continuous fusion (2nd phase of release) was observed over 10 min mostly from newly recruited granules that progressively accumulated on the plasma membrane. Thus, our data revealed the distinct behavior of the insulin granule motion during the 1st and 2nd phase of release.

Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that SNARE (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors) hypothesis (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar) may be applicable to insulin exocytosis in pancreatic β cells (3Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Nagamatsu S. Watanabe T. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Tsuzuki K. Matsushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8053-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); however, the dynamics of insulin granule exocytosis in live pancreatic β cells is poorly understood. Imaging techniques are powerful tools for detecting vesicle exocytosis in live cells and have provided significant advances in understanding the mechanism of exocytosis. In previous studies, synaptic vesicles or granules were labeled with the weak base fluorescent dye acridine orange, which accumulates in acidic compartments in cells (5Steyer J.A. Almers W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2262-2271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 6Oheim M. Loerke D. Stuhmer W. Chow R.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), although acridine orange labels not only secretory granules but also other acidic compartments in cells. To overcome the problem, we produced an expression vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)1fused to human preproinsulin. We found that the GFP-tagged insulin we produced here expressed in MIN6 β cells can specifically label the insulin secretory granules. Therefore, we used this probe combined with evanescent wave microscopy (also called total internal reflection microscopy) to acquire images of the docking and fusion of insulin granules. Evanescent wave microscopy selectively excites subcellular features close to (within ∼100 nm) the plasma membrane at the cell-glass coverslip contact region (8Axelrod D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The advantage of this method over confocal laser microscopy is that only a thin layer (∼100 nm) is illuminated, an excellent fluorescent signal-to-background is obtained, and photo damage is minimized. Because only granules close to the plasma membrane are visible, this method allows us to see with high resolution the single granules approaching, docking, and fusing with the plasma membrane. In the present study, we report the optical observation of exocytosis of the insulin molecule itself stimulated by the physiological secretagogue using evanescent wave microscopy supplemented with the real time images. We thereby reveal the distinct behavior of single insulin granule motion during the 1st and 2nd phase of insulin release. To generate a construct in which GFP is located at the C terminus of preproinsulin, the coding region of human preproinsulin cDNA (a gift from Dr. G. I. Bell, University of Chicago) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using originally designed primers, cleaved by restriction enzymes, and subcloned into vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) encoding enhanced GFP (EGFP) under cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter. The resulting product was confirmed by an automated DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). MIN6 cells (a gift from Dr. J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) at passage 15–30 were cultured as previously described (4Nagamatsu S. Watanabe T. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Tsuzuki K. Matsushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8053-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) on fibronectin (KOKEN)-coated glass chamber slides (8 wells; Lab-Tek slides, Nunc) for imaging with confocal microscopy and on high refractive index glass (Olympus) for imaging with evanescent wave microscopy. MIN6 cells were transfected with the expression vector using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. All experiments were performed between 2 and 3 days after transfection. Transfected cells were fixed, made permeable with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, and processed for immunocytochemistry as described previously (4Nagamatsu S. Watanabe T. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Tsuzuki K. Matsushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8053-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence of GFP was maintained in this condition. Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) was probed with anti-IAPP antibody (a gift from Dr. Donald F. Steiner, University of Chicago; diluted 1:50) and revealed with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO; diluted 1:100). Immunofluorescence staining was detected with a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510). The emission signals were filtered with a 505–530-nm filter (GFP emission excited by argon laser at 488 nm) or with a long pass 590-nm filter (rhodamine emission excited by helium/neon laser at 543 nm). The Olympus total internal reflection system (9Kawano Y. Abe C. Kaneda T. Aono Y. Abe K. Tamura K. Terakawa S. Andrews D.L. Asakura T. Jutamulia S. Kirk W.P. Lagally M.G. Lal R.B. Trolinger J.D. Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 4098; Optical Devices and Diagnostics in Materials Science. SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering, Bellingham, WA2000: 142-151Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Light from an argon laser (488 nm, 3 milliwatts) was introduced to an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus) through a single mode fiber and two illumination lenses; the light was focused at the back focal plane of a high aperture objective lens (Apo 100× OHR; NA 1.65, Olympus). The focal point was moved off-axis to the most peripheral position in the objective lens by simply shifting the position of the fiber. The transfected cells on the glass coverslip (refractive indexn = 1.8 at 488 nm, Olympus) were mounted in an open chamber and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) containing 110 mm NaCl, 4.4 mm KCl, 1.45 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2.3 mm calcium gluconate, 4.8 mm NaHCO3, 2.2 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then transferred to the thermostat-controlled stage (37 °C). Stimulation with KCl and glucose was achieved by the addition of 100 mm KCl-KRB (NaCl was reduced to maintain the isotonicity of the solution) or 52 mm glucose-KRB into the chamber (final = 50 mm KCl or 22 mm glucose). Diiodomethane sulfur immersion oil (n = 1.81 at 488 nm, Cargille Laboratories) was used to make contact between the objective lens and the coverslip. At a measured incidence angle of 61.3° withnglass = 1.8 and ncytosol= 1.38, a 488-nm beam had a calculated penetration depth of about 80 nm (8Axelrod D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Images were collected by a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Micromax, MMX-512-BFT, Princeton Instruments; operated with Metamorph 4.5, Universal Imaging). Images were acquired every 300 ms. Most analyses, including tracking (single projection of difference images) and area calculations, were performed using Metamorph software. To analyze the data, fusion events were manually selected and the average fluorescence intensity of individual granules in a 1- × 1-μm square placed over the granule center was calculated. The number of fusion events was manually counted while looping 1000–2400 frame time-lapses. Sequences were exported as single TIFF files and further processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0, or they were converted into Quick Time movies. After MIN6 cells were plated on 24-multiwell plates, cells were preincubated for 30 min in 2.2 mm glucose and then challenged with 2.2 mmglucose, 22 mm glucose, or 50 mm KCl. The media were collected at 1- or 2-min intervals. At the end of the stimulation period, the cells were disrupted by sonication, and aliquots of media and cell extracts were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously (4Nagamatsu S. Watanabe T. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Tsuzuki K. Matsushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8053-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Released insulin is expressed as a percentage of total cellular content per min. Studies were carried out on the MIN6 cell line, which responds to the physiological range of glucose (10Miyazaki J.-I. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K.-I. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 11Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.-I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) with biphasic insulin release (see Fig. 3E). Firstly, to examine whether GFP-tagged insulin transiently expressed in MIN6 cells was localized to insulin secretory granules, the localization of the intrinsic fluorescence of GFP was compared with that of IAPP, a marker for insulin-containing dense-core secretory granules (12Lukinius A. Wilander E. Westermark G.T. Engstrom U. Westermark P. Diabetologia. 1989; 32: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), in fixed MIN6 cells. The intense punctuate fluorescence of GFP was localized to >94% of IAPP-containing granules stained with anti-IAPP antibodies as detected by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1). These results indicate that most of the GFP-tagged insulin expressed in MIN6 cells is correctly sorted to insulin secretory granules.Figure 1Colocalization of GFP-tagged insulin and IAPPin MIN6 cells. After MIN6 cells were transfected with expression vector encoding GFP-tagged insulin, they were fixed with paraformaldehyde and immunostained with anti-IAPP antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” There was significant overlap (yellow) of the GFP-insulin (green) and IAPP (red) fluorescence intensity. Scale bar: 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have then used evanescent wave microscopy to monitor the real time docking and fusion process of single granules labeled with GFP-tagged insulin near the plasma membrane. Fig.2A shows a region in which GFP-tagged insulin transfected in MIN6 cells was adhered to a coverslip. Granules just beneath the plasma membrane (calculated distance from the coverslip is 80 nm) were visualized as spots of variable intensities. The average diameter is 0.39 ± 0.05 μm (n = 4 cells), which is similar to that observed using electron microscopy (13Orci L. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 163-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), indicating that each spot shows the single vesicle. Under the unstimulated condition (2.2 mm glucose), many granules appeared to dock to the plasma membrane without fusion (see movie 1 in supplemental data). Stimulation with KCl (50 mm), which represents the 1st phase of insulin release (14Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), demonstrated the dramatic change in the dynamics of granule motion, in particular the fusion from previously docked granules. The fluorescence intensity of granules (boxed regions in Fig.2A) transiently increased (observed as a bright flash in movie 1 in supplemental data), spread, and then immediately disappeared (see movie 1 in supplemental data). Fig. 2C shows sequential images (1 × 1 μm, 300-ms intervals) of the single granules observed during KCl stimulation, where red and green boxes correspond to the same colored regions shown in Fig.2A. Note that fluorescent spots suddenly brightened and finally spread (within 300 ms) as GFP-tagged insulin diffused laterally on the plasma membrane. The spread of fluorescence in the single granules indicates exocytosis through fusion, as it represents the release of material from granules (15Zenisek D. Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nature. 2000; 406: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The change of the fluorescence intensity of the fusing granule was relatively rapid; fluorescence transiently increased within approximately 900∼1200 ms and vanished within about 300 ms (Fig. 2D), which is comparable with that observed in adrenal chromaffin cells (16Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that most fusion (90% of total fused granules) evoked by KCl stimulation occurred in the previously docked granules (red column in Fig. 2B and red boxes 1and 2 in Fig. 2C), with only some of the fusion occurring in newly recruited docked granules (green columnin Fig. 2B and green box 3 in Fig.2C), whereas there was no difference in the kinetics of fusion between both types of docked granules (Fig. 2D). Fusion events evoked by KCl stimulation were almost always seen during the first 60 s (Fig. 2B), similar to the typical pattern of the 1st phase of insulin release, which was consistent with the data of endogenous insulin release measured by ELISA (Fig.2E). Daniel et al. (14Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated by biochemical approach that KCl stimulation immediately evoked the fusion of docked granules. In the present study, we not only confirmed their results by a visualizing technique but also directly identified that previously docked granules are responsible for 1st phase of insulin release. We then examined the dynamics of granule motion stimulated by the fuel secretagogue glucose. Glucose (22 mm) stimulation caused fluorescence intensity to increase, spread, and vanish (Fig. 3A; see also movie 2 in supplemental data), as we observed under KCl stimulation. It is interesting that oscillation of fluorescent intensity in docked granules was observed during glucose stimulation, which was not marked by KCl stimulation (see movie 1 in supplemental data). This granule oscillation may be associated to the repetitive firing of Ca2+ induced by glucose metabolism, which usually correlates with oscillating insulin secretion (17Bergsten P. Hellman B. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Mears D. Atwater I. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 47-61Google Scholar, 19Gilon P. Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22265-22268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the relationship between oscillating Ca2+ and granule oscillation is unknown at present, the phenomenon of granule oscillation is the novel finding that is induced by glucose stimulation. It is quite intriguing that the glucose-induced fusion for the first 120 s occurred only from previously docked granules (red column in Fig. 3B and red boxes 1 and2 in Fig. 3C), but after 360 s fusion events from newly recruited docked granules markedly increased (green column in Fig. 3B and green box 3 in Fig.3C). As judged by the data of insulin release as measured by ELISA over the same time course (Fig. 3E), fusion events after at least 360 s represent the 2nd phase of insulin release. It has been suggested that the 2nd phase of release is due to granules that are translocated from a reserve pool to plasma membrane (14Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); however, there has not been any reports to prove it. Here our data from the visualizing technique could clearly depict that fusion events during the 2nd phase of release occur mainly from newly recruited granules. On the other hand, fusion events for the first 120 s, which represents the 1st phase of release, occurred mostly from previously docked granules as observed in KCl stimulation. Thus, on the basis of analysis of single granule motion, we like to propose a theoretical hypothesis, two-compartmental model for the β cell, which was originally proposed by Grodsky et al. (21Grodsky G.M. Curry D. Landahl H. Bennett L. Acta Diabetol. Lat. 1969; 6: 554-578PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grodsky G.M. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 2-11Google Scholar) and recently by Proks et al. (23Proks P. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Rorsman P. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study, fusing granules seem to be fully merged with plasma membrane, and no hemifusion was detected. Because insulin is stored in crystalline form (13Orci L. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 163-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), release of GFP-tagged insulin granules may require the expanded fusion pore (i.e. full fusion). Indeed the rate of increase of fluorescence intensity in the study of INS1 β cells using acridine orange was much faster (7Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (33–100 ms; as well as that observed in synaptic vesicles; see Zenisek et al. (15Zenisek D. Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nature. 2000; 406: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar)) than the rate observed in this study (900∼1200 ms). Thus, it appears that the full fusion of insulin secretory granules predominantly occurs in pancreatic β cells during physiological stimulation. Finally we analyzed the insulin granule motion in detail. Analysis of the behavior of single insulin granules on each sequential image allowed us to divide the docked granules into three types: fused, retreated (paused and then moved back inside the cell without fusing), or stayed in place. By counting the individual granules of these three types on each sequential image (328 and 384 granules, stimulated by KCl or glucose stimulation, respectively), we could track the behavior of docked granules. Under KCl stimulation, the number of previously docked granules continuously decreased due to both fusion and retreat up to 150 s after KCl stimulation (red line in Fig.4A); conversely, the number of newly recruited docked granules started to increase immediately to 150 s after KCl stimulation (green line in Fig.4A). As a result, the total number of docked granules (previously docked granules + newly recruited docked granules) (black line in Fig. 4A) was kept at the same level before and after KCl stimulation (see also superimposed images in Fig. 4A). On the other hand, during glucose (22 mm) stimulation, the number of previously docked granules slowly decreased due to fusion and retreat (red line in Fig. 4B), whereas the number of newly recruited docked granules rapidly and progressively increased from 20 s after stimulation (green line in Fig.4B). Subsequently, the total number of docked granules increased up to ∼140% of the initial number of docked granules during the glucose stimulation (black line; see alsosuperimposed images in Fig. 4B). The activation of recruitment of new granules to docking sites may contribute to refilling of the docked granule pool (ready releasable pool) during the 2nd phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release, and the rate of recruitment of granules from the reserve pool to the docked pool exceeds the rate of exocytosis. Thus, these findings also coincide with a two-compartmental model for the β cell. In conclusion, by combining the highly sensitive evanescent wave microscopy and the strongly fluorescent GFP-labeled granule system, we have clearly shown the motion of single insulin secretory granules in the process of docking and fusion during physiological stimulation. Our data confirm a two-compartmental model for the β cell; furthermore, this method will be useful for clarifying the molecular steps, preceding glucose-induced insulin exocytosis in pancreatic β cells.

Although discovered nearly one hundred years ago, the mechanism by which poliovirus invades the central nervous system (CNS)1and specifically selects motor neurons for destruction remains elusive. Paralytic poliomyelitis is a rare neurologic complication of poliovirus infection (one out of one hundred), as the virus enters humans by ingestion and proliferates largely unnoticed in the gastrointestinal tract. Interestingly, once in the CNS, the virus spares most cells of the CNS parenchyma other than motor neurons from destruction. This unique neurotropism has attracted attention for decades, but no satisfactory explanation has been presented. A major determinant of a virus' pathogenicity is its tissue tropism, which is governed predominantly by the cognate cell surface receptor. The receptor for all three serotypes of poliovirus, CD155 (also known as PVR), is a membrane-associated, single-span glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (1Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The CD155 gene expresses four splice variants of which two are membrane-bound (CD155α and δ) and function as poliovirus receptors. CD155β and γ are secreted isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain (2Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Impaired by the apparently exclusive restriction to primates, CD155 is only slowly revealing its physiological functions. CD155 mRNA expression has been detected by Northern blot analyses in brain, small intestine, placenta, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, and liver (3Ren R. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 296-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Koike S. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 463-480Google Scholar). Similar albeit not identical expression patterns have been found in transgenic mice expressing the human CD155 gene (5Koike S. Taya C. Kurata T. Abe S. Ise I. Yonekawa H. Nomoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,6Ren R. Costantini F. Gorgacz E.J. Lee J.J. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). CD155-tg mice are now well established as a model of human poliomyelitis. Activity of the CD155 promoter in the notochord and floor plate of the developing neural tube of CD155 promoter/LacZ-tg mice suggests that a primary function of CD155 may relate to the development of the CNS during embryogenesis (7Gromeier M. Solecki D. Patel D.D. Wimmer E. Virology. 2000; 273: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The sites of primary infection and gastroenteric replication of poliovirus are thought to be in tonsillopharyngeal tissue and the Peyer's patches of the small intestine (8Bodian D. Am. J. Hyg. 1956; 64: 181-197PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sabin A. Ward R. J. Exp. Med. 1941; 73: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The commonality between these structures is their large concentration of lymphatic cells, but, remarkably, the predominant cells supporting poliovirus proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract of an infected individual remain unknown. As aforementioned, poliovirus infections are mainly restricted to the enteric tract. Viremia, however, is a prerequisite for the progression to poliomyelitis. How poliovirus spreads subsequently from the blood to the CNS is poorly understood. Two pathways have been suggested. First, the virus may directly pass from the blood into the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier (10Yang W.X. Terasaki T. Shiroki K. Ohka S. Aoki J. Tanabe S. Nomura T. Terada E. Sugiyama Y. Nomoto A. Virology. 1997; 229: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis suggests that the virus is transported by retrograde axonal transport ascending from the muscle to the spinal cord and brain (11McCloskey B.P. Lancet. 1950; 1: 659-663Abstract Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has found strong support in experiments with CD155-tg mice (12Ohka S. Yang W.X. Terada E. Iwasaki K. Nomoto A. Virology. 1998; 250: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Gromeier M. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5056-5060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ren R. Racaniello V.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The presence of poliovirions in axons during poliomyelitis has been a long observed phenomenon (15Bodian D. Brain. 1940; 63: 135-177Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Fairbrother R.W. Hurst E.W. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1930; 33: 17-45Crossref Google Scholar). Ohka and colleagues (12Ohka S. Yang W.X. Terada E. Iwasaki K. Nomoto A. Virology. 1998; 250: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) provided direct evidence of poliovirus in the sciatic nerves of tg mice and showed that during retrograde axonal transport the virus remains in the form of an intact 160 S particle. In this study we have focused on one or more possible functions of the intracellular C-terminal domain of CD155 to decipher cell-internal interactions important for protein function, perhaps related to poliovirus pathogenesis. We have therefore analyzed the C-terminal peptides of CD155α and -δ in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Here we describe the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of CD155 with Tctex-1, a light chain subunit of the dynein motor complex. Considering the function of dynein as the major driving force for minus end-directed transport along microtubuli, we propose that we have identified a molecular link between poliovirus and the retrograde axonal transport machinery. Indeed, we consider it possible that the majority of poliovirus infection of the CNS leading to destruction of motor neurons may occur via retrograde axonal transport. We discuss our results in light of most recent findings for two other neurotropic viruses, rabies and herpesvirus. COS-1 and HEK 293, and HEK 293T cells, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin). Two independently derived affinity-purified anti-Tctex-1 polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by S. King (R5205, University of Connecticut, Farmingville, CT) and K. Campbell (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) (17Campbell K.S. Cooper S. Dessing M. Yates S. Buder A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1728-1737PubMed Google Scholar, 18King S.M. Dillman 3rd, J.F.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the intermediate chain of Dynein IC74 (clone 70.1), and against alkaline phosphatase (clone 8B6) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. In addition, anti-CD155 mAbs D171 (19Nobis P. Zibirre R. Meyer G. Kuhne J. Warnecke G. Koch G. J. Gen. Virol. 1985; 66: 2563-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and P44 (A. Nomoto, Tokyo University, Japan) as well as anti-mNectin2 mAb 6B3 (20Aoki J. Koike S. Asou H. Ise I. Suwa H. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Nomoto A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Plasmids were constructed using PCR and standard cloning techniques (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two bait constructs for the yeast two-hybrid screen, pLexA-CD155α or pLexA-CD155δ, were generated by fusing the coding region of the cytoplasmic domains of either CD155α or CD155δ to the LexA DNA-binding domain in the vector pTT38. 2M. Yang, unpublished. pLexA-lam (S. Fields, University of Washington, Seattle) contains amino acids 66–230 of human lamin C fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain. pcDNA-Tctex-1 was generated by recovering the entire EcoRI-XhoI Tctex-1 cDNA insert of clone pCW-1 isolated in the two-hybrid screen (GenBankTM accession number U56255) and inserting it into the pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). pCDNA-CD155(AO) (G. Bernhardt, Max-Dellbrück Center für Molekulare Medizin, Berlin, Germany) contains the entire CD155α cDNA. For generation of GST fusion constructs pGEX-CD155α-cyt and pGEX-Tctex-1, the cytoplasmic domain of CD155α or the entire Tctex-1 coding region was inserted into pGEX-KG (22Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). A mutant pGEX-CD155α-cm, harboring two amino acid changes (K369T, R372L; see Fig.1) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis from pGEX-CD155α-cyt. For pCDNA-AP-CD155α-cyt, the coding region of human secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was recovered from pAPtag4 (J. Flanegan, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), inserted into pCDNA3.1, and fused to the cytoplasmic domain of CD155α. An HeLa cell cDNA library constructed in pGAD-GH (23Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) was used. The yeast tester strain L40 (24Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) was co-transformed with the cDNA library and either plasmid pLexA-CD155α or pLexA-CD155δ and plated onto selection plates, lacking His, Leu, and Trp. Primary positive colonies were replated and tested for LacZ expression by filter binding assay. Prey plasmids of His+/LacZ+ colonies were recovered, transformed into E. coli, and sequenced. The level of interaction of the most strongly positive clone, pCW-1, was determined by β-galactosidase liquid assay. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (25Cuconati A. Xiang W. Lahser F. Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled Tctex-1 protein was generated from plasmid pCDNA-Tctex-1 using the coupled wheat germ in vitro transcription/translation system (TnT by Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 μg of GST fusion protein loaded to beads was incubated with 20 μl of translation product for 30 min at 30 °C, agitating the mixture every 2–3 min, followed by four washes with binding buffer. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography. In a second type of GST pull-down experiment, a cytoplasmic cell lysate of the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A was used as a source of endogenous Tctex-1. Neuro2A cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors. An equivalent of 5 × 106 cells was incubated with 50 μg of GST fusion protein on beads for 3 h at 4 °C under agitation. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE of the eluted proteins and Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antibody R5205 against Tctex-1. In a third pull-down strategy we combined the efficacy of the GST system with the convenience of detection of AP fusion proteins. Plasmid pCDNA-AP-CD155α-cyt or SEAP expression plasmid pAPtag4 were transfected into HEK 293 cells. One milliliter of conditioned medium (containing 1500A405nm/ml/h of AP fusion proteins) was incubated with 100 μg of GST fusion proteins bound to beads and agitated for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed four times with PBS, and the amount of AP protein that was bound to the beads was determined using 9 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (in 1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 0.5 mmMgCl2) as a colorimetric substrate. For analysis of Tctex-1 protein expression, lysates of mouse tissues from adult ICR mice were prepared by sonification. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Tctex-1 antibodies. Intensity of Tctex-1-immunoreactive bands on the exposed film was determined by pixel count analysis of the scanned image with IMAGE 1.61 software (National Institutes of Health). HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with CaPO4 precipitates of plasmids pCDNA-Tctex-1 and pCDNA- CD155(AO). Three days following transfection, cells were lysed and processed as described above for Neuro2A cells. The lysate of 5 × 106 cells was incubated with anti-dynein (IC74) antibody 70.1, a control IgG antibody (anti-mNectin-2, clone 6B3), or anti-CD155 antibodies (D171 and P44). Immune complexes we captured by the addition of Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Tctex-1 antibodies. Fresh, unfixed mouse lumbar spinal cord and sciatic nerve tissues were frozen in O.C.T. cryoprotectant (Tissue-Tek). E13.5 mouse embryos were fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde before cryoprotection. Frozen sections were collected on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, air-dried, and fixed in cold 1:1 methanol/acetone for 90 min at −20 °C. Sections were blocked with PBS containing 5% normal horse and 2% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-Tctex-1 antibodies (17Campbell K.S. Cooper S. Dessing M. Yates S. Buder A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1728-1737PubMed Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking buffer. After 2 h of washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at 37 °C. The sections were washed for 2 h in PBS and mounted with Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan II fluorescence microscope equipped with a model SP401 camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH. The blots were hybridized at 55 °C for 16 h with 32P-labeled probes, made from a DNA fragment containing the complete CW-1 (Tctex-1) sequence (nucleotides 1–713) by the random primed DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). To identify cytoplasmic proteins that interact with CD155, the intracellular domains of CD155α and CD155δ were used as baits in a yeast two-hybrid screening procedure similar to that originally described (26Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 27Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). The majority of His+ colonies showed LacZ activity, expressing different levels of β-galactosidase, as assessed by filter binding assay (data not shown). Four classes of strongly to weakly lacZ-expressing clones were isolated. One group of most strongly positive cDNA clones, termed pCW-1, was isolated from yeast and co-transformed with the plasmid pLexA-CD155α or pLexA-CD155δ. pCW-1 conferred resistance to His− selection only when co-transformed with pLexA-CD155α or pLexA-CD155δ but not with a control plasmid, pLex-lam (Fig. 2). As shown in Table I, β-galactosidase activity was detected only in yeast in which plasmids pCW-1 and pLexA-CD155α or pLexA-CD155δ were co-expressed. There was no activity with either Gal4 or LexA-expressing plasmids, both plasmids together, or when co-transformed with pCW-1 and pLexA-lam. About 2000 units of β-galactosidase activity were produced when the cytoplasmic domains of CD155 and full-length CW1 (Tctex-1, see below) were provided (Table I). This indicated that there is a strong interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of either CD155α or CD155δ and the CW-1 fusion protein expressed in this yeast two-hybrid system.Table IActivation of LacZ reporter gene by Gal4 chimerasDNA-binding domain hybridActivation domain hybridβ-Galactosidase activityLexA-1-aNo plasmid was co-transformed.<1-1-aNo plasmid was co-transformed.Gal4<1LexAGal4<1LexA-lamGal4-Tctex-1<1LexA-CD155α-cytGal4-Tctex-12.38 × 103LexA-CD155δ-cytGal4-Tctex-12.48 × 103Values for β-galactosidase activity (Miller units) are the mean of assays on at least five transformants, each assayed at least twice.1-a No plasmid was co-transformed.

Sequence analysis of the clone pCW-1 revealed a fragment of ∼710 bp fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain. The predicted open reading frame (ORF) was 339 nucleotides long. DNA sequences of 10 individual cDNA clones of pCW-1 were analyzed. All cDNA clones corresponded to the same gene (our GenBankTM accession number U56255), which upon BLAST search was found to be highly homologous to the product of the mousetctex-1 (t complex testis expressed-1) gene (28Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CW-1 and mouse Tctex-1 share ∼88% nucleotide identity and ∼94% amino acid identity along their respective ORFs. While this study was ongoing Watanabe et al. (29Watanabe T.K. Fujiwara T. Shimizu F. Okuno S. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Nakamura Y. Hirai Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) also cloned the human homolog of mouse Tctex-1, identical to our sequence, and named it TCTEL1. We will continue to use the original designation Tctex-1 for the human protein throughout this report. Subsequently, Tctex-1 was identified as a light-chain subunit of the dynein motor complex (18King S.M. Dillman 3rd, J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Dynein exists in two isoforms. Cytoplasmic dynein represents the major driving force of retrograde transport of membrane-bound organelles and vesicles and is involved in spindle movement during mitosis. Axonemal dynein, on the other hand, is the force generator responsible for flagellar and ciliary beating, as is observed in the flagella of sperm or the cilia of the respiratory tract epithelium. Tctex-1 was found to be present in both forms of dynein (18King S.M. Dillman 3rd, J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Except for the overexpression of Tctex-1 mRNA in t-haplotype mice (28Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), little information is available regarding the expression profile of Tctex-1, particularly in humans. We, therefore, performed Northern blot analysis to determine the expression of the Tctex-1 mRNA in human tissues. A radiolabeled DNA probe corresponding to the entire Tctex-1 cDNA detected a single 0.75- to 0.8-kb band in all tissues tested (Fig.3 A). The highest expression of Tctex-1 was observed in skeletal muscle and testis (Fig. 3 A,lanes 6 and 12), whereas the lowest expression was seen in brain and thymus (lanes 2 and 10). This expression pattern matches that observed in mouse and rat (28Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,31King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman 3rd, J.F. Benashski S.E. Do K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because CD155-tg mice are a widely used model for the study of poliomyelitis, we were interested in whether tissue-specific patterns in the expression level of Tctex-1 protein reveal similarities to the patterns observed by Northern blot analyses. For this purpose we prepared whole tissue lysates (see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzed mouse Tctex-1 protein expression by Western blotting. Tctex-1 protein could be detected in all tissues tested, albeit at differing amounts. Protein levels in mouse tissues largely agreed with the mRNA expression in humans (Fig. 3). Especially the high expression in testis (Fig. 3 B, lane 7) and low expression in CNS (lanes 1–3) and liver (lane 6) confirm previously reported results (28Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman 3rd, J.F. Benashski S.E. Do K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the very high levels of Tctex-1 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle in humans is in disagreement with the low levels of Tctex-1 protein found in mouse skeletal muscle (compare Fig. 3 A, lane 6, and Fig. 3 B, lane 4). The reason for this discrepancy is not known. In several tissues the anti-Tctex-1 antibodies recognized a doublet of bands. The presence of a second band was most evident in uterus, spleen, and kidney (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9–11). Mou and coworkers (32Mou T. Kraas J.R. Fung E.T. Swope S.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) found Tctex-1 to be phosphorylated by the Src family kinase p59fyn. Different phosphorylation states may therefore account for the variable apparent size of Tctex-1. The identity of the 20-kDa band in stomach tissue remains unknown (Fig. 3 B, lane 12). We next examined by indirect immunofluorescence the expression of Tctex-1 in mouse tissues most relevant to poliovirus pathogenesis, sciatic nerve, and lumbar spinal cord. Using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (17Campbell K.S. Cooper S. Dessing M. Yates S. Buder A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1728-1737PubMed Google Scholar) in combination with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, we detected Tctex-1 protein in both spinal cord and sciatic nerve (Figs. 4, and 5, respectively). Tctex-1 immune reactivity was higher in embryonal spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (E13.5; Fig. 4 E) when compared with the adult (Fig.4 A). This is in agreement with the developmental regulation of Tctex-1 mRNA expression in CNS and other tissues that has been described by DiBella and colleagues (33DiBella L.M. Benashski S.E. Tedford H.W. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14366-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Among a variety of neuronal cell bodies, Tctex-1 was also expressed in the notably large motor neurons of the anterior horn (Fig. 4 C, arrows). Tctex-1 staining was largely confined to small punctae of homogenous size (Fig. 4 C, and inset). This punctate staining was also observed in the dorsal root where it appeared to be localized along linear tracts, an observation suggesting that it might be associated with sensory nerve fibers (Fig. 4 D). A similar Tctex-1 distribution was found in sciatic nerve (Fig. 5). It should be noted that two independently derived Tctex-1 antisera, whose specificity has been demonstrated previously (17Campbell K.S. Cooper S. Dessing M. Yates S. Buder A. J.

We consider it likely that Tctex-1 may be present in transport vesicles, a conclusion supported by the findings of the groups of Chao and Sung who independently showed the presence of Tctex-1 in axons of cultured neurons (34Yano H. Lee F.S. Kong H. Chuang J. Arevalo J. Perez P. Sung C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and within synaptic vesicles at mossy fiber terminals (35Chuang J.Z.

In a first set of experiments, the GST fusion proteins, bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, were then used in a GST pull-down assay (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar) to determine affinities to in vitro translated 35S-Tctex-1. GST-CD155α-cyt specifically bound Tctex-1 (Fig. 6 B,lane 4), whereas GST alone did not interact with Tctex-1 (lane 2). We also noticed a weak homo-interaction of Tctex-1 with GST-Tctex-1 (lane 3), an observation supporting a recent report by DiBella and co-workers (33DiBella L.M. Benashski S.E. Tedford H.W. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14366-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that Tctex-1 may form a homodimer within the dynein complex. To ascertain whether CD155α could also interact with endogenous Tctex-1 present in neuronal cells, we extended the GST pull-down experiments and replaced Tctex-1 radiolabeled by in vitrotranslation with Tctex-1 from cytoplasmic lysates of mouse Neuro2A cells (Fig. 6 C). The material bound to the glutathione beads was analyzed for the presence of Tctex-1 protein by immunoblotting. As is apparent in Fig. 6 C, CD155α strongly interacted with cellular Tctex-1 (middle panel, lane 5). Neither glutathione beads alone, nor GST complexed to glutathione beads, interacted with endogenous Tctex-1 under the conditions of the assay (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Because both membrane-bound splice variants of CD155, CD155α, and CD155δ, interacted with Tctex-1 in the two-hybrid system, we suspected that the target sequence f"
https://openalex.org/W2047683495,"The Ca2+-triggered release of neurotransmitters is mediated by fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. The molecular machinery that translates the Ca2+ signal into exocytosis is only beginning to emerge. The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin are central components of the fusion apparatus. Assembly of a membrane-bridging ternary SNARE complex is thought to initiate membrane merger, but the roles of other factors are less understood. Complexins are two highly conserved proteins that modulate the Ca2+responsiveness of neurotransmitter release. In vitro, they bind in a 1:1 stoichiometry to the assembled synaptic SNARE complex, making complexins attractive candidates for controlling the exocytotic fusion apparatus. We have now performed a detailed structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analysis of complexin binding to the SNARE complex. We found that no major conformational changes occur upon binding and that the complexin helix is aligned antiparallel to the four-helix bundle of the SNARE complex. Complexins bound rapidly (≈5 × 107m−1 s−1) and with high affinity (≈10 nm), making it one of the fastest protein-protein interactions characterized so far in membrane trafficking. Interestingly, neither affinity nor binding kinetics was substantially altered by Ca2+ ions. No interaction of complexins was detectable either with individual SNARE proteins or with the binary syntaxin·SNAP-25 complex. Furthermore, complexin did not promote the formation of SNARE complex oligomers. Together, our data suggest that complexins modulate neuroexocytosis after assembly of membrane-bridging SNARE complexes."

In this study, we report that the Sec-independent Pf3 coat protein requires the YidC protein specifically for the membrane translocation step. Using photocrosslinking techniques and ribosome-bound Pf3 coat derivatives with an extended carboxyl-terminal region, we found that the transmembrane region of the Pf3 coat protein physically interacts with YidC and the bacterial signal recognition particle Ffh component. We also find that in the insertion pathway, Pf3 coat interacts strongly with YidC only after its transmembrane segment is fully exposed outside the ribosome tunnel. Interaction between Pf3 coat and YidC occurs even in the absence of the proton motive force and with a Pf3 coat mutant that is defective in transmembrane insertion.

The Sec translocase is composed of the integral membrane core subunits SecY and SecE, which function as protein transporters, and the peripheral subunit SecA, an ATPase that functions as a molecular motor to push the protein chain through the SecYE translocase by hydrolyzing ATP (1Mori H. Ito K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 494-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 2Economou A.

The other components of the Sec translocase, such as SecG, SecD, SecF, and YajC, are not absolutely required for protein translocation. Prior to the membrane translocation step, the proteins need to be targeted to the membrane. In bacteria, this is achieved by two major pathways, one involving SecB (reviewed in Ref. 4Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the other involving the signal recognition particle (SRP)1 (reviewed in Ref. 5Herskovits A.A. Bochkareva E.S. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the SecB pathway, SecB, a small molecular chaperone, targets exported proteins post-translationally to the membrane-bound SecA subunit of the Sec translocase (6Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In the SRP pathway, SRP targets membrane proteins co-translationally to the membrane (7Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In bacteria, SRP consists of a 48-KDa protein component, designated Ffh, and a 4.5 S RNA component. SRP is thought to bind to FtsY in its targeting cycle. After targeting by SRP, SecA can also be required for translocation of the periplasmic domains of some membrane proteins (8Neumann-Haefelin C. Schafer U. Muller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). YidC, a homologue of the mitochondrial Oxa1 (9Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

YidC is absolutely essential for the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent M13 coat protein (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E.

It also stimulates the membrane translocation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the Sec-dependent proteins, leader peptidase (Lep) and FtsQ (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 15Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C.

For Sec-dependent membrane proteins, YidC has been shown to cooperate with Sec translocase and to play a possible role in the lateral movement of transmembrane segments out of the Sec translocase complex (15Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Scotti P.A.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, a current model is that YidC functions in association with the Sec translocase or works independently to insert proteins into membranes (18Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Nature. 2000; 406 (577): 575Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whether YidC works with or without the Sec translocase depends on the membrane protein being inserted. Pf3 coat, a 44-amino acid membrane protein, is the major coat protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage Pf3. When Pf3 coat is expressed in Escherichia coli, it inserts into the inner membrane with a single transmembrane segment adopting an Nout/Cin topology. Pf3 coat has been used as a model protein to study Sec-independent membrane insertion (21Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was widely believed that Pf3 coat inserts directly into the bilayer of the bacterial inner membrane without the assistance of proteinaceous factors (22Ridder A.N. Morein S. Stam J.G. Kuhn A. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6521-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, because recent studies show that the Sec-independent M13 procoat protein requires YidC for membrane insertion (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 14Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), Pf3 coat protein might first contact YidC and require its function for translocation across the membrane. In this study, we show that in a strain in which YidC is depleted, the membrane insertion of wild-type Pf3 coat is severely affected. Using a photocrosslinking method and Pf3 coat mutants in which the carboxyl-terminal regions are extended, we found that YidC, but not SecY, interacts with Pf3 coat protein after its transmembrane segment emerges from the ribosome. We have also shown that YidC can interact with Pf3 coat when it is partitioned into but not translocated across the membrane, suggesting that YidC plays a specific role for membrane translocation. The E. coli YidC depletion strain, JS7131, was from our laboratory collection (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For in vivo studies, the genes of Pf3 coat, its mutants, and Pf3-P2 (Pf3 coat extended with Lep P2 soluble domain at its carboxyl terminus) were under the control of the tac promoter in vector pMS119. pMS119 also carries the lacIq gene necessary for studies in JS7131. For in vitro studies, the truncated Pf3-P2 mRNA was transcribed from the T7 promoter in the pT7-7. pET610, harboring secYEG genes under the control of the Trc promoter, was a generous gift from Arnold Driessen's laboratory. JS7131 strain bearing wild-type Pf3 coat or its mutants, or Pf3-P2 in pMS119, was grown in LB medium with 0.2% arabinose overnight. The overnight culture was washed with LB medium twice and back-diluted 1 to 50 into fresh LB containing either 0.2% glucose or 0.2% arabinose. The cultures were grown for 2.5 h and shifted to M9 minimal medium supplemented with arabinose (to express YidC) or glucose (to deplete YidC) and grown for an additional 30 min. Ten min prior to labeling, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. The cells were labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s and chased for various times. In vivo protease mapping was performed to determine whether the amino-terminal domain of Pf3 coat protein translocates across the membrane as described (24Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled cells were resuspended in 33 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and a 40% sucrose solution, treated with 5 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm EDTA (final concentrations), and incubated on ice for 15 min to convert the cells into spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were then treated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h on ice. The reaction was quenched with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.33 mg/ml, final concentration) and then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to immunoprecipitation or directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Pf3 coat can be analyzed directly without immunoprecipitation using a 22% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing urea (25Boeke J.D. Russel M. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), because there is no background of radiolabeled proteins in the region of the gel of less than 6 KDa. Pf3-P2 can be analyzed by immunoprecipitation with antiLep serum. The cells expressing Pf3 coat were labeled with trans-[35S]methionine and converted into spheroplasts as described under “In VivoProtease Mapping.” 0.2 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) was added to the spheroplast suspensions. The suspensions were then vigorously vortexed and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation for 1 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm) to remove non-lysed cells and cell debris, the sample was subjected to ultracentrifugation (130,000 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant and membrane pellets were carefully separated, subjected to 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. The E. coli S100 in vitro translation system was made according to Gold and Schweiger (26Gold L.M. Schweiger M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 537-542Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Site-specific photocrosslinking was performed based on the procedure as described (27Graf R. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Martoglio B. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. 4. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 495-501Google Scholar). Amber codons were introduced into the Pf3 coat gene at various positions to allow the incorporation of the photoactivatable amino acid analogue (Tmd)Phe (l-4′-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl)phenylalanine) (28Brunner J. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 154-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using T4 RNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), (Tmd)Phe-pdCpA was covalently joined to the E. colisuppressor tRNAAsn (29Cload S.T. Liu D.R. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) made using T7 Megashortscriptin vitro transcription kit from Ambion. PCR was used to generate the truncated gene fragments from which the truncated mRNA transcripts were made using the T7 Megashortscript in vitrotranscription kit. The inverted membrane vesicles were prepared according to the procedure (30Rhoads D.B. Tai P.C. Davis B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For photocrosslinking studies, the truncated mRNA and (Tmd)Phe-charged tRNAAsn were added to the E. coli S100 in vitro translation system to produce the [35S]methionine-labeled Pf3 coat nascent protein. Inner membrane vesicles were added to the translation reactions 4 min after the reactions were initiated at 37 °C, and the reaction was continued for 40 min at 37 °C. The reactions were then irradiated with 360 nm of ultraviolet light for 30 min at 4 °C to perform photocrosslinking. The reactions were then subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation or immunoprecipitation. The SecY positive control was synthesized using pET610 (containing thesecY gene) with the T7 S30 circular DNA in vitro translation system (Promega). In this system, we took advantage of endogenous E. coli RNA polymerase instead of T7 RNA polymerase. For SecY immunoprecipitation, the samples were not heated, to avoid aggregation. We have demonstrated that M13 Procoat, a Sec-independent protein, requires YidC for membrane insertion (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in whether the single membrane-spanning Pf3 coat may also require YidC for membrane insertion. Previously, Pf3 coat was shown to insert into the E. coli inner membrane without the aid of the Sec translocase (31Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). E. coli JS7131 cells (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) were grown in the presence of arabinose to express YidC or glucose to deplete YidC. Cells expressing Pf3 coat protein were labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s and chased for various times. Protease mapping was performed to monitor the membrane insertion of Pf3 coat. Because the methionine at position 1 is the only methionine in the Pf3 coat protein, only Pf3 coat with an intact amino terminus can be detected by autoradiography (see Fig.1 a). When YidC was present (Fig. 1 b, YidC +), Pf3 coat was inserted normally across the membrane with an Nout/Cin topology and was digested to a nonradiolabeled fragment by proteinase K added to the periplasmic side. In YidC-deficient cells (Fig. 1 b,YidC −), Pf3 coat was protected by the membrane from proteinase K digestion, indicating that it does not insert across the membrane even after a 2-min chase period. This demonstrates that Pf3 coat protein requires YidC for transmembrane insertion. Because Pf3 coat requires YidC for membrane insertionin vivo, we analyzed whether YidC physically interacts with Pf3 coat during insertion and whether other proteins interact with Pf3 coat. Site-specific photocrosslinking (28Brunner J. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 154-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was applied to study Pf3 coat membrane biogenesis in vitro. With this technique, a truncated mRNA is generated that lacks the termination codon and therefore the nascent protein chains are not released from the ribosome. Ribosome-nascent chains trapped in the translocation process can then be subjected to cross-linking to identify interacting proteins. The length of wild-type Pf3 coat (44 amino acids) is too short for the photo-cross-linking technique, because 35–40 amino acids are estimated to reside within the ribosomal tunnel upon arrest of translation. To make Pf3 coat suitable for photocrosslinking, we have lengthened the protein with a sequence of the leader peptidase (Lep) soluble P2 domain (the hybrid is called Pf3 P2, Fig.1 a). The hybrid protein shows the same YidC dependence as Pf3 coat (Fig. 1 c). Pf3-P2 was expressed in the JS7131 strain and subjected to proteinase K mapping. In the cells grown with arabinose to express YidC (Fig. 1 c,YidC +), Pf3-P2 was digested to a smaller fragment, whereas in the cells grown with glucose to deplete YidC (Fig.1 c, YidC −), Pf3-P2 was fully protected, indicating that Pf3-P2 is also YidC-dependent. Ribosome-attached Pf3-P2 nascent proteins were site-specifically modified with the photoactivatable cross-linking group (Tmd)Phe (l-4′-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl)phenylalanine). Amber suppressor tRNA charged with (Tmd)Phe enabled incorporation of the photoprobe into the Pf3 coat transmembrane segment at positions Thr-20, Ile-27, and Leu-34 (Fig.2 a). A PCR method was employed to generate the truncated Pf3-P2 gene fragment for each amber mutant coding for a 91-amino acid protein. After synthesis, the Pf3 coat portion of 44 amino acids should be fully exposed from the ribosome, whereas the Lep P2 domain remains in ribosomal tunnel. Each truncated mutant protein was synthesized in vitro in the presence of inverted membrane vesicles. During the synthesis, each reaction was exposed to UV radiation. Pf3 coat was cross-linked to YidC and also to Ffh when the (Tmd)Phe photoprobe was located within the transmembrane segment (Fig. 2 b) at positions Thr-20, Ile-27, and Leu-34. UV irradiation resulted in two major cross-linking products with apparent molecular weights of 60 and 70 KDa. Immunoprecipitation with antiserum to YidC or with antiserum to Ffh (Fig. 2 b) confirmed that the 70-KDa cross-linking product corresponds to the YidC-Pf3 coat adduct and the 60-KDa product is the Ffh-Pf3 coat adduct. The molecular masses of the cross-linked products (Pf3-YidC and Pf3-Ffh adducts) are consistent with the combined sizes of the individual components (the 91-amino acid Pf3 coat protein is ∼10 KDa; YidC, 60 KDa; and Ffh, 48 KDa). We also introduced the photoprobe into the Pf3 coat amino tail (at position Leu-12) and observed almost no cross-linking between Pf3 coat and YidC (data not shown). These studies are consistent with YidC promoting membrane insertion by physically interacting with the Pf3 coat hydrophobic segment and not with the hydrophilic region. To test whether the interaction of the Pf3 coat to YidC occurs only during membrane translocation, photocrosslinking using the Pf3 coat L34 amber mutant (the total nascent chain length is 91 amino acids) was carried out after treating the translocation intermediates with puromycin/high salt (potassium acetate) (Fig. 2 c). Puromycin/high salt treatment releases the truncated nascent protein from the ribosome so that no translocation intermediates will be formed (15Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When the puromycin/high salt treatment was carried out for 5 min prior to UV irradiation (Fig. 2 c, Puro +), the photocrosslinking between YidC and Pf3 coat was substantially reduced compared with the nontreated sample (Fig. 2 c, Puro−). This suggests that when Pf3-P2 is released from the ribosome, it cannot form translocation intermediates with YidC, which therefore indicates that the Pf3 coat-YidC interaction occurs only during Pf3 coat membrane insertion. Taken together, the photocrosslinking data clearly demonstrate that YidC as well as Ffh can interact physically with Pf3 coat during its membrane insertion. To study at which stage Pf3 coat interacts with YidC during membrane insertion, we used truncated mRNA to synthesize nascent Pf3 coat proteins of different lengths,i.e. 56-Pf3, 64-Pf3, 72-Pf3, 80-Pf3, and 91-Pf3, which have 56, 64, 72, 80 and 91 amino acids, respectively. In addition, the photoprobe (Tmd)Phe was incorporated by introducing an amber codon at position Thr-20 in 56-Pf3 and 64-Pf3 or at position Leu-34 in 72-Pf3, 80-Pf3, and 91-Pf3 (Fig.3 a). For nascent chains that remain bound to the ribosomes, about 35 amino acids will be trapped within the ribosomal tunnel. Therefore, as the nascent chains increase in length from 56 to 64 to 72 residues, the Pf3 coat proteins gradually expose their transmembrane regions (residues 19–36) from the ribosomal tunnel, whereas in 80-Pf3 or 91-Pf3 the transmembrane segment is fully exposed. The series of truncated nascent proteins should therefore represent insertion intermediates (32Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 142-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) by which the Pf3 coat protein leaves the ribosome to contact and insert into the membrane. Photo-cross-linking was performed to investigate at which stage of the membrane biogenesis pathway YidC interacts with Pf3 coat. To do this, the photocrosslinking products of the nascent chains were analyzed either directly (Fig. 3 b) or after immunoprecipitation with antiserum to YidC (Fig. 3 c,left panel,IP,YC). The data show that the interaction between YidC and Pf3 coat is most intense when the transmembrane segment of Pf3 coat is fully exposed from the ribosome (80-Pf3 and 91-Pf3). This finding indicates that YidC interaction is more efficient when the carboxyl-terminal region of the Pf3 coat protein is exposed from ribosomal tunnel. We also checked whether YidC in the photocrosslinking described above was cross-linked to SecY. The photocrosslinking products of the different Pf3 coat truncated proteins (56-Pf3, 64-Pf3, 72-Pf3, 80-Pf3, and 91-Pf3) were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to SecY (Fig.3 c,left panel,IP,SY). No SecY-Pf3 coat cross-linking products were detected among the series of the nascent proteins, which represent different stages of Pf3 coat membrane insertion (Fig. 3 c,left panel,IP,SY). As a positive control, we showed that the antiserum to SecY immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled SecY, which was synthesized in vitro in an E. coli S30 translation system (Fig. 3 c,right panel). These data are consistent with Pf3 coat protein not contacting SecY. The fact that YidC mediates membrane insertion of Pf3 coat, a Sec-independent protein, implies that YidC can work independently of the Sec translocase. Pf3 coat membrane insertion can be understood as a process of three steps; i.e. the first step is targeting of Pf3 coat protein to the membrane, the second step is partitioning of the Pf3 coat hydrophobic domain into the membrane lipid bilayer, and the final step is the formation of a transmembrane helix with concomitant membrane translocation of the amino-terminal region (23Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the third step, the proton motive force (pmf) is required for the electrophoretic transfer of the amino-terminal tail, which contains two negatively charged amino acid residues (33Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our data obtained by photocrosslinking suggests that YidC functions at the stage of membrane insertion, which might be the membrane partitioning step (the second step) or the orientation step (the third step), to form the transmembrane form of the protein. Therefore, we dissected the membrane insertion of Pf3 coat to determine at which stage YidC functions. First, we investigated whether YidC is important for the partitioning of the hydrophobic domain of Pf3 coat into the membrane. We used sodium carbonate extraction, which distinguishes peripherally bound proteins from integral membrane proteins. Pf3 coat was pulse-labeled for 20 s in YidC-induced JS7131 cells (treated with arabinose) or YidC-depleted JS7131 cells (treated with glucose). After converting the cells into spheroplasts, the cells were extracted with sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) and then subjected to ultracentrifugation to separate the membrane fraction (pellet) and cytosolic fraction (supernatant). As a control, we confirmed by using proteinase K mapping that the insertion of Pf3 coat was essentially 100% blocked when YidC was depleted (data not shown). The carbonate extraction study showed that almost all the Pf3 coat was found in the membrane fraction when YidC was expressed by the addition of arabinose (Fig.4 a,YidC +). In the YidC-depleted cells, only ∼40% of the Pf3 coat is in the membrane fractions, and ∼60% of Pf3 coat was extracted into the supernatant (Fig. 4 a,YidC −). This indicates that without YidC, more than half of the Pf3 coat cannot stably partition into the membrane and is extracted. The 40% of Pf3 coat detected in the membrane was still protected from proteinase K digestion, indicating that this portion of Pf3 coat is not oriented correctly in the Nout/Cin topology. These data suggest that YidC plays a role to orient Pf3 coat in the transmembrane configuration. Therefore, when YidC is absent, the hydrophobic region of Pf3 coat does not span the membrane and can be more easily extracted by sodium carbonate. The pmf is involved in membrane translocation of the negatively charged residues located within the amino-terminal region of Pf3 coat protein. What is the relationship between the function of YidC and the pmf? We applied photocrosslinking to investigate whether the interaction between Pf3 coat and YidC still occurs if the pmf is destroyed. The 91 amino acid-nascent Pf3 coat protein with amber mutation at L34 was used for photocrosslinking in the presence or absence of 140 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore that dissipates the pmf. As previously shown by Kiefer and Kuhn (23Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), CCCP can efficiently abolish the pmf under thesein vitro conditions. Fig. 4 b (left panel) shows that there is no difference in the YidC-Pf3 coat photocrosslinking products between the non-CCCP-treated and CCCP-treated photocrosslinking reactions. This result indicates that the pmf is not necessary for YidC to interact with Pf3 coat and that YidC does not function after the pmf-requiring step. Rather, YidC might act synergistically with the pmf to orient Pf3 coat in the membrane, whereby the pmf acts upon the negatively charged amino-terminal tail and YidC functions by interaction with the hydrophobic segment. In addition, because YidC is a membrane protein, the cross-linking of Pf3 coat to YidC corroborates that Pf3 coat can partition into the membrane in the absence of the pmf. We next examined a Pf3 coat mutant, Pf3–4N, which cannot translocate its hydrophilic domain across the membrane, as judged by protease mapping experiments (23Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This mutant lacks negative charges in the amino-terminal tail on which the pmf acts, and therefore the pmf cannot drive the neutral N-terminal tail across the membrane. Truncated nascent chains of 91 residues with the photoprobe at the Leu-34 position were synthesized to study possible interactions with YidC. The photocrosslinking products were immunoprecipitated with YidC antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Fig. 4 b(right panel) shows that strikingly Pf3–4N can interact with YidC with approximately the same efficiency as wild-type Pf3 coat. We believe that this Pf3 coat mutant, like the wild-type Pf3 coat that accumulates when the pmf is abolished, has an Nin/Cin topology. In both cases, the proteins are partitioned into the membrane and are able to interact with membrane-bound YidC (see Fig. 4 c for proposed intermediates). We also show that YidC can be cross-linked to another Pf3 coat mutant, Pf3-RD, although its membrane insertion orientation (Cout/Nin) is opposite to that of wild-type Pf3 coat (33Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 b,right panel). Taken together, the photocrosslinking data demonstrate that the Pf3 coat-YidC interaction occurs independently of the charges flanking the transmembrane segment of Pf3 coat. These findings are also consistent with the idea that the Pf3 coat-YidC interaction takes place prior to or at the same time as the pmf-requiring step. We have presented data showing for the first time that YidC interacts directly with a Sec-independent membrane protein, namely the Pf3 coat protein, and promotes its membrane insertion. Previously, we have shown that YidC promotes the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent M13 procoat protein (13Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, we could not rule out the possibility that YidC depletion was causing an indirect effect, thereby inhibiting membrane protein insertion. In this study, we have found, using photocrosslinking, that ribosome-bound Pf3 coat nascent chains are cross-linked to YidC when the photoprobe is located either in the center or toward the amino- or carboxyl-terminal ends of the transmembrane segment (Fig. 2). Moreover, we found that YidC binds to a nontranslocated membrane protein, as it is directly cross-linked to Pf3–4N, which cannot insert across the membrane (Fig. 4). In our photocrosslinking studies, we extended the carboxyl terminus of Pf3 coat such that we could fully expose the hydrophobic domain (residues 19–36) during synthesis with the protein still attached to the ribosome. This was necessary because Pf3 coat is too short when the ribosome is attached, as around 35∼40 amino acids residues are within the ribosome. The Pf3 coat with the extended carboxyl-terminal region, called Pf3-P2, was completely YidC-dependent for membrane insertion (Fig. 1). Efficient cross-linking to YidC was observed only when the carboxyl-terminal region of Pf3 coat had emerged from the ribosome. No cross-linking of Pf3 coat was observed to SecY. These data are consistent with Pf3 coat being inserted by means of a Sec-independent mechanism (31Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our cross-linking results show some differences and similarities to those obtained with FtsQ, a Sec-dependent membrane protein, which has been investigated using the same photocrosslinking methodology (15Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They are different because the hydrophobic domain of FtsQ first inserts in an environment around SecY and then moves toward YidC. The proposed function of YidC is to integrate the transmembrane regions into the membrane bilayer (19Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Muller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our studies with the Sec-independent Pf3 coat are similar to those of FtsQ in that both of these proteins contact YidC efficiently when the transmembrane segments are fully exposed from the ribosomal tunnel. This similarity suggests that YidC may function in a common way for Sec-dependent and Sec-independent proteins. The actual function of YidC might be that of a membrane chaperone to enable the hydrophobic segments of either Sec-dependent or Sec-independent proteins to properly integrate into the lipid bilayer in a transmembrane configuration. Although the precise function of YidC is not known, it is required for the translocation of the hydrophilic domain of Pf3 coat across the membrane. We found that the Pf3-RD mutant, which inserts also with the inverted topology, interacts with YidC (Fig. 4). Importantly, the Pf3–4N mutant, which does not translocate its hydrophilic domain across the membrane, still interacts with YidC (Fig. 4), indicating that YidC recognizes the nontransmembrane coat protein. In addition, YidC still interacts with nascent Pf3 coat proteins that are in the process of inserting in the membrane even when the pmf is abolished by the addition of CCCP. We propose that YidC and the pmf act synergistically to promote membrane insertion, whereby YidC associates with hydrophobic segments and the pmf acts on negatively charged residues. When YidC is depleted within the cell membrane, the hydrophobic region of wild-type Pf3 coat still partitions into the membrane, but some of it falls off of the membrane under alkaline conditions (Fig. 4 a). This is in contrast to the M13 procoat protein, which still partitions into the membrane and does not fall off of the membrane in YidC-depleted cells (14Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, M13 procoat protein has an additional hydrophobic segment that most likely promotes the hydrophobic interaction of the protein with the membrane. In addition to YidC interacting with Pf3 coat with an extended carboxyl-terminal region, we found that Ffh may contact the Pf3 coat protein in the membrane targeting and insertion pathway (Figs. 2 and3). The Ffh-Pf3 coat interaction might be enhanced because Pf3-P2 is bound to the ribosome and has a better chance to interact productively with Ffh at the ribosome. The wild-type Pf3 coat protein does not require Ffh for membrane insertion. 2M. Chen and R. Dalbey, unpublished data. We propose a new model for Pf3 coat membrane biogenesis (Fig.5) based on the data in this study and on previously published work (23Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After Pf3 coat is targeted to the surface of the membrane, its hydrophobic segment partitions into the membrane and moves into an environment near YidC, with the Pf3 coat polar amino-terminal tail region and positively charged carboxyl-terminal region located in the aqueous cytosol. Finally, the electrical potential (Δψ), a component of the pmf, translocates the amino-terminal tail across the membrane by an electrophoretic mechanism, and at the same time YidC mediates the transmembrane segment insertion. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time, using the photocrosslinking approach, that YidC acts directly on a Sec-independent substrate to promote its membrane insertion. YidC functions at a stage of membrane insertion by associating with the membrane-bound hydrophobic region (Fig. 3) and then helping the inserting protein to orient into the transmembrane form (Fig. 4). The YidC-Pf3 coat interaction can occur even when the pmf is disrupted with CCCP and with a Pf3 coat protein mutant that cannot integrate across the membrane. Taken together, the data support the notion that the YidC-Pf3 coat interaction takes place during or before the pmf-requiring step of membrane protein insertion.

These proteins are essential for embryonic development and for angiogenesis in a variety of physiological and pathological circumstances (1Ferrara N. Alitalo K. Nat.

VEGF is the most critical inducer of vascular formation and angiogenesis as it is required to initiate the formation of immature vessels by vasculogenesis or angiogenic sprouting during embryonic development as well as in adults. Members of the angiopoietin family, such as Ang-1 and Ang-2, are required for further remodeling and maturation of the vasculature (3Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). There are two known VEGF tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR) (4Ferrara N.

Neuropilin-1 has been shown to be an isoform-specific VEGF receptor able to bind the heparin-binding VEGF isoforms (5Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). VEGFR-1 is thought to play a negative role in the regulation of angiogenesis acting as a “decoy” receptor at least in some circumstances (6Gille H. Kowalski J. Yu L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4064-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).

VEGF stimulation leads to a robust autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and activation of the MAPK cascade (7Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 67: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which may directly contribute to endothelial cell proliferation. VEGF also induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PI 3-kinase in endothelial cells (9Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase, mediated by VEGFR-2, contributes to the chemotactic effects of VEGF (6Gille H. Kowalski J. Yu L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N.

Activation of PI 3-kinase is also strongly implicated in VEGF-induced endothelial cell survival via its downstream target serine/threonine kinase Akt (9Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M.

Akt promotes cellular survival by suppressing the activity of proapoptotic proteins, such as caspase-9 in monocytes, and by inducing the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and A1, in vascular endothelial cells (10Gerber H.P.

Physiol. 1993; 265: H586-H592PubMed Google Scholar) are believed to be coupled to nitric oxide (NO) production. VEGF has been shown to induce the release of NO from vascular endothelial cells by increasing phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (13Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L.

Phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 by Akt directly stimulates eNOS activity and NO production (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest the existence of local, tissue-specific regulators of endothelial cell phenotype and growth (15Stewart P.A.

The morphology and functions of endothelial cells vary extensively among different organs. While endothelial lineage is genetically determined, expression of a set of vascular bed-specific genes is regulated at the transcriptional level following interaction with local signaling pathways (17Aird W.C.

Expression of human EG-VEGF mRNA is restricted to the steroidogenic glands, ovary, testis, adrenal, and placenta. EG-VEGF promoted proliferation, migration, and fenestration in cultured capillary endothelial cells derived from such endocrine glands. It also induced extensive angiogenesis when delivered in the ovary but not in the skeletal muscle or in the cornea. In contrast, VEGF induced angiogenesis in all the organs tested (18LeCouter J.

EG-VEGF is most likely the human orthologue of VPRA, and the two proteins display 80% homology (18LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L.

The other members of this family include the secreted protein from the frogBombina variegata, Bv8 (21Mollay C. Wechselberger C. Mignogna G. Negri L. Melchiorri P. Barra D. Kreil G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 374: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and its mammalian orthologues (22Wechselberger C. Puglisi R. Engel E. Lepperdinger G. Boitani C. Kreil G.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), the digestive enzyme colipase (24Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 477-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and theXenopus head-organizer protein dickkopf (25Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). EG-VEGF/VPRA shows a high degree of homology (70–76%) to the Bv8 protein and its murine and human orthologues. The common structural motif in this family is five pairs of disulfide bonds with conserved span that are predicated to form similar globe foldings. This was demonstrated in the superimposable global folds of the solution structure of VPRA and the crystal structure of colipase despite only 17% sequence identity between these proteins, the least among the five proteins (26Boisbouvier J. Albrand J.P. Blackledge M. Jaquinod M. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Marion D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).In the present study we have analyzed the signal transduction events elicited by EG-VEGF in adrenal cortex-derived endothelial (ACE) cells. EG-VEGF was able to activate similar pathways as VEGF, most notably the MAPK and PI 3-kinase/Akt pathways. Both signaling pathways were essential for the activity of EG-VEGF on proliferation, migration, and survival in ACE cells.DISCUSSIONThe present results show that, similar to VEGF, EG-VEGF induces activation of MAPK and PI 3-kinase in ACE cells, leading to proliferation, migration, and survival. The dose-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK p44/p42 was used as a sensitive readout of EG-VEGF activity. The nearly complete inhibition by pretreatment with PD 98059 indicates that the activation of MEK1/2 is necessary for EG-VEGF-induced MAPK p44/42 phosphorylation.We also observed phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 in ACE cells in response to EG-VEGF. Compared with VEGF, Akt phosphorylation induced by EG-VEGF was less intense, yet more prolonged. Similar to that induced by VEGF, EG-VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt was wortmannin-sensitive, indicating that the phosphorylation was downstream of PI 3-kinase activation. The induction of prolonged phosphorylation of Akt contributed significantly to ACE cell migration as reflected in our migration assay and is also likely to be crucial for the antiapoptotic effect of EG-VEGF. However, this pathway appears to contribute less to ACE cell growth relative to that of phosphorylated MAPK p44/42. Akt has been reported to directly phosphorylate eNOS at Ser-1177 (32Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T. Bozinovski S. de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), which leads to activation of eNOS. Several lines of evidence indicate that eNOS is an important modulator of angiogenesis and vascular tone (33Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M. Bauters C. Masuda H. Kalka C. Kearney M. Chen D. Symes J.F. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). VEGF has been shown to induce the release of NO from endothelial cells from a variety of species (34Yang R. Bunting S. Ko A. Keyt B.A. Modi N.B. Zioncheck T.F. Ferrara N. Jin H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 103-110PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, VEGF stimulates human endothelial cells to grow in a NO-dependent manner and promotes NO-dependent formation of vessel-like structures in a three-dimensional collagen gel model (35Papapetropoulos A. Garcia-Cardena G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NO production by eNOS inhibitors significantly inhibited VEGF-induced mitogenic and angiogenic effects (36Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.T. Donnini S. Granger H.J. Bicknell R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 99: 2625-2634Crossref Google Scholar). Although we found that EG-VEGF-induced phosphorylation of eNOS in ACE cells is dependent on PI 3-kinase and Akt activation, we did not observe significant effects of eNOS inhibitors on ACE cell proliferation or migration (data not shown).The fact that the effects of EG-VEGF in ACE cells are very similar to those induced by VEGF raised the possibility that EG-VEGF may require VEGF to elicit activation of the MAPK pathway. EG-VEGF and VEGF do not show any sequence or structural homology. Thus, it is very likely that distinct membrane receptors exist for the two molecules. Our data suggest that EG-VEGF receptor might be a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) or at least that Gαi is required to mediate MAPK activation. EG-VEGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation was PTX-sensitive, whereas PTX failed to inhibit VEGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation in the same experiment. This is consistent with the notion that VEGF activates downstream signaling following binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (4Ferrara N. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 794-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In contrast, EG-VEGF failed to induce detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in ACE cell membranes. However, given the limited sensitivity of such phosphotyrosine blots, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the EG-VEGF receptor may have a weak tyrosine kinase activity. Indeed, it is well established that several receptor tyrosine kinases can cross-talk to GPCR (37Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In the case of the IGF-1 receptor, there is evidence not only for an association with multiple G proteins but also for an intrinsic GPCR function (38Dalle S. Ricketts W. Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15688-15695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).It is now increasingly apparent that, in addition to a well characterized pathway leading to MAPK activation following ligand-induced tyrosine kinase receptor autophosphorylation, many GPCRs, which lack intrinsic kinase activity, are also able to effectively activate MAPK (39van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 40van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). These includes the receptors for such diverse ligands as bombesin, endothelin-1, somatostatin, interleukin-8, oxytocin, LPA, etc. Receptors coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are integral membrane proteins involved in the transmission of signals from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm (42Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that MAPK activation by GPCR requires, depending on the cellular context, various nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src family, Csk, Lyn, and Btk (for a review, see Ref. 42Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein completely abolish EG-VEGF-dependent MAPK activation (data not shown). Further studies will be required to identify the specific transducers linking EG-VEGF receptor activation to the MAPK pathway.Several studies indicated the involvement of GPCR in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. For example, disruption of the Gα13 gene was found to impair the ability of endothelial cells to develop into an organized vascular system, including sprouting, growth, migration, and remodeling of endothelial cells (43Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Receptors for thrombin and angiotensin II are GPCRs involved in the regulation of a number of critical events in the cardiovascular system, including vascular permeability (44Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. J. Investig. Med. 1995; 43: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar), proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells (45Herbert J.M. Dupuy E. Laplace M.C. Zini J.M. Bar Shavit R. Tobelem G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 46Senger D.R. Ledbetter S.R. Claffey K.P. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Peruzzi C.A. Detmar M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar) and induction of metalloproteinases production (47Zucker S. Conner C. DiMassim B.I. Ende H. Drews M. Seiki M. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23730-23738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a family of GPCRs (EDG family) serving as receptors for sphingosine 1-phosphate has been shown to play a key role in endothelial cell survival and morphogenesis (48Hla T. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 64: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine whether blocking Gαi will specifically inhibit the angiogenic effects of EG-VEGF in target tissues.It is important to emphasize that a different biological activity had been previously attributed to several members of the EG-VEGF protein family. Both VPRA/EG-VEGF (20Schweitz H. Pacaud P. Diochot S. Moinier D. Ladzunski M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Li M. Bullock C.M. Knauer D.J. Ehlert F.J. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and the “Bv8” proteins have been shown to induce contractions of ileum and distal colon and relaxation of proximal colon (21Mollay C. Wechselberger C. Mignogna G. Negri L. Melchiorri P. Barra D. Kreil G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 374: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Li M. Bullock C.M. Knauer D.J. Ehlert F.J. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Notably,N ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reversibly inhibited VPRA-induced relaxation of proximal colon, indicating that NO synthesis is required for such effect (20Schweitz H. Pacaud P. Diochot S. Moinier D. Ladzunski M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Li et al. (23Li M. Bullock C.M. Knauer D.J. Ehlert F.J. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) concluded, on the basis of pharmacological evidence, that the contractility-enhancing effects on guinea pig ileum of “prokineticin-1” (identical to EG-VEGF) were mediated by a GPCR. Thus, pending definitive molecular identification of the receptor(s), two independent studies support the conclusion that the EG-VEGF receptor is likely to be a GPCR. While it may appear difficult to reconcile such apparently unrelated activities as stimulation of contractility and endothelial cell mitogenesis, it is noteworthy that certain mitogenic growth factors can profoundly affect smooth muscle contractile properties. Epidermal growth factor probably represents one of the best examples. This well characterized peptide growth factor has been shown to have complex effects on the contractility of gastrointestinal and vascular smooth muscle cells (49Hollenberg M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 108-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,50Murthy K.S. Grider J.R. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G201-G210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, very recent studies have shown that the Bv8 protein is able to exert neurotrophic effects (51Melchiorri D. Bruno V. Besong G. Ngomba R.T. De Cuomo L. Blasi A. Copani A. Moschella C. Storto M. Nicoletti F. Lepperdinger G. Passarelli F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1694-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that this EG-VEGF-related protein also induces endothelial cell growth. 2R. Lin, J. LeCouter, J. Kowalski, and N. Ferrara, manuscript submitted. Considering that VEGF is also able to induce neurotrophic effects mediated by its binding to neuropilin-1 (52Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), these findings emphasize the intriguing emerging molecular analogies between angiogenesis and neuronal survival and sprouting. Further studies will be required to dissect these various activities at the molecular level. Over the last decade, extensive research has been done on members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 and angiopoietin families. These proteins are essential for embryonic development and for angiogenesis in a variety of physiological and pathological circumstances (1Ferrara N. Alitalo K. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3425) Google Scholar). VEGF is the most critical inducer of vascular formation and angiogenesis as it is required to initiate the formation of immature vessels by vasculogenesis or angiogenic sprouting during embryonic development as well as in adults. Members of the angiopoietin family, such as Ang-1 and Ang-2, are required for further remodeling and maturation of the vasculature (3Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). There are two known VEGF tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR) (4Ferrara N. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 794-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Neuropilin-1 has been shown to be an isoform-specific VEGF receptor able to bind the heparin-binding VEGF isoforms (5Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). VEGFR-1 is thought to play a negative role in the regulation of angiogenesis acting as a “decoy” receptor at least in some circumstances (6Gille H. Kowalski J. Yu L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4064-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Compelling evidences indicate that VEGFR-2 is the major mediator of the mitogenic, angiogenic, and permeability-enhancing effects of VEGF (4Ferrara N. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 794-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). VEGF stimulation leads to a robust autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and activation of the MAPK cascade (7Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 8D'Angelo G. Lee H. Weiner R.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which may directly contribute to endothelial cell proliferation. VEGF also induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PI 3-kinase in endothelial cells (9Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase, mediated by VEGFR-2, contributes to the chemotactic effects of VEGF (6Gille H. Kowalski J. Yu L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4064-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase is also strongly implicated in VEGF-induced endothelial cell survival via its downstream target serine/threonine kinase Akt (9Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Akt promotes cellular survival by suppressing the activity of proapoptotic proteins, such as caspase-9 in monocytes, and by inducing the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and A1, in vascular endothelial cells (10Gerber H.P. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13313-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Effects of VEGF on permeability (11Wu H.M. Huang Q. Yuan Y. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2735-H2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular tone (12Ku D.D. Zaleski J.K. Liu S. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H586-H592PubMed Google Scholar) are believed to be coupled to nitric oxide (NO) production. VEGF has been shown to induce the release of NO from vascular endothelial cells by increasing phosphorylation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) (13Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 by Akt directly stimulates eNOS activity and NO production (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest the existence of local, tissue-specific regulators of endothelial cell phenotype and growth (15Stewart P.A. Wiley M.J. Dev. Biol. 1981; 84: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 16Dellian M. Witwer B.P. Salehi H.A. Yuan F. Jain R.K. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 59-71PubMed Google Scholar). The morphology and functions of endothelial cells vary extensively among different organs. While endothelial lineage is genetically determined, expression of a set of vascular bed-specific genes is regulated at the transcriptional level following interaction with local signaling pathways (17Aird W.C. Edelberg J.M. Weiler-Guettler H. Simmons W.W. Smith T.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Recently we reported the identification of a tissue-specific angiogenic factor, EG-VEGF (18LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L. Keller G.-A. Peale F. Gurney A. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Nature. 2001; 412: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Expression of human EG-VEGF mRNA is restricted to the steroidogenic glands, ovary, testis, adrenal, and placenta. EG-VEGF promoted proliferation, migration, and fenestration in cultured capillary endothelial cells derived from such endocrine glands. It also induced extensive angiogenesis when delivered in the ovary but not in the skeletal muscle or in the cornea. In contrast, VEGF induced angiogenesis in all the organs tested (18LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L. Keller G.-A. Peale F. Gurney A. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Nature. 2001; 412: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). EG-VEGF is a member of an emerging new protein family with multiple regulatory functions. The first of such molecules, venom protein A (VPR"

(1992) Science 256, 1821–1823). To identify an alternative Ca2+ sensor, we searched for other Syt isoforms in Syt I-deficient PC12 cells and identified Syt IX, an isoform closely related to Syt I, as an abundantly expressed dense-core vesicle protein. Here we show that Syt IX is required for the Ca2+-dependent release of NE from PC12 cells. Antibodies directed against the C2A domain of either Syt IX or Syt I inhibited Ca2+-dependent NE release in permeable PC12 cells indicating that both Syt proteins function in dense-core vesicle exocytosis. Our results support the idea that Syt family proteins that co-reside on secretory vesicles may function cooperatively and redundantly as potential Ca2+ sensors for exocytosis. Synaptotagmin (Syt) I-deficient phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cell lines show normal Ca2+-dependent norepinephrine (NE) release (Shoji-Kasai, Y., Yoshida, A., Sato, K., Hoshino, T., Ogura, A., Kondo, S., Fujimoto, Y., Kuwahara, R., Kato, R., and Takahashi, M.

Our results support the idea that Syt family proteins that co-reside on secretory vesicles may function cooperatively and redundantly as potential Ca2+ sensors for exocytosis. Neurotransmitter release is achieved by fusion of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic plasma membranes (i.e. exocytosis) in response to a rapid increase in Ca2+ ions entering through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Ca2+-binding proteins (so-called “Ca2+sensors”) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bennett M.R. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and 2Augustine G.J. Curr. Opin.

Syt I contains one transmembrane region at the amino terminus and two C2 domains (the C2A domain and C2B domain) in the cytoplasmic domain, and Ca2+ binding to the C2A domain is essential for regulating Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release (3Fernandez-Chacon R.

Syt I is also found in the secretory granules of some endocrine cells (e.g. chromaffin cells, pancreatic β-cell lines, and PC12 cells) and has been shown to be involved in Ca2+-dependent endocrine exocytosis by peptide or antibody injection experiments (7Elferink L.A.

However, in 1992, Syt I-deficient PC12 cell lines exhibiting normal Ca2+-dependent norepinephrine (NE) release were established (12Shoji-Kasai Y. Yoshida A. Sato K. Hoshino T. Ogura A. Kondo S.

Based on our finding, we discuss the functional relationship between Syt I and Syt IX in PC12 cells. The anti-Syt I mouse monoclonal antibody (Ab) (SYA148) was from StressGen. The anti-Syt I-C2A rabbit Ab was prepared as described previously (17Mikoshiba K. Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Llinás R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Abs specific for the amino-terminal domain of mouse Syt I (anti-Syt I-N) and Syt IX (anti-Syt IX-N) were raised against the following synthetic peptides: MVSASRPEALAAPVTTVATC (Syt I-N) and KTPPDSSRIRQGAVC (Syt IX-N).

Under our experimental conditions, we could not observe cross-reactivity of anti-Syt IX-C2A and anti-Syt IX-N Abs with Syt I in immunoblotting. The protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a reference. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J.

After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with either low KCl buffer (5.6 mm KCl, 145 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) or high KCl buffer (56 mm KCl, 95 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) containing rhodamine-labeled anti-Syt I-N Ab (1 μg/ml) and fluorescein-labeled anti-Syt I Ab (10 μg/ml). The cells were immediately washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer for 20 min at room temperature as described previously (20Fukuda M.

Incorporated antibodies were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (TE300, Nikon) attached to a laser confocal scanner unit CSU 10 (Yokogawa Electric Corp.) and HiSCA CCD camera (C6790, Hamamatsu Photonics). Images were pseudo-colored and superimposed with Adobe Photoshop software (Version 4.0) (20Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). PC12 cells, cultured as described previously (27Lomneth R. Martin T.F.J. DasGupta B.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were incubated with 0.5 μC/ml [3H]NE (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and 0.5 mm ascorbate for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, preincubated in culture medium for two 1-h incubations, and removed from dishes by pipetting with ice-cold KGlu buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 120 mm potassium glutamate (KGlu), 20 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were permeabilized by a single passage through a stainless steel ball homogenizer (28Martin T.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 168: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and preincubated with KGlu buffer adjusted to 11 mm EGTA for 1 h on ice. Permeable cells were primed in incubations for 30 min at 30 °C in KGlu buffer containing 2 mm MgATP plus 1 mg/ml rat brain cytosol. Following two washes, the permeable cells were preincubated with antibodies where indicated for 1 h on ice and incubated at 30 °C for 3 min in triggering reactions containing KGlu buffer with free Ca2+ adjusted to 1 mm plus 0.1 mg/ml rat brain cytosol. Reactions were terminated by chilling followed by sedimentation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. [3H]NE in the supernatants and the 1% Triton X-100-solubilized cell pellets were used to calculate Ca2+-dependent [3H]NE release as a percentage of total [3H]NE in each incubation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (23Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of Syts I and IX in PC12 cells was also performed as described previously (20Fukuda M.

Syt I-deficient PC12 cells were isolated as a G418-resistant cell line following transfection with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing a rat Syt I cDNA sequence (−22 to 109) in reverse orientation. Immunoblotting indicated the complete absence of Syt I protein but normal levels of Syt IX, syntaxin 1A, VAMP2, and SNAP-25. Synaptotagmin has been found to represent a large protein family in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and 13 isoforms have been identified in the rat and mouse (4Marquèze B. Berton F. Seagar M.

Since several other presynaptic proteins show functional redundancy in the brain (e.g. synapsins, complexins, and SV2s) (30Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Brose N.

To test this hypothesis, we generated a specific antibody against each Syt isoform (Syts I–XIII) 2X. Zhang, M. J. Kim-Miller, M. Fukuda, J. A. Kowalchyck, and T. F. J. Martin, submitted for publication. and examined its expression in normal and Syt I-deficient PC12 cell lines (PC12-a and -b). Quantitative analysis by using the recombinant Syts I–XIII with a T7 tag indicated that only the Syt IX isoform (formally called Syt V) (33Craxton M. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Hudson A.W. Birnbaum M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5895-5899Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)2 is expressed as abundantly as the Syt I isoform in both PC12 cell lines but that it is less abundant in brain (Fig. 1,A and B). The most important finding was that the Syt I expression level is dramatically reduced in PC12-b cells (less than 5% of that of normal PC12-a cells) and that the Syt IX expression level is significantly higher than that of normal PC12 cells (Fig.1 B), suggesting that Syt IX may substitute for Syt I function in PC12-b cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, the phylogenetic distance between invertebrate Syt I and mouse Syt IX is indistinguishable from that between invertebrate Syt I and mouse Syt I (Fig. 1 C, boxed), and the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding properties of Syts I, II, and IX are the same in terms of affinity for Ca2+ and specificity for phospholipids (19Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C2A domain of Syt IX fused to GST bound PS/PC liposomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner but did not bind PC liposomes alone, irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.1 D). If Syt IX compensates for the function of Syt I in Syt I-deficient PC12 cells, the Syt IX would be expected to be localized to dense-core vesicles. Immunocytochemical studies indicated that Syt IX was present at the tips of neurites where dense-core vesicles are enriched, and it closely co-localized with Syt I (Fig. 2, Syt IX in green (A), Syt I in red(B), and overlay in yellow (C)). The specificity of the anti-Syt IX antibody was confirmed by incubation with antigenic peptide (Fig. 2, D and E). To examine the dynamics of Syt IX molecules during Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, Abs directed against the luminal domain of Syt IX conjugated to fluorescein and the luminal domain of Syt I conjugated to rhodamine were added to the culture medium (24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Kraszewski K. Mundigl O. Daniell L. Verderio C. Matteoli M. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4328-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were stimulated with a low or high concentration of KCl. Uptake of both the fluorescein-Syt IX Ab and rhodamine-Syt I Ab into neurites and cell body occurred only at depolarizing KCl concentrations (Fig. 3,A–D and G–J). Co-localization of the fluorescein-Syt IX Ab and the rhodamine-Syt I Ab (Fig. 3,C and I, arrowheads) indicated that Syt I and IX proteins are present on the same vesicles that undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.Figure 3Essential role of Syt IX in Ca2+-dependent NE release in PC12 cells.

Middle, inhibitory effects of Syt I (0.3 mg/ml) and Syt IX (2 mg/ml) IgGs on Ca2+-dependent NE release were nonadditive at maximally effective concentrations for each antibody. Right, Fab fragments derived from Syt I and Syt IX IgGs strongly inhibited Ca2+-dependent NE release from wild type permeable PC12 cells (open symbols). In contrast, Syt IX, but not Syt I, Fab fragments inhibited Ca2+-dependent NE release from Syt I-deficient PC12 cells (closed symbols). Shown for Syt I Fab is a buffer control, which contained high concentrations of HEPES (closed square). Preparation of the permeable PC12 cells, measurements of NE release, and antibody inhibition studies were performed as described previously (26Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Lomneth R. Martin T.F.J. DasGupta B.R. J.

Because the PC12-b cells exhibited deficiencies in NE uptake, we used Syt I antisense PC12 cell lines that completely lack Syt I for the NE release assays.WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We had previously shown that inhibition of Ca2+/phospholipid binding to the C2A domain of Syt I by anti-Syt I-C2A Ab blocks neurotransmitter release in the squid giant synapse and superior cervical ganglion neurons (17Mikoshiba K. Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Llinás R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10703-10707Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Mochida S. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Kobayashi H. Mikoshiba K. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the role of Syts in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in PC12 cells is unclear (12Shoji-Kasai Y. Yoshida A. Sato K. Hoshino T. Ogura A. Kondo S. Fujimoto Y. Kuwahara R. Kato R. Takahashi M. Science. 1992; 256: 1821-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we introduced Syt C2A antibodies into permeabilized PC12 cells (26Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Lomneth R. Martin T.F.J. DasGupta B.R. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1989; 168: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to assess their effect on Ca2+-dependent NE release. The Ab against the C2A domain of Syt IX (anti-Syt IX-C2A) inhibited Ca2+-dependent NE release in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition at about 50% (Fig. 3 K, left, circles), whereas a preimmune Ab did not have any significant effect (Fig. 3 K,left, squares). Similar results were obtained when the anti-Syt I-C2A Ab was introduced into permeable PC12 cells with maximal inhibition at about 50% (Fig. 3 K,left, triangles). To analyze the functional relationship between Syts I and IX in NE release, the anti-Syt I-C2A and anti-Syt IX-C2A Abs were simultaneously introduced into PC12 cells. No significant additive effect of these two antibodies was observed at maximally effective concentrations of both antibodies (Fig.3 K, middle). To assess whether antibody inhibition could result from steric effects or cross-linking of bivalent IgGs, we tested Fab fragments of the Abs. Fab fragments from either the Syt IX-C2A or the Syt I-C2A Ab strongly inhibited Ca2+-dependent NE release from wild type PC12 cells with maximal inhibition exceeding 80% (Fig.3 K, right, open symbols). As anticipated, the Syt I-C2A Fab fragments failed to inhibit Ca2+-dependent NE release from Syt I-deficient PC12 cells, whereas the Syt IX-C2A Fab fragments were fully inhibitory (Fig. 3 K, right, closed symbols). The greater inhibitory effect of the Fab fragments compared with IgGs suggests that full access of larger IgGs to the C2A domain may be limited, which could be due to C2A domain-protein interactions that may be important for transmitter secretion (for a review, see Ref. 4Marquèze B. Berton F. Seagar M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cross-linking of Syt I or IX isoforms by bivalent IgGs may allow residual Syt function in NE release. The results for Fab fragments indicate that inhibition of either Syt I or Syt IX in wild type PC12 cells is sufficient to block Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. This suggests that Syts I and IX function interdependently, which is consistent with our finding that both reside on the same vesicles and with our previous studies showing that Syts I and IX can form Ca2+-dependent hetero-oligomers (36Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In summary, several lines of evidence indicate that Syt IX is a major Syt isoform that is required for Ca2+-dependent secretion in PC12 cells. First, in wild type PC12 cells, Syt IX is expressed as abundantly as Syt I, and in Syt I-deficient PC12 cells, the expression of Syt IX is up-regulated (Fig. 1). No other Syt isoforms including Syt VII, a recently proposed plasma membrane Ca2+ sensor (37Sugita S. Han W. Butz S. Liu X. Fernandez-Chacon R. Lao Y. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2001; 30: 459-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), are expressed abundantly (although Syt IV, a third isoform expressed in PC12 cells, is present at <5% of the level of Syt I). Second, both Syt I and Syt IX are present on the same vesicles that undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (Figs. 2 and 3). Third, the Ca2+-dependent binding of the Syt IX C2A domain to phospholipids (Fig. 1) is similar to that of the Syt I C2A domain (19Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and similar Ca2+-dependent interactions of Syt I (38Gerona R.R. Larsen E.C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6328-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and Syt IX with SNAP-25 have been characterized.2 Last, Fab fragments from either Syt I-C2A or Syt IX-C2A Abs almost completely inhibited Ca2+-dependent NE release in PC12 cells (Fig. 3). Based on these results, we propose that PC12 cells utilize two Ca2+ sensors, Syts I and IX, on the same vesicles that function cooperatively to mediate the Ca2+triggering of exocytosis. This hypothesis can account for the finding that Syt I-deficient PC12 cells exhibit normal Ca2+-dependent NE release; Syt IX can function as an alternate Ca2+ sensor.

To study α to β conformational transitions, we designed a series of peptides with structural duality; namely, peptides with sequence features of both an α−helical leucine zipper and a β−hairpin. The parent peptide, Template−α, was designed to be a canonical leucine-zipper motif and was confirmed as such using circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. To introduce β−structure character into the peptide, glutamine residues at sites away from the leucine-zipper dimer interface were replaced by threonine to give Template−αT. Unlike the parent peptide, Template−αT underwent a heat-inducible switch to β−structure, which reversibly formed gels containing amyloid-like fibrils. In contrast to certain other natural proteins where destabilization of the native states facilitate transitions to amyloid, destabilization of the leucine-zipper form of Template−αT did not promote a transformation. Cross-linking the termini of the peptides compatible with the alternative β−hairpin design, however, did promote the change. Furthermore, despite screening various conditions, only the internally cross-linked form of the parent, Template−α, peptide formed amyloid-like fibrils.

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). It is accepted that misfolding of peptides and proteins cause the fibrillar aggregates known as amyloid, which characterize the diseases collectively known as amyloidoses (3Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 4Kelly J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 5Dobson C.M.

Therefore, the elucidation of the underlying molecular principles for the transformation of soluble proteins into amyloid has potential for understanding and tackling these diseases. A diverse set of peptides and proteins form amyloid (6Sunde M. Serpell L.C. Bartlam M. Fraser P.E. Pepys M.B. Blake C.C.F. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 300: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This set is not limited to peptides and proteins that form amyloid depositsin vivo and are associated with the various diseases (8Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc.

In these cases, the structural changes vary from slow conversions of random-coil peptides to gross structural changes of larger, natively folded, globular structures brought about by destabilization of the native state. Furthermore, for the latter, there are no clear themes in the types of native state that undergo transitions to amyloid: all-α-helical proteins can be transformed into amyloid (13Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), as can all-β-structures (14McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and structural types between these extremes (6Sunde M. Serpell L.C. Bartlam M. Fraser P.E. Pepys M.B. Blake C.C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar, 7Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Benson M.D. Tennent G.A. Pepys M.B. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, amyloid and amyloid-like structures have common cores based on β-structure (15Serpell L.C. Blake C.C.F. Fraser P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13269-13275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Jimenez J.L. Guijarro J.L. Orlova E. Zurdo J. Dobson C.M. Sunde M. Saibil H.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar): fibrils are assembled from protofilaments in which β-strands are aligned perpendicular to the long fiber axis. Thus, an increasingly adopted view is that the ability to form amyloid is largely a general property of the polypeptide backbone (9Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 17MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12707-12713Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, the role, if any, of protein sequence in amyloid fibril formation is not clear. A number of studies indicate that sequence, and therefore amino acid side chains, do influence the formation of amyloid (10West M.W. Wang W.X. Patterson J. Mancias J.D. Beasley J.R. Hecht M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 18Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8397-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, the question is whether sequence changes simply affect the relative stabilities of the various folded, partly folded, and unfolded states of the subject proteins and hence their propensity to aggregate (18Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Ramirez-Alvarado M. Merkel J.S. Regan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar); in this sense, the role of sequence in the formation of the amyloid structure itself may be regarded as passive. Alternatively, sequence may take a more active role in promoting β-structured elements in the unfolded states or within the amyloid-fibril structures themselves (10West M.W. Wang W.X. Patterson J. Mancias J.D. Beasley J.R. Hecht M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 19McLaurin J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8397-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We are interested in addressing a specific issue in protein conformation switching, namely, how sequence brings about and influences the rather extreme α to β structural transitions in proteins. To do this, we set out to design a peptide with astructural conflict; namely, with sequence features compatible with both α-helical and β-hairpin structures. Such a system would allow us to assess the role of specific side chain placements in effecting the conversion between the two structures; in addition, if the β-structured form acted as precursor for amyloid formation, such a system may provide insight into the mechanism(s) of conversion to amyloid-like structures. Others have engineered peptides and proteins with structural conflicts. Minor and Kim (24Minor D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) show that an 11-residue peptide sequence can be accommodated at structurally distinct sites within the same protein fold; in this case, overall tertiary context overrides local sequence and secondary structure preferences. At the level of a whole protein, Dalal and Regan (25Dalal S. Balasubramanian S. Regan L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have met the Paracelsus Challenge and succeeded in transmuting a mixed α/β protein fold into an all α−helical fold by altering only ≈50% of the sequence. In addition, several groups have succeeded either serendipitously, or with reasoned designs to construct peptide sequences that do switch conformational state (11Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Osterhout J.J. Teplow D.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,12Takahashi Y. Yamashita T. Ueno A. Mihara H.

To elucidate specific sequence features of natural proteins that drive α to β secondary structure switching, we designed and characterized a series of peptides in which positive design features for a dimeric, α-helical coiled coil and a β-hairpin were superimposed in a short sequence. The parent peptide, Template-α, was confirmed as a stable, cooperatively folded, dimeric, helical structure consistent with the designed leucine zipper. As expected, mutation of three exterior Gln residues to Thr reduced the stability of this folded state. Surprisingly, however, thermal unfolding of the mutant was accompanied by conversion to β-structure on a time scale of tens of minutes. In this state the samples gelled and were shown to contain fibrils with tinctorial properties and the morphology of amyloid. Small sequence changes were made to probe the basis of the conversion to amyloid. We conclude that straight destabilization of the coiled-coil structure does not necessarily foster the change, but alterations geared to favor the alternative β-conformation do promote the structural switch. Peptides were made on a Pioneer Peptide Synthesis System (Perseptive Biosystems) using standard Fmoc chemistry. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and their identities confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Purified peptides were stored at pH 2, −20 °C in 7 mmDTT.1 Oxidized peptides were prepared as follows: peptides (at ≤100 μm) were agitated at room temperature overnight in 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 20% Me2SO, 2 m guanidine hydrochloride. Oxidized peptides were stored at pH 2, −20 °C. Circular dichroism measurements were made on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter fitted with a Peltier temperature controller. Unless otherwise stated, the sample stocks were diluted into a standard buffer of 25 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7) containing 1 mm DTT (DTT was omitted for the oxidized peptides). All data were collected in 1-mm quartz cuvettes. Data points for CD spectra were recorded at 1-nm intervals using a 1-nm bandwidth and 4–16-s response times. After baseline correction, ellipticities in mdeg were converted to molar ellipticities (deg cm2 dmol res−1) by normalizing for the concentration of peptide bonds. Data points for the thermal unfolding curves were recorded through 1 °C min−1 ramps using a 2-nm bandwidth, averaging the signal for 16 s at 1 °C intervals. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 5 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge fitted with an An-60 Ti rotor. A ≈100-μl sample of Template-α (100 μm) in standard buffer containing 100 mm sodium chloride was used. The sample was equilibrated for ≈48 h at rotor speeds of 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 rpm. Sedimentation curves were measured by absorbance at 240 nm (theE 240 for Template-α was calculated as 2240m−1 cm−1). The resulting data sets were fitted simultaneously using routines in the Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (version 4.0). Two fitting models were used: the first assumed a single ideal species; the second assumed a monomer-dimer equilibrium and fixed monomer molecular weight. The molecular weight and partial specific volume of the peptide were calculated from the amino acid sequence as 3118 and 0.755, respectively. The viscosity of the buffer at 5 °C was taken to be 1.008 mg ml−1. Emission fluorescence spectra of thioflavine T (10 μm) with ≈10 μm peptide added were recorded between 480 and 600 nm with an excitation wavelength of 435 nm using a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorimeter and 1-cm quartz cuvettes. A scan rate of 600 nm min−1 and data interval of 1 nm was used throughout. Droplets of peptide solution were applied to carbon-coated copper specimen grids and dried with filter paper before negative staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid at pH 7. Grids were examined in a Hitachi 7100 TEM at 100 kV and digital images were acquired with a (800 × 1200 pixel) charge-coupled device camera. The starting point for our study was a designed canonical α-helical leucine-zipper sequence (Template-α). Using established rules for coiled-coil assembly (30Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 31Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Gonzalez L.J. Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 33Kohn W.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 993-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Template-α was designed to form a leucine zipper (i.e. a dimeric, parallel coiled coil, Fig.1 A): the combination of Val ata and Leu at d sites of the heptad repeat was used to direct dimer formation; Lys at one a position and the juxtaposition of Lys and Glu at g and e, respectively, were placed to ensure parallel dimers; the band c positions were filled with helix-promoting Ala residues and the outer f sites were made polar Gln. The heptad repeat was flanked by Cys residues, which could be oxidized to an intramolecular disulfide bond to favor the alternative β-hairpin conformation (Fig. 1 B) as required. An N-terminal Tyr-Gly tag was added to allow peptide concentrations to be determined (34Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Padmanabhan S. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The N and C termini were acetylated and amidated, respectively. The full sequences of Template-α and its derivatives are given in Fig. 1 C. The coiled-coil conformation of Template-α, at 100 μmconcentration, 25 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mmDTT (pH 7), was confirmed experimentally using a combination of circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2). The CD spectrum of Template-α at 5 °C had minima at 208 and 222 nm characteristic of α-helical structure (Fig. 2 A). From the intensity of the signal at 222 nm, we estimated that Template-α contained ≈70% helix (35O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The thermal unfolding of Template-α was concentration dependent as expected for an oligomerizing system (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the unfolding transitions were almost completely reversible (Fig.2 A). Sedimentation equilibrium studies of Template-α indicated a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the CD data and the design. For example, the data did fit an analysis that assumed a single ideal species, but returned aM r of 5273 (with 95% confidence limits of 5036 and 5503), i.e. between the molecular weights expected for monomer (3118) and dimer. More detailed analysis assuming a monomer-dimer equilibrium model gave a dissociation constant of 66 μm (with 95% confidence limits of 49 and 91 μm). These data are thus consistent with the CD measurements, which indicated near, but not complete folding at 5 °C and 100 μm peptide concentrations. In summary, the CD and equilibrium sedimentation data for Template-α are comparable with those collected on other designed and natural leucine zippers under similar conditions (35O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) and are, thus, consistent with the peptide forming a dimeric helical structure as designed. As a first step to introduce β-structure character into the designed system, the three Gln residues at the f sites of the heptad repeat of Template-α were replaced by Thr to give Template-αT (Fig. 1 C). The f sites lie away from and, so, should not compromise the leucine-zipper interface (Fig.1 A). As Thr has a lower α-helix propensity and a higher β-sheet propensity than Gln (36O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 37Kim C.A. Berg J.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) Template-αT was expected to form a leucine zipper, but with a reduced stability compared with Template-α. This was observed (compare Figs. 2, A andB, and 3, A and B). However, the thermal unfolding of Template-αT was less reversible; that is, spectra recorded after returning to the starting temperature showed a lower helicity than was measured at the start of the experiment (Fig.3 A). When thermal unfolding was repeated at the higher peptide concentration of 300 μm, Template-α again unfolded with a normal, reversible, sigmoidal transition (Fig. 2, A andB). By contrast, the unfolding of Template-αT showed an inflection above 60 °C, which suggested some refolding (Fig.3 B). Spectra recorded after cooling this sample were wholly different from anything recorded previously: the minima at 208 and 222 nm were absent and replaced by a single minimum at 218 nm, indicative of β-structure (Fig. 3 A). It was possible to follow the transition of Template-αT from a near-unfolded conformation to a β-conformation directly on the time scale of minutes by maintaining a freshly prepared 300 μm sample of the peptide at 70 °C (Fig. 3 C), i.e. just beyond the inflection point in the unfolding curve. Coupled with these structural changes the samples of Template-αT gelled. To test if this process could be reversed the gel was re-suspended in a 25 mm phosphoric acid buffer adjusted to pH 2; the rationale being that peptides, proteins, and protein complexes can be acid denatured, presumably because at low pH polypeptides carry net positive charges, which repel in the folded and/or associated states. The CD spectrum recorded for the Template-αT gels recorded immediately after re-suspension indicated β-structure (Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, however, with time the CD spectrum of this sample reverted to that for a partly folded α-helix (Fig. 3 D). Switches to β-structure accompanied by gel formation are indicative of amyloid-like fibrils. Therefore, we tested the gelled peptide samples for tinctorial properties characteristic of amyloid. The fluorescence of thioflavine T (38Levine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) was compared in the presence of Template-αT in its α-helical and β-structured states. The fluorescence intensity at 480 nm for the latter was ≈2.5 times greater (Fig.4 A). This was evidence for the presence of amyloid-like fibrils in the heat-treated, 300 μm Template-αT sample. To confirm this we prepared samples of this state for electron microscopy. The resulting images revealed filamentous, 25–30-nm bundles of extended, non-branching fibrils (Fig. 4, B and C). The component fibrils were twisted with a similar periodicity and, on average, had a diameter of ≈10 nm. These features are all consistent with amyloid formation. Having established a system that underwent an α to β transition with the added curiosity that the β-structured state formed amyloid, we set out to examine how small, specific and rational sequence changes influenced the transition. For instance, could the transition be eased and made to occur at lower temperatures by destabilizing the native coiled-coil conformation of Template-αT? Capping the ends of free-standing α-helical peptides is known to stabilize helical structures (39Chakrabartty A. Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11332-11336Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and this effect is enhanced in leucine-zipper and other coiled-coil peptides (40Greenfield N.J. Stafford W.F. Hitchcockdegregori S.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 2M. R. Hicks and D. N. Woolfson, unpublished results. Thus, Template-αT was re-synthesized with free N and C termini to give Template-αTu (Fig. 1 C). This had the desired effect of destabilizing the leucine-zipper state; indeed, the peptide was random coil and did not form appreciable helical structure over a wide range of concentrations. It is not clear how uncapping the peptide might affect amyloid formation itself. Nevertheless, Template-αTu could be converted to a β-structured state. However, this still required elevated temperatures and, in fact, the transition was more difficult to effect than with Template-αT: under the conditions used to convert Template-αT (300 μm, 70 °C), Template-αTu did not transform over a 1-h time scale, but a transition was observed within 1 h at 80 °C. Fibrils were observed for these samples by electron microscopy. With Template-αTu the formation of amyloid was assisted by salt; 0.5m KF lowered the temperature required for the conversion described above to 70 °C, i.e. to that required for the capped peptide in the absence of salt. Curiously, however, salt also stabilized the low-temperature α-helical state of the peptide increasing the α-helical content from ≈33 to 50% at 300 μm peptide. Thus, again for our system, there was no correlation between destabilization of the native state and easing fibrillogenesis. Salt also accelerated the conversion of Template-αT at 70 °C to the β-structured state; the CD-monitored transitions in 0, 0.5, and 1 m KF were complete in ≈60, 30, and 10 min, respectively. Summarizing the above, simply destabilizing the leucine-zipper conformation of Template-αT did not facilitate the α to β transition. Others have used β-hairpins to build a high-resolution structure for an Aβ amyloid fibril (15Serpell L.C. Blake C.C.F. Fraser P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13269-13275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and implicated their involvement in amyloid-like fibril formation by a peptide from OspA (41Ohnishi S. Koide A. Koide S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, our next step was to determine if the transition was affected by increasing the β-hairpin propensity of Template-α (Fig. 1B). Although by no means an ideal β-hairpin sequence, Template-α was designed to be compatible with this conformation. The key features were the Cys residues flanking the central heptad-based sequence. In our design logic, oxidation of these to an intramolecular disulfide link would bring the termini of the peptide together. This should simultaneously promote the β-hairpin and destabilize the leucine zipper. The design principles for the β-hairpin follow from an understanding of amino acid pairings in anti-parallel β-sheets (42Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M.G. Proteins. 1995; 22: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 43Hutchinson E.G. Sessions R.B. Thornton J.M. Woolfson D.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). On this basis, the Cys-Cys pair should occupy a so-called non-hydrogen-bonded site in the hairpin (Fig. 1 B). In turn, this would lead to the alignment of complementary, inter-strand hydrophobic interactions (between thea and d positions of the heptad repeat) and electrostatic pairs (between e and g) (Fig.1 B). Furthermore, in this conformation, two of the Thr residues introduced in Template-αT should also align across the structure at a favored non-hydrogen-bonded site (43Hutchinson E.G. Sessions R.B. Thornton J.M. Woolfson D.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). With these potential interactions, and if a β-structured precursor could seed/promote amyloid-like fibril formation, one might expect that forcing the intra-molecular Cys-Cys bridge would facilitate the α to β transitions in the Template-α peptides and promote fibrillogenesis. To probe the role of the intramolecular cross-link, oxidized variants for Template-α, Template-αT and Template-αTu, which we distinguish with the suffix “-ox,” were prepared. For each peptide, mass spectrometry confirmed the intramolecular disulfide bonds, and either sedimentation equilibrium experiments or analytical size-exclusion chromatography was used to show that the low-temperature states were monomers. At 100 μm and 5 °C Template-αT-ox was α-helical and thermally stabilized (Fig.5, A and B). Thermal unfolding converted the sample to a β-structured state (Fig.5 A). Compared with Template-αT, this conversion of Template-αT-ox to β-structured aggregates was facilitated; a 100 μm sample could be transformed in ≈20 min at 70 °C. The gels and fibrils from these samples had all the previously described characteristics consistent with amyloid. For Template-αTu-ox the disulfide link did not induce additional structure at low temperature, but the temperature required to observe the conversion to β-structured in the presence of salt was lowered to 50 °C (compared with 70 °C for the reduced peptide). Although we screened a number of conditions, only the oxidized form of Template-α showed any tendency to form amyloid-like fibrils (Fig. 5 C). Thus, tethering the termini of the peptides using a disulfide bond increased their ability to form amyloid consistent with the possible involvement of a β-hairpin in the fibrillogenesis process. We have shown that peptides designed and characterized as a canonical, dimeric leucine-zipper can be induced to switch to β-structured states that form amyloid-like fibrils. The switches were heat-induced, indeed they occurred from the heat-denatured states of the peptides, and they were facilitated by modifications that raise the β-propensity of the sequence. Straight destabilization of the native leucine-zipper state did not promote the switch per se; elevated temperatures were still required to induce β-structure in a mutant that did not form a leucine-zipper dimer at ambient temperatures. This contrasts with reports for certain globular proteins in which amyloid formation correlates with the destabilization of the native state (18Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G.

https://openalex.org/W2122140053,"We demonstrate the presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor-specific endosomal pathway in the protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma brucei. In higher eukaryotes evidence indicates that GPI-anchored proteins are transported in both the endocytic and exocytic systems by mechanisms involving sequestration into specific membrane microdomains and consequently sorting into distinct compartments. This is potentially extremely important in trypanosomatids as the GPI anchor is the predominant mechanism for membrane attachment of surface macromolecules, including the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). A highly complex developmentally regulated endocytic network, vital for nutrient uptake and evasion of the immune response, exists in T. brucei. In common with mammalian cells an early endosomal compartment is defined by Rab5 small GTPases, which control transport processes through the endosomal system. We investigate the function of two trypanosome Rab5 homologues. TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B, which colocalize in the procyclic stage, are distinct in the bloodstream form of the parasite. TbRAB5A endosomes contain VSG and transferrin, endocytosed by the T. brucei GPI-anchored transferrin receptor, whereas TbRAB5B endosomes contain the transmembrane protein ISG100but neither VSG nor transferrin. These findings indicate the presence of trypanosome endosomal pathways trafficking proteins through specific routes depending on the mode of membrane attachment. Ectopic expression of mutant TbRAB5A or -5B indicates that TbRAB5A plays a role in LDL endocytosis, whereas TbRAB5B does not, but both have a role in fluid phase endocytosis. Hence TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B have distinct functions in the endosomal system of T. brucei. A developmentally regulated GPI-specific endosomal pathway in the bloodstream form suggests that specialized transport of GPI-anchored proteins is required for survival in the mammalian host.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 8: 83-110Google Scholar). Expression of the major surface antigen, variant surface glycoprotein (VSG),1 is periodically switched from one gene to another, resulting in the production of a surface with an antigenically distinct VSG and preventing recognition by the host immune system (2Pays E. Lips S. Nolan D. Vandamme L. Perez-Morga D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additional host defense mechanisms include the presence of endogenous lytic factors in the bloodstream (3Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hadjuk S.L. Science. 1993; 268: 284-286Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar,4Raper J. Portela M.P. Lugli E. Frevert U. Tomlinson S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); trypanocidal activity is mediated at least in part by endocytosis of these factors by the parasite (5Hager K.M. Hajduk S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A highly active recycling process is also involved in the trypanosome response to recognition of the surface by host antibody as immunoglobulin bound to surface VSG is capped, endocytosed, and proteolyzed (6O'Beirne C. Lowry C.M. Voorheis H.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 911: 165-193Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hence, the endocytic system is an important component of the host-parasite interface. Unusually, in trypanosomatids all endocytic transport from the plasma membrane is restricted to the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the plasmalemma surrounding the flagellum where it enters the cell body, and is partly isolated from the bulk plasma membrane by desmosomal-like structures. These organisms also use GPI anchors as the predominant mechanism for cell surface attachment of proteins and other macromolecules (7Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10673-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Ilg T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 489-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several recently characterized proteins also cycle through the T. brucei endocytic system including the bloodstream form-specific invariant surface glycoprotein 100 (ISG100) (9Field H. Farjah M. Pal A. Gull K. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32102-32110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Nolan D.P. Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Pays A. Geuskens M. Michel A. Voorheis H.P. Pays E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29212-29221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and p67/CB1 (11Kelley R.J. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Most recently it was reported that endocytosis in bloodstream form involves the presence of a polylactosamine (pNAL)-containing determinant present on a subset of surface glycoproteins and recognized by tomato lectin, but the molecular mechanism underpinning this specificity is not yet clear (12Nolan D.P. Geuskens M. Pays E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1169-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The presence of glycolipid raft-like structures in both T. brucei and Leishmania major indicates that lipid-based sorting also operates in these organisms (13Denny P.W. Field M.C. Smith D.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Endocytosis is under strict developmental control in T. brucei. The bloodstream form is highly active in fluid phase and receptor-mediated pathways, with one of the highest rates of membrane turnover recorded. This contrasts with the procyclic pathway where endocytic flux is substantially lower (14Liu J. Qiao X. Du D. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12032-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and endocytic activity correlates well with expression of the trypanosome clathrin heavy chain (15Morgan G.W. Allen C.L. Holinshead M. Jeffries T. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2605-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the high rate of bloodstream form endocytosis is explained in part by a requirement for rapid antibody clearance from the parasite surface (6O'Beirne C. Lowry C.M. Voorheis H.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 911: 165-193Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). T. brucei also utilizes the endocytic pathway to acquire nutrients, including low density lipoprotein (LDL), an essential source of lipids, and transferrin, ligands for which the parasite has specific receptor systems. LDL is essential for parasite growth in vitro (16Coppens I. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Baudhuin P. J. Protozool. 1987; 34: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the system operates in both life stages. Although not defined at the molecular level, both a high (∼2 nm) and low affinity binding site (∼100 nm) have been described for LDL (17Coppens I. Baudhuin P. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 83: 6753-6757Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The transferrin receptor, the product of the ESAG6 andESAG7 genes, is expressed exclusively in the bloodstream form (18Salmon D. Hanocq-Quertier J. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Pays A. Tebabi P. Nolan D.P. Michel A. Pays E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7272-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Rabs are low molecular mass GTPases essential for eukaryote protein trafficking (19Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). The Rab5 subfamily is essential for the control of traffic through the early endosomal system, and Rab5 compartments interface with recycling systems, controlled in part by Rab4 and Rab11, as well as pathways leading to the lysosome. In vitrostudies indicate that nucleotide hydrolysis governs the period during which a docking vesicle is fusion-competent (20Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), whereas Rab5 interacts with a large number of effector molecules, including cytoskeletal proteins, signaling molecules, and components of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor vesicle fusion system (21Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 22Segev N. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 500-511Google Scholar). Expression of dominant negative GDP-bound Rab5 mutants result in decreased endosomal volume, whereas expression of constitutively active GTP-bound Rab5 mutants leads to endosomal swelling and fusion (23Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In most systems there are multiple Rab5 isoforms, and genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests partial redundancy (24Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In metazoans evidence indicates nonequivalent functions for Rab5 isoforms based on sensitivity to Listeria monocytogenes infection and enhancement of epidermal growth factor receptor endocytosis by some Rab5 isoforms but not others (25Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11459-11462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Two Rab5 homologues have been described in T. brucei,TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B (9Field H. Farjah M. Pal A. Gull K. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32102-32110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The genes are constitutively expressed at the mRNA level, and their protein products localize to vesicular structures in the flagellar pocket region, suggesting involvement in endocytic processes. In addition, homologues of Rab4 and Rab11, TbRAB4 and TbRAB11, are localized to structures in intimate contact with the TbRAB5A compartment and are potentially involved in recycling pathways (9Field H. Farjah M. Pal A. Gull K. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32102-32110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the relationship between TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B with cargo molecules and assessed their individual contributions to endocytosis. Our data demonstrate that TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B have distinct functions in T. brucei and that TbRAB5A controls a GPI-specific pathway. All materials were of analytical grade or higher. Human LDL was from Sigma. Radioisotopes were from Amersham Biosciences. Nucleic acid modification enzymes were variously from Stratagene, New England Biolabs, and MBI Fermentas. Culture media and fetal calf serum were from Sigma or Invitrogen unless indicated otherwise. Anti-TbRAB proteins were made in house and are described below or in previous publications (9Field H. Farjah M. Pal A. Gull K. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32102-32110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Field H. Ali B.R.S. Sherwin T. Gull K. Croft S.L. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-VSG (221) rabbit antibodies were made by immunization with soluble VSG following hypotonic lysis of 221 bloodstream forms and DEAE ion exchange purification. Anti-ISG100 was the gift of Derek Nolan (Brussels, Belgium). Fluorescent LDL, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Lucifer Yellow, and transferrin were from Molecular Probes. Procyclic culture form T. brucei,strain 427, was grown at 27 °C in SDM79 (29Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 286-292Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 7.5 μg ml−1 hemin. Cells were maintained at 5 × 105–1 × 107 cells ml−1 in polystyrene flasks (Corning Glass). 427 bloodstream form cells were cultured as described (27Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation of cell numbers, aliquots of cultures were withdrawn and diluted with 10 ml of Isoton2 medium (Beckman Coulter), and cell number was determined with a Z2 Coulter Counter, averaging at least three measurements. Generation times were calculated using data from replicate cultures followed by regression analysis using Prism (version 2.0a). For SDS-PAGE analysis freshly harvested trypanosomes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being added to 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 3 min with occasional vortexing before analysis. Molecular biology grade water was from an Elgastat Option 4 system (Elga, London, UK). Plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) or DH5α following transformation by electroporation with a BTX 600 ECM electroporator. PCR products and gel-embedded DNA fragments were purified using Geneclean (Bio 101, Inc.), whereas plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen kits following the manufacturers' instructions. Small scale plasmid preparations were performed using the Promega Wizard system. For mutagenesis of TbRAB5A, the pALTER1 vector (Promega Corp.) was used with the Altered Sites TM system, following the manufacturer's instructions. The TbRAB5A WDTAGQE motif was mutagenized with an Ala to Thr substitution, and a silent PstI site introduced as a marker for restriction analysis via a second AT substitution. The oligonucleotide was GGGATACTGCAGGGCTGGAGCGCTACCG. For all other mutants, mutagenesis was carried out by PCR, and assembly was performed in pBlueScript. Site-directed PCR mutagenesis was performed to introduce the Gln to Leu exchange for the GTP-locked TbRAB5B and the Ser to Asn exchange for the GDP-locked form of both TbRAB5A and −5B. Flanking primers included aHindIII restriction site at the 5′-end and aBamHI site at the 3′-end for subsequent ligations into expression vectors. Primers were designed to amplify open reading frames only. Ser to Asn exchanges created a new AcsI site; the Gln to Leu exchange in TbRAB5B created a unique XbaI site. Wild type TbRAB5B open reading frame was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using CTTAAGCTTGTCCATGTCTGTGAAGACCG and AACGGATCCCAACAACATGCAGTGCTTCAACC. For Ser to Asn exchanges, the AGT at 85–87 bp (TbRAB5A) or TCA at 76–78 bp (TbRAB5B) 3′ to the start codon was replaced by AAT using long primers harboring a HindIII site and the start ATG at the 5′-end and the exchange at the 3′-end. GDP-locked TbRAB5ASN was PCR-amplified using CTTAAGCTTATGTCGGTGTCAGCGACACCATACAAACGACAGGATGCAATAACCGCCAGAACTGTTTTGCTCGGGGAGAGTGCAGTAGGAAAGAATTCC and AACGGATCCCAACAACATGCAGTGCTTCAACC. GDP-locked TbRAB5BSNwas PCR amplified using CTTAAGCTTGTCCATGTCTGTGAAGACCGTTGCCGCCCCAACAAAAAAGTACAAAATTGTCCTTTTGGGCGATAGCGGTGTTGGTAAAAATTCCC and AACGGATCCCAACAACATGCAGTGCTTCAACC. For TbRAB5BQL the mutagenesis was done by creating two gene fragments with an overlap bearing the mutation and an XbaI site. The 5′-fragment bore a HindIII site, the start ATG, and the mutation, and the 3′-fragment bore the mutation, stop codon, and aBamHI site. 5′-Fragment oligonucleotides for TbRAB5BQL are CTTAAGCTTGTCCATGTCTGTGAAGACCG and CCAGACTTTTGTAGCGTTCTAGACCGGC, and the 3′-fragment oligonucleotides are CCGGTCTAGAACGCTACAAAAGTCTGGC and CCGGTCTAGAACGCTACAAAAGTCTGGC. All constructs were verified after assembly by sequence analysis on a 377 PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sequencing system, using Big DyeTM chemistry (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to further analysis. The relevant TbRAB5 open reading frames were subcloned into pXS219 for expression in procyclics or pXS519 for expression in bloodstream forms (derivatives of pXS2 and pXS5 containing the pUC19 polylinker (30Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 2M. C. Field, unpublished data. For transformation of procyclics, 4 × 107 cells of a fresh overnight culture in log phase were centrifuged for 10 min at 800 ×g, washed in 10 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), centrifuged again, and finally resuspended in 800 μl of Opti-MEM. These cells were then transferred into 4-mm gap electrocuvettes (Bio-Rad) and mixed with appropriate amounts of vector DNA (typically ∼10 μg) for electroporation in an ECM600. The volume in each cuvette was adjusted to 900 μl with Opti-MEM, and samples were chilled on ice prior to electroporation (720-ohm resistance, 2-kV charging voltage, 6.25 kV cm−1 desired field strength, and 5-ms desired pulse length). Samples were immediately transferred into 10 ml of nonselective SDM79 immediately after electroporation. Approximately 16 h following electroporation Geneticin (G418) was added to cultures at 65 μg ml−1 to select for transformants. Single cell clones were derived as described (30Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Bloodstream form trypanosomes were harvested from a 50-ml culture in exponential growth (2 × 106 cells/ml) at 800 × g for 10 min, washed once in 50 ml of prewarmed cytomix (37 °C), and resuspended in prewarmed cytomix at 8 × 107 cells/ml. 450 μl of this suspension was premixed with 10 μg of vector DNA, and pulses were administered in 2-mm ice-cold electrocuvettes (Bio-Rad) at 1.5 kV and 25 microfarads in a GenePulser II (Bio-Rad). Cells were then transferred into sterile flasks prepared with 50 ml of HMI9. Cloned cell lines were obtained by serial dilution under antibiotic selection (2.5 μg ml−1 G418, Sigma). PCR amplification of T. brucei total genomic DNA was performed on small scale genomic preparations (31Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) using 5 ml of dense cultures (∼2 × 107 cell ml−1). Each PCR was set up in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture consisted of 7 mm MgCl2, 250 mm dNTP, ∼20 ng of template genomic DNA, 30 pmol each of forward and reverse primers, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 1× reaction buffer. The reactions were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 480 DNA Thermal Cycler. Taq polymerase was added after the reaction was heated to 94 °C for 5 min to denature template DNA (hot start). Thirty cycles were used per reaction, with a 94 °C, 1-min denaturation step, a 58 °C, 1-min annealing step, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Primers corresponding to sequences from pXS219 or pXS519 flanking the cloning site were used for detecting integrated copies of the various transgenes. Insertion of the correct mutant or wild type was scored by restriction analysis using the silent sites incorporated during the mutagenesis procedure. 5 × 106–2 × 107 cells per lane were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE minigels as described (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and wet-blotted at 100 V for 3 h in a Transphor Electrophoresis apparatus (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments) in freshly prepared transfer buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol) onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking for 1 h in buffer A (PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 2% (w/v) nonfat dried milk) at room temperature, membranes were washed 3 times in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubated with primary antibody (diluted 1:1000 in buffer A) for 1 h. After three 5-min washes in PBST the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Sigma) goat anti-rabbit antisera (diluted 1:20,000 in buffer A) for 1 h followed by four 15-min washes in PBST. Visualization was by enhanced chemiluminescence. Equivalence of loading was ensured by both determination of cell number before sample preparation and Coomassie Blue staining following electrophoresis. The open reading frames for TbRAB5A, TbRAB5AQL, TbRAB5BQL, TbRAB5BSN, and TbRAB5B were expressed from pGEX in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified by standard procedures on glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). All expression constructs were verified by sequence analysis on a 377 PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sequencing system, using Big DyeTM chemistry. Plasmids produced a band of ∼50 kDa upon induction for all constructs, the predicted molecular mass for a GST·TbRAB5 fusion protein. Protein was quantitated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining following purification on glutathione-agarose. Antibodies to TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B were prepared by immunization with proteins cleaved from GST beads using factor Xa and raised in a rabbit using MPLTM as adjuvant (Sigma). Preparation of GST·TbRAB2 has been described previously (28Field H. Ali B.R.S. Sherwin T. Gull K. Croft S.L. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified from clotted whole serum by affinity chromatography on CNBr-Sepharose immobilized TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B as appropriate. Specificity was monitored by Western blot analysis against the cognate and noncognate TbRAB5 isoform in whole cell E. coli lysates. Antibodies only recognized the cognate TbRAB5 (data not shown). Affinity-purified recombinant GST-TbRAB5A, GST-TbRAB5B, GST-TbRAB2, and corresponding QL and SN mutant forms (28Field H. Ali B.R.S. Sherwin T. Gull K. Croft S.L. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bound to reduced glutathione beads were quantitated by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE, and equal amounts (∼10 μg each) were incubated with 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP) for 10 min at 37 °C. After loading of the radiolabeled nucleotide, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg ml−1 BSA) before initiation of hydrolysis by incubation at 37 °C. At each time point an aliquot of the reaction was quenched by adding an equal volume of quench buffer (5 mm EDTA, 50 mm GTP, 50 mm GDP). The degree of hydrolysis was analyzed by separating quenched reactions on 0.1-mm cellulose TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel), with 0.75 mKH2PO4 as mobile phase (33Foster R. Hu K.-Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The TLC plate was air-dried and transferred to a PhosphorImager cassette for detection (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). The ratio of GTP to GDP at time zero was set as 0 percent hydrolysis (note that [α-32P]GTP as supplied by the manufacturer contains trace levels of GDP). Nonenzymatic hydrolysis was monitored by assays that included glutathione beads without recombinant fusion protein and was typically less than 5% after 2 h of incubation (28Field H. Ali B.R.S. Sherwin T. Gull K. Croft S.L. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assay for endocytosis of a fluid phase marker with time, log phase cells were harvested, and appropriate cell numbers (2.5 × 107/measurement) were centrifuged (1,200 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), resuspended in TES (30 mm TES, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KH2PO4, 120 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 0.2 mm adenosine, pH 7.5) containing 3 mg ml−1 Lucifer Yellow (Molecular Probes), and cultures divided into 3 aliquots for incubation at 27 (procyclic), and 37 (bloodstream form), and 0 °C for specific times before being washed five times with 1 ml of PBS (tabletop centrifuge, top speed, 40 s, 4 °C). The final pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1% SDS in TES to lyse cells and release internalized Lucifer Yellow for spectrophotometric assay. 90 μl of each sample was resuspended in 2 ml of 1% SDS/TES in a cuvette for analysis. At each measurement, the fluorescence at 0 °C was subtracted from that obtained at 27 or 37 °C. Fluorescence was quantitated with a Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) configured at λem 532 nm, λabs 428 nm, 10 nm slit width. 1% SDS/TES was used as a blank and a range of Lucifer Yellow concentrations used for calibration. Procyclic trypomastigotes were adhered to precoated poly-l-lysine slides for 3 min at room temperature (Sigma), fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Sigma), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS as described (28Field H.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antigen was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). The procedure for fluorescent staining of bloodstream forms was identical, except that the cells were adhered to slides in PBS, 10 mm glucose for 15 min at 4 °C prior to fixation. For accumulation of BODIPY®-conjugated bovine serum albumin, procyclic trypomastigotes were harvested and resuspended in serum-free SDM79 medium containing 1% BSA, incubated for 5 min at 27 °C, pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of SDM79 containing 2 mg ml−1 BODIPY-BSA (Molecular Probes), and incubated for 10 min at 27 °C before fixing as above. For LDL, log phase parental or mutant trypomastigotes were harvested and adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Sigma) for 3 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then washed with PBS (Sigma). For visualization of LDL-binding sites, procyclics were stained with 10 μg/ml BODIPY-LDL (Molecular Probes) in goat serum/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. All slides finally washed with PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 1 min before final washing with PBS and mounting with Vectastain (Vectalabs). Cells were examined using a Nikon Microphot II microscope and images captured with a Photometrics CH250 Slow Scan charge-coupled device camera. Images were digitized using IP Lab spectrum 3.1 software, false colored, and assembled into figures using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). LDL quantities are expressed as mass of apoB, the major protein component of LDL. 100 μg of LDL was iodinated with 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (100 mCi/ml) using chloramine T (Sigma). LDL and chloramine T were separately dissolved in sterile buffer (0.5m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) to obtain a 1 and 0.56 mg/ml solution, respectively. 100 μl of LDL solution, 5 μl of Na125I (0.5 mCi), and 60 μl of chloramine T solution were mixed rapidly, and after incubation for 1 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 100 μl of saturated tyrosine. Iodinated LDL was separated from nonincorporated radioactivity and tyrosine on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 25 ml of sterile PBS (Sigma). The 125I-LDL preparation was subjected to TLC and SDS-PAGE to characterize the site of iodination; essentially all radiolabel was found in a chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3 v/v/v) extract that migrated on silica TLC plates as free lipid species. To prepare cold competitor, a 5 mg/ml stock solution of native LDL in sterile PBS was clarified by passage through a 0.45-mm syringe filter (Nylon Acrocons). Transferrin (TF) was iodinated using chloramine T in a similar fashion and purified by gel filtration through a PD10 column."
https://openalex.org/W1974938963,"Sialic acids are critical components of many glycoconjugates involved in biologically important ligand-receptor interactions. Quantitative and structural variations of sialic acid residues can profoundly affect specific cell-cell, pathogen-cell, or drug-cell interactions, but manipulation of sialic acids in mammalian cells has been technically limited. We describe the finding of a previously unrecognized and efficient uptake and incorporation of sialic acid analogues in mammalian cells. We added 16 synthetic sialic acid analogues carrying distinct C-1, C-5, or C-9 substitutions individually to cell cultures of which 10 were readily taken up and incorporated. Uptake of C-5- and C-9-substituted sialic acids resulted in the structural modification of up to 95% of sialic acids on the cell surface. Functionally, binding of murine sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-2 (Siglec-2, CD22) to cells increased after N-glycolylneuraminic acid treatment, whereas 9-iodo-N-acetylneuraminic acid abolished binding. Furthermore, susceptibility to infection by the B-lymphotropic papovavirus via a sialylated receptor was markedly enhanced following pretreatment of host cells with selected sialic acid analogues including 9-iodo-N-acetylneuraminic acid. This novel experimental strategy allows for an efficient biosynthetic engineering of surface sialylation in living cells. It is versatile, extending the repertoire of modification sites at least to C-9 and enables detailed structure-function studies of sialic acid-dependent ligand-receptor interactions in their native context."
https://openalex.org/W2077785228,"The 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90), the target of the ansamycin class of anti-cancer drugs, is required for the conformational activation of a specific group of signal transducers, including Raf-1. In this report we have identified a 75-kDa Raf-associated protein as Hsp90N, a novel member of the Hsp90 family. Intriguingly, the ansamycin-binding domain is replaced in Hsp90N by a much shorter, hydrophobic sequence, preceded by a putative myristylation signal. We demonstrate that, although much less abundant, Hsp90N binds Raf with a higher affinity than Hsp90. In sharp contrast to Hsp90, Hsp90N does not associate with p50cdc37, the Hsp90 kinase cofactor. Hsp90N was found to activate Raf in transiently transfected cells, while Rat F111 fibroblasts stably transfected with Hsp90N exhibited elevated activity of the Raf and downstream ERK kinases. This may be due to Raf binding to myristylated Hsp90N, followed by Raf translocation to the membrane. To examine whether Hsp90N could therefore substitute for Ras in Raf recruitment to the cell membrane, Hsp90N was transfected in c-Ras-deficient, 10T½-derived preadipocytes. Our results indicate that, as shown before for activated Ras or Raf, the introduction of even low levels of Hsp90N through transfection in c-Ras-deficient preadipocytes causes a dramatic block of differentiation. Higher levels of Hsp90N expression resulted in neoplastic transformation, including interruption of gap junctional, intercellular communication, and anchorage-independent proliferation. These results indicate that the observed activation of Raf by Hsp90N has a profound biological effect, which is largely c-Ras-independent. With the recent finding that p50cdc37 is tumorigenic in transgenic mice, these results reinforce the intriguing observation that the family of heat shock proteins represents a novel class of molecules with oncogenic potential.

Several lines of experimental evidence have illustrated the central importance of the Raf kinase in mammalian cell signaling. Surprisingly, despite the fact that Raf has been one of the most well studied kinases, its mode of regulation remains largely unsolved (1Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 3Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Extensive genetic and biochemical data indicate that, following growth factor receptor stimulation, Ras-GTP tethers Raf to the plasma membrane for further activation by phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 1Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In fact, recruitment of Raf to the membrane was found to be both necessary and sufficient for activation, as demonstrated in experiments where Raf was artificially targeted to the membrane through fusion to a myristylation signal sequence. Such membrane-bound Raf was constitutively active, even in the absence of Ras-GTP (4Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 5Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). In addition to membrane targeting, regulation of Raf function requires the interaction with a number of partners. In fact, extensive genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological evidence indicates that the chaperone Hsp90 is an important Raf activator (6van der Straten A. Rommel C. Dickson B. Hafen E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is an essential and abundant heat-shock protein in all eukaryotes studied, and is highly conserved in evolution. Unlike other, promiscuous heat shock proteins, Hsp90 exhibits specificity for its clients; moreover, in contrast to other chaperones, Hsp90 binds substrates which have already reached their correct folded state post-translationally (reviewed in Refs. 10Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholarand 11Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Katsanis E. Pharm. Rev. 1998; 50: 493-513PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the fact that a large proportion of its clientele is composed of proteins involved in proliferation and cell cycle progression, Hsp90 has emerged as the cardinal chaperone for signal transducers, tightly connected to the function of kinases, as well as ligand-induced transcriptional factors, the latter mainly of the steroid hormone receptor family (10Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Katsanis E. Pharm. Rev. 1998; 50: 493-513PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp90 consists of two highly conserved domains, of 25 and 50 kDa, located at the N terminus and C terminus, respectively, connected with a highly charged linker (10Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A structural hallmark of Hsp90 is an ATP/ADP-binding site embedded within its N-terminal 25-kDa domain. A class of ATP-mimetic drugs, including geldanamycin (GA), bind this nucleotide-pocket region and inhibit Hsp90 activity (10Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). According to the current model, GA competitively displaces ATP and locks Hsp90 into its inactive conformation. GA binding to Hsp90 results in Hsp90s dissociation from its targets, with the latter ultimately degraded upon prolonged in vivo GA treatment (10Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Katsanis E. Pharm. Rev. 1998; 50: 493-513PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the above N-terminal located chaperone site and ATP/ADP pocket, the existence of a second nucleotide site and an independent substrate-binding site residing at the C-terminal 50-kDa domain of Hsp90 has been recently suggested (12Marcu M.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 13Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The importance of the C-terminal 50-kDa domain of Hsp90 is also underlined by the fact that it is also the region known to mediate the formation of Hsp90 dimers, the presumed active conformation of this chaperone (10Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Katsanis E. Pharm. Rev. 1998; 50: 493-513PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the Hsp90 client proteins is known to require the synergism of co-chaperones. According to one of the best studiedin vivo models of Hsp90-regulated kinases, Hsp90, in synergy with p50cdc37, its kinase-specific cofactor and oncogene, regulates Raf function (7Silverstein A.M.

Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that, acting as a Hsp90-specific target modulator, p50cdc37 binds Hsp90 via its C-terminal half and to the catalytic domain of Raf through its N-terminal region (9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A ternary kinase·p50cdc37·Hsp90 complex is then formed, which is essential for catalytic activity (7Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell.

Treatment of mammalian cells with drugs which specifically inhibit Hsp90 results in the inability of Raf to become activated and, upon prolonged drug treatment, in the proteasomal degradation of the kinase (8Schulte T.W.

Finally, exclusion of Hsp90 from the Raf heterocomplex, through expression of dominant negative (DN) p50cdc37 mutants, inhibits Raf catalytic activity (9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A.

Notably, the above Raf population which is bound to DN p50cdc37 and almost entirely devoid of Hsp90, has a normal half-life, and is not degraded (9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), underscoring the fact that the requirement for Hsp90 in Raf function (6van der Straten A.

Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 123: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hunter T. Poon R.Y.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 157-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hsp90N (originally named Hsp89αΔN), encoding a protein of ∼75 kDa, is a novel Hsp90 isoform, originally isolated as a cDNA overexpressed in pancreatic carcinomas (23Schweinfest C.W. Graber M.W. Henderson K.W. Papas T.S. Baron P.L. Watson D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hsp90N shares the 509-amino acid C-terminal region with Hsp90; however, possibly due to differential promoter utilization or splicing, it differs from its abundant 90-kDa counterpart in that in place of the 223-amino acid N-terminal domain containing the nucleotide/ansamycin drug-binding site, it possesses a much shorter, 30-amino acid hydrophobic sequence (23Schweinfest C.W. Graber M.W. Henderson K.W. Papas T.S. Baron P.L. Watson D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present article, we have identified and cloned Hsp90N as a novel component of the native Raf complex which regulates the catalytic activity of Raf and functions as a potent oncogene in established cell culture systems. The rat F111 fibroblasts have been used extensively in the study of the effect of a variety of oncogenes upon the cellular phenotype because they display a very low rate of spontaneous transformation (20Raptis L. Vultur A. Raptis L. Neoplastic Transformation Assays SV 40 Protocols. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 151-164Google Scholar). The mouse 10T½ line has been previously described (21Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp90N was expressed in these cells through transfection with a pSG5-based plasmid (Stratagene) together with the py3 plasmid and hygromycin resistance selection (21Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). For the production of c-Ras-deficient cells, 10T½ fibroblasts were transfected with a ras-antisense construct expressing the EJ-ras gene downstream and in the opposite orientation from the mouse metallothionein promotor. These cells (e.g. lines 25B8 and 24D4) express ∼30% the c-Ras levels present in the parental 10T½ and they differentiate into adipocytes very effectively (22Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Lu Y. Preston T. Narsimhan R.P. Schaefer E. Anderson S. Haliotis T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A number of lines were produced which permanently express theras-antisense and Hsp90N, using the same plasmid and hygromycin resistance selection as described before (21Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar, 22Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Lu Y. Preston T. Narsimhan R.P. Schaefer E. Anderson S. Haliotis T. Exp.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Freshly plated cells were transfected at 70–80% confluence using Superfect (Qiagen). For all lines, a large number of vials were frozen in liquid nitrogen as soon as possible after isolation and cells used for a maximum of six passages after thawing. The constructs for the expression of pEF1α-GST-p50cdc37, pEF1α-GST-MEK-1, pEF1α-GST-Raf-1, or pEF1α-GST-BXB-Raf-1 have been previously described (7Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For expression of Hsp90N by in vitrotranslation or in mammalian cells, constructs containing the complete open reading frame in pSG5 in combination with the T7 RNA polymerase system (Promega) or subcloned in the pCMV3 and pSG5 vectors were used as described (23Schweinfest C.W. Graber M.W. Henderson K.W. Papas T.S. Baron P.L. Watson D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For expression of Hsp90 by in vitrotranslation, a construct involving full-length Hsp90 in pGEM was generously provided by Dr. D. Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Antibodies directed against Hsp90 (SPA-830 and SPA-771) and Hsp70 (SPA-812) were obtained from Stressgen. Antibodies against Raf (C-12), MEK, ERK-2, or GST (Z-5) epitope tag were obtained from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal antibodies against Raf were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, anti-Ras from Oncogene Science (pan-Ras Ab2), and the anti-FLAG antibody from Kodak. Anti-active polyclonal ERK1/2 antibodies were a gift of Dr. Erik Schaefer (QCB/BIOSOURCE International). CV-1 or COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with a total of 2.5 μg DNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 24 h later, cells were incubated in fresh complete medium or serum starved, depending on the experiment. Cells were then lysed in extraction buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). For immunoprecipitations under stringent conditions, the extraction buffer was supplemented with 2.5 m urea. Following preclearing, immunoprecipitation was performed for 2 h at 4 °C, using the indicated antibodies and immune complexes recovered by binding to protein A/G-Sepharose (Sigma). Alternatively, GST fusion proteins were purified using pre-equilibrated GSH-Sepharose (9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). After three washes with 50 volumes of extraction buffer, GSH-Sepharose-bound proteins and immunocomplexes were eluted with Laemmli SDS-loading buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 5% glycerol), separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Immunoblot detection was performed with the antibodies specified in each experiment in 5% dried skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline and developed using alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL), according to the manufacturers instructions (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). For reblotting, membranes were incubated in 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at ambient temperature. For cell fractionation, following washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested by scraping and resuspended in a hypotonic lysis buffer consisting of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 150 μmNaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described above. After 20 min on ice, cells were disrupted with 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged twice at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets (P100) were resuspended in the above buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, sonicated for 3 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant, containing membrane proteins, was collected, protein concentration determined and either subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Raf antibodies or analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as described above. Hsp90 or Hsp90N full-length proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro from the pGEM or the pSG5 expression constructs in the presence of 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), using the coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate and SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase system, respectively (Promega). To examine protein myristylation in vivo, cells transfected with the empty vector (pSG5) or the vector containing the Hsp90N insert were labeled at 48 h post-transfection and for 20 additional hours in fresh medium containing [3H]myristate ([9,10-3H]myristic acid, 11.2 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number NET830). Cells were then lysed and solubilized extracts immunoprecipitated with anti-Raf or Hsp90N antibodies, as described above for non-labeled lysates, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography. To identify Raf-associated proteins, Raf was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells as a GST fusion protein and bound proteins analyzed using glutathione-linked Sepharose pull-down assays. The 75-kDa GST-Raf-associated polypeptide was visualized by Ponceau S staining and cut out from the nitrocellulose membrane. It was then incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% acetonitrile at 37 °C for 90 min, and digested with trypsin for 16 h at 37 °C. The fragments were then microsequenced as described (24Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Procaryotically expressed GST fusion proteins were purified by GSH-Sepharose affinity chromatography in NETN buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors as previously described (9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Kinase-defective (KD) bacterial (His)6-MEK-1 (K97M) was similarly prepared by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+ column (Qiagen). For studyingin vitro associations, GSH-Sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins were directly incubated with in vitro translated proteins in NETN buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound complexes were subsequently washed 3 times in 50 volumes of prechilled NETN buffer and after SDS-PAGE analysis they were either immunoblotted or, for [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, directly analyzed by fluorography. For kinase reactions, immunocomplexes were washed in 50 volumes of kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 μg of (His)6-MEK-1 (K97M) protein substrate (9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) were subsequently added to washed immunoprecipitates. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, assays were terminated by the addition of Laemmli SDS loading buffer, the boiled samples resolved by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated substrate proteins quantitated by autoradiography. As kinase assay controls, catalytically active Raf prepared by co-infection of insect Sf9 cells with wild type Raf and v-Src, or inactive Raf (K375M) were included. Baculovirus infection and culture of Sf9 cells was performed essentially as previously described (9Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 25Grammatikakis N. Jaronczyk K. Grammatikakis A. Vultur A. Brownell H.L. Benzaquen M. Rausch C. Lapointe R. Raptis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27840-27845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 48 h post-infection, Raf was immunoprecipitated, quantitated, and tested for kinase activity as above. Approximately 104 cells were suspended in 2 ml of 0.33% agarose (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, on top of a feeder layer of the same medium containing 0.7% agarose, in 6-cm Petri dishes. Growth was recorded and photographs taken 20 days later under brightfield illumination. For anchorage-independent growth quantitation, cells were plated in Methocel (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal calf serum and 20 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (20Raptis L. Vultur A. Raptis L. Neoplastic Transformation Assays SV 40 Protocols. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 151-164Google Scholar). Twenty days later, cells were washed from the water-soluble Methocel and trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity determined. Standard procedures described before were followed (22Raptis L.

Preston T. Corbley M.J. Narsimhan R.P. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼103 cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well Linbro plate (Corning) in 10% fetal calf serum. At confluence, cultures were treated with differentiation medium containing 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.2 μm dexamethasone, and 10% fetal calf serum. This medium was changed 48 h later to medium containing 10 μg/ml insulin and 10% fetal calf serum. Lipid droplets appeared ∼10 days later and stained with Oil Red-O as described (22Raptis L.

Preston T. Corbley M.J. Narsimhan R.P. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). To increase the attachment of transformed cells to the culture plates, cells were plated onto Cell-Tak, a polyphenolic protein extracted from a marine mussel, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Collaborative Research). It was performed essentially as described (20Raptis L. Vultur A. Raptis L. Neoplastic Transformation Assays SV 40 Protocols. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 151-164Google Scholar, 27Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Firth K.L. MacKenzie L.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on a glass slide, half of which was coated with electrically conductive, optically transparent, indium-tin oxide (Ask Science Products, Kingston, Canada). The fluorescent dye, Lucifer yellow (5 mg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without calcium), was applied to the cells and introduced through an electrical pulse. The migration of the dye through gap junctions to the non-electroporated cells growing on the non-conductive area of the slide was microscopically observed under fluorescence illumination. Photographs were taken 5 min later and dye transfer through gap junctions assessed by overlapping the phase-contrast and fluorescence pictures. Our search for Raf-associated proteins led us to a polypeptide migrating at the 70–75-kDa range on SDS-PAGE. Microsequencing revealed that this protein is identical to our previously identified variant of the chaperone protein Hsp90, whose mRNA was found to be elevated in cDNA libraries from pancreatic cancer tissues (23Schweinfest C.W. Graber M.W. Henderson K.W. Papas T.S. Baron P.L. Watson D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To examine the properties of the new Hsp90 isoform, its full-length cDNA (23Schweinfest C.W. Graber M.W. Henderson K.W. Papas T.S. Baron P.L. Watson D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was transcribed and translated in vitro, in parallel with Hsp90. As expected, in vitro translated Hsp90N migrated as a 75-kDa polypeptide on SDS-PAGE, a size distinct from the one of Hsp90, the latter migrating at the 90-kDa range (Fig.1 A). To facilitate the functional characterization of Hsp90N, we raised a monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing the newly cloned protein, but not Hsp90. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1 B, the anti-Hsp90N antibody reacts with a 75-kDa polypeptide on Western blots of total cell extracts from CV-1 cells as expected, while an antibody specific for Hsp90 recognizes a 90-kDa protein. To confirm that the cloned protein is identical to the 75-kDa Raf-associated protein that is recognized by the anti-Hsp90N antibody, Hsp90N was overexpressed in CV-1 cells and its ability to bind R"
https://openalex.org/W1994062125,"Dexras1 is a novel GTP-binding protein (G protein) that was recently discovered on the basis of rapid mRNA up-regulation by glucocorticoids in murine AtT-20 corticotroph cells and in several primary tissues. The human homologue of Dexras1, termed activator of G protein signaling-1 (AGS-1), has been reported to stimulate signaling by Gi heterotrimeric G proteins independently of receptor activation. The effects of Dexras1/AGS-1 on receptor-initiated signaling by Gi have not been examined. Here we report that Dexras1 inhibits ligand-dependent signaling by the Gi-coupled N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR). Dexras1 and FPR were transiently co-expressed in both COS-7 and HEK-293 cells. Activation of FPR by ligand (N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (f-MLF)) caused phosphorylation of endogenous Erk-1/2 that was reduced by co-expression of Dexras1. Direct effects of Dexras1 on the activity of co-expressed, epitope-tagged Erk-2 (hemagglutinin (HA)-Erk-2) were measured by immune complex in vitro kinase assay. Expression of Dexras1 alone resulted in a 1.9- to 4.9-fold increase in HA-Erk-2 activity; expression of the unliganded FPR alone resulted in a 6.2- to 8.1-fold increase in HA-Erk-2 activity. Stimulation of FPR by f-MLF produced a further 8- to 10-fold increase in HA-Erk-2 activity over the basal (non-ligand-stimulated) state, and this ligand-dependent activity was attenuated at the time points of maximal activity by co-expression of Dexras1 (reduced 31 ± 6.8% in COS-7 at 10 min and 86 ± 9.2% in HEK-293 at 5 min, p < 0.01 for each). Expression of Dexras1 did not influence protein expression of FPR or Erk, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of Dexras1 reflect a functional alteration in the signaling cascade from FPR to Erk. Expression of Dexras1 had no effect on expression of Giα species, but significantly impaired pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of membrane-associated Giα. Expression of Dexras1 also significantly decreased in vitro binding of GTPγS in f-MLF-stimulated membranes of cells co-transfected with FPR. These data suggest that Dexras1 inhibits signal transduction from FPR to Erk-1/2 through an effect that is very proximal to receptor-Gi coupling. While Dexras1 weakly activates Erk in the resting state, more potent effects are evident in the modulation of ligand-stimulated receptor signal transduction, where Dexras1 functions as an inhibitor rather than activator of the Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade.

Dexras1 is the prototypic member of a recently defined group of Ras-related intermediate molecular weight, basic GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). The group, which includes Dexras1, the activator of G protein signaling 1 (AGS-1) (1.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Ma C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat.

Key T.A. Kilpatrick K. Dorin R.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The increased molecular mass of these proteins is accounted for by a unique carboxyl terminus variable domain that is highly conserved within the group and bears no known structural motifs, except for a terminal consensus sequence for isoprenylation (CAA X box) (4.Graham T.E. Key T.A. Kilpatrick K. Dorin R.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Dexras1 was first identified by differential display as a murine mRNA that is rapidly and transiently up-regulated by glucocorticoids in anterior pituitary, brain, and other tissues (5.Kemppainen R.J. Behrend E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3129-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have reported that expression of Dexras1 in AtT-20 corticotroph cells results in the inhibition of stimulus-coupled peptide hormone secretion (4.Graham T.E. Key T.A. Kilpatrick K. Dorin R.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fang et al. recently identified the rat homologue of Dexras1 through its interaction with CAPON, a targeting protein for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), implicating Dexras1 in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor signaling in cortical neurons (6.Fang M. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Ye K. Luo X. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Dexras1 exerts its biological activities and the downstream signaling pathways governed by Dexras1 are not well characterized. The recent discovery and characterization of a human homologue of Dexras1, AGS-1, establishes Gi family heterotrimeric G proteins as potential signaling targets of Dexras1 (1.Cismowski M.J.

AGS-1 and Dexras1 share 97% amino acid identity, with conserved homology in the residues that vary (4.Graham T.E. Key T.A. Kilpatrick K. Dorin R.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). AGS-1 was identified functionally on the basis of its ability to activate ligand-independent signal transduction by a Giα2/Gpa1 chimera in a yeast pheromone pathway-based genetic complementation screen (1.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Ma C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The yeast pheromone pathway (8.Gustin M.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20916-20923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Erk-1/2 MAP kinase pathway mediates diverse signaling activities of receptor-tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors and G protein-coupled receptors, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and metabolism (9.Gutkind J.S.

Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). Cismowski et al. used an indirect, luciferase-based transactivation assay to evaluate Dexras1 effects on this pathway in mammalian cells. AGS-1 expression had no effect on cAMP-response element-binding protein or Jun basal transcriptional activities in COS-7 cells but produced a significant, 2.6-fold transactivation of Elk1 (7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol.

Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the effects of AGS-1 on yeast pheromone pathway signaling may translate to activation of the analogous Erk-1/2 MAP kinase pathway in mammalian cells. However, direct effects of Dexras1/AGS-1 on the phosphorylation state or kinase activity of Erk have not been demonstrated in mammalian cells. Furthermore, it is not known whether Dexras1/AGS-1 play a role in ligand-dependent signaling by Gi-coupled receptors. mitogen-activated protein N-formyl peptide receptor N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine hemagglutinin guanyl nucleotide exchange factor mitogen-activated protein N-formyl peptide receptor N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine hemagglutinin guanyl nucleotide exchange factor Activation of mammalian Erk MAP kinases by Gi-coupled receptors is mediated through Gβγ, analogous to Ste4 and Ste18 in the yeast pheromone pathway (8.Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for Gβγ in signaling by Dexras1 is supported by the observation that transactivation of Elk1 by Dexras1 is inhibited by overexpression of transducin-α (7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which acts as a scavenger of free Gβγ (13.Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Therefore, analogous to receptor-mediated activation of Gi, the interaction between Dexras1 and Giα may promote release of Gβγ and activation of Gβγ-mediated signaling pathways. Two observations further suggest that the Dexras1-Giα interaction may functionally parallel the receptor-Giα interaction. First, Dexras1 stimulates guanyl nucleotide exchange by Giα to an extent similar to that reported for receptors (7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); second, transactivation of Elk1 by Dexras1 is sensitive to pertussis toxin (7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which modifies an important site of coupling between Giα and receptor (14.Cote T.E. Frey E.A. Sekura R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8693-8698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Giα by Dexras1 may require guanyl nucleotide binding by Dexras1, since a mutant form of Dexras1 reported to be deficient in guanyl nucleotide binding does not transactivate Elk1 (7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that guanyl nucleotide-bound Dexras1 (Dexras1·GTP or Dexras1·GDP) interacts with Giα in a ligand-independent fashion to effect catalytic activities similar to those associated with ligand-dependent, receptor-initiated activation of Giα. According to this hypothesis, the release of Gβγ from the Gi heterotrimer initiated by Dexras1 would lead to ligand-independent activation of the Erk-1/2 MAP kinase pathway. Since Dexras1 potentially employs the same mechanism as receptor for activating Giα, we further hypothesized that Dexras1 might modulate Gi-dependent signal transduction by a ligand-stimulated receptor. In view of data suggesting a physical interaction between Dexras1 and Giα (1.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Ma C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we considered that a Dexras1−Giα interaction might result in cooperative or additive enhancement of Gi signaling, resulting in increased downstream activity of Erk following receptor stimulation. Alternatively, a Dexras1−Giα interaction might cause competitive or antagonistic interference with receptor−Giα signaling, resulting in inhibition of maximal Erk activity following receptor stimulation. The principle aim of this study was to distinguish between these potential modulatory effects of Dexras1 in the context of ligand-stimulated signaling by a Gi-coupled receptor. Here we report that expression of Dexras1 increases Erk activity in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells but simultaneously attenuates further activation of Erk by ligand-stimulated FPR, acting through a mechanism that is proximal to receptor−Giα coupling. Dexras1 cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. R. Kemppainen and E. Behrend (Auburn College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn, AL) in the pZL1 cloning plasmid (5.Kemppainen R.J. Behrend E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3129-3131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of Dexras1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/His-C mammalian expression plasmid (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) as described (4.Graham T.E. Key T.A. Kilpatrick K. Dorin R.I. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3-FPR expression plasmid has been described (15.Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The pSRα expression plasmid for hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Erk-2 (HA-Erk-2) was a gift of Dr. J. S. Gutkind (Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Polyclonal antibody recognizing Giα1–3 and monoclonal antibody to hemagglutinin antigen was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Corp. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphoryl-specific (phoshpo-Thr202/Tyr204) and non-phosphoryl-specific polyclonal antibodies against Erk-1/2 (p42/p44 MAP kinases) were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). COS-7 cells were from the ATCC (Manassas, VA), and HEK-293 cells stably expressing the large-T antigen were a gift of Dr. Ulla Naus (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). [35S]GTPγS was from NEN Life Sciences Products (Boston, MA).32P-labeled β-NAD, N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (f-MLF), and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were split 24 h prior to transfection so that 80% confluency was achieved at the time of transfection, and f-MLF treatments and collection of cell lysates were conducted 24 h following transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. pcDNA3.1/His-C empty plasmid was used as a negative control for the Dexras1 expression plasmid. Cells for membrane preparations were obtained from cultures in multiple 100-mm plates, each transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-FPR and 3 μg of pcDNA3.1/His-Dexras1 or empty vector. Cells for Erk phosphorylation or kinase activity assays were cultured in 35-mm 6-well plates and transfected with: 0.33 μg pcDNA3-FPR, 0.33 μg pcDNA3.1/His-Dexras1, or empty vector and 0.33 μg pSRα-HA-Erk-2; pcDNA3.1 empty vector was substituted for pSRα-HA-Erk-2 in experiments measuring the phosphorylation of endogenous Erk. Cells for luciferase reporter transactivation assays were cultured in 35-mm 6-well plates and transfected with 500 ng of reporter pFR-luc, 50 ng of expression plasmid for Elk1-GAL4dbd fusion protein, and 500 ng of either pcDNA-Dexras1 or control pcDNA3.1/His plasmids. The PathDetect system (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) was used as recommended by the manufacturer to measure the transcriptional activity of an Elk1-GAL4dbd chimera against a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the GAL4 upstream activation site (GAL4-UAS). Luciferase activity was measured in arbitrary luminescence units as previously described (16.Malkoski S.P. Dorin R.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1629-1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of reporter plasmid with a plasmid expressing GAL4dbd lacking the Elk1 domain was used as a negative control alone and under various experimental conditions to establish background transcriptional activities that were subtracted from the final numbers reported. Luciferase activities for the Elk1-GAL4dbd chimera were 35- to 100-fold greater than baseline activities under various experimental conditions, demonstrating that regulatory effects were specific for the Elk1 transactivation domain. HA-Erk-2 assays against the substrate myelin basic protein were performed in vitro with anti-HA immunoprecipitates, using the technique described by Graham et. al. (17.Graham T.E. Pfeiffer J.R. Lee R.J. Kusewitt D.F. Martinez A.M. Foutz T. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6733-6744PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated myelin basic protein was isolated by separating the reactants on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging on a Storm system (Molecular Dynamics, San Diego, CA). An aliquot of the reactants was further subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a non-phosphoryl-specific Erk-1/2 antibody to determine the total quantity of HA-Erk-2 (New England Biolabs). COS-7 cells were transfected as described above, and isolated membranes were prepared according to the method of Manning and co-workers. (18.Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A.

GTPγS binding to isolated membranes was assayed using a modification of the technique described by Seifert et. al. (19.Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), differing only in that the binding buffer contained 5 μm GDP and 1 nm[35S]GTPγS. In vitro pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of proteins in isolated membranes (25 μg) was performed using a standard technique (20.Carty D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized after completion of the ADP-ribosylation reaction by boiling in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE; [32P]ADP-ribosylation of Giα species (∼41-kDa band) was imaged and quantitated by phosphorimaging. For analysis of activated, endogenous Erk-1/2, cells were treated, and lysates were prepared as for in vitro kinase assays; lysates were boiled with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with phosphoryl-specific antibodies to Erk-1/2. For analysis of Giα expression in membranes, 50 μg of membrane protein was directly solubilized by boiling in Laemmli buffer and analyzed. A polyclonal antibody recognizing Giα1–3 was used to detect Giα species. Secondary reagents and chemiluminescent detection substrate were provided by the Western Breeze system (Invitrogen) and used as recommended by the manufacturer. The relative intensities of bands on blots were quantitated by autoluminography using the Kodak 440cf digital imaging system (available through NEN Life Science Products). Cell surface expression of FPR was quantitated by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescent ligand binding in COS-7 cells as described (21.Vilven J.C. Domalewski M. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Muthukumaraswamy N. Harris R.B. Freer R.J. Sklar L.A. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1998; 18: 187-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with expression plasmids for FPR and Dexras1 or empty control plasmid in ratios comparable with those used for other assays. Cell samples were stained with 10 nm N-formyl-Nleu-Leu-Phe-Nleu-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein and analyzed by flow cytometry for the fraction of cells expressing the FPR. The mean channel fluorescence was determined for the population of FPR-expressing cells and compared with the population co-transfected with control plasmid. Quantitative data were analyzed using ANOVA, with post-hoc analysis using a paired t test and pairing assigned on the basis of replicate experiments. A pvalue of < 0.05 defined significant variation. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and each independent experiment was repeated at least twice. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Overexpression of AGS-1, the human homologue of Dexras1, has been reported by Cismowski et al. to activate Elk1, but not cAMP-response element-binding protein or Jun, as assessed by an indirect transactivation assay (PathDetect, Stratagene) (7.Cismowski M.J.

As shown in Fig. 1A, using the same assay, we observed a similar transactivation of Elk1 when mouse Dexras1 was over-expressed in either COS7 or HEK-293 cells. Dexras1-dependent activation of Elk1 was reduced by overnight pretreatment with pertussis toxin (89 ± 4% reduction, p < 0.01) or by transient co-expression of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase carboxyl terminus peptide (ct-β-ARK), a scavenger of free Gβγ (65 ± 4% reduction, p < 0.01) (22.Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We specifically tested for, but did not find, any difference in the protein expression level of Dexras1 in cells treated with pertussis toxin or co-expressing ct-β-ARK (as detected by Western blotting, data not shown). The sensitivity to pertussis toxin is consistent with the reported mechanism of Dexras1/AGS-1 to activate the Giα subunit. Release of free Gβγ following ligand-stimulated receptor activation is believed to play an important role in the activation of Erk-1/2 MAP kinases (23.Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of ct-β-ARK co-expression is consistent with a mechanism for Elk1 activation that involves release of free Gβγ subunits as proposed by Cismowski et al. (7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) The magnitude of Elk1 activation caused by expression of Dexras1 was modest (2.3 ± 0.3-fold) and consistent with the 2.6-fold increase in Elk1 transactivation reported by Cismowski et. al. (7.Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) Elk1 is a nuclear transcription factor whose phosphorylation and transactivation lie downstream of the Erk-1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway in many cell types (12.Gille H.

Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), suggesting that Dexras1 may utilize the Raf-1/MEK/Erk-1/2 signaling cascade in the transactivation of Elk1. Nevertheless, Erk-independent pathways for activation of Elk1 have also been described (25.Shore P. Whitmarsh A.J. Bhaskaran R. Davis R.J. Waltho J.P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3338-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26.Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of Dexras1 expression on more proximal signaling events in this pathway, we examined the ability of Dexras1 to influence Erk activity measured by an in vitro immune complex kinase assay utilizing co-transfected, hemagglutinin antigen-tagged Erk-2 (HA-Erk-2). As shown in Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5, co-transfection of COS-7 cells with an increasing quantity of expression plasmid for Dexras1 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in HA-Erk-2 activity against the myelin basic protein substrate, ranging from 1.9-fold (0.5 μg of plasmid DNA) to 4.9-fold (2.0 μg of plasmid DNA) over baseline. Overnight pretreatment of Dexras1-transfected cells with pertussis toxin or co-transfection of the ct-β-ARK peptide resulted in reductions in HA-Erk-2 activity comparable in magnitude to the inhibitory effects of these agents on Elk1 transactivation (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7). To evaluate the effects of Dexras1 on ligand-stimulated signaling by a Gi-coupled receptor, we co-expressed Dexras1 with the Giα2/Giα3-coupled (27.Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) FPR in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells. Previous reports indicate that neither cell line expresses the endogenous FPR (28.Perez H.D.

Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of Dexras1 on FPR signaling before and after stimulation of cells with f-MLF, a peptide ligand of the FPR. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1–3), stimulation with f-MLF caused a 6.3-fold maximal increase in phosphorylation of endogenous Erk-1/2 in each cell type as detected by phosphoryl-specific Western blotting. f-MLF had no effect on Erk-1/2 activation in cells transfected with the control plasmid instead of FPR (data not shown), which establishes the specificity of FPR-mediated Erk-1/2 activation and is consistent with the lack of endogenous expression of FPR by either cell line. The time course to maximal production of phospho-Erk-1/2 following addition of f-MLF was 5 and 10 min for HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells, respectively (full time course data not shown). This time course of Erk-1/2 phosphorylation is comparable with that reported for other G protein-coupled receptors (22.Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The enhanced ICAM-1 expression resulted in increased adhesion of U937 cells to NCI-H292 cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein or herbimycin), Src family inhibitor (PP2), or a phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122) attenuated the IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) also inhibited IFN-γ-induced response. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, stimulated ICAM-1 expression; this effect was inhibited by tyrosine kinase or Src inhibitor. ICAM-1 promoter activity was enhanced by IFN-γ and TPA in cells transfected with pIC339-Luc, containing the downstream NF-κB and γ-activated site (GAS) sites, but not in cells transfected with GAS-deletion mutant, pIC135 (ΔAP2).

The ICAM-1 promoter activity was stimulated by cotransfection with wild type PLC-γ2, PKCα, c-Src, JAK1, or STAT1. An immunocomplex kinase assay showed that both IFN-γ and TPA activated c-Src and Lyn activities and that these effects were inhibited by staurosporine and herbimycin. Thus, in NCI-H292 epithelial cells, IFN-γ activates PLC-γ2 via an upstream tyrosine kinase to induce activation of PKC-α and c-Src or Lyn, resulting in activation of STAT1α, and GAS in the ICAM-1 promoter, followed by initiation of ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion.

The initial interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium appears to be transient, resulting in the leukocytes rolling along the vessel wall. These rolling leukocytes then become activated by local factors generated by the endothelium, resulting in their arrest and firm adhesion to the vessel wall. Finally, the leukocytes migrate across the endothelium. These complex processes are regulated, in part, by specific endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules.

Following IFN-γ binding, the IFN-γ receptor oligomerizes and brings the Janus kinases (JAKs) into juxtaposition, leading to their cross-phosphorylation and activation. The JAKs in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues on receptors that lack intrinsic kinase activity, thereby providing the docking site for downstream signaling proteins. The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which are recruited to the JAK-receptor complex via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, are phosphorylated on a conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminal region. This phosphorylation results in STAT dimerization and forms a protein complex first identified as γ-activated factor (GAF). The GAF complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the specific promoter DNA sequence, GAS, thereby affecting the expression of multiple target genes, such as ICAM-1(24Greenlund A.C.

The results show that IFN-γ activates phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C-γ2 (PI-PLC-γ2), resulting in the activation of PKCα, c-Src or Lyn, STAT1α, and GAS in the ICAM-1 promoter, followed by ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion. Mouse monoclonal anti-human ICAM-1 antibody (11C81) and recombinant human IFN-γ were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for p65, p91 (STAT-1α), c-Src, Lck, Lyn, or Fyn were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

The four ICAM-1 promoter constructs, pIC1352, pIC339, pIC135, and pIC135(ΔAP2) (pIC135 with the −105/−38 region deleted), were the generous gifts from Dr. P. T. Van der Saag (Hubrecht Laboratory, Utrecht, Netherlands). The PLC-γ2 wild type and mutant, SH2(N), in which Arg-564 is replaced by Ala, and the PKCα wild type and dominant negative mutant (K/R) were gifts from Drs. T.

The JAK1 wild type and dominant negative JAK1 and JAK2 mutants were gifts from Dr. Rothman (Department of Microbiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University) and Dr. Levy (Department of Pathology, New York University, New York), respectively. The STAT3(DN) was gift from Dr. Nakajima (Department of Molecular Oncology, Osaka university, Japan). The human alveolar epithelial cell carcinoma cell line, NCI-H292, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 6-well plates for ICAM-1 promoter transfection, on 24-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes for ICAM-1 immunofluorescence studies, in 6-cm dishes for kinase activity measurements, or in 10-cm dishes for the gel-shift assay. The human monocytic leukemia cell line, U937, was obtained from the Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taiwan, and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were split and fed every 3–4 days. The level of cell-surface ICAM-1 expression was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously (33Chen C.C. Chen J.J. Chou C.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Chen C.C. Chou C.Y. Sun Y.T. Huang W.C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate, and the basal absorbance (about 0.2 units) was subtracted. In pretreatment experiments, cells were incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin, the PC-PLC inhibitor, D609, the PI-PLC inhibitor, U73122, the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, propranolol, or the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and Ro 31-8220, and Src inhibitor, PP2 for 30 min before addition of IFN-γ or TPA. None of these inhibitors affected the basal ICAM-1 expression. NCI-H292 cells, grown on coverslips, were treated for 18 h with IFN-γ or TPA in growth medium. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (33Chen C.C. Chen J.J. Chou C.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). NCI cells, grown in 96-well plates, were treated for 18 h at 37 °C with IFN-γ or TPA and then washed twice with PBS. U937 cells were labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 ng/ml BCECF and washed twice with growth medium, and then 2.5 × 105 (100 μl) of the labeled cells were added to the NCI monolayer and the cultures incubated in a CO2incubator for 1 h. Non-adherent cells were removed from the plate by gentle washing with PBS and the number of adherent cells determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity using a CytoFluor 2300 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). To determine the contribution of ICAM-1 to IFN-γ-induced monocytes adherence, NCI cells were treated with anti-ICAM-1 antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C before the BCECF-labeled U937 cells were added. NCI-H292 cells, grown in 6-well plates, were transfected with the human ICAM-1 promoter-firefly luciferase constructs, pIC1352, pIC339, pIC135, or pIC135(ΔAP2), using TfxTM-50, as described previously (35Chen C.C. Sun Y.T. Chen J.J. Chiu K.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2719-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The following day, cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml IFN-γ or 1 μm TPA for 5 h; cell extracts were then prepared and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities measured, and the luciferase activity of each well was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. In dominant negative mutant experiments, cells were cotransfected with reporter/β-galactosidase and the mutant PLC-γ2 SH2(N), the dominant negative PKC-α(K/R), c-Src (K295M), 2W. C. Huang, J. J. Chen, and C.-C. Chen, manuscript in preparation. JAK1, JAK2, STAT1 (Y701M) or STAT3 mutant, or the empty vector. In wild type experiments, cells were cotransfected with reporter/β-galactosidase and the PLC-γ2, PKCα, c-Src, JAK1, or STAT1 wild type plasmids, or the empty vector using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Briefly, wild type plasmid or empty vector (1.5 μg), pIC135 (0.5 μg), and β-galactosidase (0.25 μg) were mixed with 1.87 μl (1:0.5) of SuperFect in 600 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, 300 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium was then applied to the cells. Eight hours later, 100 μl of FCS was added, and the cells were grown in medium containing 10% FCS. On the following day, the cell extracts were prepared. The luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase activities were measured, and the luciferase activity of each well was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. In PLC-γ2 (wt), PKCα (wt), or c-Src(wt) and dominant negative c-Src(KM) or STAT1(Y701M) mutant experiments, the wild types (1.5 μg) and dominant negative mutants (2.0 μg) or the empty vector were cotransfected. Cells were incubated for 10 min, 1 h, or 24 h with IFN-γ and then nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (35Chen C.C. Sun Y.T. Chen J.J. Chiu K.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2719-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the GAS consensus sequence in the human ICAM-1 promoter (5′-CGAGGTTTCCGGGAAAGCAGC-3′) were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and EMSA was performed as described previously (35Chen C.C. Sun Y.T. Chen J.J. Chiu K.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2719-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). When supershift assays were performed, polyclonal antibodies specific for p91 (STAT1-α) or p65 were added to the nuclear extracts 30 min before the binding reaction, and the DNA-nuclear protein complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel. After treatment with IFN-γ or TPA for 10, 30, or 60 min, with or without pretreatment with various inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were rapidly washed with PBS and then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, 20 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100). A sample of total cell extract containing 50 μg of protein was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.5 μg of anti-c-Src or anti-Lyn antibody, and the antibody-bound protein was collected using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma). The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of kinase reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of enolase, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was then stopped by addition of 20 μl of Laemmli buffer and the proteins subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE; the, phosphorylated enolase was visualized by autoradiography. Quantitative data were obtained using a densitometer with ImageQuant software. When NCI-H292 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IL-1β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ, with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide or with 1 μm TPA, only IFN-γ and TPA stimulated ICAM-1 expression, as measured by ELISA (data not shown). IFN-γ induced ICAM-1 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig.1). With an exposure period of 18 h, maximal ICAM-1 expression was seen using 10 ng/ml IFN-γ (Fig.1 A), and when cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for various times, ICAM-1 expression was significantly increased after 5 h and was maximal at 18 h, remaining at this level for at least 40 h (Fig. 1 B). Induction of ICAM-1 by IFN-γ was also demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig.2, ICAM-1 was not seen in the basal state (Fig. 2 B) but appeared on the cell surface following treatment with IFN-γ or TPA (Fig. 2, D and F). In the following ICAM-1 expression experiments, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 18 h. Under these conditions, both the transcriptional and translational inhibitors, actinomycin and cycloheximide, inhibited the IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression (data not shown).Figure 2Localization of ICAM-1 on the cell surface. Immunofluorescent staining of NCI-H292 epithelial cells with affinity-purified anti-ICAM-1 antibody (1:100). Control cells (A and B), cells after 18 h treatment with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ (C and D), and cells after 18 h treatment with 1 μm TPA (E andF) were fixed and stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bar, 200 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether IFN-γ- or TPA-induced monocytes adherence to NCI-H292 cells correlated with cell-surface ICAM-1 expression, we analyzed U937 cell adhesion to NCI-H292 cells (Fig.3). After 18 h of treatment with IFN-γ, adherence was increased by ∼11-fold, and anti-ICAM-1 antibody reduced adherence to below the basal level, showing that IFN-γ-induced U937 cell adhesion to NCI-H292 cells was because of ICAM-1 expression. Similarly, 18 h of treatment with TPA resulted in a 10-fold increase in adherence, which was inhibited by 70% by anti-ICAM-1 antibody, indicating a role of ICAM-1 in TPA-induced U937 cell adhesion. To study the intracellular signaling pathway involved in IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression, NCI-H292 cells were pretreated for 30 min with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin. Under these conditions, IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression was inhibited 34, 45, or 47%, respectively, by 30 or 100 μm genistein or 1 μm herbimycin (Fig.4 A). When cells were pretreated with the PI-PLC inhibitor, U73122, at 10 or 30 μm, IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression was inhibited by 31 or 50%, respectively, whereas 30 μm U73343 (an inactive analogue of U73122), 100 μm D609 (a PC-PLC inhibitor), or propranolol (a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor) had no effect (Fig. 4 B). Because IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression was inhibited by U73122, indicating involvement of the PI-PLC pathway, which increases diacylglycerol levels and then activates PKC, the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and Ro 31-8220, were used to determine whether PKC was involved in IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression. Following pretreatment of cells with 10, 30, or 100 nm staurosporine or with 0.1, 0.3, or 1 μm Ro 31-8220, IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 C). Because PKC had been shown to be involved, the effect of direct TPA-mediated PKC activation on ICAM-1 expression was examined. TPA (1 μm) also induced a time-dependent increase in ICAM-1 expression, which was significant at 4.5 h and maximal at 16 h and then declined after 20 h (Fig.5 A). Induction of ICAM-1 expression by TPA was also demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2 F) and U937 cell adhesion (Fig. 3). When cells were pretreated with 100 nm staurosporine or 10, 30, and 100 μm genistein, or 1 μm herbimycin, TPA-induced ICAM-1 expression was inhibited by 89, or 40, 62, 80, or 52%, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The specific Src inhibitor, PP2 (56Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), inhibited IFN-γ- or TPA-induced ICAM-1 expression dose-dependently (Fig. 5 C). To study further the involvement of the PI-PLC-dependent PKC pathway in IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression, transient transfection was performed using the human ICAM-1 promoter-luciferase constructs, pIC1352 (−1352/+1), which contains full-length human ICAM-1 promoter; pIC339 (−339/+1), which contains the downstream NF-κB and GAS sites in the ICAM-1 promoter; pIC135 (−135/+1), which contains the GAS site but not the NF-κB site; and pIC135(ΔAP2), which does not contain either the NF-κB or the GAS site but contains the proximal TATA box site. Treatment with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ or 1 μm TPA led to a 4.1- or 5.7-fold increase, respectively, using pIC1352, and a 3.7- or 5.3-fold increase, respectively, using pIC339, and a 3.5- or 3-fold increase, respectively, using pIC135. However, using pIC135(ΔAP2), IFN-γ, or TPA treatment only resulted in a 1.4- or 1.2-fold increase, respectively, in ICAM-1 promoter activity (Fig.6). These results indicate that the GAS cis-acting element is responsible for mediating both IFN-γ- and TPA-induced ICAM-1 expression in NCI-H292 cells and that NF-κB may be involved in TPA- but not IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 expression. By using pIC339, the induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity mediated by IFN-γ was attenuated by genistein, herbimycin, U73122, staurosporine, or Ro 31-8220, but not by PDTC, whereas that induced by TPA was inhibited by genistein, herbimycin, staurosporine, or PDTC (Fig.7 A). In cotransfection experiments, the induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity by IFN-γ was inhibited by the mutant PLC-γ2 SH2(N) or by the dominant negative PKC-α/KR or c-Src(KM) mutants, whereas that induced by TPA was inhibited by the dominant negative PKC-α/KR or c-Src(KM) mutants but not by the mutant PLC-γ2 SH2(N) (Fig. 7 B). By using pIC135, the IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 promoter activity was also inhibited by cotransfection with the above three mutants. Furthermore, induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity by IFN-γ was inhibited by cotransfection with the dominant negative JAK1, JAK2, or STAT1α (Y701M) but not by STAT3 (Fig.8 A). The ICAM-1 promoter activity was enhanced by cotransfection with wild type PLC-γ2(wt), PKCα(wt), c-Src(wt), JAK1(wt) or STAT1(wt), which led to 4.8-, 4.4-, 4.9-, 4.1-, or 6.4-fold increase, respectively (Fig. 8 B). The induction of ICAM-1 promoter activity by wild type PLC-γ2 (wt) or PKCα (wt) was blocked by cotransfection with dominant negative c-Src(KM) or STAT1 (Y701M) mutant and that by wild"
https://openalex.org/W2022120006,"In bacteria, several proteins have been shown to autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues, but little is known on the molecular mechanism of this modification. To get more information on this matter, we have analyzed in detail the phosphorylation of a particular autokinase, protein Wzc, from Escherichia coliK12. The analysis of the hydropathic profile of this protein indicates that it is composed of two main domains: an N-terminal domain, including two transmembrane α-helices, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The C-terminal domain alone can undergo autophosphorylation and thus appears to harbor the protein-tyrosine kinase activity. By contrast, the N-terminal domain is not phosphorylated when incubated either alone or in the presence of the C-domain, and does not influence the extent of phosphorylation of the C-domain. The C-domain contains six different sites of phosphorylation. Among these, five are located at the C-terminal end of the molecule in the form of a tyrosine cluster (Tyr708, Tyr710, Tyr711, Tyr713, and Tyr715), and one site is located upstream, at Tyr569. The Tyr569 residue can autophosphorylate through an intramolecular process, whereas the tyrosine cluster cannot. The phosphorylation of Tyr569results in an increased protein kinase activity of Wzc, which can, in turn, phosphorylate the five terminal tyrosines through an intermolecular process. It is concluded that protein Wzc autophosphorylates by using a cooperative two-step mechanism that involves both intra- and interphosphorylation. This mechanism may be of biological significance in the signal transduction mediated by Wzc."

In this study, we show that PGC-1 can potentiate TR-mediated transactivation of reporter genes driven by natural thyroid hormone response elements both in a ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manner and that the extent of coactivation is a function of the thyroid hormone response element examined. Our data also show that PGC-1 stimulation of TR activity in terms of Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion is strictly ligand-dependent. In addition, an E457A AF-2 mutation had no effect on the ligand-induced PGC-1 enhancement of TR activity, indicating that the conserved charged residue in AF-2 is not essential for this PGC-1 function. Furthermore, GST pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the PGC-1 LXXLL motif is required for ligand-induced PGC-1/TR interaction. This agonist-dependent PGC-1/TR interaction also requires both helix 1 and the AF-2 region of the TR ligand-binding domain.

In addition to those three major functional domains, a hinge region separating the TR DBD from the LBD also appears to be important for receptor function (10Miyamoto T. Kakizawa T. Ichikawa K.

Control of gene expression is a dynamic and complex process. Gene transcription involves assembly of multiple transcription factors at the distal enhancer region and the basal transcriptional machinery, including RNA polymerase II, at the core promoter of the target gene. Like other transcription factors, TRs exert their effects on gene regulation via binding to specific DNA sequences referred to as thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the regulatory regions of T3 target genes (11Williams G.R. Brent G.A. Weintraub B.D. Molecular Endocrinology: Basic Concepts and Clinical Correlations. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1995: 217-239Google Scholar). Unlike the classical steroid receptors, TRs can positively or negatively regulate T3-responsive gene expression, depending on the nature of the TREs and auxiliary proteins (12Wu Y. Koenig R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 207-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the past few years, there has been enormous progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of nuclear receptor-mediated gene expression. In the current model, TR-modulated gene expression involves the sequential assembly of an array of coregulatory proteins, including coactivators and corepressors (13Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol.

In general, the binding of unliganded TRs to “positive” TREs results in repression of basal transcription, and this silencing is mediated by interaction of TR with a corepressor complex that contains histone deacetylase activity (15Horlein A.J.

It appears that ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivators is critical for TR and other nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. To date, a large number of coactivators for TR have been defined and characterized. They include at least several proteins: 1) three members of the structurally and functionally related p160 family, SRC-1/NCoA-1 (19Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Most of the characterized coactivators interact with the LBDs of ligand-bound nuclear receptors, including TRs, through helical LXXLL motifs (where X is any amino acid) present within p160 family members and other coactivators (32Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). p160 family proteins and other coactivators contain one or more copies of the LXXLL motif in their central nuclear receptor interaction domains (33Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Thus, TRs and other nuclear receptors may differentially interact with various combinations of these multiple LXXLL motifs to assemble distinct coactivator complexes (34McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

However, emerging evidence indicates that tissue-specific or inducible coactivators may play a critical role in achieving selective and tissue-specific gene expression (36Muller J.M. Isele U.

Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). Unlike most characterized coactivators that are often expressed ubiquitously, PGC-1 (PPARγcoactivator-1) displays a pattern of tissue-specific expression and is inducible by various stimuli, including exposure to cold temperature and exercise (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar, 38Goto M. Terada S. Kato M. Katoh M. Yokozeki T. Tabata I. Shimokawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although PGC-1 was initially identified as a coactivator for the nuclear receptor PPARγ, accumulating data have shown that PGC-1 plays a broader role in mediating transactivation by other nuclear receptors and transcription factors (39Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Most importantly, PGC-1 has been implicated in the regulation of many important physiological processes, including adaptive thermogenesis (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar, 40Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and hepatic gluconeogenesis (41Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Given that T3 is a key regulator of energy metabolism and that the major target tissues of T3 in mammals overlap with the selective distribution of PGC-1, a role of PGC-1 as an important physiological modulator for TR action is suggested. Previous observations that PGC-1 stimulates TR/retinoid X receptor-mediateducp-1 (uncouplingprotein-1) gene transcription in a ligand-induced manner in rat fibroblast cells has strongly supported this notion (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of PGC-1 coactivation of TR has yet to be determined. Studies of several other nuclear receptors, including PPARγ, PPARα, estrogen receptor-α, and GR, have suggested that PGC-1 may adopt distinct mechanisms of action, depending on the identity of the nuclear receptor in question (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar,42Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D.

For example, PGC-1 interacts with PPARγ in a ligand-independent fashion via the hinge region of the receptor (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar), whereas the ligand-induced interaction with PPARα, estrogen receptor-α, and GR depends on the AF-2 region of the receptor (42Tcherepanova I.

In this report, utilizing GST pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays, we provide evidence that PGC-1 interacts with TRβ1 in a largely ligand-dependent manner. The LXXLL motif of PGC-1 and the intact AF-2 region of the receptor mediate the agonist-dependent PGC-1/TR interaction. Surprisingly, helix 1 of the TR LBD is also essential for this process. Furthermore, functional studies demonstrate that the effect of PGC-1 on TR transcriptional activation can be ligand-dependent and ligand-independent, depending on the structure of the response element with which TR interacts. The 1XTRE-tk-Luc and 3XTRE-tk-Luc reporters, containing one and three copies, respectively, of a characterized direct repeat TRE derived from the rat α-myosin heavy chain (45Brent G.A. Williams G.R. Harney J.W. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were generated by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotide response elements upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter linked to a luciferase gene (pTAL, CLONTECH). The DR4-tk-Luc reporter contains a copy of a direct repeat TRE from human 5′-deiodinase type I, TRE2 (46Toyoda N. Zavacki A.M. Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5100-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The IP6-tk-Luc reporter contains a single copy of an inverted palindrome TRE from mouse myelin basic protein (47Jeannin E. Robyr D. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24239-24248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified full-length human TRβ1 and TRα1 and rat TRβ2 cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1(−) expression vector (Invitrogen). The TRβ1 E457A mutant was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. pcDNA3-PGC-1 expressing full-length human PGC-1 was a generous gift from Dr. A. Kralli and has been previously described (43Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Gal4TRβ1 and the various deletions and mutations were created by cloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments corresponding to the different TR regions into the EcoRI andSalI sites of the pM vector (CLONTECH). These varieties of DNA fragments were also cloned into pcDNA3. Gal4 DBD-PPARγ LBD was described previously (48Hourton D. Delerive P. Stankova J. Staels B. Chapman M.J. Ninio E. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). VP16-PGC-1 and the LXXLL motif mutant VP16-PGC-1AXXAL were generated by cloning PCR-amplified DNA encoding PGC-1 amino acids 100–411 into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the VP16 vector. The GRIP-1 expression vector was obtained from Dr. R. J. Koenig. To ensure the fidelity of the resulting constructs, all predicted mutations and PCR-based constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Hela and CV-1 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Prior to transfection, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum. After 16 h of growth at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The next morning, the transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh media containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum and 10−6mT3, if indicated, were added. After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with a cell culture lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured in a Dynex luminometer. Generally, all transfections included 50 ng of expression vector for receptors, 100 ng of expression vector for coactivators, 250 ng of pG5-Luc reporter, and 100 ng of TRE-Luc reporter. All experiments were done at least twice in triplicate. GST pull-down assays were performed as previously described (49Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with in vitro translated35S-labeled receptors in binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and one tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation for 1–2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 10−6m T3, the beads were extensively washed with binding buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To determine the ability of PGC-1 to coactivate TR-dependent transactivation from different TREs in various cell lines, we performed transient transfection experiments in HeLa and CV-1 cells using various luciferase reporter constructs. The 1XTRE-tk-Luc and 3XTRE-tk-Luc reporters contain one and three copies, respectively, of a direct repeat TRE derived from the rat α-myosin heavy chain gene upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene, whereas the DR4-tk-Luc construct contains a single copy of a direct repeat TRE from the human 5′-deiodinase type I gene. The IP6-tk-Luc reporter contains a single copy of an inverted palindrome TRE from the mouse myelin basic protein. Fig.1 shows that, in the presence of T3, PGC-1 potently augmented the transcription of 1XTRE-tk-Luc by TRβ1 4.6-fold. This PGC-1-mediated activation was further elevated to 8.7-fold with the 3XTRE-tk-Luc reporter. Similarly, the activities of the TR-dependent DR4-tk-Luc and IP6-tk-Luc reporters were stimulated by PGC-1 ∼5.2- and 6.9-fold, respectively. Intriguingly, expression of PGC-1 also resulted in a 3.7-fold ligand-independent increase in TR-mediated DR4-tk-Luc reporter activation relative to a vector control containing no TRE, whereas a mild increase (1.5-fold) was also observed with either the 1XTRE-tk-Luc or IP6-tk-Luc reporter. In contrast, no such ligand-independent PGC-1 enhancement was obtained with 3XTRE-tk-Luc. Similar results were obtained using CV-1 cells (data not shown). Thus, the effect of PGC-1 on TR-mediated transactivation has both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent components that are a function of the TRE utilized. Furthermore, these effects do not appear to be dependent on the cell type utilized. There are at least three functional TR isoforms: TRα1, TRβ1, and TRβ2. Although they are structurally and functionally related, expression of TRα1 and TRβ (TRβ1 and TRβ2) in distinct but overlapping patterns suggests that the TR isoforms may have both distinct and common functional roles (3Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 50Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). PGC-1 also displays a tissue-specific pattern of expression and has been shown to be highly expressed in cold-induced brown fat cells and in skeletal muscle (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). Because both PGC-1 and TRs exhibit tissue-selective expression, we investigated whether PGC-1 function on TR exhibits an isoform specificity. To address this possibility, the effect of PGC-1 on the transcriptional activity of the three TR isoforms fused to a Gal4 DBD was examined by mammalian one-hybrid analysis. As shown in Fig.2, PGC-1 stimulated the transcriptional activation of all three Gal4-TR constructs to a similar level. This indicates that PGC-1 exhibits no preference for TR isoforms, at least within our experimental conditions. Unlike the effect of PGC-1 on TR-mediated reporter gene expression, coactivation of the transcriptional activity from the Gal4-TR constructs by PGC-1 was entirely ligand-dependent. However, in contrast to TR, coactivation of the transcriptional activity of Gal4-PPARγ by PGC-1 was ligand-independent, which is in agreement with a previous report (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations confirm that PGC-1 is a potent coactivator for TR action and suggest that PGC-1 coactivation of TR is influenced by the structure of the promoter with which TR interacts. Biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies have established that the AF-2 domain within helix 12 of TR and other nuclear receptors plays a critical role in mediating ligand-induced transcriptional activation (17Bourguet W. Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 18Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis has revealed that highly conserved residues such as Glu457 and Leu454 in this domain are very important for the recruitment of coactivators such as p160 proteins (51Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 52Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31157-31161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the PGC-1 effect on TR also depends on these highly conserved residues, we employed a TRβ1 E457A mutant fused to the Gal4 DBD and performed transient transfection analysis in HeLa cells. As expected, in the absence of T3, expression of wild-type Gal4-TRβ1 repressed basal transcription. Addition of T3 resulted in a 5-fold induction of Gal4-TRβ1 activity (Fig. 3). The ligand-induced transcriptional activation of Gal4-TRβ1 was diminished ∼3-fold by the E457A mutation when no coactivators were ectopically expressed in the cells (Fig. 3). The decreased Gal4-TRβ1 activity is likely due to impaired interaction with endogenous p160 or other coactivators. As observed earlier, a 20-fold increase in the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of Gal4-TRβ1 was achieved when PGC-1 was coexpressed (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, the E457A mutant did not alter the ability of PGC-1 to stimulate the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of Gal4-TRβ1 (Fig. 3). However, enhancement of Gal4-TRβ1 activity by overexpressing SRC-1 was severely impaired (>70%) by this E457A mutant (data not shown). Therefore, these data indicate that the requirement of critical amino acid residues in the TR AF-2 region for PGC-1 function is distinct from that seen with p160 coactivators. Initial domain analysis of PPARγ revealed that the interaction of PGC-1 with this receptor is ligand-independent and mediated by a region spanning part of the DBD and the hinge region (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). The AF-2 domain was suggested not to be involved in PGC-1 recruitment. However, studies with PPARα and GR revealed that the effect of PGC-1 on these receptors is ligand- and AF-2-dependent (42Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 43Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell.

To determine the functional domain(s) responsible for PGC-1 coactivation of TR, a series of TR LBD deletion mutants fused to the Gal4 DBD were used to perform mammalian one-hybrid assays. As shown earlier, PGC-1 had no effect on the Gal4 DBD itself either in the presence or absence of T3. PGC-1 greatly enhanced the T3-dependent transcriptional activity of full-length TRβ1 fused to the Gal4 DBD (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, the N-terminally truncated mutant containing only the intact TRβ LBD (Gal4-TR216) not only increased its transcriptional activity without coexpression of PGC-1, but also exhibited a significant stimulation of the transcription by PGC-1 compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4 B). This unexpected finding indicates that the deleted region may have an inhibitory effect on the receptor activity modulated by PGC-1 or other coactivators (53Liu Y. Takeshita A. Nagaya T. Baniahmad A. Chin W.W. Yen P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 4 B, the T3-activated PGC-1 enhancement was completely abolished by the deletion mutant Gal4-TR233, which lacks helix 1, but contai"
https://openalex.org/W1972697451,"The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) is an essential element in the complex of mechanisms that maintain low intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the living cell. This pump is tightly regulated by calmodulin through binding to a high affinity calmodulin-binding domain at the C terminus that also serves as an autoinhibitor of the enzyme. Inspection of the C terminus of hPMCA4b, the most widely distributed form of PMCA, revealed a caspase-3 consensus sequence (1077DEID1080) just a few residues upstream of the calmodulin-binding domain. We demonstrate here that, in the early phase of apoptosis, hPMCA4b is cleaved at aspartic acid Asp1080 in hPMCA4b-transfected COS-7 cells or in HeLa cells that naturally express this protein. This cleavage of hPMCA4b produces a single 120-kDa fragment that is fully active in the absence of calmodulin, because the whole inhibitory region downstream of the1077DEID1080 sequence is removed. Our experiments show that caspase-3 or a caspase-3-like protease is responsible for the formation of the constitutively active 120-kDa PMCA4b fragment: 1) Pretreatment of the cells with the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK (benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone) was able to block the production of the 120-kDa fragment. 2)In vitro treatment of hPMCA4b with recombinant caspase-3 also generated a 120-kDa cleavage product, consistent with that seen in cells undergoing apoptosis. 3) Mutants in which the caspase-3 consensus sequence was altered (1077AEID1080,1077DEIA1080, and1077AEIA1080 mutants) were resistant to proteolysis. Based on these data, we conclude that hPMCA4b is a newly identified, natural caspase-3 substrate. We suggest that a constitutively active form of this protein, responding much faster to an increase in Ca2+ concentration than the autoinhibited form, may have an important role in regulating intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the apoptotic cell.

We suggest that a constitutively active form of this protein, responding much faster to an increase in Ca2+ concentration than the autoinhibited form, may have an important role in regulating intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the apoptotic cell. Apoptosis is a well controlled form of cell death (1Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar), characterized by typical morphological changes of the suicidal cells. These changes include shrinkage of the cytoplasm, blebbing of the plasma membrane, externalization of membrane phosphatidylserine molecules, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (2Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). These phenomena result from a series of different biochemical events in which caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play a central role (3Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Caspases are all expressed as inactive zymogens, and after they are activated, mainly by proteolytic cleavage, they cleave a set of cellular proteins in a coordinated manner. They are responsible for the cleavage of many essential proteins such as components of the apoptotic machinery, several structural proteins, and various proteins related to cellular signaling. The proteolysis of a large number of substrates leads to loss of cell function and finally to cell death. Over a dozen different caspases have been identified, which act as a cascade system. Roughly, they are divided into two groups: initiators and effectors. The initiator proteases are involved in the activation of the effectors, which in turn carry out apoptosis by cleaving their cellular substrates. The common feature of all caspases is that they all recognize a tetrapeptide sequence on their substrates and cleave exclusively after an aspartate residue. The four optimal amino acids upstream from the cut-site differ considerably among caspases, which implies different biological roles for each of them. Caspase-3 is one of the key effectors of apoptosis.

(14Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar)). Excessive elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ level by ionophores or by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitor thapsigargin induces apoptosis or necrosis in a variety of cells (15Jiang S.

Moderate intracellular calcium elevations, however, have been shown to be either apoptotic or antiapoptotic depending on the interplay between the mitochondria and the ER (20Szalai G.

Numerous studies have reported that treatments that minimize increases in intracellular Ca2+ level, i.e. buffering of intracellular Ca2+ by addition of permeant Ca2+chelators or removal of extracellular Ca2+ with Ca2+ chelators, depress apoptosis (15Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Scoltock A.B. Bortner C.D., St.J. Bird G. Putney J.W., Jr. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This indicates that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ level is an important cell death signal. Other studies, however, have suggested that a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration is not essential in the early phase of apoptosis but is necessary in the final degradation of the DNA (24Scoltock A.B.

Thus, the precise role of Ca2+ is controversial and appears to be highly dependent on the apoptotic stimuli applied and the cell type being studied.In a recent study Szalai et al. (20Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a coincident occurrence of both proapoptotic stimuli and Ca2+ signals induces apoptosis in permeabilized HepG2 cells. They showed that the rise in intracellular Ca2+caused by IP3-producing agonists leads to mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake but not normally to apoptosis. This series of events is turned into an apoptotic signal by ceramide, which facilitates the Ca2+-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulting in the release of cytochromec from the mitochondrial matrix. Cytochrome cactivates caspase-9, which in turn activates the executioner caspases, leading to a finely controlled execution of cells. After the decay of the Ca2+ spike, the mitochondria reseal to maintain mitochondrial metabolism and to provide the ATP necessary to support the following steps of apoptosis. In the absence of this ATP supply, a critical breakdown of energy metabolism unavoidably would lead to necrotic and inflammatory processes.In a recent paper Pinton et al. (25Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) showed that ceramide alone, without IP3-producing agonists, induces a drastic loss of Ca2+ from the ER in HeLa cells, and, consequently, an increase in Ca2+ concentration both in the cytosol and in the mitochondrial matrix. They also showed that the Ca2+ content of the ER can be an important modulator of apoptosis; reduction of the ER Ca2+ content as well as buffering of changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration by Ca2+ chelators protected HeLa cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis. The same authors suggested that the anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-2 is based on a Bcl-2-dependent reduction of the ER Ca2+ content.Plasma membrane calcium ATPase (ATP2B, referred to here as PMCA) is a P-type ATPase that plays a crucial role in regulation of cell calcium homeostasis. Its function is to remove excess calcium from the cytosol to maintain the resting low intracellular calcium concentration and to prevent cells from a lethal overload of calcium. The pump is coded by four different genes and alternative splicing of the primary transcripts produces at least 15 isoform variants. Two of the four PMCAs (PMCA1 and PMCA4) are ubiquitous, whereas the expression of the two other isoforms (PMCA2 and PMCA3) is cell- and tissue-specific (26Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).PMCAs are calmodulin-regulated enzymes. They have a special C terminus, which in the absence of calmodulin interacts with the catalytic core, thus inhibiting the calcium transport activity of the pump (27Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+-calmodulin to the calmodulin-binding domain (located between residues 1086 and 1113 of hPMCA4b) abolishes this interaction, and the pump becomes activated. The C-terminal regions of PMCAs differ substantially from one another. Not only do the four genes differ from each other in this region, but each of them has an alternate splice option in the middle of the sequence coding for the calmodulin-binding domain (28Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This alternative splice generates two or more versions (a, b, c, etc.) of the C-terminal tail that result in very different modulation of the pump's activity.PMCA4b, although it is widely distributed, appears to be a specialized form of PMCA: 1) It has the lowest calmodulin affinity among the PMCA “b” forms, and 2) its activation by calmodulin is the slowest of all isoforms studied so far; this results in a very slow activation by Ca2+ (29Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Bajzer Z. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Additional reports have suggested that this slow response of PMCA4b is necessary for full development of the Ca2+ spike upon stimulation of cells expressing this isoform. Differences in the response of PMCAs to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration should affect substantially the shape of Ca2+ spikes. In a recent paper (30Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Penheiter A.R. Pászty K. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) we concluded that the type of PMCA expressed corresponds well with the speed of Ca2+ signals in the cell, so that cells that need to respond faster to Ca2+ spikes express faster-responding PMCA isoforms. In good accordance with this theory we found that fast pumps (PMCA2b, 3f, 2a, 4a) are located in tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, and brain whereas PMCA4b was abundant in Jurkat cells.As discussed above, several studies showed that various apoptotic stimuli might change the intracellular calcium concentration; however, the involvement of the PMCAs in apoptosis has not been demonstrated. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the possible role of PMCA4b in apoptotic cells. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing either wild type hPMCA4b or its mutants and epithelial HeLa cells expressing hPMCA4b endogenously were examined. Here we investigated mutants to the predicted caspase cut site, which is only a few residues upstream of the calmodulin-binding domain. We show that cells that expressed wild type hPMCA4b, subjected to either spontaneous- or staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis, contain a degraded form of the hPMCA4b, from which the C-terminal regulator region is cut. The apoptotic degradation of the mutants was compared with that of the wild type pump. In situ and in vitro experiments proved that PMCA4b is a substrate of caspase-3 and that the cleavage by this protease irreversibly activates the pump.DISCUSSIONWe report here for the first time that the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase isoform 4b (PMCA4b) is cleaved by caspase-3 in cells undergoing apoptosis. We identify the caspase-3-cleavage site in PMCA4b and demonstrate that cleavage at this site causes irreversible activation of the Ca2+ transport activity of the enzyme.Among the P-type ATPases, PMCAs have a unique property: Calmodulin and some additional cellular regulators such as protein kinases and calpain control its activity. In the case of hPMCA4b a sequence of about 120 residues at the C terminus is responsible for all these regulations. The N-terminal region of this sequence has a 28-residue-long high affinity calmodulin-binding domain, which also serves as an autoinhibitor of the enzyme. At low intracellular Ca2+concentrations, when calmodulin is removed, the calmodulin-binding domain interacts with the catalytic core and inhibits its activity. Upon stimulation, when the intracellular Ca2+ concentration rises inside the cell, calmodulin binds to the calmodulin-binding domain. That binding frees the catalytic core from the intramolecular interaction, and the pump becomes activated. It has been demonstrated that removal of the C terminus by proteolysis or mutagenic truncation causes irreversible activation of hPMCA4b. Among the proteases studied so far, calpain is the only physiologically relevant enzyme that cuts the pump at two or three different locations at the C terminus and causes partial or complete activation (44Wang K.K.W. Roufogalis B.D. Villalobo A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Morelli A. Castello G. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T.

The DEXD consensus sequence appears to be unique to PMCA4, because the corresponding sequences in the other isoforms (PMCA1–3) are all EEID. Consistent with this difference, they appear to be more resistant to caspase cleavage. 2K. Pászty, A. K. Verma, R. Padányi, A. G. Filoteo, J. T. Penniston, and Á. Enyedi, unpublished observation. It has been clearly demonstrated that caspase-3 plays a key role in mammalian apoptosis. Caspase-3 is activated by a wide variety of apoptotic challenges, and an increasing number of substrates have been identified. Sometimes cleavage results in activation of the substrates, as in the case of apoptosis-related endonucleases (e.g.caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD) and its inhibitor (ICAD)) (47Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar, 48Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar) and protein kinases (e.g. PKCδ, PKCθ, and PKCμ) (7Khwaja A. Tatton L. Blood. 1999; 94: 291-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18476-18481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), often by removal of an inhibitory domain or subunit.Our first evidence indicating that PMCA4b is cut and activated upon apoptosis was that in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, which were spontaneously detached from the surface, the expressed PMCA4b was degraded to a 120-kDa fragment. We showed that these cells were undergoing spontaneous, suspension-induced apoptosis rather than necrosis. A similar fragment of 120 kDa was seen in COS-7 cells expressing PMCA4b and in HeLa cells containing endogenously expressed PMCA4b when apoptosis was induced by STS. The kinetics of the formation of the PMCA4b fragment was similar to those of the fragmentation of PARP, a widely known caspase-3 substrate, indicating that degradation of PMCA4b is an early apoptotic event. The molecular size of the 120-kDa fragment corresponded well to that of the ct120 mutant, and it showed similar characteristics: It was fully active in the absence of calmodulin, and no additional activation with calmodulin occurred. The ct120 mutant ends just five residues downstream of the1077DEID1080 caspase-3 consensus sequence (Fig.2); therefore, we presumed that hPMCA4b is degraded by caspase-3 or caspase-3-like proteases. This was confirmed by the following experiments: 1) When caspase-3 inhibitor was added to the incubation media before inducing apoptosis by STS, the inhibitor prevented the degradation of the pump. 2) In vitro digestion of the pump by a recombinant caspase-3 enzyme gave the same 120-kDa fragment as in apoptotic COS-7 and HeLa cells. 3) Site-directed mutagenesis of the aspartate residues of the 1077DEID1080consensus sequence prevented the appearance of the 120-kDa fragment. The apparent molecular weight of this fragment was lower than that seen when hPMCA4b was cleaved by calpain. The calpain fragment(s) were definitely higher with a molecular mass of about 124–126 kDa. Thus, our experiments demonstrated that hPMCA4b is a newly identified substrate for caspase-3 and the cleavage site is at the1077DEID1080 caspase-3 consensus sequence. Cleavage of the pump by caspase-3 resulted in the formation of a 120-kDa constitutively active fragment.Several lines of evidence have indicated that alteration in intracellular calcium homeostasis plays an important role in apoptosis (14–25). The effect of moderate elevation of calcium concentration was shown to be either pro- or antiapoptotic, whereas a sustained excessive increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration could be apoptotic or necrotic depending on the cell type. The functions of many important elements of calcium signaling pathways during apoptosis were investigated by various research groups. It has been demonstrated that depletion of intracellular calcium stores can directly induce apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells (51Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A moderate decrease in the ER Ca2+ content, such as that caused by Bcl-2, on the other hand, protected HeLa cells from apoptosis due to reduced Ca2+ release from the ER during cell stimulation and consequently to a smaller increase in both intracellular and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels (25Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The IP3Ca2+ release channels, type 1 and 3, have also been implicated as critical mediators of apoptosis. T cells deficient in type 1 receptor were resistant to apoptosis (52Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and antisense constructs to receptor type 3 prevented programmed cell death in lymphocytes (53Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M., Li, S.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and dorsal root ganglia neurons (54Blackshaw S. Sawa A. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Khan A.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported (11Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that the IP3 receptor isoform 1 is a specific substrate for caspase-3 and that cleavage of the receptor inactivates its channel function. Although plasma membrane calcium ATPases have a significant role in calcium homeostasis, their destiny and function during apoptosis have not been considered.In vitro experiments on PMCA4b indicate that an irreversible, proteolytic activation of the protein substantially changes its response to increases in Ca2+ concentration. Early work of Scharff and Foder (55Scharff O. Foder B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 691: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that activation of PMCA4b is slow. We have demonstrated that, because of the slow response of the pump to calmodulin, the rate of response to increases in Ca2+ concentration is also slow. In contrast to the intact PMCA4b, the activation by Ca2+ of a truncated mutant (ct120) that lacks the whole regulatory region of PMCA4b was immediate (30Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Penheiter A.R. Pászty K. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because this mutant ends five residues downstream of the 120-kDa caspase fragment, we conclude that the caspase-3 fragment will also respond quickly to the increase in Ca2+ concentration. An experiment by Foder and Scharff (56Foder B. Scharff O. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) may shed light on the physiological consequences of the formation of a fast responding PMCA4b fragment. Using red cell membrane ghosts, they showed that when the erythrocyte pump (which is mainly PMCA4b) was activated by tryptic digestion, no increase in intravesicular Ca2+ concentration occurred if Ca2+entry was triggered by the Ca2+ionophore A23187. In contrast, slow activation of the intact protein by calmodulin allowed a transient increase in intravesicular Ca2+ concentration. Moreover, when the activity of the pump was inhibited by calmodulin antagonist, the intravesicular Ca2+ increased quickly to a high steady-state level, as expected. Thus, in a model system in vitro, activation of the pump by proteolysis was able to diminish completely a rather excessive intravesicular Ca2+ load.The situation in vivo is far more complex, and the distribution of different PMCA isoforms as well as the mechanism of Ca2+ signaling varies greatly from one cell type to another. Therefore, based on the in vitro experiments we cannot propose a simple model for the role of PMCA in cells undergoing apoptosis. We may hypothesize, however, that cells in which PMCA4b is the major PMCA isoform will respond quicker to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration if they produce a constitutively active fragment of this protein during apoptosis. This mechanism may defend these cells from an excessive load of Ca2+ in the cytosol and in the mitochondria, protecting them from a more rapid destruction. Our hypothesis, that an increased activity of PMCA may protect cells from destruction, is supported by two independent observations: 1) Overexpression of PMCA4b in HeLa cells prevented mitochondrial damage and protected these cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis (25Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The authors attributed this effect to a reduced ER Ca2+ content due to overexpression of PMCA4b. 2) Additionally, PMCA4b-overexpressing clones of PC12 cells were less vulnerable to Ca2+-mediated cell death whereas antisense clones were more susceptible (57Garcia M.L. Usachev Y.M. Thayer S.A. Strehler E.E. Windebank A.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Finally, the PMCA “b” variants, isoforms PMCA1b, PMCA2b, PMCA3b, and PMCA4b, have a PDZ binding sequence at the extreme C terminus that allows them to interact with specific PDZ domain-containing proteins. It has been demonstrated that the C-terminal four residues (ETSV) of PMCA4b interact strongly with PDZ domains of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK)-related proteins (58Kim E. Demarco S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2029777074,"Amino acid Asp-351 in the ligand binding domain of estrogen receptor α (ERα) plays an important role in regulating the estrogen-like activity of selective estrogen receptor modulator-ERα complexes. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen is a full agonist at a transforming growth factor α target gene in situ in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with the wild-type ERα. In contrast, raloxifene (Ral), which is also a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is a complete antiestrogen in this system. Because D351G ERα allosterically silences activation function-1 activity in the 4-hydroxytamoxifen-ERα complex with the complete loss of estrogen-like activity, we examined the converse interaction of amino acid 351 and the piperidine ring of the antiestrogen side chain of raloxifene to enhance estrogen-like action. MDA-MB-231 cells were either transiently or stably transfected with Asp-351 (the wild type), D351E, D351Y, or D351F ERα expression vectors. Profound differences in the agonist and antagonist actions of Ral·ERα complexes were noted only in stable transfectants. The agonist activity of the Ral·ERα complex was enhanced with D351E and D351Y ERα, but raloxifene lost its agonist activity with D351F ERα. The distance between the piperidine nitrogen of raloxifene and the negative charge of amino acid 351 was critical for estrogen-like actions. The role of the piperidine ring in neutralizing Asp-351 was addressed using compound R1h, a raloxifene derivative replacing the nitrogen on its piperidine ring with a carbon to form cyclohexane. The derivative was a potent agonist with wild type ERα. These results support the concept that the side chain of raloxifene shields and neutralizes the Asp-351 to produce an antiestrogenic ERα complex. Alteration of either the side chain or its relationship with the negative charge at amino acid 351 controls the estrogen-like action at activating function 2b of the selective estrogen receptor modulator ERα complex. Amino acid Asp-351 in the ligand binding domain of estrogen receptor α (ERα) plays an important role in regulating the estrogen-like activity of selective estrogen receptor modulator-ERα complexes. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen is a full agonist at a transforming growth factor α target gene in situ in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with the wild-type ERα. In contrast, raloxifene (Ral), which is also a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is a complete antiestrogen in this system. Because D351G ERα allosterically silences activation function-1 activity in the 4-hydroxytamoxifen-ERα complex with the complete loss of estrogen-like activity, we examined the converse interaction of amino acid 351 and the piperidine ring of the antiestrogen side chain of raloxifene to enhance estrogen-like action. MDA-MB-231 cells were either transiently or stably transfected with Asp-351 (the wild type), D351E, D351Y, or D351F ERα expression vectors. Profound differences in the agonist and antagonist actions of Ral·ERα complexes were noted only in stable transfectants. The agonist activity of the Ral·ERα complex was enhanced with D351E and D351Y ERα, but raloxifene lost its agonist activity with D351F ERα. The distance between the piperidine nitrogen of raloxifene and the negative charge of amino acid 351 was critical for estrogen-like actions. The role of the piperidine ring in neutralizing Asp-351 was addressed using compound R1h, a raloxifene derivative replacing the nitrogen on its piperidine ring with a carbon to form cyclohexane. The derivative was a potent agonist with wild type ERα. These results support the concept that the side chain of raloxifene shields and neutralizes the Asp-351 to produce an antiestrogenic ERα complex. Alteration of either the side chain or its relationship with the negative charge at amino acid 351 controls the estrogen-like action at activating function 2b of the selective estrogen receptor modulator ERα complex. raloxifene selective estrogen receptor modulators estrogen receptor α transforming growth factor α 4-hydroxytamoxifen estrogen response element activation function activation function 2b ligand binding domain glutathione S-transferase analysis of variance messenger RNA Raloxifene (Ral)1 (see Fig. 1) is a polyhydroxyphenyl benzothiophene antiestrogen that has low estrogen agonist activity in the rodent uterus (1Black L.J.

However, tamoxifen therapy is also associated with estrogen-like effects in the uterus with an increased incidence of endometrial cancer (13Assikis V.J. Neven P. Jordan V.C. Vergote I. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 1464-1476Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Raloxifene is currently being compared with tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer in a large clinical trial called the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene. Because raloxifene has fewer estrogen-like effects than tamoxifen in laboratory tests, the purpose of the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene trial is to determine whether the decreased estrogenic properties of the Ral·ERα complex compared with the tamoxifen-ERα complex translate to improved efficacy as a breast cancer preventive and result in a decrease in the estrogen-like side effects observed with tamoxifen in the uterus. Clearly, an understanding of the factors that govern the estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties of SERM·ERα complexes will provide additional opportunities to improve targeted therapeutic agents in the future. We have devised a mechanism-based assay system to classify estrogens, tamoxifen-like compounds, raloxifene-like compounds, and pure antiestrogens (14Levenson A.S. Jordan V.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 1628-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15MacGregor J.I. Jordan V.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 151-196PubMed Google Scholar). The assay is based on the ability of compounds to initiate transforming growth factor α (TGFα) gene transcription in MDA-MB-231 ERα-negative breast cancer cells stably transfected with the cDNAs for the wild type or D351Y ERα. The D351Y ERα was selected because it was discovered as a natural ERα mutation in a tamoxifen-stimulated breast tumor (16Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 31: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and was subsequently found to enhance the estrogen-like action of antiestrogens (17Catherino W.H. Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 60: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The critical role of amino acid 351 to regulate the estrogen-like actions of SERMs was subsequently confirmed with the crystallization of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ERα with either raloxifene (19Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.Å. Carlquist M.

Endocrinol. 1977; 75: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The antiestrogenic side chain of both 4-OHT and raloxifene interacts with the surface aspartate at 351, but raloxifene is located so that it appears to shield and neutralize the carboxylic acid. Because raloxifene is a complete antiestrogen at theTGFα gene target in situ (22Levenson A.S. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1872-1875PubMed Google Scholar) whereas 4-OHT is a complete estrogen (23Levenson A.S. Tonetti D.A. Jordan V.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the negative charge at surface amino acid 351 could act as part of a docking site for coactivators involved in TGFα gene transcription induced by SERMs. We took two strategic approaches to illustrate the critical role of Asp-351 on the estrogen-like action of the 4-OHT·ERα complex. We first showed that 4-OHT·D351G ERα complexes completely lost their estrogen-like properties to induce TGFα mRNA level, but the complexes maintained antiestrogenic properties (24MacGregor Schafer J. Liu H. Bentrem D.J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5097-5105PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, changing the dimethylaminoethoxy side chain of 4-OHT for an allyl carboxylic acid (GW7604, Glaxo Wellcome, Durham, NJ) also resulted in a loss of estrogen-like properties for the SERM·ERα complex, but again there was retention of antiestrogenic properties (25Bentrem D.J. Dardes R.C. Liu H. MacGregor-Schafer J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We proposed that the carboxylic acid of GW7604 repelled Asp-351, thereby disrupting the surface charge to prevent coactivator binding (25Bentrem D.J. Dardes R.C. Liu H. MacGregor-Schafer J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on the principles established for the 4-OHT·ERα complex (24MacGregor Schafer J. Liu H. Bentrem D.J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5097-5105PubMed Google Scholar,25Bentrem D.J. Dardes R.C. Liu H. MacGregor-Schafer J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and crystallographic structures of antiestrogen-bound LBD of ERα (19Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E.

Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar), we address the structure-function relationships of the Ral·ERα complex in this study. We have tested the hypothesis that a surface-negative charge at amino acid 351 is necessary for the transcription of TGFα by replacing the aspartic acid with the longer glutamic acid in the Ral·ERα complex. Alternatively, we would predict that the change of the D351Y for a D351F would change the Ral·ERα complex from an estrogen-like to an exclusively antiestrogenic complex. The other component of the equation is the ligand. We have used a novel raloxifene derivative, compound R1h (Fig.1), that has a cyclohexane ring in the side chain so that the surface-negative charge at Asp-351 cannot be neutralized but could be shielded instead. This would test whether shielding the negative charge at amino acid 351 or neutralization is the principal reason for the silencing of the Ral·ERα activation functions. MDA-MB-231 ERα-negative human breast cancer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Stable transfectants generated in MDA-MB-2321 cells were grown in phenol-red free minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% 3× dextran-coated charcoal-stripped calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 6 ng/ml bovine insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids. 500 μg/ml G418 was added in the medium for stable transfectants. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. 17β-Estradiol (E2) and 4-OHT were purchased from Sigma. Raloxifene and compound R1h were generous gifts from Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, IN). pSG5HEGO, a wild type ERα expression vector, was a generous gift from Professor Pierre Chambon (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/INSERM, Universite Louis Pasteur, College de France, Strasbourg, France). pSG5HETO, a D351Y ERα expression vector, and pGEX-ΔSRC-1, an expression for GST-ΔSRC-1 fusion protein, were described previously (17Catherino W.H. Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24MacGregor Schafer J. Liu H. Bentrem D.J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5097-5105PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations at Asp-351 were introduced using a QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pSG5HEGO as the template. The sequences of mutated ERα cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing analysis (ABI automated sequencer). MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in phenol-red free minimal essential medium containing 5% 3× dextran-coated charcoal-stripped calf serum for 4 days and then transiently transfected with estrogen receptor expression vectors (1 μg/cuvette), vitellogenin A2ERE3-luciferase reporter (1 μg/cuvette), and pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.2 μg/cuvette) by electroporation (950 microfarads, 320 V) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Hercules, CA). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (17Catherino W.H. Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Asp-351, D351Y, and D351G stable transfectants were described previously (17Catherino W.H. Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Mol.

MDA-MB-231 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of ERα expression vectors and 0.5 μg of pBK-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate D351F and D351E stable transfectants. Neomycin resistant clones (10 clones/transfectants) were screened and characterized for ERα expression using Northern and Western blot analyses and hormone binding assays. Clones with comparable levels of ERα were chosen for the further study. For ERα Western blot analysis, 25 μg of whole cell lysate were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Anti-ERα polyclonal antibody G20 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The level of β-actin was determined as a loading control (β-actin antibody AC-15, Sigma). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used to visualize bands using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). ERα band densities relative to β-actin from at least three separate experiments were quantitated using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For measuring TIF2 protein levels in the stable transfectants, fifty micrograms of nuclear extracts were loaded and separated on a 6% SDS-PAGE. Anti-GRIP1 polyclonal antibody (C-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Ligand binding assays were performed following a modified procedure (27Liu H. Wormke M. Safe S.H. Bjeldanes L.F. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1758-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For saturation binding assays, the stable transfectants were incubated with increasing concentrations of3H-labeled E2 (46 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature to obtain total binding. To determine nonspecific binding, each concentration of3H-labeled E2 was competed with 400-fold excess of radioactive inert diethylstilbestrol. The specific binding was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. For competition binding assays, the stable transfectants were incubated with 1 nm3H-labeled E2 with increasing concentrations of raloxifene or compound R1h for 2 h at room temperature. Each binding assay was repeated at least three times, and the K d values for E2 and IC50 for raloxifene or compound R1h were calculated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). TGFα mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot analyses as described previously (23Levenson A.S. Tonetti D.A. Jordan V.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). pS2 probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR. The primers used are 5′-ATGGCCACCATGGAGAACAAGGTG-3′ (sense) and/or 5′-CTAAAATTCACACTCCTCTTCTGG-3′ (antisense). β-actin mRNA levels were detected as the loading controls. The band densities were quantitated using ImageQuant. Reverse transcription-PCR for pS2 and β-actin were described previously (28Liu J. Burdette J.E. Xu H. Gu C. van Breemen R.B. Bhat K.P. Booth N.

GST pull-down assays were performed as previously described (29Halachmi S. Marden E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M.

The data from ligand binding assays, Northern blot, and Western blot analyses were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism. Transient transfection assays have been widely used to study transcriptional activity of ERα using a reporter gene under the control of estrogen responsive elements (EREs) in MDA-MB-231 ERα-negative human breast cancer cells (31Kraus W.L.

We have developed an assay system using MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with ERα cDNA and an endogenous TGFα gene as the reporter in which SERMs show significantly higher agonist activities (18Levenson A.S. Catherino W.M. Jordan V.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Levenson A.S. Tonetti D.A. Jordan V.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 4-OHT or raloxifene had minimum agonist activity in MDA-MB-231 cells transiently transfected with the wild type (Fig. 2 A) or D351Y ERα (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, 4-OHT exhibited strong agonist activity with the wild type and D351Y ERα (Fig. 2, A andB), and raloxifene became an agonist with D351Y ERα (Fig.2 B) using stable transfectants with a TGFα gene target in situ. Based on these data, we decided to employ the stable transfection approach methodology to interrogate the raloxifene-ERα complexes. To study the role of amino acid 351 in the agonist activity of raloxifene, we constructed the wild type (26Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), D351Y (17Catherino W.H. Wolf D.M. Jordan V.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), D351G (24MacGregor Schafer J. Liu H. Bentrem D.J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5097-5105PubMed Google Scholar), D351E, and D351F ERα expression vectors and generated stable transfectants in MDA-MB-231 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). All of the stable transfectants expressed ERα at similar levels as determined by the Western blots (Fig. 3 A). The binding affinities to E2 were similar in cells expressing the wild type, D351E, and D351G ERα. D351Y and D351F ERα had significantly lower binding affinities for E2 compared with the wild type ERα (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 B). The binding affinities to raloxifene and compound R1h were also assessed using competitive binding assays. The results are presented in Fig. 3 C. Compared with the wild type ERα, D351G and D351Y had significantly higher IC50 values for raloxifene (p < 0.01). All of the wild type and mutant ERα have relatively lower binding affinities for R1h compared with those for raloxifene (Table I).Table IIC50 values (nm) for raloxifene and compound R1h measured by competitive binding assaysAsp-351D351ED351GD351YD351FRal0.95 ± 0.154.35 ± 0.566.93 ± 1.191-aCompared to IC50 of wild type ERα (Asp-351), p < 0.01.7.70 ± 1.201-aCompared to IC50 of wild type ERα (Asp-351), p < 0.01.4.87 ± 1.09R1h69.47 ± 19.7258.94 ± 7.74272.3 ± 49.371-aCompared to IC50 of wild type ERα (Asp-351), p < 0.01.76.08 ± 15.16109.1 ± 3.241-a Compared to IC50 of wild type ERα (Asp-351), p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Our previous study (24MacGregor Schafer J. Liu H. Bentrem D.J. Zapf J.W. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5097-5105PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that a loss of the negative charge at amino acid 351 abolishes the agonist activity of 4-OHT. In the current study, we explored further the role of the negative charge at amino acid 351 in the agonist activity of raloxifene. In Fig.4 A, we compared the agonist activity of raloxifene in cells expressing the wild typeversus D351E ERα. In the wild type ERα (19Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar), a strong hydrogen bond (H-bond) (2.7 Å, 180°) is formed between Asp-351 and the piperidine nitrogen. We hypothesized that the H-bond between Asp-351 and the nitrogen on piperidine ring of raloxifene holds the side chain of raloxifene at a position that shields and neutralizes the negative charge on Asp-351. This may explain why raloxifene does not exhibit any agonist activity with wild type ERα. However, when Asp-351 was replaced by Glu-351, which has a longer negatively charged side chain, raloxifene became an agonist and induced the TGFα mRNA level in a concentration-dependent manner. The partial agonist activity of raloxifene with D3531Y ERα (22Levenson A.S. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1872-1875PubMed Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 4 B. Interestingly, Phe-351, which has a phenyl ring instead of a phenolic ring on its side chain, completely abolished the agonist activity of raloxifene. These results indicate that an exposed phenolic hydroxyl at amino acid 351 enhances the agonist activity of raloxifene. Although raloxifene had no agonist activity in cells expressing D351G and D351F ERα (Fig. 4, A and B), antiestrogenic activity was retained. We treated the cells expressing wild type, D351F, or D351G ERα with increasing concentrations of raloxifene in combination with 10 nm E2. Raloxifene inhibited E2-induced TGFα mRNA levels in concentration-dependent manners in the wild type and D351F-expressing cells (Fig. 4 C). Because of the decreased binding affinity of D351G ERα to raloxifene (Fig. 3 C), raloxifene only inhibited the effects of 10 nmE2 at 1 μm. Similar results were obtained when 1 nm E2 was used (data not shown). Therefore, a specific amino acid at 351 is not required for the antagonist activity of raloxifene, which is consistent with what has been previously reported in a transient transfection system (33Anghel S.I.

We also determined the expression of pS2 gene (34Jakowlew S.B. Breathnach R. Jeltsch J.M. Masiakowski P. Chambon P.

To our surprise, pS2 gene expression was only induced significantly by E2 in wild type and D351Y ERα-containing cells determined by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-PCR (Fig.4 D). As we mentioned earlier, the strong H-bond between Asp-351 and the piperidine nitrogen of raloxifene is responsible for holding the side chain of raloxifene in such a disfavored conformation that shields and neutralizes the negative charge on Asp-351. Therefore, raloxifene behaves as an antagonist with wild type ERα in our system. To explore the possibility that only steric hindrance is responsible for antiestrogenic action, we used the compound R1h from Eli Lilly and Company. R1h has a cyclohexane ring on its side chain (Fig. 1) and has been shown to have minimal antagonist activity in vivo (35Grese T.A. Sluka J.P. Bryant H.U. Cullinan G.J. Glasebrook A.L. Jones C.D. Matsumoto K. Palkowitz A.D. Sato M. Termine J.D. Winter M.A. Yang N.N. Dodge J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14105-14110Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Unlike raloxifene (Fig.4 A), R1h produced a concentration-related increase in TGFα mRNA (Fig. 5 A). R1h also induced TGFα mRNA levels in D351E-expressing cells (Fig.5 B). However, compound R1h did not increase TGFα mRNA levels in D351G, D351F, or D351Y ERα stable transfectants. These results indicated that the piperidine ring is required for the antagonist activity of raloxifene. To determine whether compound R1h also activates other ERα-regulated genes, we measured pS2 mRNA levels in the wild type ERα containing stable transfectants treated with vehicle control, 1 nm E2, 1 μm raloxifene, or 1 μm R1h for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5 C, R1h induced pS2 mRNA level significantly (compared with the control,p < 0.01), which was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). To further characterize the agonist activity of R1h, we also conducted growth assays to determine the stimulatory effect of R1h on the growth of ERα-positive human breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig.5 D, R1h stimulated the growth of MCF-7 cells (compared with the control, p < 0.05), which was blocked by 1 μm ICI 182,780. Similar results were obtained in T47D cells (data not shown). To investigate whether the agonist activities of raloxifene and compound R1h are because of an increase in AF-2 function, we performed GST-ΔSRC-1 pull-down assays using35S-labeled ERα. As shown in Fig.6 A, E2 induced the wild type, D351E, and D351Y ERα binding to SRC-1, which is consistent with previous reports (33Anghel S.I. Perly V. Melancon G. Barsalou A. Chagnon S. Rosenauer A.

Actually, Ral had an inhibitory effect on the basal ERα-SRC"

The data presented here demonstrate that, in contrast to activation by the cytokine, growth hormone (GH), the activation of STAT5b by the growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF), requires overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR). We have shown that EGF activates STAT5b not only in a HEK293 cell model in which the EGFR is stably overexpressed but also in the MDA-MB468 breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, EGF (but not GH) is able to activate tyrosine phosphorylation of a Tyr-699 mutant of STAT5b. Using metabolic labeling studies as well as site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified three novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-725, Tyr-740, and Tyr-743. Luciferase assays using a STAT5-specific DNA sequence demonstrate that, although Tyr-699 is absolutely required for transcriptional activation, tyrosines 725, 740, and 743 may be involved in a negative regulation of transcription. Because overexpression of the EGFR is common in many cancers, including advanced breast cancer, characterization of EGF-induced STAT5b may have direct implications in therapeutic applications.

Seven STAT proteins have been cloned and four of these (STATs 1, 3, 5a, and 5b) can be activated by a number of different cytokines (1Ihle J. Witthuhn B. Quelle F. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 2Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin.

Similar to growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors are single transmembrane receptors that are activated by ligand-induced dimerization. However, the cytokine receptors do not contain a tyrosine kinase activity; rather they recruit one or more of a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases known as JAK kinases (JAKs 1, 2, 3, and tyk2) to the cytokine receptor complex. Activation of these kinases results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more of the recruited STAT proteins (2Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Some growth factor receptors have also been shown to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins (4Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor treatment results in the activation of STAT1 and STAT3, and EGF can activate STATs 1, 3, and 5 (5David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C.

Although JAK kinases are activated after growth factor stimulation, they are not required for growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT3 (4Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In response to cytokine treatment, STAT proteins are activated by the phosphorylation of a single tyrosine residue at the C terminus of the molecule. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs results in STAT dimerization through phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions. Dimerization leads to nuclear translocation and binding of STAT dimers to consensus elements upstream of regulated genes. There is evidence that STATs 1, 3, and 5 are also serine-phosphorylated in their C-terminal transactivation domain resulting in maximal transcriptional activation (9Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). The importance of this C-terminal domain is evidenced by the fact that its truncation results in dominant negative STAT proteins that are able to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the wild type STAT proteins (2Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, these C-terminal truncated proteins provide a direct means of inhibiting the biological function of wild type STATs at the cellular level. The biological actions of STAT proteins are diverse and involve a number of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar).In our previous work on growth hormone (GH) receptor signaling, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, we identified and cloned the human forms of STAT5a and STAT5b, encoded by two separate genes that result in two highly homologous proteins (94% homology at the amino acid level) (11Silva C. Lu H. Day R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cytokine activation results in the phosphorylation of tyrosine 694 of STAT5a and tyrosine 699 of STAT5b (6Grimley P.M. Dong F. Rui H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Others have also reported the serine phosphorylation of these proteins. Rui et al. (12Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) demonstrated that serine 725 of STAT5a is constitutively phosphorylated and that the corresponding serine 730 of STAT5b is phosphorylated in response to prolactin. Although they found that neither of these serines needed to be phosphorylated for maximal transcriptional activation, serine 715 of STAT5b was required for maximal transcriptional activation. Hyneset al. (13Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Hofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) subsequently found that serine 779 was also constitutively phosphorylated but not required for transcriptional activation of STAT5a.We have continued our investigation of STAT5b activation not only in response to GH but also in response to the growth factor, EGF. We have found that EGF-induced activation of STAT5b requires overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and that this activation involves the phosphorylation of three novel tyrosines. These results provide insight into potential mechanisms of STAT5b activation in states of EGFR overexpression, found in many cancer types.RESULTSTo begin our investigation of EGF signaling to the STAT pathway, we transfected the coding sequence for the human EGFR into HEK293 cells and selected for stable colonies. After selection, three clones were analyzed for expression of the EGFR. Total lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-EGFR antibody (Fig.1 A). Clone #5 showed detectable and increased levels of the EGFR, whereas clone #3 and the negative control (empty vector) did not. We then investigated the ability of EGF to activate signaling in these three clones. As seen in Fig. 1 B, EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation is seen only in the clone that overexpresses the EGFR (clone #5). In contrast, growth hormone (GH) activates STAT5b in all three clones (293 cells endogenously express low levels of the GH receptor). For comparison, we also analyzed another EGF-induced signaling molecule, the adapter protein Shc. Fig. 1 C demonstrates that Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF in all three clones, indicating that, although endogenous levels of the EGFR do not result in STAT5b activation, they are sufficient to activate the Shc signaling pathway. We also investigated whether the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b in the EGFR-overexpressing cells had an effect on the transcriptional activation of STAT5b. The stable clones were transiently transfected with an LHRR-luciferase reporter construct, and EGF-induced luciferase activity was analyzed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1 D, the clone expressing the empty vector has only a very low level of EGF-induced luciferase activity, which is due to endogenous levels of the EGFR (1.6-fold ± 0.09). In clone #3, which expresses undetectable levels of EGFR and of EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation, the EGF-induced luciferase activity is only slightly higher than that seen in cells expressing endogenous levels of EGFR (3.9-fold ± 0.16), indicating that some exogenous EGFR (not detectable by blotting) is expressed. In contrast, clone #5, which expresses high levels of EGFR and EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation, shows a greater than 50-fold increase in EGF-induced luciferase (52.7-fold ± 0.12). These results demonstrate that EGFR overexpression and EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation lead to a significant increase in the transcriptional activity of STAT5b.To determine whether the EGF-induced activation of STAT5b is biologically relevant, we investigated the activation of STAT5b in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of the EGFR is known to occur in advanced, estrogen-independent breast cancer (22Battaglia F. Scambia G. Rossi S. Panici P.B. Bellantone R. Polizzi G. Querzoli P. Negrini R.

The details of our work on this model have been submitted for publication separately and reviewed in Biscardi et al. (25Biscardi J.S. Ishizawar R.C. Silva C.M. Parsons S.J. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Results from two of these breast cancer cell lines are shown in Fig.2. As described previously, MDA-MB468 cells do not express the estrogen receptor, overexpress the EGFR (40-fold normal levels), and form large, aggressive tumors in nude mice. In contrast, MCF-7 cells express the estrogen receptor, normal levels of EGFR, and do not form tumors in nude mice in the absence of estrogen (26Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A (top panels) confirms the overexpression of the EGFR in MDA-MB468 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. Fig. 2 A (bottom panels) demonstrates that EGF-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 699 (the well-described site of STAT5b phosphorylation) is detected only in the EGFR-overexpressing MDA-MB468 cells and not the MCF-7 cells. Specific immunoprecipitation of STAT5b (Fig. 2 B) confirms that STAT5b is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF in MDA-MB468 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. These studies support those found with the stably transfected HEK293 cell model (Fig. 1) and show that EGF-induced activation of the STAT5b transcription factor requires EGFR overexpression in breast cancer cells. Fig. 2 C shows a representative EMSA analysis using the STAT5 consensus sequence oligonucleotide (LHRR) and lysates from control or EGF-treated cells (MCF-7 or MDA-MB468). The lower filled arrow points to the EGF-induced band in MDA-MB468 cells (lane 8), which is completely supershifted by anti-STAT5b antibody (lane 7,upper filled arrow). These shifted bands demonstrate that STAT5b binds to the LHRR sequence in an EGF-induced manner. Theopen arrow indicates a band that appears in control and EGF-treated samples and appears to be stabilized but not shifted by anti-STAT5b antibody. Therefore, this shifted band does not contain STAT5b but may represent other STATs or related proteins. Most importantly, these shifted complexes are not seen in the MCF-7 cells (lanes 1–4), demonstrating that STAT5b DNA binding is not induced in the MCF-7 cells; thus confirming the results seen with STAT5b immunoprecipitation.Figure 2EGF-induced activation of STAT5b in MDA-MB468 but not MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. After pretreatment overnight in BSA-containing media, cells were treated for 15 min with 100 ng/ml rhEGF.

Dong F. Rui H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). HA-epitope-tagged forms of the wild type and Y699F mutants of human STAT5b were transiently transfected along with the human EGF receptor (EGFR) into GHR293 cells. Analysis of anti-HA immunoprecipitates by anti-STAT5b blotting (Fig.3, bottom panel) showed that both forms of STAT5b were expressed to similar levels in these cells. Anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of anti-HA immunoprecipitates from GH- and EGF-treated cells showed that wtSTAT5b was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to both cytokine and growth factor treatment (Fig. 3,top left panel). In contrast, anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of anti-HA immunoprecipitates from Y699F-expressing cells treated with GH showed no tyrosine phosphorylation. However, anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of anti-HA immunoprecipitates from Y699F-expressing cells treated with EGF showed a major tyrosine-phosphorylated band (Fig. 3,top right panel). These results suggest that EGF, but not GH, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b on sites other than Tyr-699. This novel tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed with other anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). Furthermore, blotting with the anti-phospho-699-specific STAT5 antibody confirmed that this signal was not due to phosphorylation of tyrosine 699 (Fig. 3,middle panels). Also, close inspection of the anti-STAT5b blotting (bottom panel) shows that, although there is a shift in wtSTAT5b with GH and EGF treatment, there is no shift in EGF-treated Y699F despite the presence of a tyrosine phosphorylation. Together, these results demonstrate that the growth factor, EGF, can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine 699 of STAT5b as well as one or more other tyrosines.Figure 3EGF , but not GH , induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Y699F STAT5b. The human EGFR along with HA-tagged forms of wild type or Y699F STAT5b was expressed in GHR293 cells. Cells were treated for 15 min with media alone (Cont), GH (200 ng/ml), or EGF (100 ng/ml). Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (top), anti-phospho(Y699)STAT5 (middle), and anti-STAT5b (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a means toward identifying the novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation site(s), GHR293 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with media alone (Cont), 200 ng/ml GH, or 100 ng/ml EGF. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the labeled STAT5b band was excised from the blot and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were then analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and chromatography. As shown in Fig. 4, thelarge white-circled spot represents the peptide containing Tyr-699 (as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis and Edman degradation). As expected, phosphorylation of Tyr-699 is seen in both GH- and EGF-treated wtSTAT5b but not in the Y699F mutant (comparetop versus bottom panels). To characterize the novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, we focused on those spots that remained in the EGF-treated Y699F mutant (bottom, right panel). The largest of the spots remaining (circled in black) was seen not only in EGF-treated Y699F but also in the GH-treated sample (and to some extent, the untreated Cont). Amino acid analysis allowed us to determine that this spot corresponded to phosphoserine. The other two series of five and three spots that were seen only in the EGF-treated Y699F mutant (bracketed) were found to contain phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine (as labeled). The fact that these two series of spots are not seen in the GH-treated Y699F sample (bottom, middle panel) suggests that they represent one or more of the novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylations. Importantly, these spots are also seen in the EGF-treated wtSTAT5b (top, right panel), indicating that these phosphorylations may also be present under physiological conditions.Figure 4Tryptic digests of wild type and Y699F STAT5b. GHR293 cells transiently expressing HA-tagged wtSTAT5b or Y699F mutant STAT5b were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with media (Cont), or 200 ng/ml GH or 100 ng/ml EGF. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the band corresponding to STAT5b was excised from the blot and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were then analyzed by two-dimensional chromatography/electrophoresis (as shown by arrows). Thewhite circle represents Tyr-699 as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis and Edman degradation. In the lower right panel, the dark circle is phosphoserine and thebrackets are as labeled (and determined by phosphoamino acid analysis).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The pattern of spots seen in Fig. 4 (lower right panel) indicates that the peptides they represent are in some way related. They may result from a change in hydrophobicity (affecting the chromatography) and/or incomplete tryptic digestion possibly due to closely spaced cleavage sites. Furthermore, the presence of serine phosphorylation in this series of spots demonstrates that the peptide is serine- as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated. Given the low mobility of these peptides during electrophoresis, these peptides are likely to be large. To predict which tyrosines may be responsible for the novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, we began by listing the theoretical peptides that would result from trypsin proteolysis of STAT5b. Trypsin typically cleaves proteins C-terminal to lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues. We found that a total of greater than 80 potential peptides would result from trypsin digestion of STAT5b. Fig.5 depicts the domain structure of STAT5b and the tryptic peptides that result from proteolysis of the SH2 domain through the C terminus of STAT5b. Tyr-699 is found here in a relatively short peptide (AVDGYVK). In addition, three tyrosines (Y725/740/743) are found in an unusually large peptide that is followed by two adjacent arginines (R). Furthermore, this peptide also contains the serine sites reported to be phosphorylated in response to prolactin (S715/730) (12Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These characteristics (potential serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, large size, and potentially incomplete digestion pattern at the arginines) led us to investigate further this peptide as representing the series of five and three spots shown in Fig. 4. We predicted that one or more of the three tyrosines in this peptide would be responsible for the novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylations.Figure 5Predicted tryptic peptides of STAT5b.Theoretical proteolysis of STAT5b by trypsin occurs after each lysine (K) and arginine (R). The peptides shown represent the region of STAT5b from the start of the SH2 domain through the C terminus. Tyrosines of interest are circled, and reported serine phosphorylation sites are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Despite numerous attempts, we could not identify the phosphorylated amino acid(s) by Edman degradation because the peptides were of low abundance (probably because of low yield due to their relatively large size). Furthermore, unlike the single spot representing tyrosine 699, in this case the 32P label was distributed among a number of spots. Thus, we decided to use site-directed mutagenesis, targeting the three tyrosines contained in the large peptide described in Fig. 5. As a first step toward determining whether any of these three tyrosines were novel phosphorylation sites, we reconstructed the STAT5b expression vector using a poly-histidine epitope tag (His) in place of the HA-epitope tag, which itself contains three tyrosines (YPYDVPDYA). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the His epitope tag also allowed purification using the Nickel-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen). As shown in Fig. 6, EGF induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of His-tagged Y699F STAT5b, ruling out the possibility that the phosphorylation detected previously was due to the three tyrosines in the HA-epitope. Also seen under these conditions is a constitutive level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Y699F STAT5b (Cont) that is not seen in the wild type control (His-STAT5b, Cont). A nonspecific band in the anti-pTyr blot migrates just above STAT5b (open arrow) and is consistently seen (although at varying levels) in subsequent figures. As seen previously with the HA-tagged constructs, anti-STAT5b blotting demonstrates a shift in the wtSTAT5b protein upon activation by EGF, resulting in two additional STAT5b bands. However, a shift in the Y699F mutant is not as dramatic despite an EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 6His-tagged Y699F STAT5b is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF. The coding sequence for STAT5b was tagged with an epitope containing six histidines (His) and expressed in GHR293 cells along with the EGFR. Cells were treated and lysates isolated as previously. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” nickel-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) were used to isolate the His-tagged proteins. The filled arrow indicates the STAT5b band, and the open arrow indicates a nonspecific protein that binds to the nickel-agarose beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the His-tagged Y699F STAT5b, we mutated the three tyrosines, identified in Fig. 5 (725/740/743), to determine directly whether they were responsible for the novel EGF-induced phosphorylation. These constructs were transiently expressed in the 293 cells along with the EGFR (Fig. 7). Mutation of tyrosine 725 led to a slight but consistent decrease in the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Y699F STAT5b, whereas mutation of tyrosines 740 and 743 led to a dramatic decrease in EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that all three tyrosines (725/740/743) have a role in the novel EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b. Interestingly, although STAT5b blotting does not show a shift in Y699F upon EGF stimulation, mutations of these additional tyrosines restores a noticeable shift in Y699F STAT5b.Figure 7The role of tyrosines 725, 740, and 743 in the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b. Tyrosine 725 or tyrosines 740/743 were mutated in the context of the Y699F mutant of STAT5b. These mutants were transiently transfected into GHR293 cells along with the EGFR and analyzed as in Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the mutation of tyrosines 740/743 together showed the greatest effect on EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, we mutated them individually in the context of Y699F, and analyzed for EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. As previously shown, mutation of both Tyr-740 and Tyr-743 results in a dramatic decrease in EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 8 D). In contrast, mutation of these tyrosines individually showed no apparent decrease over that of Y699F (Fig. 8, compare B andC to A). These results indicate that either Tyr-740 or Tyr-743 can be phosphorylated in response to EGF and that mutation of one does not affect the total EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y699F mutant of STAT5b.Figure 8Phosphorylation of either Tyr-740 or Tyr-743. Because tyrosines 740/743 when mutated together showed the greatest effect on EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, they were mutated individually in the context of the Y699F mutant of STAT5b and analyzed as in Fig. 6.

We chose to mutate tyrosine 405 (within the DNA-binding domain) and tyrosine 679 (not found in STAT5a and thus unique to STAT5b). Fig. 9 shows that neither of these mutations affects the ability of EGF to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y699F mutant of STAT5b (compare C andD to B). Again, mutation of tyrosines 725/740/743 in the context of Y699F completely abrogates EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 9 E, top) and also unmasks the shift of the STAT5b band (bottom panel in Fig.9 E).

In a previous paper, we demonstrated that the expression of CD40 is regulated by both post-transcriptional and post-translational processes. In this paper, we show that basal (constitutive) CD40 gene expression is regulated by a TATA-less promoter, with Sp1 as a key transcription factor. Two Sp1 binding regions were identified in the mouse CD40 promoter at positions −59 to −50 and −74 to −66. Surprisingly, Sp1-mediated CD40 transcription was reduced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation and was associated with a time-dependent reduction in Sp1 DNA binding activity. This reduction seemed to be mediated by phosphorylation of the Sp1 molecule. We also show here that CD40 expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells is up-regulated by NF-κB through two distinct sites. One of these sites (−128 to −119) was shown to bind p50 and p65 members of the NF-κB family, while the other site (−562 to −553) bound only p65.

The pivotal position of CD40 as an orchestrator of T cell-mediated immune responses requires that its activity be carefully regulated. Recently, we have demonstrated that CD40 function is controlled by post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We identified five CD40 isoforms that were generated by alternative splicing. Type I CD40 is the functional form, which contains a signal-transducing cytoplasmic domain. Type II CD40 lacks the membrane-associated endodomain and seems to inhibit the expression of signal-transducing CD40 on the cell surface. Type III and IV CD40 are membrane-bound CD40 isoforms with cytoplasmic domains not capable of signal transduction. These two membrane-bound isoforms might function as dominant negative inhibitors of the Type I CD40 isoform.Little is currently known of the transcriptional regulation of the CD40 gene. Nguyen and Benveniste (15Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have shown that CD40 transcription is regulated by STAT-1 and Ets in IFN-γ stimulated cells. Otherwise, little is known of the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of CD40 gene expression in nonstimulated resting cells or in cells stimulated by microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS).In this paper, we show, in the macrophage cell line RAW 264 and in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bmDC), that Sp1 is a key transcription factor in the basal expression of CD40 and that the transcription factor NF-κB has an important role in up-regulating CD40 expression following LPS stimulation. We also demonstrate that in LPS-stimulated cells, Sp1-mediated CD40 promoter activity seems to be down-regulated by the phosphorylation of Sp1.DISCUSSIONIn a previous paper (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we have shown that the signal-transducing CD40 isoform is expressed on nonstimulated cells and is required for the up-regulation of IL-12 p40 expression in these cells. This constitutive CD40 expression seems to be maintained by Sp1, which is known to be constitutively expressed and to bind to the G+C-rich consensus sequence (KRGGCGKRRY). Recently, we found that Sp1 can also bind to the CCTCCT motif in the IL-10 promoter and plays a key role in IL-10 transcriptional regulation in a wide range of cell types (16Tone M. Powell M.J. Tone Y. Thompson S.A.J. Waldmann H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Sp1-mediated transcription, therefore, is an important player in the regulation of the immune response.We have also shown previously that the CD40 gene is expressed as a series of CD40 isoforms (Type I-V) generated by alternative splicing. Type I CD40 is the normal signal-transducing receptor, and signaling through this receptor is blocked by coexpression of the Type II, III, and IV isoforms. Interestingly, up-regulation of CD40 expression by LPS stimulation is blocked by coexpression of the Type II isoform (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD40 signaling requires its own up-regulation. Since macrophages and dendritic cells express the ligand for CD40 (CD40L), it is possible that CD40 expression is up-regulated by LPS-mediated CD40L interaction with CD40 on the same cells. Signaling through CD40 is known to activate the NF-κB pathway, and in this paper we have demonstrated that CD40 expression is also regulated by NF-κB. Taken together, the up-regulation of CD40 expression might be regulated through a positive feedback mechanism using this CD40/NF-κB activation pathway.In LPS-stimulated cells, increased levels of promoter activity (about 2-fold) were observed by addition of a 48-bp sequence (−553 to −505) (Fig. 2 D, D9-D10). Binding of the transcription factor STAT-1 to this region and involvement of this region in CD40 transcriptional regulation in IFN-γ-stimulated cells has been reported (15Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that STAT-1 is activated by LPS stimulation through a signal transduction pathway distinct from that used by IFN-γ (18Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It would seem, therefore, that CD40 expression in LPS-stimulated cells might also be up-regulated by STAT-1.We show that NF-κB up-regulates CD40 expression in LPS-stimulated cells. However, this strong NF-κB-mediated promoter activity was reduced to less than 10% of the baseline by mutations in the Sp1 sites in the CD40 promoter, suggesting that the CD40 promoter does not function properly without Sp1. We also show that Sp1 DNA binding activity is decreased by phosphorylation of this transcription factor in LPS-stimulated macrophages and dendritic cells. We speculate, therefore, that the phosphorylation of Sp1 after LPS activation of macrophages and dendritic cells might result in a reduced capacity for CD40 transcription. There are two known mechanisms of post-translational modification of Sp1. One involves glycosylation and the other phosphorylation. Sp1 contains O-linkedN-acetyl-glucosamine residues in the N-terminal half of this protein (19Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), but this glycosylation has no effect on the DNA binding function of Sp1. The N terminus of Sp1 can be phosphorylated also by DNA-dependent protein kinase (20Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This, however, also does not appear to affect either its transcriptional or DNA binding activities. Phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, on the other hand, results in increased transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity (21Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity of the phosphorylated form of Sp1 seem to be dependent on the actual site of phosphorylation, which in turn may depend on the particular kinase. In the case of CD40 expression, the phosphorylation of Sp1 seems to down-regulate Sp1-mediated CD40 transcription. In support of these findings, decreased Sp1 DNA binding activity by phosphorylation in rat liver cells has also been reported (22Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has been reported also that the C terminus of Sp1 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II, and DNA binding activity is decreased due to this phosphorylation (23Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The reduction of Sp1 binding to the CD40 promoter in LPS-stimulated RAW 264 cells is perhaps also mediated by casein kinase II. Indeed, activation of casein kinase II in LPS-stimulated RAW 264 cells has been reported (24Lodie T.A. Savedra Jr., R. Golenbock D.T. Van Beveren C.P. Maki R.A. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1848-1856PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Sp1-mediated CD40 transcription may be regulated by the casein kinase activation pathway. Further research is needed to explore this possibility.We have demonstrated that CD40 promoter activity is reduced by LPS-mediated phosphorylation of Sp1. Since NF-κB regulates CD40 gene expression, I-κB can block this transactivation (25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5541) Google Scholar). We know that CD40 transcription is also stimulated by STAT-1 in IFN-γ stimulated cells (15Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and presumably in LPS-stimulated cells as well. We have already shown that in IFN-γ-stimulated cells, up-regulation of CD40 gene expression is blocked by the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway. CD40 transcription, therefore, might be controlled by three different negative feedback mechanisms: I-κB, phosphorylation of Sp1, and SOCS-1.Based on our results and results shown by Nguyen and Benveniste (15Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we suggest the following sequence of events during CD40 expression. (i) Nonstimulated macrophages and dendritic cells express low levels of CD40 mRNA generated via Sp1-mediated basal transcription. (ii) CD40 mRNA expression is substantially increased through the activation of NF-κB, the latter itself being sustained through CD40L/CD40 interaction. Signaling through the IFN-γ receptor activates STAT-1, which then also contributes to the enhancement of CD40 expression. Maximum transactivation, however, is maintained only for a short period. (iii) Eventually, I-κB inactivates NF-κB, STAT-1 activation is down-regulated by SOCS-1, and Sp1 DNA binding activity is decreased by LPS-mediated phosphorylation. CD40 transcription is then decreased by the combination of these negative feed back pathways. (iv) In addition, by this time, post-transcriptional regulation has become involved in the form of alternative splicing to produce the CD40 isoforms Type II, III, and IV (half of pre-CD40 RNA is spliced out to these CD40 mRNA isoforms at 24 h after LPS stimulation) (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). (v) By a mechanism of post-translational regulation, the protein products from these CD40 isoforms block signaling through the CD40 Type I receptor.The CD40 molecule is a pivotal receptor influencing the activity of many cell types, and its expression must therefore be tightly controlled. We have show in this and a previous (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) paper that CD40 gene expression occurs through a range of processes that operate at three different levels of gene expression: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation.

It has been also reported that STAT-1 is activated by LPS stimulation through a signal transduction pathway distinct from that used by IFN-γ (18Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It would seem, therefore, that CD40 expression in LPS-stimulated cells might also be up-regulated by STAT-1.We show that NF-κB up-regulates CD40 expression in LPS-stimulated cells. However, this strong NF-κB-mediated promoter activity was reduced to less than 10% of the baseline by mutations in the Sp1 sites in the CD40 promoter, suggesting that the CD40 promoter does not function properly without Sp1. We also show that Sp1 DNA binding activity is decreased by phosphorylation of this transcription factor in LPS-stimulated macrophages and dendritic cells. We speculate, therefore, that the phosphorylation of Sp1 after LPS activation of macrophages and dendritic cells might result in a reduced capacity for CD40 transcription. There are two known mechanisms of post-translational modification of Sp1. One involves glycosylation and the other phosphorylation. Sp1 contains O-linkedN-acetyl-glucosamine residues in the N-terminal half of this protein (19Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), but this glycosylation has no effect on the DNA binding function of Sp1. The N terminus of Sp1 can be phosphorylated also by DNA-dependent protein kinase (20Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This, however, also does not appear to affect either its transcriptional or DNA binding activities. Phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, on the other hand, results in increased transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity (21Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity of the phosphorylated form of Sp1 seem to be dependent on the actual site of phosphorylation, which in turn may depend on the particular kinase. In the case of CD40 expression, the phosphorylation of Sp1 seems to down-regulate Sp1-mediated CD40 transcription. In support of these findings, decreased Sp1 DNA binding activity by phosphorylation in rat liver cells has also been reported (22Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has been reported also that the C terminus of Sp1 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II, and DNA binding activity is decreased due to this phosphorylation (23Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The reduction of Sp1 binding to the CD40 promoter in LPS-stimulated RAW 264 cells is perhaps also mediated by casein kinase II. Indeed, activation of casein kinase II in LPS-stimulated RAW 264 cells has been reported (24Lodie T.A. Savedra Jr., R. Golenbock D.T. Van Beveren C.P. Maki R.A. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1848-1856PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Sp1-mediated CD40 transcription may be regulated by the casein kinase activation pathway. Further research is needed to explore this possibility.We have demonstrated that CD40 promoter activity is reduced by LPS-mediated phosphorylation of Sp1. Since NF-κB regulates CD40 gene expression, I-κB can block this transactivation (25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5541) Google Scholar). We know that CD40 transcription is also stimulated by STAT-1 in IFN-γ stimulated cells (15Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and presumably in LPS-stimulated cells as well. We have already shown that in IFN-γ-stimulated cells, up-regulation of CD40 gene expression is blocked by the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway. CD40 transcription, therefore, might be controlled by three different negative feedback mechanisms: I-κB, phosphorylation of Sp1, and SOCS-1.Based on our results and results shown by Nguyen and Benveniste (15Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we suggest the following sequence of events during CD40 expression. (i) Nonstimulated macrophages and dendritic cells express low levels of CD40 mRNA generated via Sp1-mediated basal transcription. (ii) CD40 mRNA expression is substantially increased through the activation of NF-κB, the latter itself being sustained through CD40L/CD40 interaction. Signaling through the IFN-γ receptor activates STAT-1, which then also contributes to the enhancement of CD40 expression. Maximum transactivation, however, is maintained only for a short period. (iii) Eventually, I-κB inactivates NF-κB, STAT-1 activation is down-regulated by SOCS-1, and Sp1 DNA binding activity is decreased by LPS-mediated phosphorylation. CD40 transcription is then decreased by the combination of these negative feed back pathways. (iv) In addition, by this time, post-transcriptional regulation has become involved in the form of alternative splicing to produce the CD40 isoforms Type II, III, and IV (half of pre-CD40 RNA is spliced out to these CD40 mRNA isoforms at 24 h after LPS stimulation) (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). (v) By a mechanism of post-translational regulation, the protein products from these CD40 isoforms block signaling through the CD40 Type I receptor.The CD40 molecule is a pivotal receptor influencing the activity of many cell types, and its expression must therefore be tightly controlled. We have show in this and a previous (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) paper that CD40 gene expression occurs through a range of processes that operate at three different levels of gene expression: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation. In a previous paper (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we have shown that the signal-transducing CD40 isoform is expressed on nonstimulated cells and is required for the up-regulation of IL-12 p40 expression in these cells. This constitutive CD40 expression seems to be maintained by Sp1, which is known to be constitutively expressed and to bind to the G+C-rich consensus sequence (KRGGCGKRRY). Recently, we found that Sp1 can also bind to the CCTCCT motif in the IL-10 promoter and plays a key role in IL-10 transcriptional regulation in a wide range of cell types (16Tone M. Powell M.J. Tone Y. Thompson S.A.J. Waldmann H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Sp1-mediated transcription, therefore, is an important player in the regulation of the immune response. We have also shown previously that the CD40 gene is expressed as a series of CD40 isoforms (Type I-V) generated by alternative splicing. Type I CD40 is the normal signal-transducing receptor, and signaling through this receptor is blocked by coexpression of the Type II, III, and IV isoforms. Interestingly, up-regulation of CD40 expression by LPS stimulation is blocked by coexpression of the Type II isoform (14Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD40 signaling requires its own up-regulation. Since macrophages and dendritic cells express the ligand for CD40 (CD40L), it is possible that CD40 expression is up-regulated by LPS-mediated CD40L interaction with CD40 on the same cells. Signaling through CD40 is known to activate the NF-κB pathway, and in this paper we have demonstrated that CD40 expression is also regulated by NF-κB. Taken together, the up-regulation of CD40 expression might be regulated through a positive feedback mechanism using this CD40/NF-κB activation pathway. In LPS-stimulated cells, increased levels of promoter activity (about 2-fold) were observed by addition of a 48-bp sequence (−553 to −505) (Fig. 2 D, D9-D10). Binding of the transcription factor STAT-1 to this region and involvement of this region in CD40 transcriptional regulation in IFN-γ-stimulated cells has been reported (15Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).

However, in humans, very little is known about expression of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels in male germ cells or their function. We have used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and patch clamp recording to investigate the expression of low voltage activated voltage-operated Ca2+ channels in human male germ cells. We report that full-length transcripts for both α1G and α1H low voltage activated channel subunits are expressed in human testis. Multiple isoforms of α1G are present in the testis and at least two isoforms of α1H, including a splice variant not previously described in the human. Transcripts for all the isoforms of both α1G and α1H were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on mRNA isolated from human spermatogenic cells. In situhybridization for α1G and α1H localized transcripts both in germ cells and in other cell types in the testis. Within the seminiferous tubules, α1H was detected primarily in germ cells. Using the whole cell patch clamp technique, we detected T-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channel currents in isolated human male germ cells, although the current amplitude and frequency of occurrence were low in comparison to the occurrence of T-currents in murine male germ cells.

Unfortunately, this approach has (so far) provided little information on expression of VOCCs. However, the whole cell clamp technique has been applied successfully to mouse spermatogenic cells (16Hagiwara S. Kawa K. J.

However, male germ cells of α1E knockout mice possess normal T-currents, indicating that α1E channels do not mediate the currents seen in these cells (32Sakata Y. Saegusa H. Zong S. Osanai M.

Antibodies for LVA channels are not available.Very little is known about the expression and roles of VOCCs in human male germ cells. The effects of VOCC antagonists on progesterone-induced [Ca2+]isignaling in spermatozoa have been studied extensively, but findings have been both variable and contradictory (34Blackmore P.F.

Using molecular and immunohistochemical techniques, Benoff and colleagues (27Benoff S. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: d1220-d1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence for the presence of a number of isoforms of the HVA α1C subunit in human testis and spermatozoa. However, only preliminary data are available on expression of LVA channels. Sonet al. (46Son W.-Y. Lee J.-H. Lee J.-H. Han C.-T. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 6: 893-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained a 489-bp RT-PCR fragment of α1H with human testicular mRNA. Transcripts for α1G were not detected in human testicular mRNA (46Son W.-Y. Lee J.-H. Lee J.-H. Han C.-T. Mol. Hum.

Androl. 2000; 56: 48Google Scholar).To understand the processes that underlie AR in human spermatozoa, and to assess the accuracy of the mouse model of AR, it is vital that the nature of the Ca2+ channels involved is elucidated. As a vital, first step, we have undertaken the detection, sequencing, and localization of T-channel subunit transcripts from the human testis and have applied the patch clamp technique to immature human germ cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSPCRPCR forward and reverse primers were designed to sequences of α1G from the human brain (GenBank™ accession no.AF029229) and α1H from the human heart (GenBank™ accession no. AF051946). PCR products were amplified on human, adult, normal testis cDNA (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands; Origene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) using in-house primer pairs (TableI) and the Expand High Fidelity PCR System containing thermostableTaq DNA polymerase and a proofreading enzyme (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). A human brain cDNA library provided by the Medical Research Council, Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center, United Kingdom, was used as positive control. Touchdown PCR was carried out on a Primus 25 legal thermocycling PCR system (MWG Biotech Ltd., Ebersberg, Germany). The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 3 min 30 s, followed by six cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 64 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 3 min; with a touchdown temperature change of −0.5 °C/cycle. A further 40 cycles were carried out at 94 °C, 30 s; 61 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 3 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The annealing temperatures for different primer pairs were altered in the range of 64 to 58 °C depending upon the Tm (melting temperature) of the primer pairs in use. Corresponding changes in touchdown temperatures were made. The annealing temperature of the second set of PCR cycling conditions was kept 3 °C below the annealing temperature of the first set of cycling conditions.Table ISense and antisense primers used in the amplification of transcripts for α1G and α1H subunits and the leukocyte common antigen precursorNo.α1G primersSense primerAntisense primerNameSequenceNameSequence1HGS45′-ATGGACGAGGAGGAGGAT-3′HGAS25′-TGTCTCCTCTGCTCATCC-3′2HHS85′-TGCGTGACCCTGGGCATG-3′HGAS35′-GGGAGGCTGAAATTCTCAG-3′3HGS65′-CTGAGCGTGGACCTGGAG-3′HGAS55′-ATGATGTCGACCCAGCCC-3′4HGS75′-GCCTGGATCGCCATCTTC-3′HGAS65′-TGGTGGTGATGGTGGTGG-3′5HGS95′-AGCTGCTCTCGCTCCCAC-3′A1G10R5′-GGCTGGTGAAGACGATGTTG-3′6A1G9F5′-TTGGCCGGGGAATCATGATC-3′HGAS75′-TCGGGCTCTGATTCGGAC-3′7HGS125′-TGACCTTCGGCAACTACGTGC-3′HGAS125′-TCCAGCTGCTTGCAGCGCTC-3′8HGS185′-AAGCAGCTGGACCAGCAGG-3′HGAS185′-GACAAGGACCACGTGGTCG-3′9HGS175′-TCCTGTGTCACCGATCATC-3′HGAS175′-ATGTTCAGGACAAAGAAGGCC-3′10HGS115′-CTGAACATGTTTGTGGGTGTGG-3′HGAS115′-TGACACCTGTGATGAAGAGGTC-3′11HGS115′-CTGAACATGTTTGTGGGTGTGG-3′HGBAS15′-TCAGCCATCTGCTTCTCCTTAC-3′12HGS165′-CACTTGTGCACCAGCCACTAC-3′HGAS165′-CTCTCCTCCAGGTGCTTCATC-3′13HGS135′-ACTTTGTGTCCTTCGTGCTGAC-3′HGAS135′-ACAAGACGGAGCCTGACTGAG-3′14HGS145′-TGTCGGCATGGGAGCACTG-3′HGAS145′-CTCCTCTGCTCATCCAGCC-3′15HGS15′-GAAGTGCTACAGCGTGGAGGC-3′HGAS15′-CCAGGTCTGCTGGGTCAGAGG-3′No.α1H primersSense primerAntisense primerNameSequenceNameSequence1HHS75′-ATGACCGAGGGCGCACG-3′HHAS95′-CTCGGAGCCGCACTCAAC-3′2HHS85′-TGCGTGACCCTGGGCATG-3′HHAS105′-CCTGACAAAGGCACTGTCC-3′3HHS95′-GGACAGTGCCTTTGTCAG-3′HHAS85′-CGGCACACGTTGTAGTAC-3′4HHS25′-CCAGTACTACAACGTGTGCC-3′HHAS25′-GATCTTCTCGTAGGGATCAG-3′5HHS15′-GGCTGGGCACCATGAACTAC-3′HHAS15′-GTGAATTCATAGACGCCACG-3′6HHS45′-GGTGAGCTCAGCGGCTC-3′HHAS135′-CAGCAGCCTGTGCAGAAC-3′7HHS105′-TACCATGAGCAGCCCGAG-3′HHAS145′-CGTGTCGGATCTGTTGGC-3′8HHS145′-CAACTATGTGCTCTTCAACCT-3′HHAS215′-ACAGGGAGAACTTCGGAGGC-3′9HHS145′-CAACTATGTGCTCTTCAACCT-3′HHAS205′-TGGTCTGGAGTTCTCTGAGC-3′10HHS175′-GCGATGCCAACAGATCCGAC-3′HHAS185′-ATCATCTCCGCCACGAAGATG-3′11HHS125′-GTGGCGGAGATGATGGTG-3′HHAS175′-TAGTGGCTGGTGCACAGC-3′12HHS155′-TTCATCTCCTTCCTGCTCATCG-3′HHAS195′-CATGGTGATGACGTTGACACAG-3′13HHS155′-TTCATCTCCTTCCTGCTCATCG-3′HHAS225′-GCGAGTAGTCGGCATAGTAGG-3′14HHS155′-TTCATCTCCTTCCTGCTCATCG-3′HHAS235′-CGAAGGTCACGAAGTAGACGG-3′15HHS165′-TCTACTTCGTGACCTTCGTGC-3′HHAS255′-GAGCTGGTGATGTGGCTGAC-3′16HHS195′-ACGAGGAGGTCAGCCACATC-3′HHAS245′-AGAGGAAGCTCTGGATTCTGG-3′17HHS185′-TCTTGGACGGTAGCCACAGTG-3′HASUTR15′-TCTCCTGACGGGAGGCTGAC-3′No.Leukocyte primersSense primerAntisense primerNameSequenceNameSequenceSLEUKO15′-ACACCCATTTTGTTATACTTATGC-3′ASLEUKO15′-AAGTTGTTCTAAGTCAGTAGAATG-3′ Open table in a new tab The PCR products were run on agarose gels and purified using a QIAquick™ Spin gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and either sequenced directly (MWG Biotech. Ltd.) or cloned into a pGEM®-T Easy cloning vector (Promega).Isolation of Germ CellsHuman CellsCells were obtained by two methods.For RT-PCR and for the first series of electrophysiological recordings, testicular tissue was removed from patients who were attending for treatment at the Assisted Conception Unit, Birmingham Women's Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom (Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority Center 0119). Mature, motile spermatozoa were found in all biopsies used for cell isolation. Sufficient testicular tissue was initially isolated for the treatment of patients by intracytoplasmic sperm injection, whereas the remainder was used to isolate cells undergoing spermatogenesis. Ethical approval was obtained from the local ethics committee (0374 and 0420). A total of six biopsies were used for isolation of cells, three of which had been frozen in sperm freezing medium (MediCult Ltd., Copenhagen, Denmark) after selection of cells for intracytoplasmic sperm injection and subsequently thawed for isolation of germ cells and patching. The extracted testicular tissue was placed in a Petri dish containingin vitro fertilization medium (Scandinavian IVF, Gothenburg, Sweden) and the seminiferous tubules teased out using needles. Following this, the tissue was then passed through a series of smaller gauge needles starting at 26 through to 18. Once the cells were sufficiently dissociated, a 50-μl droplet of the cell suspension was placed in a Petri dish along with two 50-μl droplets of clean medium. The droplets were covered with oil (OvOil, Scandinavian IVF). The Petri dish was then placed on a Nikon Microscope under 200× magnification, and individual cells were removed from the cell suspension using a Narashige micromanipulator. Micropipettes with a 10–15-μm inner diameter were used to individually select germ cells (spermatocytes and spermatids). The classification of germ cells was the same as that previously published by Johnson and colleagues (47Johnson L. Neaves W.B. Barnard J.J. Keillor G.E. Brown S.W. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Once an individual germ cell was selected, it was placed in a clean medium droplet. This procedure was repeated until sufficient germ cells were isolated. The droplet was then aspirated using a pipette, and the contents were either placed in an Eppendorf tube for RT-PCR (see above) or incubated overnight in a Petri dish for attachment to gelatin-coated slides prior to electrophysiological recording (see below). For RT-PCR, a total of 75 cells from the six biopsies were pooled before extraction of mRNA. For patch clamping, cells from five of the biopsies were used.For the second series of electrophysiological recordings, seminiferous tubules were isolated from the testes of a patient undergoing an orchidectomy (ethical authorization number DGS 2001/0211) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 3 ml of solution containing (mm): NaCl (150), KCl (5Wassarman P.M.

Spermatogenic cells were obtained by manual trituration and attached to culture dishes coated with Cell-Tak (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). The cells obtained were primarily pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids.Mouse CellsTestes were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a Petri dish containing Earle's balanced salts medium (Sigma) containing 1% (w/v) trypsin (Invitrogen) in RNase-free water. Seminiferous tubules were teased out using a sterile needle and the sample incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with intermittent shaking. The aqueous medium was then pipetted out from the Petri dish, and mineral oil (Sigma) was overlaid. Germ cell isolation, including overnight incubation for attachment, was then carried out as described above for isolation of cells from biopsies taken for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (method 1 above). For patch clamp, untrypsinized tissue was used to isolate germ cells. After isolation, cells were allowed to attach to gelatinized slides before recording (see below).RT-PCR on Germ CellsFor both human and mouse preparations, total RNA was isolated from 75–100 germ cells using the StrataPrep® Total RNA Microprep kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's protocol (48Steuerwald N. Cohen J. Herera R.J. Brenner C.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 5: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The expected yield of RNA was 50–100 ng. RNA was eluted in a total volume of 60 μl of elution buffer. 30 μl was used for reverse transcription. The RT reaction was carried out in a total volume of 60 μl in presence of 5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dNTP, 1.5 units of recombinant RNasin® (1 unit/μl), 1× RT buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25 °C), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton®X-100), 1.5 μg of random hexamers (0.5 μg/μl), and 48 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase enzyme (15 units/μl) (Promega). The reaction mix was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 60 min at 42 °C. The sample was placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min and on ice for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme. The RT mix was stored at −70 °C for further use or used immediately in PCR.PCR reaction was carried out using 5 μl of the RT mix from RNA isolated from human or mouse germ cells, 1× RT buffer, 0.64 μm primer pairs (A1G9F-A1G10R specific to α1G and HHS1-HHAS1 specific to α1H, respectively), and nuclease-free water to make up the total reaction volume to 25 μl.Touchdown PCR, similar to that described under “PCR,” was carried out in the presence of Taq DNA polymerase enzyme (Promega). Primers internal to the region amplified were used to confirm the PCR products obtained. Control PCR reactions employed (i) human or mouse β actin primers (Origene) to amplify 614 and 575 bp, respectively, and (ii) primer pairs matching the human T200 leukocyte common antigen precursor gene sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AH007396; see TableI). PCR was carried out using RT mix from germ cell RNA and testis cDNA (Invitrogen) as template. Amplification conditions were hot start at 94 °C for 3 min 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 64 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min. The PCR product obtained using cDNA as template was sequenced to confirm its identity.In Situ HybridizationA digoxigenin (DIG) labeling and detection kit (Roche; Ref. 49Meehan T. Schlatt S. De O'Bryan M.K. Kretser D.M. Loveland K.L. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used to make DNA probes with PCR-amplified products. The products used were a 395-bp product from the COOH-terminal end of α1G (PCR product no. 15; Fig. 1) and a 373-bp product from the I-II linker region of α1H (PCR product no. 5; Fig. 1). The PCR product was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector and DIG label incorporated into the cloned DNA template by PCR carried out for 25 cycles at 94 °C, 1 min 45 s; 55 °C, 1 min 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min. The annealing temperature was 59 °C for α1H. 0.4 μl of Expand High Fidelity PCR enzyme (1 unit/μl; Roche) was used in a 50-μl reaction containing 5 μl each of 10× DIG DNA labeling mix, 10× HF buffer, 1.6 pmol of primer, and 0.1 μg of plasmid DNA. DIG labeled DNA was run on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. Labeled probe, migrating at a higher molecular weight than unlabeled cDNA, was eluted from the gel using QIAquick spin gel extraction kit. In situ hybridization was carried out on adult human testis sections (Novagen; Peterborough Hospital Tissue Bank, United Kingdom). Probe mixture and hybridization conditions were as described in the Roche manual with some modifications. Sections were de-waxed (Histoclear) for 10 min, rehydrated, and digested with 0.1 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C. Sections were hybridized overnight at 42 °C and sequentially washed twice for 15 min at 20 °C with 5× SSC and once for 10 min at 42 °C with 1× SSC. Probe hybrids were localized using 1:500 dilution of alkaline phosphatase anti-DIG antibody (Fab fragments; Roche). Alkaline phosphatase activity was finally stained with freshly prepared solutions of 45 μl of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (3 mg/ml) and 35 μl of 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl phosphate (3 mg/ml) in 1 ml of detection solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.05m MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl; Ref. 50Fragale A.

The reaction was stopped with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 1 mm EDTA. Sections were mounted using DABCO (Sigma), an aqueous mounting medium and observed under bright-field illumination (Zeiss Axioskop 2). Control hybridization and localization reactions were carried out using non-DIG-labeled probe, using unconjugated DIG (blind probe), without the anti-DIG antibody and without use of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl phosphate. Positive reactions were also carried out on other tissues to confirm localization of hybridization.The distributions of α1G and α1Htranscripts within seminiferous tubules, were compared by counting stained cells. For each of the two probes, 20 tubule profiles derived from two different samples were examined. The numbers of stained spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells were counted, and the distributions of staining (spermatogenic:Sertoli) for the two transcripts were compared using a chi-square contingency table.ElectrophysiologyTwo series of electrophysiological recordings were made. For the first series, cells were isolated from human testicular biopsies taken"

Arg-14 and Arg-17, on the WW domain of Pin1, are thought to be important for the binding of Group IV ligands that have (Ser(P)/Thr(P))-Pro sequences. We have applied surface plasmon resonance to determine the ligand specificity of several WW domains containing Arg-14. Among these WW domains, Rsp5.2 and mNedd4.3 bound only to the Group I ligand containing Pro-Pro-Xaa-Tyr with K D values of 11 and 55 μm, respectively. The WW domains of hPin1,Caenorhabditis elegans Pin1 homologue (Y110), PinA, and SspI bound to Group IV ligands with K D values ranging from 22 to 700 μm. PinA and SspI do not have Arg-17, unlike Pin1 and Y110. The modeled structures of the WW domains of PinA and SspI revealed that the structure and the network of hydrogen bonds of Loop I, which are also formed in Pin1 and Y110, are conserved. We propose that this configuration of Loop I (referred to as the “p patch”) is necessary for binding Group IV ligands and that it can be used to predict the specificity and functions of other WW domains.

Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). hPin1 binds to mitotically phosphorylated proteins such as Cdc25c, Myt1, Plk1, and Cdc27 through its WW domain (7Lu K.P. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and it also binds to the phosphorylated RNA pol II1C-terminal domain (CTD), implying transcriptional regulation by Pin1 (3Sudol M. Sliwa K. Russo T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Several structures have been determined so far for WW domain-ligand complexes, three of Group I and one of Group IV. These structures reveal that WW domains each adopt a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. For each domain, the same side of the β-sheet is used to bind all of its respective ligands (2Macias M.J.

The crystal structure of the hPin1 WW domain, complexed with a phosphorylated CTD peptide of RNA polymerase II (Tyr-Ser(P)-Pro-Thr-Ser(P)-Pro-Ser), has shown the importance of two arginine residues (Arg-14 and Arg-17) on this side of the sheet in recognizing the ligand. Arg-14 of the WW domain recognizes Pro-3′ of the ligand peptide, whereas Arg-17 interacts with the phosphate group of Ser(P)-5′ (9Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus the arginine residues on the ligand-binding side may determine the ligand specificity of the Group IV WW domains. However, ligand specificity of parvulin-type PPIases other than hPin1 has not been examined so far. The question of whether the arginine residue is essential remains to be addressed because some WW domains of parvulin-type PPIases do not have Arg-17.To elucidate the roles of these arginine residues on ligand specificity in more detail, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to examine the ligand specificity of WW domains containing Arg-14. SPR is becoming a widespread method to measure quantitatively biomolecular interactions. WW domains that do not have Arg-17 (such as PinA and SspI) bound to Group IV ligands, as did WW domains that do have Arg-17 (such as Pin1 and the Caenorhabditis elegans Y110A2AL.13 gene product (Y110)). Arg-17 has been thought to be the most important residue for this binding. Thus, we have built structural models of these WW domains to elucidate the mechanism for recognition of ligand peptides with sequences of (Ser(P)/Thr(P))-Pro, and we have proposed the p patch, a new structural patch of Group IV WW domains, which interacts with their ligands. After summarizing these new findings, we have proposed the determinants by which Group IV WW domains bind to the (Ser(P)/Thr(P))-Pro ligands, and we have compared the determinants of Group IV to those of Group I as deduced from the previously determined structures. By applying these new criteria and alignment analysis, we can predict the specificity of WW domains of Group I or IV. A WW domain is a small structural motif named after a pair of tryptophan residues that are highly conserved (1Sudol M. Hunter T.

https://openalex.org/W1981180578,"PZR is an immunoglobulin superfamily cell surface protein containing a pair of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. As a glycoprotein, PZR displays a strong association with concanavalin A (ConA), a member of the plant lectin family. Treatment of several cell lines with ConA caused tyrosine phosphorylation of a major cellular protein. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that this protein corresponded to PZR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was accompanied by recruitment of SHP-2 and was inhibited by PP1, a selective inhibitor of the Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, c-Src was constitutively associated with PZR and was activated upon treatment of cells with ConA. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was markedly enhanced in v-Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells and was predominant inEscherichia coli cells co-expressing c-Src. Expression of an intracellular domain-truncated form of PZR in HT-1080 cells affected cell morphology and had a dominant negative effect on ConA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR, activation of c-Src, and agglutination of the cells. Together, the data indicate that PZR is a major receptor of ConA and has an important role in cell signaling via c-Src. Considering the various biological activities of ConA, the study of PZR may have major therapeutic implications.

This was demonstrated by the use of plant lectins that cross-link cell surface glycoproteins thereby initiating various cellular responses (1Sharon N. Lis H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2Elgavish S. Shaanan B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Concanavalin A (ConA)1 is the most extensively investigated member of the lectin family of plant proteins (3Lin S.S. Levitan I.B. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 273-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Bowles D.J. Pappin D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 60-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It displays high affinities for terminal α-d-mannosyl and α-d-glucosyl residues (5Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Yahara I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). At physiological pH, ConA exists as a tetramer and displays cell-agglutinating and mitogenic activities (6Reeke G.N. Becker J.W. Cunningham B.A. Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Edelman G.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 234: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Kalb A.J. Lustig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 168: 366-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, ConA has differential toxicity on normal and transformed cells in vitro and inhibits tumor development in vivo (8Bittiges H. Schnebli H.P. Concanavalin A as a Tool. J. Wiley & Sons, London1976Google Scholar, 9Burger M.M. Noonan K.D. Nature. 1970; 228: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Other activities of ConA include inhibition of the endocytosis of adrenergic receptors (10Wang H.Y. Berrios M. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Tang H. Nishishita T. Fitzgerald T. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13420-13426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and induction of apoptosis (12Cribbs D.H. Kreng V.M. Anderson A.J. Cotman C.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite these major biological activities, the potential uses of ConA and other plant lectins as therapeutic drugs are tempered by their lack of specificity. In addition, the precise mechanism by which these lectins function to regulate adhesion and proliferation is not clear. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (13Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar, 14Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). It is the initial step in cell signaling induced by extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, antigens, and extracellular matrix. Tyrosine phosphorylation alters enzymatic activity and/or provides binding sites for downstream signaling molecules containing SH2 domains and PTB domains (15Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Because these domains bind with specific tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs, tyrosine kinase signaling pathways gain specificity from the intrinsic binding preferences of these domains for short sequences that flank phosphotyrosine. Recently, we have isolated a cell surface glycoprotein designated PZR. PZR is a widely expressed member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Its extracellular segment has significant sequence homology to myelin P0, a major structural protein of the myelin sheath. Its intracellular portion has two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) that specifically interact with SHP-2 (17Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), an SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase with a crucial role in cell signaling (18Feng G.S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR is observed upon treatment of cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate and in cells overexpressing the catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 but not in cells treated with growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although PZR is a potential receptor, its ligand is not known. Because PZR is a heavily glycosylated protein and it binds tightly with wheat germ agglutininin vitro (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we thought that a lectin family protein might serve as a ligand of PZR. In the present study, we demonstrate that PZR is a major mediator of cell signaling induced by ConA. HT-1080, HeLa, human embryonic kidney 293, NIH-3T3, and v-Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin. Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-SHP-2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Transduction Laboratory, respectively. The former was used for immunoprecipitation while the latter was employed for Western blotting. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 and anti-v-Src were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., and Oncogene Sciences, respectively. Tunicamycin, concanavalin A (ConA), succinyl-ConA, and ConA-agarose were from Sigma Chemical Co., whereas the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 was from Calbiochem. Polyclonal anti-PZR serum 105 was raised in a rabbit against a GST fusion protein containing the intracellular domain of PZR (amino acids 191–269) as described previously (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To enhance its specificity, the anti-serum was passed through a glutathione S-transferase-agarose column. Unless otherwise noted, the treated anti-serum was used. Full-length PZR cDNA in sense and in antisense directions and an intracellular domain-truncated form (PZRX) corresponding to amino acids 1–199 of the PZR molecule were subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The DNA constructs were used to transfect the human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell line by using the FuGENE6 cell transfection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Clonal cell lines were isolated by G418 selection. Stable cell lines were maintained in complete culture medium supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml G418. Expression of both the full-length and the truncated form of PZR were analyzed by using anti-PZR serum 105. HT-1080, 293, and HeLa cells were cultured to 80–90% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were starved with 0% serum for 4 h before stimulation with ConA. The stimulation reactions were stopped by washing cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in buffer A containing 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 μm microcystin, 1.0 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were incubated overnight with various antibodies pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times with an immunoprecipitation washing buffer containing 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mmNa3VO4. For Western blot analyses, samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies and were detected by using the ECL system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). HT-1080 cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-v-Src antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed with the aforementioned immunoprecipitation washing buffer and then with a Src kinase assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase assay system contained 50 μl of the assay buffer plus 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) and 0.2 mg/ml rabbit skeletal muscle enolase or glutathione S-transferase fusion protein carrying the intracellular portion of PZR. The reactions were run at room temperature for 20 min and stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylated products were detected by autoradiography after separation on 10% SDS gels. The intracellular domain of PZR (amino acid residues 192–269) and the correspondent Tyr-to-Phe mutant form PZR(Y241F/Y263F) were constructed as GST fusion proteins by using the pGex-2T vector, which contains an ampicillin-resistant gene. The fusion proteins were expressed in DE3(LysS) Escherichia coli cells co-expressing c-Src carried by a pET9a vector, which is kanamycin-resistant. Upon treatment with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3.5 h, the cells were harvested and extracted in PBS by sonication. The extracts were subjected to separation on SDS gels and further to Western blot analyses. For purification of the fusion proteins, cell extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing with PBS, the beads were incubated with HT-1080 extracts for 2 h and were then washed as described for immunoprecipitation described above. Proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies. The PZR cDNA encodes a type I transmembrane protein of 269 amino acid residues. However, the PZR protein is highly heterogeneous on SDS gel with molecular sizes larger than the calculated value. For example, PZR from HeLa cells ran at 30–70 kDa whereas that from HT-1080 cells and 293 cells displayed proteins bands of 31–50 kDa (Fig.1 A). It is not known if this heterogeneity in the size of PZR is related to any specific type of cell transformation. Nonetheless, it is caused by different degrees of glycosylation, because treatment of cells with tunicamycin resulted in a sharp PZR band of ∼30 kDa, which agrees with the molecular size predicted from its primary structure (Fig. 1 A). Tunicamycin inhibited N-linked glycosylation, and thus the data suggest that N-linked glycosylation is responsible for the heterogeneous size of PZR. In fact, PZR contains two putativeN-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular region and in vitro deglycosylation by N-glycosidase F also resulted in a sharp band of ∼30 kDa (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As a glycosylated protein, PZR is a potential receptor of the lectin family proteins. Our earlier studies have showed that PZR binds wheat germ agglutinin (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To further study the interaction of PZR with the lectin family proteins and its biological functions, we employed ConA, the most extensively studied lectin family of plant proteins. As shown in Fig.1 B, when HT-1080 cell extracts were passed through a ConA-agarose column in the presence of 0.3 m NaCl, PZR was totally depleted from cell extracts. Consequently, all the bound PZR was recovered by eluting the column with 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine. ConA exists in tetrameric and higher oligomeric forms under physiological pH. Because of its ability to cross-link cell surface glycoproteins, ConA exhibits multiple biological activities, but the signal transduction mechanisms are not well understood. Initially, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins upon treatment of HT-1080 cells with ConA. When serum-starved HT-1080 cells were treated with 100 μg/ml ConA, clear tyrosine phosphorylation of a major protein around 43 kDa was observed after 20 min (Fig.2 A). The same phosphorylated band was seen in cells treated with 12 μg/ml ConA for 1 h. The protein co-migrated with PZR, and immunoprecipitation of the cell extracts with anti-PZR antibody caused total depletion of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from the cell extracts, indicating the protein corresponds to PZR (the far right lane in Fig.2 A). Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of the PZR immunoprecipitates further verified these results (Fig. 2 B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR appeared after 5 min of ConA treatment and reached a plateau after 40 min. It should be pointed out that immunodepletion and immunoprecipitation experiments with preimmune PZR serum and a irrelevant rabbit polyclonal anti-LAIR-1 antibody demonstrated that the detection of PZR was highly specific (data not shown but provided for scrutiny by reviewers). Our earlier studies have shown that PZR is a major anchor protein of SHP-2 on the cell membrane (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As expected, ConA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was accompanied by recruitment of SHP-2. The level of SHP-2 binding is directly proportional the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR. This is reminiscent of growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of receptors and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. However, it should be noted that no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 was observed. To demonstrate that induction of PZR tyrosine phosphorylation is a general phenomenon in ConA-treated cells, we studied several other cell lines. Fig.3 shows the results obtained with 293 and HeLa cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was verified by immunodepletion and immunoprecipitation. The time course and the dose response of the phosphorylation in these cells were similar to those observed in HT-1080 cells. Immunoprecipitation of SHP-2 also caused total depletion of tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR from 293 cell extracts, indicating that all the tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR was associated with SHP-2 in ConA-treated cells. Note that PZR from HeLa cells showed as heterogeneous bands of 30–70 kDa on SDS gel. This is due to a different degree of glycosylation. 2R. Zhao, A. Guerrah, H. Tang, and Z. J. Zhao, unpublished data. We also observed similar tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR in HepG2 and A431 cells (not shown), suggesting that ConA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR is a general phenomenon.Figure 3PZR is a major protein that is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon treatment of 293 and HeLa cells with ConA. HeLa and 293 were serum-starved for 2 h and then treated with a fixed dose (100 μg/ml, indicated by “+” in theupper panel) or variable doses (0–200 μg/ml, lower panel) of ConA for 60 min (upper panel) or 0–90 min as indicated (lower panel). Cell extracts and immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-PZR or anti-SHP-2 as indicated were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Note that the SDS gel electrophoresis in the lower panel was performed under non-reducing conditions so that IgG runs an intact molecule of over 150 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ConA exists as a tetramer, between pH 5.8 and pH 7.0. It forms higher aggregates above pH 7.0. Much of the biological activity (e.g. agglutinating and mitogenic activity) of ConA depends on its degree of aggregation. Succinylation results in a dimeric form that remains as a dimer above pH 5.6 (3Lin S.S. Levitan I.B. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 273-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Succinyl ConA still binds ConA receptors but is ineffective at cross-linking them and therefore fails to exhibit any biological activity of ConA. We thus compared the effects of ConA and succinyl ConA on tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and its association with SHP-2 (Fig. 4). Unlike ConA, which caused clear tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and recruitment of SHP-2 at a concentration of 12 μg/ml (Fig. 4,A and B), succinyl ConA failed to induce either of these at a concentration as high as 200 μg/ml (Fig. 4,C and E). For simplicity, Fig. 4 Cshows results of immunoblotting with anti-PY and anti-SHP-2 together. Separated immunoblotting of anti-PZR immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-SHP-2 gave rise to the same negative results. Fig. 4 C represents a relatively overexposed Western blot, and thus the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and its association with SHP-2 became evident. Fig. 4 D shows equal immunoprecipitation of PZR by anti-PZR antibody. Because ConA is tetravalent, i.e. it has four sugar binding sites, the data seem to suggest that tetramerization of PZR or clustering with other proteins is required for the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it should be noted that the proper position of each receptor subunit in a dimer is also crucial for induction of signaling. It is possible that bivalent succinyl-ConA also binds cell surface PZR, but spatial restraints render it unable to cross-link two PZR molecules, or that PZR dimers formed by bivalent ConA are not in the right conformation to cause tyrosine phosphorylation. In any case, ConA is a useful tool for studying PZR. Src family protein-tyrosine kinases play a crucial role in cell adhesion. To investigate possible involvement of these kinases in phosphorylation of PZR, we pre-treated HT-1080 cells with the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1. PP1 at a concentration of 5 μmtotally inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and its association with SHP-2 (Fig. 5). Note the tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and the association with SHP-2 at the basal level. Although PP1 is not a very specific Src family kinase inhibitor, the results at least suggest that a Src family tyrosine kinase may be responsible for phosphorylation of PZR. The association of PZR with c-Src further supports this notion. As shown in Fig.6 A, c-Src was detected in the immunoprecipitates of PZR in non-treated as well as ConA-treated cells. Compared with the level of c-Src present in anti-c-Src immunoprecipitates, c-Src co-immunoprecipitated with PZR represented a small but evident portion of total c-Src in cell extracts. Note that control experiments with preimmune anti-PZR serum demonstrated the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. Because anti-PZR and anti-c-Src antibodies used in this study were able to deplete PZR and c-Src, respectively, from cell extracts, we estimated that about 2–4% of c-Src was constitutively associated with PZR. We further analyzed the activity of c-Src by using the commonly used rabbit muscle enolase as a substrate. The data shown in Fig. 6 B demonstrated that treatment of cells with ConA resulted in increased c-Src activity. Quantification of the radioactive bands by scintillation counter revealed about 3-fold increase of Src kinase activity over the basal level. Similar activation of c-Src was observed when a GST fusion containing the intracellular part of PZR was used as a substrate. Taken together, the data indicate that c-Src may be at least partly responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR induced by ConA.Figure 6c-Src is constitutively associated with PZR and is activated upon treatment of cells with ConA. Serum-starved HT-1080 cells were non-treated or treated with 100 μg/ml ConA for 1 h. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-PZR serum, anti-PZR pre-immune serum, and anti-c-Src antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analyses with anti-c-Src and anti-PZR (upper panel) or to Src kinase assays with enolase and GST-PZR fusion protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (lower panel). The reaction products of the kinase assays were detected by autoradiography. Note that the SDS gel separation were performed under non-reduced condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further verify the involvement of Src family kinases in phosphorylation of PZR, we analyzed the phosphorylation of PZR in v-Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells with normal NIH-3T3 cells as control. As shown in Fig.7 A, a very strong tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was observed in the v-Src-transformed cells. Note that a much lower basal level of PZR phosphorylation was seen in the non-transformed control cells and that phosphorylation of PZR was accompanied by binding of SHP-2. Immunoblotting analyses with anti-PZR antibody revealed that control and v-Src-transformed cells expressed comparable amounts of PZR. Oncogenic v-Src is a deregulated, constitutively active form of c-Src. These data thus provide further evidence that Src family tyrosine kinase is at least partly responsible for in tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR in vivo. We further investigated the phosphorylation of PZR in E. coli cells expressing c-Src. The intracellular domain of PZR, which contains the ITIMs, was expressed as a GST fusion protein by using the pGex-2T vector. For a control experiment, we also expressed the correspondent Tyr-to-Phe mutant form PZR(Y241F/Y263F). c-Src was introduced intoE. coli cells by a pET9a vector. The data are shown in Fig.7 B. Although the PZR fusion protein was not a major protein in the cell extracts as revealed by Coomassie Blue staining, it represented by far the predominant tyrosine-phosphorylated protein bands. As expected, the Tyr-to-Phe mutant PZR(Y241F/Y263F) was not phosphorylated at all, providing further evidence that tyrosine residues 241 and 263 embedded in the ITIMs are responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR. This agrees with our previous results obtained with pervanadate-treated cells (17Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PZR fusion proteins displayed several bands as detected by anti-GST antibodies. This is probably caused by protein degradation and/or early termination in translation. Note that only the two higher bands corresponding to the molecular size of intact GST-PZR fusion proteins were phosphorylated and that the phosphorylation appeared to cause gel mobility shift. Finally, tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR fusion protein was able to recruit SHP-2 from HT-1080 cell extracts. This study not only verifies the phosphorylation of PZR by c-Src on the tyrosyl residues embedded in ITIMs but also provides a way to produce large amounts of phosphorylated PZR protein for further functional and structural analyses. It has been well accepted that growth factors and cytokines cause tyrosine phosphorylation of their receptors by inducing dimerization or clustering of the extracellular domains and consequent activation of the intracellular kinase domains or intracellular domain-associated kinases (20Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 49-71PubMed Google Scholar). We thought that tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR induced by ConA may also follow the same mechanism. To verify this, we expressed an intracellular domain-truncated form of PZR in HT-1080 cells in to determine whether it has a dominant negative role. For comparison, we also transfected cells with constructs carrying the full-length PZR cDNA in sense and in antisense orientations. The expression vector used was the pCDNA3 plasmid, which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter and a neomycin resistance gene. Clonal cell lines were isolated by G418 selection. Expression levels of PZR in these stable cell lines are represented in Fig.8. All of the clones transfected with the full-length form of PZR in sense orientation displayed substantial overexpression of PZR as compared with the wild type cells. Sequential dilutions of cell extracts followed by Western blotting analyses revealed a 3-to 6-fold increase in the protein level of PZR. The clones transfected with the antisense PZR cDNA had a PZR expression essentially equal to the parental cells, and these cells served as a control cell line for our further studies. The expression of the intracellular domain-truncated form of PZR in the stable cell lines is demonstrated by the presence of a protein band just below the full-length form of PZR. We then treated the three cell lines with ConA as described earlier. As revealed by the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of cell extracts shown in Fig.9 A, tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR was clearly enhanced in cells overexpressing the full-length form of PZR in comparison with the control cells. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR in cells expressing the truncated form of PZR was diminished. This was further verified by Western blotting analysis of anti-PZR immunoprecipitates (Fig. 9 B). Although a much higher level of PZR tyrosine phosphorylation was observed with cells overexpressing sense PZR, almost no phosphorylation was detected for cells expressing the truncated form of PZR. As a consequence of loss of tyrosine phosphorylation, binding of SHP-2 was also abolished in cells expressing the truncated form of PZR. It should be pointed out that cells expressing the truncated form of PZR also expressed the endogenous full-length form of PZR, which can be immunoprecipitated by anti-PZR antibody (Fig. 9 B, right panel). The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR in the sense PZR-expressing cells is attributable to a higher PZR expression, but the loss of PZR phosphorylation in PZRX-expressing cells was not caused by a decrease in PZR protein level in comparison with the antisense control cells. The blocking of tyrosine phosphorylation by expression of the truncated form indicates that the latter form has a dominant negative role. This also provides direct evidence that activation of PZR requires clustering of PZR molecules with the functional intracellular part. This is reminiscent of the dominant negative effects observed with the kinase mutant of growth factor receptors (20Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 49-71PubMed Google Scholar). We also analyzed the activation of c-Src in these stable cell lines (Fig. 9 B,bottom panels). As expected, expression of the truncated form of PZR also abolished ConA-induced activation of c-Src. Together, the data imply that ConA causes cross-linking of cell surface PZR and thereby results in activation of c-Src which in turn phosphorylates PZR. Of course, we cannot rule out involvement of other cell surface glycoproteins and other tyrosine kinases.Figure 9Overexpression of an intracellular domain-truncated PZR blocks ConA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and activation of c-Src. HT-1080 cells transfected with sense PZR, antisense PZR, or intracellular domain-truncated PZRX were serum-starved for 2 h and then left untreated or treated with 100 μg/ml ConA for 20–60 min (upper panel) or for 60 min (lower panel). Cell extracts (upper panel) and anti-PZR and anti-c-Src immunoprecipitates (lower panel) were subjected to Western blotting analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-SHP-2, and anti-c-Src or to Src kinase activity assays followed by autoradiography. Representative data of four independent experiments with eight different stable cell lines are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By clustering cell surface glycoproteins, one of the major activities of ConA is to cause agglutination of cells. To examine whether PZR plays a role in this process, we treated the stable HT-1080 cell lines with ConA and investigated cell morphology changes (Fig.10). Cells overexpressing the full-length form of PZR showed much enhanced agglutination in comparison with the antisense control cells. In contrast, expression of the truncated form totally blocked the process. Because agglutination of the adherent cells involves cell detachment and migration, the data suggest an important role of PZR in these processes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR is presumably essential for the detachment and migration. However, treatment of cells with Src kinase inhibitor PP1 totally blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR but only slightly slowed down the agglutination process (data not shown). This is probably due to the fact that PP1 itself causes detachment of the cells from the culture plates and suspended cells are more easily to be agglutinated by ConA. Finally, it should be noted that overexpression of PZRX per se had significant effects on the morphologies of HT-108 cells (Fig. 10, upper panel). The PZRX-expressing cells appeared more transformed as indicated by their spindle-like structures. In contrast, PZR-overexpressing cells and antisense control cells displayed flattened cells morphology. The spindle shape of the PZRX cells suggests possible loss of cell contact inhibition. Further study is underway to investigate the effects of PZR on cell tumorigenicity. In the present study, we demonstrated that PZR is a major protein that is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon treatment of cells with ConA. Furthermore, ConA causes phosphorylation of PZR by cross-linking cell surface PZR molecules, which is similar to the manner by which growth factors or cytokines activate their receptors. The most compelling evidence for this comes from the fact that an intracellular domain-truncated form of PZR has a dominant role in blocking ConA-induced PZR activation. Therefore, it is fair to say that PZR is a major receptor of ConA. Although ConA may also bind other cell surface glycoproteins and induce their activation, PZR is by far the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in at least three cell lines examined in this study. This is probably due to the fact that PZR is a relatively abundant cell surface molecule. In fact, our earlier studies indicate that depletion of PZR causes depletion of nearly 50% of SHP-2 in cell extracts (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As a major receptor of ConA, PZR must be an important transducer of ConA-induced cell signaling. Indeed, our studies indicated that cross-linking of PZR by ConA lead to activation of c-Src, which may be responsible for phosphorylation of PZR and possibly other proteins. Phosphorylation of PZR in turn recruits SHP-2, which by itself is an essential signal transducer. Further downstream signaling events still need to be investigated. ConA has multiple biological activities dependent on cell types. Importantly, it displays differential toxicity toward normal and tumor cells (8Bittiges H. Schnebli H.P. Concanavalin A as a Tool. J. Wiley & Sons, London1976Google Scholar, 9Burger M.M. Noonan K.D. Nature. 1970; 228: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, the potential uses of ConA as therapeutic drugs are tempered by its nonspecificities and by the lack of understanding of its functional mechanisms. Here we demonstrated that PZR is a major receptor of ConA thereby providing a specific target for further investigation. In this study, we focused on ConA, the most extensive studied lectin protein. We believe other lectin proteins may also use PZR as a receptor. Our earlier studies have shown that PZR also binds wheat germ agglutinin (16Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Different lectins have different binding affinities and selectivity to carbohydrates, and thus the biological effects may differ. In addition, although lectin family proteins were originally identified in plants, mammalian cells also contain a large numbers of proteins with lectin domains (21Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 22Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 23Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Rini J.M. Lobsanov Y.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whether any of these proteins specifically interact with PZR is not known. PZR is a highly heterogeneous protein due to different degrees of glycosylation, and PZR proteins from different human cells displayed distinct mobilities on SDS gels. For example, PZR in HeLa cells runs as a much broader band than that found in 293 and HT-1080 cells (see Fig. 3). This indicates that transformed cell lines may have different modification of PZR. It is not known whether normal cells differ from transformed cells in the glycosylation of PZR. If so, PZR might be an excellent target for therapeutic drug development to treat cancer. Finally, because ConA induces activation of PZR by cross-linking the protein on the cell surface, the action of ConA can be mimicked specifically by anti-PZR antibodies that recognize the extracellular segment of PZR. In an earlier study, we have shown that a specific antibody can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1, an ITIM-containing receptor expressed in hematopoietic cells (25Xu M. Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17440-17446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, PZR antibodies may have potential for therapeutic applications. PZR belongs to ITIM-bearing cell surface receptors. ITIMs were defined as inhibitory motifs, because they were initially found in inhibitory immunoreceptors like FcγRIIB and KIR and they mediate the inhibitory effects of these proteins on signal transduction (26Long E.O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 875-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 27Ravetch J.V. Lanier L.L. Science. 2000; 290: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because phosphorylation of the tyrosyl residue in the ITIMs triggers binding and activation of tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and the inositol phosphatase SHIP, the inhibitory functions of ITIMs are thought to be executed by these phosphatases. SHP-2 is a widely distributed intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing SH2 domains. Studies have shown that SHP-2 plays a crucial role in cell signaling, because expression of its catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser mutant form blocks growth factor-induced activation of mitogen-activate protein kinase (18Feng G.S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 28Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 183: 182-188Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the mouseshp-2 gene caused death of mouse embryos at mid-gestation (29Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Further studies with cells derived from SHP-2-deficient mice demonstrated impairment in erythropoiesis and cell migration (30Qu C.K. Shi Z.Q. Shen R. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which SHP-2 functions is still poorly understood, and we think that PZR may be involved in this function. Purified SHP-2 possesses low activity in vitro due to internal structural suppression (32Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Therefore, SHP-2 can be viewed as an inactive enzyme in the resting state of cells, which is activated by binding through SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors on cell membrane. As a major anchor protein of SHP-2, PZR may primarily serve as an activator SHP-2, although it can also serve as a substrate (17Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As a phosphatase, the main function of SHP-2 is certainly dephosphorylation, and this can have positive or negative effects on signaling processes. The net effect of SHP-2 in a cell signaling process is dependent on the targets it dephosphorylates. By studying the PZR-controlled activation of SHP-2 and the cell signaling events that are initiated, we should gain further insight into the function of SHP-2."

For example, evidence exists that certain activator proteins can simply be masked or sequestered by protein binding partners that do not interact with DNA directly, as in the case of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein-mediated repression of the E2F family oftrans-activators (3Ross J.F. Liu X. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a repressor protein may bind and displace components of the basal transcription machinery as in the case of Drosophila even-skipped-mediated repression of the Adh proximal promoter (4Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3771-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that some repressors can participate, indirectly, in modifying chromatin structure by binding activator sites and recruiting specific histone deacetylases to silence genes through histone modification. This scenario is implicated in repression of E-box motifs through Mad/Max-mediated recruitment of histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (2Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Still other models of repression propose that activator protein access to a DNA target sequence can be blocked by repressor protein binding to either the same site or an overlapping site. Such a mechanism appears to be operative in the competitive DNA binding of YY1 and serum response factor (SRF)1 to serum response elements (SREs) of the c-fos promoter (5Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An interesting variation on the theme of multiple proteins competing for overlapping binding sites arises from our attempts to elucidate the mechanism of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) α-actin promoter regulation in fibroblasts where plasticity of actin expression is necessary to accommodate switching to a contractile myofibroblast phenotype (6Serini G. Gabbiani G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 7Powell D.W. Mifflin R.C. Valentich J.D. Crowe S.E. Saada J.I. West A.B. Am. J.

In early studies, deletion mapping of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse VSM α-actin gene revealed several positive and negativecis-regulatory elements important for cell type-specific expression of promoter activity in skeletal myoblast-like cellsversus embryonic fibroblasts (9Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). While the region between −191 and −150 functioned as a positive transcriptional control element in transfected myogenic and fibroblastic cell lines, inclusion of the sequence spanning −224 to −191 restricted expression of the promoter to fully differentiated BC3H1 myogenic cells (9Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the full −224 to −191 sequence was required to function as a negative regulatory element in undifferentiated myoblasts, retention of a relatively small GGGA motif located on the 3′ end (−195 to −192) was sufficient to confer complete repression in fibroblasts. This implied that the sequence spanning −195 to −150 contained closely aligned cis-elements responsible for both activation and repression of promoter activity in fibroblasts. In a later study, mutational analysis of several non-canonical SREs of the general form, CC(A/T)6GG, located 3′ of the −191 to −150 positive control element revealed that a CArG box spanning −120 to −111 was essential for serum growth factor induction of a deletionally activated reporter in fibroblasts and for DNA binding by in vitrosynthesized SRF (10Stoflet E.S.

Similarly, mutation of an inverted muscle CAT (MCAT)-like motif (GGAATG) residing between −181 to −176 was also found to eliminate transcriptional activity of the same truncated reporter and to impair DNA binding by a fibroblast-derived factor provisionally identified as transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) (11Cogan J.G.

Collectively, these data suggested that functional cooperation between CArG-bound SRF and a MCAT-interacting factor related to TEF-1 was necessary for activation of the VSM α-actin promoter in fibroblasts once the MCAT enhancer was released from repression by proximate negative-acting factors. Biochemical support for the existence of MCAT-suppressing factors came about when it was fortuitously noted that nucleotides spanning −195 to −165, which include the MCAT element, demonstrated a high degree of polypurine-polypyrimidine (Pu/Py) asymmetry (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell.

Computer modeling of the sequence spanning −224 to −162 also indicated that this region possessed the theoretical potential to form a non-B-DNA cruciform structure with placement of the MCAT motif in a partially unpaired configuration. 2J. G. Cogan and A. R. Strauch, unpublished data.2J. G. Cogan and A. R. Strauch, unpublished data. These observations prompted an assessment of the region encompassing the MCAT site as a target for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteinsin vitro. Several sequence-specific vascular actin ssDNA-binding factors (VACssBFs) were identified in cell and tissue extracts that selectively bound to opposing strands of the Pu/Py element in manner that was consistent with suppression of MCAT enhancer activity (11Cogan J.G.

Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results led to the formulation of a hypothetical model whereby interaction of VACssBFs with opposing strands of the Pu/Py element was proposed to mediate transcriptional repression of the VSM α-actin promoter in fibroblasts (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, disruption or stabilization of MCAT enhancer base pairing by VACssBFs was envisioned to exclude binding of a TEF-1-like activator to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (14Strauch A.R.

Screening a mouse lung expression library with VACssBF target sequences subsequently resulted in the cloning of cDNAs encoding these putative repressor proteins and identification of VACssBF2 as Purα and Purβ (15Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and VACssBF1 as MSY1 (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G.

Purα and Purβ are highly homologous proteins that interact with the purine-rich strand of the Pu/Py element as homo- or heterodimers (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). They represent a newly delineated family of proteins whose founding member, Purα, appears to play a role in both cell growth and differentiation by modulating cell cycle progression as well as the replication and transcription of certain viral and cellular genes via interaction with specific single-stranded purine-rich elements of the general form, (GGN)n (17Gallia G.L. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MSY1 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved Y-box family of nucleic acid-binding proteins implicated in transcriptional and translational regulation (18Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). MSY1 binds to the pyrimidine-rich stand of the VSM α-actin Pu/Py element and can be detected in association with both Purα and Purβ in fibroblast cell extracts (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Precedence exists for the human Y-box protein, YB-1, and human Purα to both physically and functionally associate to enhance the transcriptional activity of the JC virus promoter in glial cells (19Safak M. Gallia G.L. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that mouse Purα and Purβ together with MSY1 cooperate to repress transcriptional activity of the VSM α-actin promoter in fibroblasts. Owing to the high degree of sequence conservation between rodent and human Pur proteins (17Gallia G.L. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Y-box proteins (16Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that such functional differences are due to a species-specific phenomenon. Rather, promoter context and cellular environment are likely to be critical factors in determining the functional activity of Pur and Y-box proteins both individually and collectively (20Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This contention is supported by this study in which a variety of experimental approaches are used to biochemically define the scope of protein-ssDNA, protein-dsDNA, and protein-protein interactions that may contribute to modulating the activity of a cryptic VSM α-actin MCAT enhancer element in rodent fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs containing the minimal mouse VSM α-actin promoter (VSMP7, −59/+46) or the minimal promoter plus additional 5′ flanking sequence (VSMP1, −1063/+46; VSMP2, −724/+46; VSMP3, −224/+46; VSMP4, −191/+46; VSMP5, −150/+46; VSMP6, −90/+46) were described previously (10Stoflet E.S.

A SalI/BamHI (restriction sites underlined) fragment was generated by PCR amplification using Δ195 as a template with a 5′ primer (mutated bases in lowercase letters) (5′-TGCAGGTCGACGttAGacGAACAGcGGAATGCAGTttcctctACCCGGCCTC-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-AGATCTGGATCCTGACAGCGACTG-3′). The mutant promoter fragment was gel purified, cut with restriction enzymes, subcloned into pBLCAT3, and sequenced. All reporter plasmids used for transfection were purified by double cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Unlabeled and 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer. The double-stranded form of the mouse VSM α-actin Pu/Py promoter element (dsPE) containing a core MCAT motif (underlined) was generated by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the forward (PE-F) and reverse (PE-R) strands of the sequence spanning −194 to −165 relative to the transcription start site (5′-ggagCAGAACAGAGGAATGCAGTGGAagag-3′). Mouse VSM α-actin CArG box (underlined) containing dsDNA probes were similarly generated by annealing complementary strands of sequences located −80 to −51 nucleotides (CArG1, 5′-cgtcTTTGCTCCTTGTTTGGGAGGCGagtg-3′) and −130 to −101 nucleotides (CArG2, 5′-gtgcTGAGGTCCCTATATGGTTGTGTtaga-3′) upstream of the transcription start site. To assist in 32P labeling, all dsDNA probes used for band shift assays were engineered with 4 base overhangs (lowercase letters) on each end to allow for filling-in by Klenow fragment. Blunt-ended biotinylated dsDNA probes used for pull-down of nucleic acid-binding proteins from cell extracts (see below) were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides in which only one strand was biotinylated on the 3′ end. Rat A7r5 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and transiently transfected using GenePORTERTM reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Gene Therapy Systems). Mouse embryo-derived AKR-2B cells were cultured and transiently transfected as described previously (10Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol.

In experiments designed to compare the activity of various VSM α-actin promoter constructs in asynchronous cultures, 4 × 105 AKR-2B cells and 2 × 105 A7r5 cells were transfected with 4.8 μg of VSM α-actin promoter:CAT reporter and 0.2 μg of pCMVβ (CLONTECH, control β-galactosidase reporter) and harvested after 48 h incubation in complete growth medium. In experiments designed to compare the activity of selected VSM α-actin promoter constructs in synchronized cells, 5 × 105AKR-2Bs or 2 × 105 A7r5s were transfected, serum-starved, and restimulated as previously described (10Stoflet E.S.

To harvest cell lysates, transfectants were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 ml of 1 × hypotonic CAT lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was applied for 30 min. Whole cell lysate was collected after centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C and total protein content was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. CAT and β-galactosidase reporter proteins were measured using colorimetric enzyme immunoassay kits as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). β-Galactosidase served as reference to monitor transfection efficiency between replicate transfectants. Peptides corresponding to the first 15 amino acids of mouse TEF-1 (IEPSSWSGSESPAEN), TEF-3 (ITSNEWSSPDSPEGS), TEF-4 (MGDPRTGAPLDDGGG), and TEF-5 (IASNSWNASSSPGEA) were synthesized, purified, and coupled to carrier protein as previously described (16Kelm Jr., R.J.

After a 30-min incubation period at room temperature, streptavidin-coated paramagnetic particles (400 μl equivalent, Promega) that had been washed and resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl were added to the protein/DNA solution. Following an additional 30-min incubation period, particles were captured with a magnet and washed three times with either 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl for ssDNA probes or 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl for dsDNA probes. In both cases, DNA-bound proteins were eluted by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (31 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue) and heating at 65 °C for 10 min. Eluates were supplemented with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% mini-gel and transferred to ImmobilonTM-P membrane (Millipore) for analysis by Western (immuno)blotting as previously described (16Kelm Jr., R.J.

All expression vectors cited in this study utilize the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-enhancer to drive expression and were sequenced to ensure fidelity of the cDNA insert. Whole cell protein (100 μg) extracted from AKR-2B fibroblasts expressing His or Myc epitope-tagged proteins (His-Purα, His-Purβ, Myc-MSY1, or Myc-TEF-1), was combined with selected rabbit or mouse IgGs (2.5 μg) in 250 μl of binding buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, ∼1.2 × 107 sheep anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse) IgG-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal Inc.) that had been washed and suspended in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl were transferred to the binding reactions. Solutions were mixed gently for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then captured with a magnet, washed three times, and eluted with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. Eluates were supplemented with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min in preparation for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with either mouse anti-RGS(H)4at 250 ng/ml or mouse anti-c-Myc at 40 ng/ml. To quantitatively compare the contribution of several consensus cis-regulatory elements to transcriptional activity of the minimal mouse VSM α-actin promoter in fibroblasts and SMCs, a variety of CAT reporter constructs containing deletion or point mutations of the 5′-flanking region (Fig.1 A) were transiently transfected into mouse AKR-2B or rat A7r5 cells. Unlike previous studies (9Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stoflet E.S.

In AKR-2B fibroblasts, ∼1 kb of 5′-flanking region failed to substantially enhance the transcriptional activity of the minimal promoter, defined empirically as TATA box-containing sequence spanning −59 to +46 relative to the start site of transcription (Fig. 1 B, compareVSMP1 to VSMP7). However, deletion of nucleotide sequence between −1063 and −192 generated a reporter (−191 to +46:CAT or VSMP4) that produced ∼10-fold more CAT protein than the minimal, TATA-driven promoter in fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B, compare VSMP4 to VSMP7). Deletion or point mutation of a conserved MCAT motif spanning −181 to −176 was sufficient to reduce the activity of VSMP4 to basal levels (Fig.1 B, compare VSMP5 andP4/TV177 to VSMP4 andVSMP7). Similarly, mutation of the second of two CArG elements located upstream of the TATA box (CArG2) also decreased VSMP4 activity by ∼5-fold (Fig. 1 B, compareP4/Stu2 to VSMP4). Alteration of the CArG element closest to the TATA box (CArG1) lowered activity by only ∼2-fold (Fig. 1 B, compare P4/Stu1 toVSMP4) suggesting that CArG2 is the more critical of the two CArG sites in terms of co-regulating promoter activation in concert with the MCAT element in VSMP4. Importantly, the enhanced transcriptional activity of VSMP4 was also eliminated by the addition of just 4 bp (GGGA) of 5′ VSM α-actin flanking sequence (Fig.1 B, compare Δ195 to VSMP4). These data confirmed that the MCAT element, while capable of conferring robust enhancer activity in cooperation with CArG2 in the deletionally activated VSMP4 reporter, is normally cryptic in the context of longer promoter constructs (e.g. Δ195, VSMP3, VSMP2, and VSMP1). Furthermore, although additional negative regulatory elements may reside between −196 −224 (Fig. 1 B, compareVSMP3 and Δ195), −195 to −192 constitutes the minimal extra sequence required to inactivate the MCAT enhancer and to reinstate basal promoter activity in AKR-2B fibroblasts (compare Δ195 to VSMP7). To test whether the cryptic behavior of the MCAT enhancer was unique to AKR-2B fibroblasts, the same set of reporters were also evaluated for transcriptional activity in A7r5 cells, a rat aortic SMC line that exhibits a differentiated adult SMC phenotype (24Firulli A.B. Han D. Kelly-Roloff L. Koteliansky V.E. Schwartz S.M. Olson E.N. Miano J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 34: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 C, although the total activity of each reporter was about an order of magnitude greater in A7r5 cells relative to AKR-2B fibroblasts (compare y axes in B andC), the pattern of activity displayed among the reporters was remarkably similar in both cell lines. In particular, the Δ195 reporter was repressed relative to VSMP4, while mutation of the MCAT and CArG2 elements in the context of VSMP4 dramatically reduced promoter"

The V490M PHGDH yielded less than 35% of the activity observed for the wild-type enzyme when overexpressed by transient transfection or when comparing the endogenous activity in fibroblast cells from the patients with controls. Immunoblotting studies showed a comparable reduction in the level of immunoreactive PHGDH in cells expressing the mutant enzyme. Pulse-chase experiments with metabolically labeled PHGDH indicated that this resulted from an increased rate of degradation of the mutant enzyme following its synthesis. Thermolability analyses of mutant and wild-type enzyme activity revealed no significant differences. While others have proposed that the V490M mutation decreases the V max of the enzyme, we conclude that this mutation impairs the folding and/or assembly of PHGDH but has minimal effects on the activity or stability of that portion of the V490M mutant that reaches a mature conformation.

Serine is incorporated directly into proteins and is a precursor for the de novobiosynthesis of glycine, cysteine, and the nonstandard amino acid, selenocysteine. It is also essential for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine and sphingolipids. Serine can be converted to pyruvate in the liver and kidney, with subsequent utilization for gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, or energy production.l-serine is also the precursor of d-serine (7Wolosker H.

Finally, serine serves as the major intracellular source of one-carbon units in the cell, through the action of l-serine hydroxymethyltransferase. The products of this reaction, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and glycine, are critical metabolites involved in folate and bile acid metabolism and in the de novo biosynthesis of creatine, porphyrins, thymidylate, and purine nucleotides. Glycine also functions as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Serine is classified as a nutritionally nonessential amino acid because it can be synthesized de novo, from both glucose and glycine. PHGDH is the first enzyme in a widely distributed, cytoplasmic pathway that synthesizes serine from the glycolytic intermediated-3-phosphoglycerate (reviewed in Refs. 13Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar and 14Snell K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 241-243Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PHGDH catalyzes the oxidation of this substrate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, with NAD+ required as a cofactor. Transamination of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate with glutamate by 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase yields 3-phosphoserine. In the final step, dephosphorylation of 3-phosphoserine by phosphoserine phosphatase produces l-serine. Only the final reaction in this pathway is irreversible. In some cells, serine can also be produced from glycine (13Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This process requires the enzymes of the glycine cleavage complex, found in mitochondria, and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, an enzyme with one isoform localized in the cytoplasm and another in mitochondria. The mitochondrial isozyme may operate reversibly, producing either serine or glycine, depending upon metabolite levels and the presence of the glycine cleavage system. In contrast, the cytoplasmic isozyme appears to operate in one direction only, producing serine (15Chasin L.A. Feldman A. Konstam M. Urlaub G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 17Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Teng C.

While the relative contributions of these alternate synthesis pathways to serine homeostasis remain to be determined, the neurodevelopmental phenotype of patients with a deficiency of PHGDH highlights the importance of that pathway in the central nervous system.

The distribution and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of these mutations support the conclusion that they are disease-causing. However, following synthesis in vitro, these mutations caused only modest reductions in PHGDH activity. These reductions were attributed to a reduced V max of the mutant enzymes, whereas the K m did not differ from the wild-type in this system. To reconcile the dramatic phenotype observed in the patients with the modest effects of these mutations on enzyme activity, the authors speculated that in addition to the lower catalytic turnover, the mutations may result in decreased expression of the enzyme in vivo. Measurements of PHGDH mRNA levels in fibroblasts showed no differences between patients and controls (4Klomp L. de Koning T. Malingre H. van Beurden E. Brink M. Opdam F. Duran M. Jaeken J.

In this paper, we report the independent identification of the V490M mutation in two siblings born to nonconsanguineous parents of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity from New England. Detailed characterization of the enzyme demonstrated an ∼70% reduction of enzyme activity and a similar reduction of immunoreactive protein in cells expressing V490M PHGDH. In contrast to the work of Klomp et al. (4Klomp L. de Koning T. Malingre H. van Beurden E. Brink M. Opdam F. Duran M. Jaeken J. Pineda M. van Maldergem L. Poll-The B. van Den Berg I. Berger R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we find that these reductions resulted from an increased degradation of the mutant protein, probably due to less efficient folding and/or assembly following synthesis. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the low levels of PHGDH and serine observed in our patients and confirm a role for this enzyme deficiency in the genesis of a neurodevelopmental phenotype of congenital microcephaly, severe psychomotor retardation, and seizures. The probands, male and female siblings with congenital microcephaly, severe global developmental delays, seizures, and spastic quadriparesis, were born to healthy, unrelated parents of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity. They were found to have low levels of serine in cerebrospinal fluid, as will be described in detail elsewhere. 2K. Swoboda, M. Korson, and M. Natowicz, manuscript in preparation. Heparinized blood and skin fibroblasts were obtained with informed consent. Leukocyte pellets were prepared from heparinized blood as described (20Kolodny E.H. Mumford R.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1976; 70: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Blood specimens were obtained through informed consent from 400 non-Jewish and 400 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. Samples were included in the latter group if all four grandparents were of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using reagents from Invitrogen. HeLa and BHK-21 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and skin fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM (high glucose) containing 8% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Control fibroblasts (GM 08399A) were obtained from the NIGMS (National Institutes of Health) Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Overlapping expressed sequence tags encoding the entire PHGDH cDNA were identified by sequence similarity to the rat liver cDNA (21Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Schaftingen E.V. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59915) Google Scholar). Primers based upon this sequence were used to amplify the human cDNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR. 100 ng of total RNA prepared from HeLa cells and proband fibroblasts (Trizol; Invitrogen) was reverse transcribed using 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 2.5 pmol of a primer complementary to the sequence 54–74 nucleotides downstream of the predicted stop codon (5′-TCT CTC CCT ATT GAT CAC AGT GG-3′). The 5′ PCR primer (5′-TTA GGT ACT TCT ACT CAC AGC GGC-3′) begins 47 nucleotides upstream of the predicted start codon. The 3′ PCR primer (5′-CAA GTG GAT CCA GGT TAG AAG TGG AAC TGG AAG GC-3′) is complementary to the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein and contains a BamHI restriction site (in italics) added after the stop codon (underlined) for cloning purposes. Amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 36 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min 30 s, with a final 10 min at 72 °C, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). An ∼1.6-kb product was purified (Qiaex II kit; Qiagen) from an agarose gel and digested with EagI and BamHI. This was then cloned into the pcDNA 3.1(−) expression vector (Invitrogen), which had been digested with NotI and BamHI. The resulting clones were assessed by dideoxy sequencing using T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Tissue culture cell pellets and white blood cell pellets were incubated overnight at 50 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA was then purified by sequential extractions with phenol, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), followed by precipitation with ethanol (modification of Ref. 23Williamson R. Eskdale J. Coleman D.V. Niazi M. Loeffler F.E. Modell B.M. Lancet. 1981; 2: 1125-1127Abstract PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) A PCR-based assay was developed to survey for the 1468G→A mutation in genomic DNA. Preliminary analysis indicated the presence of an ∼800-bp intron close to this mutation site. This region was cloned, and the exon/intron boundaries (between 1447 and 1448) were determined. 3J. Mauthe and S. Pind, manuscript in preparation. For detection of the 1468G→A mutation, the 5′ PCR primer (5′-CTC CGC TCA TTG CAC CTT TGA-3′) is situated in the intron, starting 115 bp upstream of 1448. The 3′ primer (5′-ATG CTG CTT CCA CGC TTC CA-3′) is complementary to nucleotides 1553–1572. A 238-bp product was amplified from ∼100 ng of genomic DNA using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following amplification conditions: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. Aliquots were digested with Hsp92II (Promega), separated on 10% acrylamide gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. Fragments of 45 and 193 bp were observed for control DNA and 45, 57, and 136 bp if the 1468G→A mutation was present. The activity of the V490M PHGDH was compared with the wild-type enzyme following transient expression in BHK-21 cells. In some experiments, the PHGDH-encoding vectors were cotransfected with pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) in order to monitor the transfection efficiency. DNA-lipid complexes were prepared with 9 μg of pcDNA-PHGDH (wild-type or V490M), or 7 μg of pcDNA-PHGDH plus 2 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in DMEM, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 24 h following transfection, the cells were lysed by sonication in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2% Triton X-100 containing a mammalian cell proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min, and the protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce). β-Galactosidase activity was measured usingortho-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (24Cotten M. Wagner E. Birnstiel M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 618-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PHGDH was assayed in the direction of NADH oxidation by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Assays were performed at 30 °C in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm NADH, and 50 μm phosphohydroxypyruvate in a final volume of 1 ml (1Jaeken J. Detheux M. Van Maldergem L. Foulon M. Carchon H. Van Schaftingen E. Arch. Dis. Child. 1996; 74: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,21Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Schaftingen E.V. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Absorbance measurements were taken every 5 s for 5–10 min using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences), and the initial slopes of the decrease in absorbance were determined. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that oxidizes 1 μmol of NADH/min under these assay conditions. Corrections were made for transfection efficiency by dividing the specific activity of PHGDH in a dish of cells by a factor determined by dividing the activity of β-galactosidase in that same dish by the average β-galactosidase activity in all dishes on that day. An NcoI restriction site was introduced into the pcDNA-PHGDH construct by site-specific mutagenesis (QuikChange™ kit; Stratagene) to change the A at position −1 of the PHGDH cDNA to a C. The forward primer used for mutagenesis was 5′-CCGAGGCCAACTCCAGCCATGGCTTTTGCAAATCTGCGG-3′, with the nucleotide change highlighted in italics and the resultingNcoI site underlined. The reverse primer for mutagenesis was complementary to the forward primer. A 212-bpXbaI/BstEII fragment that encompassed this region was removed from the mutagenesis product and used to replace this region in another aliquot of pcDNA-PHGDH that had not undergone mutagenesis. It was sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutation had been introduced. The entire PHGDH coding region was then removed from this vector by digestion with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into the same sites of the pTrc 99 A prokaryotic expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting plasmid was introduced into competent BL-21 CodonPlus™ bacteria (Stratagene) and grown in Terrific broth at room temperature until reaching an OD660 of 0.5–0.6. Expression of PHGDH was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for a further 16 h at room temperature. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and stored as a pellet at −80 °C. PHGDH was purified from the bacterial cells using differential centrifugation and column chromatography. Cells were lysed by sonication in 10 volumes of buffer 1 (25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, containing a bacterial cell proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml lysozyme). Following the removal of particulate matter by centrifugation, the lysate was mixed with 0.3 volumes of 5% streptomycin sulfate and clarified by centrifugation. A 30–50% ammonium sulfate pellet prepared from the supernatant was solubilized in buffer 2 (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) and desalted using a column of Cellulofine GH-25 (Amicon) equilibrated in the same buffer. The excluded fraction from this column was then applied to a column of 5′ AMP-Sepharose 4B (25Grant G.A. Zapp M.L. Biosci. Rep. 1981; 1: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Following extensive washing with buffer 2, proteins were eluted with 1 mm β-NADH in buffer 2. Fractions containing protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Those containing PHGDH were concentrated and applied to a column of Sephacryl S-300HR (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer 3 (25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mmNa2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.2). Fractions containing purified PHGDH were pooled and stored at −80 °C following the addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 50%. PHGDH prepared in this manner was greater than 95% pure (not shown). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the purified PHGDH were produced from BALB/c mice (26Stupack D.G. Stewart S. Carter W.G. Wayner E.A. Wilkins J.A. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 34: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by the Canadian Genetic Diseases Network Immunoprobes Facility (Winnipeg, Canada). Hybridomas that produced antibodies to PHGDH were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive clones were tested for their ability to detect PHGDH on immunoblots and to immunoprecipitate labeled PHGDH from HeLa cells. Clone 13D5 performed well in all of these assays. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% minigels and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 35 V and 4 °C in 250 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, and 15% methanol (modified from Ref. 27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44919) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder. The 13D5 antibody was diluted in this same buffer and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, bound complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura; Pierce). BHK cells were transfected with 9 μg of pcDNA-PHGDH (wild-type or mutant) as described above. 24 h following transfection, cells were preincubated in Met/Cys-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with 100 μCi/mll-[35S]Met/Cys (>1000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the same medium. For chase samples, the labeling medium was replaced with complete DMEM containing 8% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm Met, and 1 mm Cys. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% digitonin, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors). After scraping from the plates, insoluble material was removed from the lysates by centrifugation at 17,000 ×g for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the 13D5 antibody preadsorbed onto protein G-agarose (Sigma). Immune complexes were washed six times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) and eluted and denatured with Laemmli sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels, fixed, dried, and exposed to film or a phosphorimaging screen (Bio-Rad). Images were analyzed using a Personal Molecular Imager FX and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Based upon their similarity to the sequence of rat liver PHGDH (21Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Schaftingen E.V. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a series of overlapping expressed sequence tags was identified that predicted the entire cDNA encoding human PHGDH. Primers were designed to amplify the coding region and 47 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region of this cDNA from human HeLa cells using reverse transcriptase-PCR. A product of the expected size (∼1.6 kb) was obtained and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 expression vector. The sequence obtained for the coding region of the HeLa cell PHGDH was identical to that predicted from the overlapping expressed sequence tags (not shown). It was 88% identical to the rat sequence through the coding region and predicted a 533-amino acid protein that was 94% identical to the rat enzyme. With the exception of a single base substitution (G → T) at position 75, our sequence was also identical to the sequence of PHGDH that was subsequently deposited into GenBankTM (accession numberAF006043; Ref. 18Cho H.M. Jun D.Y. Bae M.A. Ahn J.D. Kim Y.H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This substitution changes amino acid 25 to Asp rather than Glu as reported by Cho et al. (18Cho H.M. Jun D.Y. Bae M.A. Ahn J.D. Kim Y.H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The same substitution is also present in our family members and in all of the expressed sequence tags we examined as well as the sequence recently reported by Klomp et al. (4Klomp L. de Koning T. Malingre H. van Beurden E. Brink M. Opdam F. Duran M. Jaeken J. Pineda M. van Maldergem L. Poll-The B. van Den Berg I. Berger R. Am. J. Hum.

The only difference noted in these samples was a 1468G→A transition, resulting in a substitution of the Val at amino acid 490 with Met (V490M). This change also introduced an Hsp92II restriction enzyme site into the DNA, providing a rapid method to screen for this mutation. A 238-bp fragment that included oneHsp92II site in control samples and two sites if the 1468G→A mutation was present, was amplified from genomic DNA (Fig.1). Restriction digests of control DNA yielded bands of 193 and 45 bp (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). In samples containing th"

Recent interest has focused on biodiversity in the deep ocean ([1][1],[2][2]). Here, we report observations from submersibles of large unknown squids at bathypelagic depths in four ocean basins (Table 1).

Representative digitized video clips are available on Science Online ([3][5]). In most cases, the squids were first encountered within a few meters of the sea floor with their extremely large, terminal fins undulating slowly and with arms and tentacles typically held in a unique position: spread outward from the body axis, then abruptly bent anteriorly ([Fig. 1][3], A and B). None of these squids were collected, but all share the following morphology: The arms cannot be distinguished from the tentacles (modified ventrolateral arms of decapod cephalopods), appearing as 10 identical brachial appendages, all of about equal thicknesses and lengths. The relative length of these appendages is far greater than the arm length in any known squid, although all appendages are highly contractile. The filamentous distal portions of the brachial appendages appeared lighter in color than the rest of the animal in some videos. During extreme close-ups of squids 7 and 8, suckers could be seen along the oral surfaces of the proximal arms but not on the filamentous segments distal to the elbowlike bends.

Most of the squids did not appear initially to react to the approach of the submersibles. In one case (squid 4), no escape response was noted even when the brachial appendages brushed the sample basket. After a few minutes, one animal (squid 7) moved slowly away, flapping its fins but with the arm crown still spread ([Fig. 1][3]D). However, when most squids either touched a submersible or encountered its turbulence, the escape reaction consisted of strongly flapping the fins and towing the retracted brachial crown (e.g., [Fig. 1][3]C). When squid 7 changed from hovering to rapid swimming, the first pulse included a contraction of the mantle, but no jetting was observed subsequently. One squid (squid 5) became entangled in the submersible and seemed to have difficulty releasing its arms and tentacles; during its attempts to swim away, multiple appendages stretched greatly.

We cannot be certain of the identity of these squids until specimens are captured; the morphology is very different from any known family. They are, however, most similar to the family Magnapinnidae. This family was recently described from two juveniles and a paralarva, all captured in epipelagic waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean ([4][6]). The Magnapinnidae is characterized by tentacles and arms with slender elongate tips and very large terminal fins. The squids reported here could be the unknown adults of this family. The sharp bend of the arms, which appears to coincide with a change in sucker distribution, could mark the junction between the arms and the terminal filaments seen on juvenile magnapinnids.

The inference from eight sightings within a few years of a completely unknown deep-sea animal at similar depths in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans is that these squids are comparatively common worldwide in the bathypelagic realm. That such a substantial animal is common in the world's largest ecosystem, yet has not previously been captured or observed, is an indication of how little is known about life in the deep ocean.

https://openalex.org/W2171152623,"In this study, we describe the rational synthesis and functional analysis of novel high affinity inhibitors for the mammalian peptide transporter PEPT2. Moreover, we demonstrate which structural properties convert a transported compound into a non-translocated inhibitor. Starting from Lys[Z(NO2)]-Pro (where Z is benzyloxycarbonyl), which we recently identified as the first competitive high affinity inhibitor of the intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1, a series of different lysine-containing dipeptide derivatives was synthesized and studied for interaction with PEPT2 based on transport competition assays in Pichia pastorisyeast cells expressing PEPT2 heterologously and in renal SKPT cells expressing PEPT2. In addition, the two-electrode voltage clamp technique in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing PEPT2 was used to determine whether the compounds are transported electrogenically or block the uptake of dipeptides. Synthesis and functional analysis of Lys-Lys derivatives containing benzyloxycarbonyl or 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl side chain protections provided a set of inhibitors that reversibly inhibited the uptake of dipeptides by PEPT2 with K i values as low as 10 ± 1 nm. This is the highest affinity of a ligand of PEPT2 ever reported. Moreover, based on the structure-function relationship, we conclude that the spatial location of the side chain amino protecting group in a dipeptide containing a diaminocarbonic acid and its intramolecular distance from the Cα atom are key factors for the transformation of a substrate into an inhibitor of PEPT2.

The mammalian H+/peptide cotransporter PEPT2 was initially identified in the brush border membrane of renal proximal tubular cells as the high affinity subtype of the mammalian proton-coupled di- and tripeptide transporters (1Daniel H. Herget M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1-F8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In kidney, PEPT2 is mainly responsible for the rapid and efficient uptake of a large number of different di- and tripeptides as well as various peptidomimetics from the tubular fluids into the cell. As recent studies show, PEPT2 is also expressed in a variety of other tissues such as lung and the central nervous system (2Döring F. Walter J. Will J. Focking M. Boll M. Amasheh S. Clauss W.

Specific inhibitors have been extremely useful in the identification of the function and structure of numerous receptors, transporters, and enzymes, but so far no inhibitors of PEPT2 with the required specificity and affinity have been found.

As PEPT2 is known to have similar but not identical structural requirements for substrate recognition and transport, this study was initiated to analyze whether Lys[Z(NO2)]-Pro also inhibits PEPT2 or whether even more effective inhibitors can be obtained by alterations in the structure and hydrophobicity of this compound. Varying lysine-containing dipeptide derivatives were synthesized and submitted to structure-function analysis in three different expression systems employing competitive uptake studies with the radiolabeled dipeptidesd-Phe-Ala and Gly-Sar and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements of transport-generated currents. This procedure led to a new class of high affinity inhibitors for PEPT2. It also allowed the identification of some structural features that turn a Lys-containing dipeptide substrate of PEPT2 into an inhibitor. benzyloxycarbonyl 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl tert. butyloxycarbonyl diaminobutyric acid d-phenylalanylalanine glycylsarcosine lysyl[Z(NO2)]-alanine lysyl[Z(NO2)]-valine alanyl-lysine[Z(NO2)] valyl-lysine[Z(NO2)] lysyl(Z)-lysine[Z(NO2)] lysyl[Z(NO2)]-lysine[Z(NO2)] potassium phosphate buffer 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid The renal cell line SKPT-0193 Cl.2 established from isolated cells of rat proximal tubules (5Brandsch M.

Hopfer (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). [Glycine-1-14C]Gly-Sar (specific radioactivity 53 mCi/mmol) was custom-synthesized by Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Custom-synthesized [alanine-2,3-3H]d-Phe-Ala (specific radioactivity 40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Biotrend (Cologne, Germany). EDTA, dexamethasone, apotransferrin, Gly-Gln, and Gly-Sar were from Sigma; d-Phe-Ala was purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). Culture media and supplements, fetal bovine serum, and trypsin solution were purchased from Invitrogen. Collagenase A was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Substrates and precursors were purchased from Sigma. All non-commercially available dipeptide derivatives were synthesized according to laboratory standard procedures. Briefly, from Boc-Ala-OH, Boc-Val-OH and Nα-Boc-Nε-X-Lys-OH, and Nα-Boc-Nδ-X-Orn-OH and Nα-Boc-Nγ-X-Dab-OH (withX = Z(NO2), Z, Ac, where Dab is diaminobutyric acid), respectively, we prepared the respectiveN-hydroxysuccinimid esters (ONSu). The activated amino acid derivatives were coupled with 1.5-fold excess of the C-terminal amino acid (Lys(X), Orn(X), Ala, Pro, Val, Sar, or Lys(Boc)). The crude products were purified by flash chromatography on silica gel. After removal of the Boc groups by treatment with concentrated formic acid at room temperature, the resulting dipeptide derivatives were characterized as formiates. In the case of Lys(Boc)-Ala, the Z-Lys(Boc)-ONSu was coupled with alanine, and the Z-protecting group was removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The purity of the final products was evaluated by analytical reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and capillary electrophoresis, and it was found to exceed 98% in all cases. The dipeptide derivatives shown in Tables I and III were dissolved at high concentrations in dimethyl sulfoxide before preparing the respective uptake buffers.Table IAffinities of Lys[Z(NO 2)]-Xaa dipeptide derivatives for inhibition of [3 H]d-Phe-Ala uptake by PEPT2 expressed in yeast and [14 C]Gly-Sar uptake into SKPT cellsCompoundK iP. pastorisSKPTμmμmLys[Z(NO2)]-Pro (LZNP)2.3 ± 0.60.7 ± 0.1Lys[Z(NO2)]-Val (LZNV)1.7 ± 0.60.1 ± 0.01Lys[Z(NO2)]-Ala (LZNA)0.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1Lys[Z(NO2)]-Sar (LZNS)3.5 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.1Apparent K i values ± S.E. were calculated from IC50 values derived by nonlinear regression analysis of competition assays.

Cultures of P. pastoris strains expressing PEPT2 were prepared as described previously (6Döring F. Klapper M. Theis S. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Döring F. Theis S. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted at 3000 × g for 10 min, washed twice with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (PPB, pH 6.5), and resuspended to 5 × 107 cells × 20 μl−1 PPB. Uptake measurements were performed at 22–24 °C by using a rapid filtration technique on 96-well filter plates (HATF type, 0.45-μm pore size; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). In brief, uptake was initiated by mixing 20 μl of cell suspension with 30 μl of PPB containing [3H]d-Phe-Ala (final concentration, 25 nm) either with or without competitors (final concentration, 0.01–200 μm). After 15 min of incubation, uptake was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold PPB followed by filtration. The filters were washed four more times with 200 μl of PPB, removed from the plate with a punch, and transferred into vials. Radioactivity associated with the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. SKPT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium:Nutrient Mixture F12 (Ham) 1:1 and l-glutamine, fetal bovine serum, recombinant insulin, epidermal growth factor, apotransferrin, dexamethasone and gentamicin as described (5Brandsch M.

SKPT cells at passage numbers 56–77 were maintained in 75 cm2 culture flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. With a starting cell density of 0.8 × 106 cells per dish, the cultures reached confluence within 20 h. Uptake was measured in these cells 4 days after seeding as described previously (5Brandsch M. Brandsch C. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Hopfer U. Leibach F.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Ganapathy M.E. Brandsch M. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J.

The uptake medium was 25 mm Mes/Tris (pH 6.0) containing 140 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. Uptake was initiated after washing the cells for 30 s in uptake buffer by adding 1 ml of uptake medium containing radiolabeled Gly-Sar (10 μm) with increasing concentrations of test compounds (0–0.316 mm). If necessary, the pH of the solutions was corrected before preparing the required dilutions. After incubation for 10 min, the cells were quickly washed four times with ice-cold buffer, solubilized in 1 ml of Igepal® Ca-630 (0.5% v/v, Sigma) in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgSO4), and prepared for liquid scintillation spectrometry. For each experiment, the samples for protein measurement were prepared and measured as described earlier (5Brandsch M. Brandsch C. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Hopfer U. Leibach F.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Female X. laevis were oocytes purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). Surgically removed oocytes were separated by collagenase treatment and handled as described previously (9Boll M. Herget M. Wagener M. Weber W.M. Markovich D. Biber J. Clauss W. Murer H. Daniel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Individual oocytes were injected with 30 nl of RNA solution containing 30 ng of PEPT2 cRNA. All electrophysiological measurements were performed after 3–6 days by incubation of oocytes in a buffer composed of 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm CaCl2, 0.41 mmMgCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, and 10 mm MES/Tris at pH 6.5 (modified Barth solution). The two-electrode voltage clamp technique was applied to characterize responses in current (I) and transmembrane potential (V m) to substrate addition in oocytes expressing PEPT2. In short, oocytes were placed in an open chamber with a volume of 0.5 ml and continuously superfused with modified Barth solution or with solutions of Gly-Gln and/or the corresponding dipeptide derivatives. Electrodes with resistances between 1 and 10 megaohm were connected to a TEC-05 amplifier (NPI Electronic Instruments, Tamm, Germany). PEPT2-expressing oocytes were voltage-clamped at −100 mV, and current-voltage (I-V m) relationships were measured using short (100 ms) pulses separated by 200-ms pauses in the potential range from −160 to +20 mV. I-V m measurements were made immediately before and 30 s after substrate application when current flow reached steady state. Currents evoked by PEPT2 at a given membrane potential were calculated as the difference of the currents measured in the presence and absence of substrate. All data are given as the mean ±S.E. of three or four independent experiments. Significance of differences between the uptake rates and calculated constants were determined by a nonpaired U test. IC50 values (i.e. concentration of the unlabeled compound necessary to inhibit 50% of radiolabeled dipeptide carrier-mediated uptake) were determined by non-linear regression using the logistical equation for an asymmetric sigmoid (allosteric Hill kinetics):y = minimum + (maximum − minimum)/(1 + (X/IC50)− p) , where maximum is the initial Y value, minimum is the final Yvalue, and the exponent P represents Hill coefficient. Inhibition constants (K i) were calculated from IC50 values according to the method published by Cheng and Prusoff (10Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). We first determined the affinity of Lys[Z(NO2)]-Pro (LZNP) and three related dipeptide derivatives containing the N-terminal Lys[Z(NO2)] moiety but varying C-terminal amino acids (Ala, Val, Sar). Using competition assays based on PEPT2-expressing P. pastoris yeast cells and the renal cell line SKPT constitutively expressing PEPT2, it became obvious that the four dipeptide derivatives compete with radiolabeled d-Phe-Ala or Gly-Sar uptake via PEPT2 in dose-dependent manners (Fig.1 A and Table I). The obtained K i values varied from 0.1 to 3.5 μm showing that Lys[Z(NO2)]-Pro as well as the other tested derivatives interacted with PEPT2 with high affinities. Whether these compounds are still substrates or indeed inhibitors was analyzed by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique in PEPT2-expressing X. laevisoocytes. As shown for Lys[Z(NO2)]-Val (LZNV) (Fig.1 B), no substrate-evoked inward current could be recorded. Moreover, LZNV was able to inhibit the inward current evoked by 0.2 mm of the dipeptide Gly-Gln. This was also the case for the other Lys[Z(NO2)] dipeptide derivatives (data not shown). The inhibition of Gly-Gln-evoked inward current by Lys[Z(NO2)]-Val was found to be dose-dependent and reversible, suggesting a competitive mode of action at the substrate binding site of PEPT2 (Fig.1 B). To demonstrate this, we investigated the kinetics of the inhibition of Gly-Sar uptake in SKPT cells caused by LZNV. Gly-Sar uptake was measured over the concentration range of 0.02–5 mm in the absence or presence of LZNV at a concentration of 200 nm. In the absence of the inhibitor, the Michaelis-Menten constant, K t, for Gly-Sar was 108 ± 17 μm, and the maximal velocity,V max, was 5.4 ± 0.8 nmol × mg of protein−1 per 10 min. The corresponding kinetic constants obtained in the presence of LZNV were K t = 168 ± 14 μm and V max = 4.5 ± 0.4 nmol × mg of protein−1 per 10 min. Thus, the presence of the inhibitor at a concentration close to itsK i value increased the K t value for Gly-Sar with the V max not altered significantly. This confirmed that Lys[Z(NO2)]-Val inhibits PEPT2-mediated Gly-Sar uptake into SKPT cells in a competitive manner. The same experiment was performed in Xenopus oocytes expressing PEPT2. In this system, the K t value for Gly-Gln transport was increased from 92 to 353 μm in the presence of LZNV (10 μm). The V maxvalues were affected only insignificantly (control, 118 nA; LZNV, 106 nA). Moreover, we determined the inhibition constant (K i) for LZNV in a Dixon type experiment by measuring current in oocytes at two different Gly-Gln concentrations in the presence of increasing concentrations of LZNV (0–50 μm). The results revealed linearity at all Gly-Gln concentrations with lines intersecting above the abscissa in the fourth quadrant, as expected for a competitive inhibitor. AK i value of 2.1 ± 0.1 μm was calculated from the point of intersection. By moving the Lys[Z(NO2)] moiety into the C-terminal position with either an N-terminal Ala or Val residue attached, two compounds (ALZN and VLZN) that also inhibited dipeptide influx in the Pichia and SKPT competition assays with apparent K i values of 10 ± 4 and 3.7 ± 0.1 μm (ALZN) and 13 ± 1 μm and 0.5 ± 0.02 μm (VLZN) were obtained. However, in contrast to LZNA, which did not show any electrogenic transport in oocytes, the reversed peptide sequence ALZN produced an inward current of 11 nA, 46% as high as that generated by Gly-Gln (24 nA) at a membrane potential of −100 mV (Fig. 2). Moreover, whereas LZNA could completely block Gly-Gln-induced inward currents in oocytes, ALZN failed to cause the full inhibition of Gly-Gln-generated transport currents (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained for VLZN (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the Lys[Z(NO2)] residue provides a potent inhibitor only when present in the N-terminal position of a dipeptide. To understand why the Lys[Z(NO2)] moiety when present in the N-terminal position of a dipeptide is able to block dipeptide transport activity, we synthesized a set of dipeptide derivatives differing in the structure and spatial position of the ω-amino protecting group. As shown in Table II, the dipeptide derivatives Lys(Z)-Ala, Lys(Boc)-Ala, and Lys(Ac)-Ala competed for uptake of radiolabeled d-Phe-Ala in yeast cells with affinities of 23 ± 6, 26 ± 8, and 64 ± 7 μm and for uptake of radiolabeled Gly-Sar in SKPT cells with affinities of 0.9 ± 0.1, 3.2 ± 0.2, and 16 ± 2 μm, respectively. Whereas 5 mm Lys(Z)-Ala did not produce any inward current in oocytes, it inhibited the current evoked by 5 mm Gly-Gln in oocytes almost completely by 98% (data not shown). Lys(Boc)-Ala displayed the same characteristics as Lys(Z)-Ala with no transport currents when provided alone, but the dose-dependent inhibition of Gly-Gln generated currents. In contrast, 5 mm Lys(Ac)-Ala showed electrogenic transport with inward currents as high as that of the dipeptide (102%I Gly-Gln) but failed to inhibit Gly-Gln currents when both compounds were perfused together. The rather hydrophobic Z and Boc functions can therefore, similarly to the Z(NO2) group, render the natural dipeptide Lys-Ala into an inhibitor. That the blocked ε-amino group of the lysine residue has to be in the N-terminal position for the inhibition of PEPT2 could be confirmed by comparing Lys(Z)-Ala with Ala-Lys(Z). The latter showed an affinity in the yeast transport competition assay of 9 ± 2 μmand 1.7 ± 0.3 μm using SKPT cells and was transported in oocytes with maximal currents of 82% of that induced by 5 mm Gly-Gln. Employing this series of derivatives, we therefore established that a hydrophobic blocking group at the Nε-amino function of lysine is required for the generation of a transport inhibitor and simultaneously confirmed that this side chain construct only works as an inhibitor when present at the N terminus of a dipeptide.Table IITransport properties of dipeptide derivatives for interaction with PEPT2CompoundK i%I Gly-GlnInhibition of I Gly-GlnP. pastorisSKPTμmμmLys(Z)-Ala23 ± 60.9 ± 0.10+Lys(Boc)-Ala26 ± 83.2 ± 0.20+Lys(Ac)-Ala64 ± 716 ± 2102−Ala-Lys(Z)9 ± 21.7 ± 0.382−Orn(Z)-Ala26 ± 101.9 ± 0.265−Orn[Z(NO2)]-Ala2 ± 0.81.5 ± 0.040+Dab(Z)-Ala50 ± 94.4 ± 0.297−Dab[Z(NO2)]-Ala27 ± 14.2 ± 0.10+Apparent K i values ± S.E. were calculated from IC50 values derived by non-linear regression analysis in transport competition assays in PEPT2 expressing yeast cells with [3H]d-Phe-Ala as a substrate and in SKPT cells expressing PEPT2 with [14C]Gly-Sar as test substrate.

Next, we synthesized ornithine derivatives with the side chain blocked by a Z(NO2) or a Z group and an alanine residue in the C-terminal position. Orn[Z(NO2)]-Ala proved to be a slightly weaker inhibitor for PEPT2 than the corresponding Lys derivative with affinities of 2.0 ± 0.8 (yeast) and 1.7 ± 0.04 μm (SKPT), respectively. The affinity of Orn(Z)-Ala in the competition assays was almost identical to that of Lys(Z)-Ala (yeast, 26 ± 10 versus 23 ± 6 μm; SKPT, 1.9 ± 0.2 versus 0.9 ± 0.1 μm), too. However, in contrast to the Lys derivative, which also clearly was an inhibitor, Orn(Z)-Ala failed to inhibit Gly-Gln-evoked transport currents in oocytes but generated transport currents when perfused alone at 5 mm that reached 65% of currents of 5 mm of Gly-Gln in the same oocytes. In this special case, shortening the side chain with the protecting group just by one CH2 unit (Ornversus Lys) prevents the inhibition of PEPT2 and maintains the compound's capability for transport. That the distance between Cα and the protecting group of the side chain of the N-terminal amino acid is indeed a key factor in rendering a compound into an inhibitor was further confirmed by the dipeptide derivatives Dab(Z)-Ala and Dab[Z(NO2)]-Ala. They contain a Dab residue instead of an ornithine or lysine residue with the protecting group in Nγ-amino position. When provided at a concentration of 5 mm, Dab(Z)-Ala is electrogenically transported by PEPT2 with inward currents of 97% I Gly-Gln and failed to inhibit the current evoked by 5 mm Gly-Gln. Again, adding an NO2 group renders the substrate into an inhibitor. Dab[Z(NO2)]-Ala does not generate inward current. This observation suggests that both the structure as well as the spatial position of the N-protecting group within the substrate binding domain of PEPT2 is crucial for the ability of a compound to block the transport cycle. The demonstration that the rather hydrophobic dipeptides Lys(Z)-Ala and Ala-Lys(Z) displayed a higher affinity for PEPT2 than most of our earlier tested naturally occurring dipeptides led us to assume that an Nε-protected lysine derivative in both the N- and C-terminal position could be advantageous for obtaining more effective inhibitors. We therefore synthesized lysyl-lysine derivatives containing either a Z- or a Z(NO2) group attached at the Nε-amino groups, resulting in Lys(Z)-Lys[Z(NO2)] (LZLZN) and Lys[Z(NO2)]-Lys[Z(NO2)] (LZNLZN). Fig. 3 shows an electrophysiological analysis of PEPT2 function in X. laevis oocytes with Lys[Z(NO2)]-Lys[Z(NO2)] as the transport inhibitor. Table III summarizes the data obtained on the affinities of these compounds for PEPT2 in yeast as well as SKPT cells. As expected, adding a Z- or Z(NO2) group to a Lys residue, resulting in a higher hydrophobicity of the corresponding dipeptide, increased its affinity for interaction with PEPT2 dramatically. The apparent affinity of Lys-Lys was 43 ± 9 μm (yeast cells) and 10 ± 0.4 μm(SKPT-cells) and could be gradually increased 7–54-fold for Lys(Z)-Lys and Lys[Z(NO2)]-Lys and up to more than 4000-fold for Lys(Z)-Lys[Z(NO2)] and Lys[Z(NO2)]-Lys[Z(NO2)] with resultingK i values of 10–40 nm in both assay systems. The structural formulas of LZLZN and LZNLZN are presented in Fig. 4. When these dipeptide derivatives were analyzed for transport in oocytes expressing PEPT2 (Fig.3 A, shown for LZLZN), they did not produce any inward currents but were able to inhibit the current evoked by Gly-Gln completely but reversibly. Fig. 3 B shows the dose-dependent inhibition of the Gly-Gln-mediated inward current by increasing concentrations of LZLZN in the current voltage relationship. To demonstrate unequivocally the competitive nature of the transport inhibition by LZLZN, we performed comparable experiments in both systems, the Xenopus oocyte assay and the SKPT cells. First, we investigated the kinetics of the inhibition of Gly-Sar uptake in SKPT cells caused by LZLZN. Gly-Sar uptake was measured over a concentration range of 0.02–5 mm in the absence or presence of LZLZN at a concentration of 20 nm. The Michaelis-Menten constant, K t, for Gly-Sar uptake was 91 ± 20 μm in the absence of the inhibitor and 250 ± 40 μm in its presence. TheV max values were not altered significantly. Second, we determined the inhibition constant (K i) of LZLZN by measuring [14C]Gly-Sar uptake at two different Gly-Sar concentrations (25 and 70 μm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of LZLZN (0–500 nm). The results of the Dixon plot revealed linearity at both Gly-Sar concentrations with lines intersecting above the abscissa in the fourth quadrant and a K i value of 16.2 nm. Measuring Gly-Gln-elicited inward current in Xenopus oocytes in the presence of increasing concentrations of LZLZN (0–400 nm) resulted in a similar Dixon plot with lines intersecting in the fourth quadrant, as expected for a competitive inhibitor. A K i value of 190 ± 66 nm was calculated from the point of intersection. Thus, as has been shown for LZNV, LZLZN also inhibits PEPT2-mediated peptide uptake both in SKPT cells and in Xenopus oocytes expressing PEPT2 in a competitive manner.Figure 4Structural formulas of Lys(Z)-Lys[Z(NO2)] and Lys[Z(NO2)]-Lys[Z(NO2)].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study, we demonstrate that lysine-containing dipeptides can be converted from transported substrates of PEPT2 into effective transport inhibitors by blocking the Nε-amino group of an N-terminal lysine residue with either a Boc, Z, or Z(NO2) function. Moving such a modified Lys residue into the C-terminal position of a dipeptide structure surprisingly retains the compound's capacity for electrogenic transport. This strongly suggests that two distinctly different pockets (N-terminal P1 and C-terminal P2 pocket) within the substrate binding domain of PEPT2 accommodate the side chains of dipeptides and derivatives. Although it has been shown that the physicochemical characteristics of the N- and C-terminal residues of dipeptides differently affect their affinity for interaction with PEPT2 (11Daniel H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9565-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the present data demonstrate for the first time that the specificity within the side chains can also discriminate between substrates and inhibitors. To obtain a high affinity inhibitor, a sufficiently long side chain spacer in the N-terminal position carrying a hydrophobic function like the Z or Z(NO2) groups must be provided for the proposed P1 pocket. Shortening the spacer by just one CH2 unit, as in the ornithine homologue with the Z-function, prevents the inhibition of PEPT2 and allows transport. This suggests that a definite amino acid side chain of the PEPT2 protein specifically interacts with the altered side chain structure in P1, preventing the conformational change of the protein in the initiation of the substrate translocation step. In contrast, the P2 site in PEPT2 appears to be less restrictive to all substrate side chain modifications for transport, although they clearly affect substrate affinity. Fig. 5 provides a model for the proposed asymmetry for binding and transport or inhibition by the modified lysyl-dipeptides. With LZLZN and LZNLZN, we obtained substrates with the highest affinity (40 and 10 nm, respectively, in the yeast assay) reported so far for a ligand of PEPT2. These compounds should be very useful for probing the protein structure of PEPT2 as well as for identifying its biological role in the various cell types and tissues where the protein is expressed."

The presence of four tandem copies of TTTAAAGCCG in the polylinker region of pLITMUS28 resulted in a DNA molecule with increased affinity (ΔΔG of ∼700 cal mol−1) for the archaeal histone HMfB relative to the polylinker sequence, and the dominant, quantitative contribution of the helical repeats of the dinucleotide TA to this increased affinity has been established.

However, HMfA did not have similarly high affinities for the HMfB-selected DNA molecules, and domain-swap experiments have shown that this difference in affinity is determined by residue differences in the C-terminal region of α-helix 3 of the histone fold, a region that is not expected to directly interact with DNA. Rather this region is thought to participate in forming the histone dimer:dimer interface at the center of an archaeal nucleosome histone tetramer core.

Regardless of the species, the nucleosome contains ∼146 bp of DNA wrapped ∼1.65 times around a histone octamer core formed by a central histone (H3+H4)2 tetramer flanked by two histone (H2A+H2B) dimers (1Luger K. Mader A. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar, 2Harp J.M. Hanson B.L. Timm D.E. Bunick G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Although the role of the nucleosome as a structural element has long been recognized, it is now also clear that positioned nucleosomes play regulatory roles in gene expression (4Svaren J. Horz W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and this has led to considerable experimental interest in designing, isolating, and characterizing DNA sequences that are preferentially incorporated into nucleosomes and therefore act as nucleosome positioning elements (5Widom J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 285-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). DNA molecules with this property were designed logically, with sequences that conform to tandem repeats of (A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN, based on the argument that such molecules would be anisotropically flexible and would most readily accommodate the double-helix distortions needed for tight wrapping around the nucleosome core (6Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 7Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Repetition of this simple 10-bp motif results in a DNA molecule with A/T- and G/C-rich regions repeated sequentially approximately once per helical turn. A/T- and G/C-rich sequences were known to accommodate minor and major groove compressions, respectively (8Satchwell S.C. Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 659-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 9Burkhoff A.M. Tullius T.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As expected, when such molecules were incorporated into a nucleosome, the alternating A/T- and G/C-rich regions were positioned where the minor and major grooves were compressed, respectively, as they sequentially faced the histone core (7Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, now with high resolution structures available, it is known that the nucleosome is only quasi-symmetric and that the wrapped DNA is also distorted into regions of under- and overwinding and has sites with non-ideal base pair stacking (1Luger K. Mader A. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar, 2Harp J.M. Hanson B.L. Timm D.E. Bunick G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

As might be anticipated, to accommodate these additional distortions considerably more complex “rules” have recently been established for nucleosome positioning sequences, based primarily on the sequences of both natural and synthetic DNA molecules selectively incorporated into nucleosomesin vitro by octamer binding (10Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 11Widlund H.R. Cao H. Simonsson S. Magnusson E. Simonsson T. Nielson P.E. Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. Kubista M. J.

Biol. 1999; 288: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Consistent with the designed molecules, these selected molecules also have A/T- and G/C-rich regions alternating in phase with the helical repeat as a dominant feature, but most also have multiple short A-tracts (A3–4) on one DNA strand and an overabundance of TA dinucleotides at ∼10-bp intervals, features that introduce elements of sequence complexity. For example, the mouse genomic DNA fragments isolated with the highest histone octamer affinity have sequences that contain 10-bp repeats that conform to a consensus TATAAACGCC motif (11Widlund H.R. Cao H. Simonsson S. Magnusson E. Simonsson T. Nielson P.E. Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. Kubista M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these molecules have been shown to exhibit exceptional flexibility, both in bending and in accommodating changes to the helical twist (13Widlund H.R. Kuduvalli P.N. Bengtsson M. Cao H. Tullius T.D. Kubista M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31847-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Roychoudhury M. Sitlani A. Lapham J. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13608-13613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is noteworthy that TA is the least stable dinucleotide, and TATA is one of the most flexible tetranucleotides (15Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 16Packer M.J. Dauncey M.P. Hunter C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Consistent with exploiting these sequence-determined structural properties, TA steps have been localized ±15 bp from the central dyad of positioned nucleosomes, specifically at the sites at which the base pair stacking is necessarily most distorted (17Fitzgerald D.J. Anderson J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Presumably, this use of TA dinucleotides minimizes the energy costs of nucleosome assembly. A complicating feature in extending these analyses is that the eukaryotic histone octamer contains four different histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This makes it difficult to interpret such nucleosome positioning sequences in terms of individual histone-DNA interactions. In addition, because the octamer assembly of DNA into nucleosomesin vitro is very salt-dependent, the assembly technology used has been raised as an issue in quantitative data interpretation (12Thåstrom A. Lowary P.T. Widlund H.R. Cao H. Kubista M. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Fortunately, in contrast, archaeal nucleosome assembly in vitro occurs with only one archaeal histone and occurs spontaneously under almost all solution conditions, providing a much simpler alternative experimental system for parallel and comparative studies (18Sandman K. Grayling R.A. Reeve J.N. Bio/Technology. 1995; 3: 504-506Google Scholar, 19Reeve J.N. Sandman K. Daniels C.J.

The histone folds of archaeal histones and the eukaryotic nucleosome core histones are almost identical, but unlike their eukaryotic counterparts, archaeal histones do not have N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences extending from this fold (21Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Decanniere K. Babu A.M. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Archaeal nucleosomes resemble the structure formed by the (H3+H4)2 tetramer at the center of the eukaryotic nucleosome. Both contain a histone tetramer circumscribed by ∼85 bp of DNA but which makes direct histone fold contacts with only ∼60 bp of sequential DNA (1Luger K. Mader A. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar, 23Bailey K.A. Chow C.S. Reeve J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In both structures, the DNA can be wrapped in either a negative or positive toroidal supercoil (24Musgrave D.R.

Consistent with this homology, the DNA molecules selectively incorporated into archaeal nucleosomes by HMfB, the most extensively studied archaeal histone that originated from Methanothermus fervidus, have short A-tracts and an overabundance of AA (=TT), TA, and GC dinucleotides repeated at ∼10-bp intervals. The GC harmonic is displaced by ∼5 bp from the AA and TA harmonics, and therefore these molecules also have sequences that conform to repeats of the generic (A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN nucleosome positioning motif (30Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Widom J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, they also exhibit sequence complexity. In contrast to the overabundance of TA and GC repeats, repetitions of AT and CG were not highly selected, and almost all of the short A-tracts are located on the same DNA strand. The experiments reported here were undertaken to define and quantitate how HMfB homotetramers interact with DNA molecules designed to conform to the (A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN nucleosome positioning motif and with molecules selected experimentally by their preferential incorporation into archaeal nucleosomes. As predicted, the results obtained are consistent with these molecules being assembled into archaeal nucleosomes (29Pereira S.L. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 289: 675-681Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Widom J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with alternating A/T- and G/C-rich sequences positioned where the minor and major grooves, respectively, face the histone core. The importance of the TA dinucleotide has been directly established. In addition, we have uncovered an unanticipated interdependence of archaeal histone fold-DNA sequences in facilitating archaeal nucleosome assembly. M. fervidus also contains HMfA, a second archaeal histone with a primary sequence 84% identical to that of HMfB, and based on high resolution crystal structures HMfA and HMfB dimers have almost identical histone folds (22Decanniere K. Babu A.M. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Sandman K. Grayling R.A. Dobrinski B. Lurz R. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12624-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, HMfA does not bind similarly with high affinity to the DNA molecules selectively incorporated into archaeal nucleosomes in vitroby HMfB. Even more surprising, this difference in affinity is apparently determined by differences in the C-terminal region of α-helix 3, a region of the histone fold predicted to be buried within the nucleosome core with no direct contacts to the DNA (1Luger K.

A QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to change the sequences of codons 61–63 of hmfA andhmfB, cloned in the expression plasmids pKS395 and pKS323, from GAATTAGCT and GAACTAGCA to GAGCTAGCT and GAGCTAGCA, introducing an NheI site (GCTAGC) into both genes without changing the encoded amino acid sequence (ELA) and generating plasmids pKS597 and pKS600. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-CTAGCACGAAAAATGTTCAAATAAGATCTA and 3′-GTGCTTTTTACAAGTTTATTCTAGATTCGA and 5′-CTAGCAGTTCGAAGATTTAAGAAATA and 3′-GTCAAGCTTCTAAATTCTTTATTCGA, were annealed to obtain ds1 DNA molecules with single-stranded NheI and HindIII half-site extensions that encoded the residues of HMfA and HMfB C-terminal to residue 62. Aliquots of pKS597 and pKS600 plasmid DNA were digested with NheI plus HindIII, and ligation with the DNA molecule encoding the appropriate C-terminal sequence resulted in plasmids pKS603 and pKS604. These plasmids were transformed intoE. coli JM105, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (400 μm) was added to exponentially growing cultures of the transformants to induce the synthesis of HMfA/B-α3 and HMfB/A-α3. These proteins were purified, quantitated, and their CD spectra measured using an AVIV model 62A-DA spectropolarimeter (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) as previously described for HMfA and HMfB (33Sandman K.

Archaeal histone molar solution concentrations are cited in terms of dimers, and the apparent K d values reported for archaeal nucleosome assembly are given in terms of histone tetramers. Plasmid pMM201 and pMM301 preparations (36Shimizu M. Miyake M. Kanke F. Matsumoto U. Shindo H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were purified from 1-liter cultures of E. coli DH5α using Qiagen maxiprep kits (Valencia, CA) and digested with EcoRI plus PstI. The products were labeled at the EcoRI half-sites using [γ-32P]ATP in exchange reactions catalyzed by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) (37Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar) and separated by electrophoresis through 8% T, 0.11% C polyacryamide gels run at 8 V/cm in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8). EcoRI plus PstI digestion released 159-bp and 173-bp molecules, designated MM201 and MM301, from pMM201 and pMM301, respectively, which were located in the wet gel by autoradiography. The regions of the gel that contained these molecules were excised, crushed, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 0.5m ammonium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The gel fragments were removed by centrifugation, and the eluted DNA was precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of 2 volumes of 95% ethanol, ethanol-washed and re-dissolved in TE (10 mmTris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Preparations of plasmid pLITMUS28 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were purified from E. coli DH5α using Qiagen maxiprep kits and digested withBssHII plus Acc65I. This released a molecule with a 93-bp ds region from the polylinker region (designated Litmus28) that was 32P-labeled at the BssHII half-site using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, gel-purified, and used as a control DNA that lacked TTTAAAGCCG sequences. Aliquots (1 μm) of oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-CTTCGTGGATCCC(TTTAAAGCCG)nTGCAGGAATTCCTCG, where n was 2, 4, and 6 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), were converted to ds DNA by primer extension in re- action mixtures that contained 13 μm of a primer (5′-CGAGGAATTCCTGCAG), 20 μm dNTPs, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8). These reaction mixtures were placed at 95 °C for 2 min, 47 °C for 2 min, and 37 °C for 5 min before 3 units of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) were added, and incubation was con- tinued for 30 min at 37 °C. The ds DNA molecules generated were digested with BamHI plus EcoRI, and after gel purification, the products were ligated with BamHI plusEcoRI-digested pLITMUS28 and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Plasmids designated pTA2, pTA4, and pTA6 were isolated from ampicillin-resistant transformants, sequenced to confirm the constructions, and then digested with BssHII plusAvrII, BssHII plus AatII, andBssHII plus BamHI, respectively, to generate molecules with ds regions of 93 bp, 93 bp, and 89 bp that contained (TTTAAAGCCG)2, (TTTAAAGCCG)4, and (TTTAAAGCCG)6 located at the same position within the pLITMUS28 polylinker (see Fig. 2 A). These molecules were32P-labeled at the BssHII half-site using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and gel-purified. Aliquots of oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-CTTCGTGGATCCC(X)4TGCAGGAATTCCTCG, where X was TTTGAAGCCG, TTGCAAGCCG, AAATTTGCCG, or TATAAACGCC, were converted to ds DNA molecules and cloned into E. coli DH5α, generating plasmids designated pTG, pGC, pAT, and pTAT respectively, as described above for the construction of pTA. These plasmids were di- gested with BssHII plus AatII to obtain molecules with 93-bp ds regions with (TTTGAAGCCG)4, (TTGCAAGCCG)4, (AAATTTGCCG)4, or (TATAAACGCC)4 positioned identically within the pLITMUS28 polylinker. These molecules were 32P-labeled at the BssHII half-site and gel-purified. Some DNA molecules used in gel-shift assays and all of the DNA molecules used for rotational and translational positioning studies were generated by PCR-amplification from plasmid template DNA usingTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). These molecules were end-labeled by the incorporation of one 32P-5′-end-labeled primer and/or labeled internally by the incorporation of [α-32P]dATP during the extension reactions.32P-labeled molecules (111 bp) containing (TTTAAAGCCG)4, (TTTGAAGCCG)4, (TTGCAAGCCG)4, (AAATTTGCCG)4, and (TATAAACGCC)4 were amplified from pTA, pTG, pGC, pAT, and pTAT, respectively, using primers with the sequences 5′-CATCGCGCGCACCGTACGTCTCG and 5′-CGGTGACGTCAGGATGGGAAGCT, and the32P-labeled LITMUS28 fragment was amplified from pLITMUS28 using primers with the sequences 5′-GATCTTCGAATGCATCGCGCGC and 5′-CCAGAGCTCACCTAGGTATCTAG. 32P-labeled clone 1 and 20 DNAs (110 bp) were amplified using primers 25L and 25R from plasmid clone 1 and 20 DNAs as previously described (30Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Widom J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mixtures (15 μl) of 100 ng of EcoRI-linearized pBR322 DNA and increasing amounts of the archaeal histone were incubated for 25 min at 25 °C in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl. Gel loading buffer (5 μl of 40% sucrose, 0.25% bromphenol blue) was added, and the products were separated by electrophoresis at 0.7 V/cm through an 0.8% agarose gel (Agarose I, Amresco, Euclid, OH) run in 40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (18Sandman K. Grayling R.A. Reeve J.N. Bio/Technology. 1995; 3: 504-506Google Scholar,33Sandman K. Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Soares D. Li W-T. Reeve J.N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mixtures (10 μl) of 0.1 ng of the 32P-labeled experimental DNA and 1 or 25 ng of sss DNA were incubated with increasing amounts of the archaeal histone for 25 min at 25 °C in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8). Gel loading buffer (5 μl) was added, and the products were separated by electrophoresis through 8% T, 0.11% C polyacrylamide gels run in TBE buffer at 8 V/cm (33Sandman K. Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Soares D. Li W-T. Reeve J.N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and used to generate autoradiograms. Radioactively labeled products were quantitated by laser-scanning densitometry of the autoradiogram (Biomed Instruments Inc., Chicago, IL) and directly by β-decay measurements using a Packard Instant Imager. Archaeal histone and the 32P-labeled (TTTAAAGCCG)4-containing DNA were mixed at a molar ratio of ∼5:1 and incubated in 100 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.8) for 25 min at 37 °C. MN (Sigma) was added (final concentration of 0.005 unit/μg DNA), and incubation continued at 37 °C (33Sandman K. Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Soares D. Li W-T. Reeve J.N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Aliquots (1 μl) were removed at increasing time intervals and mixed with 2 μl of 100 mm EDTA to terminate the MN digestion. DNA molecules that remained were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, dissolved in TE, and separated by electrophoresis through 12% T, 0.16% C polyacrylamide gels run at 9 V/cm in TBE. The region of the gel that contained the ∼60-bp MN-protected DNA molecule was located by autoradiography and excised, and the DNA was eluted and purified as described above. Aliquots were subjected toBamHI, BssHII, EcoRI,HindIII, NcoI, and XbaI digestions. The digestion products were mixed with an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, pH 8) and separated by electrophoresis at 50 V/cm through 10% T, 0.52% C polyacrylamide gels that contained 8.3 m urea run in 0.5× TBE. The gels were fixed by immersion in a solution containing 10% (w/v) acetic acid and 10% (v/v) methanol, dried, and used to expose x-ray films. The percentage of the population of the ∼60-bp molecules cleaved by each restriction enzyme was determined by laser-scanning densitometry of the resulting autoradiograms. Archaeal nucleosomes (assembled by incubation of 250 ng of HMfA or HMfB with 100 ng of the (TTTAAAGCCG)4-containing DNA, clone 1 or 20 DNA at 25 °C for 20 min) were exposed to 10 μmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 20 μm EDTA, 0.9 mm ascorbate, 0.03% H2O2 for 2 min at 25 °C. One strand of the DNA molecule was labeled by PCR amplification using one32P-5′-end-labeled primer, and each experiment was repeated with the second DNA strand similarly end-labeled by32P-primer incorporation. Hydroxyl cleavage reactions were terminated by the addition of thiourea (200 mm final concentration), and after electrophoresis through 8% T, 0.11% C polyacrylamide gels run at 8 V/cm in TBE, the hydroxyl radical-treated complexes were located by autoradiography. The regions of the gel that contained these complexes were excised, crushed, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Gel fragments were removed by centrifugation, and the eluted DNA molecules were precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of 2 volumes of 95% ethanol, ethanol-washed and re-dissolved in formamide gel loading buffer. After heating to 95 °C for 1 min, these molecules were separated by electrophoresis at 50 V/cm through 10% T, 0.52% C polyacrylamide gels that contained 8.3 m urea run in TBE. The gels were fixed by immersion in 10% (w/v) acetic acid, 10% (v/v) methanol, dried, and used to expose x-ray films resulting in autoradiograms from which band intensity profiles were obtained by laser-scanning densitometry. Archaeal nucleosomes, like eukaryotic nucleosomes, were shown previously by electron microscopy to assemble preferentially at sites on DNA molecules that were intrinsically curved (38Howard M.T. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Griffith J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7864-7867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To pursue this observation, a comparison was made of archaeal nucleosome assembly on two DNA molecules, designated MM201 and MM301 (36Shimizu M. Miyake M. Kanke F. Matsumoto U. Shindo H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which contained similar repetitive sequences, (AAATTTGCCG)12 and (TTTAAAGCCG)11, respectively, but have very different intrinsic curvatures. The sequences of both molecules conform to the [(A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN]n nucleosome positioning motif, but MM201 is very highly curved whereas MM301 is only slightly curved (36Shimizu M. Miyake M. Kanke F. Matsumoto U. Shindo H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As expected for a highly curved molecule, MM201 had a very anomalous electrophoretic mobility, whereas MM301 had only a slightly anomalous mobility (Fig.1), but HMfB assembled preferentially into archaeal nucleosome on MM301. Under HMfB-limited conditions, only MM301 molecules were incorporated into archaeal nucleosomes in reaction mixtures that contained an equimolar mixture of MM201 and MM301 (Fig.1, lane 3). Intrinsic DNA curvature alone did not therefore equate to preferential assembly into an archaeal nucleosome, and as observed for eukaryotic nucleosomes (7Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2050726525,"ATP-dependent DNA ligases, NAD(+)-dependent DNA ligases, and GTP-dependent RNA capping enzymes are members of a covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily defined by a common fold and a set of conserved peptide motifs. Here we examined the role of nucleotidyl transferase motif V ((184)LLKMKQFKDAEAT(196)) in the nick joining reaction of Chlorella virus DNA ligase, an exemplary ATP-dependent enzyme. We found that alanine substitutions at Lys(186), Lys(188), Asp(192), and Glu(194) reduced ligase specific activity by at least an order of magnitude, whereas substitutions at Lys(191) and Thr(196) were benign. The K186A, D192A, and E194A changes had no effect on the rate of single-turnover nick joining by preformed ligase-adenylate but affected subsequent rounds of nick joining at the ligase adenylation step. Conservative substitutions K186R, D192E, and E194D partially restored activity, whereas K186Q, D192N, and E194Q substitutions did not. Alanine mutation of Lys(188) elicited distinctive catalytic defects, whereby single-turnover nick joining by K188A-adenylate was slowed by an order of magnitude, and high levels of the DNA-adenylate intermediate accumulated. The rate of phosphodiester bond formation at a pre-adenylated nick (step 3 of the ligation pathway) was slowed by the K188A change. Replacement of Lys(188) by arginine reversed the step 3 arrest, whereas glutamine substitution was ineffective. Gel-shift analysis showed that the Lys(188) mutants bound stably to DNA-adenylate. We infer that Lys(188) is involved in the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation."

To date, six mammalian TRAF genes and three Drosophila homologs have been described (2Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B.

All TRAF proteins, except TRAF1, are composed of an N-terminal RING finger domain, several repeats of the zinc finger motif, the TRAF-N domain with a coiled-coil structure, and the TRAF-C domain (2Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 3Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). TRAF1 lacks the RING finger and contains only one zinc finger (3Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). TRAF4 is also distinct from other TRAFs in that it possesses nuclear localization signals (5Regnier C.H.

The TRAF domain mediates the homo- and heteroassociation between TRAF proteins and the interaction of TRAF proteins with the cytoplasmic domain of TNFR family members such as TNFR2, CD40, CD30, and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK). The interaction of a TRAF and a receptor appears to be trimeric in nature, since crystal structure studies revealed a homotrimer of tumor necrosis factor (6Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P. Nature. 1989; 338: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) that induces receptor cross-linking and trimerization (7Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C.

TRAF2 binds TNFR-associated death domain protein, which interacts with TNFR1 (10Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar), and TRAF6 interacts with interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinase, which is recruited to the Toll/IL-1R family receptor complexes through MyD88 (11Cao Z.

Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Other intracellular adaptor proteins have also been shown to interact with TRAF proteins and regulate the function of TRAF proteins. Among these adaptor proteins are TANK/I-TRAF, c-IAPs, TRIP, and A20 (3Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The cytokine-induced zinc finger protein A20 has been shown to bind the TRAF domain of TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF6 and to inhibit the NF-κB activation by TRAF2 and TRAF6 (13Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 14Heyninck K. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of TRAF proteins seems to have effector functions. The regulation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is the most extensively studied function of TRAF proteins. Overexpression of TRAF2, TRAF5, or TRAF6 has been shown to induce the activation of NF-κB and JNK (15Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and oligomerization of only the N-terminal portion of TRAF2 and TRAF6 has been demonstrated to be sufficient to induce the response (16Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The TRAF-induced NF-κB activation is believed to occur by sequential processes of the activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase, which induces activation of IκB kinase, phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, and nuclear translocation of liberated active NF-κB (17May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). For the activation of JNK, other serine/threonine kinases (apoptosis-inducing kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase, and transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase 1) have been reported to channel the TRAF signal to SEK1 and MKK7, the upstream activating kinases of JNK (3Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The in vivo function of some TRAF proteins has been demonstrated by knock-out mouse studies. TRAF6-deficient mice generated independently by two research groups displayed severe osteopetrosis caused by impaired activity of osteoclasts, cells primarily involved in bone resorption (18Naito A. Azuma S. Tanaka S. Miyazaki T. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.

Naito et al. demonstrated that the differentiation of osteoclasts by the well known osteoclastogenesis factor RANK ligand (RANKL; also called ODF, OPGL, and TRANCE) is blocked in cells derived from TRAF6−/− mice, underlining the essential role of TRAF6 for RANK signaling in vivo (18Naito A.

In support of this result, several in vitro studies showed binding of TRAF6 to RANK and involvement of TRAF6 in the RANK-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK (20Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 21Kim H.-H. Lee D.E. Shin J.N. Lee Y.S. Jeon Y.M. Chung C.H. Ni J. Kwon B.S.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1536-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The importance of TRAF6 in signaling of IL-1, CD40, and lipopolysaccharide was also demonstrated with TRAF6−/− cells (19Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. van der Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of TRAF6 in signaling of RANK and other TNFR and IL-1R/Toll family proteins, we sought to find new molecules that bind TRAF6 and possibly work as new downstream targets or regulators of TRAF6. Since the N-terminal region of TRAF6, which does not contain any catalytic activity, is sufficient for its effector functions (16Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this part might mediate protein-protein interactions with potential downstream targets and regulators of TRAF6 function. Therefore, we used the N-terminal part of human TRAF6 as a bait for the yeast two-hybrid screening. A novel protein containing several repeats of a zinc finger motif was found to bind TRAF6. Transfection of the gene encoding this protein suppressed the NF-κB and JNK activation by TRAF6 and the RANK-dependent signaling, leading to our nomenclature TIZ, for TRAF6-inhibitory zinc finger protein. TIZ expression was found to change during differentiation of osteoclasts from peripheral blood monocytes, and transfection of TIZ into the monocyte/macrophage cell line Raw264.7 resulted in a decrease in formation of multinuclear osteoclast-like cells in response to RANKL. The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To construct the bait vector, DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–274 of human TRAF6 were amplified by PCR with the forward primer 5′-CGGAATTCAGTCTGCTAAACTGTGAA-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCGGCCAACATTCTCATGTGT-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and cloned into pGBT9 using EcoRI andBamHI restriction sites. The bait vector and human HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library DNAs were sequentially transformed into theSaccharomyces cerevisiae yeast reporter strain Y190 and cultured on SD/Leu−/Trp−/His−plates containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.His + transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity by the colony-lift filter assay with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Plasmids were rescued fromHis +/LacZ + yeast transformants and sequenced in our laboratory using an automatic sequencer (ABI PRISM 310) or at Korea Basic Science Institute (Gwangju, Korea). The interaction of the two-hybrid proteins was retested by cotransformation of the prey and bait plasmids into Y190 followed by both the filter and liquid β-galactosidase assays.o-Nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside was used for the liquid assays. The 5′ and 3′ portions of TIZ cDNA was obtained from human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR methods using a RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The gene-specific primers 5′-GTTAACAGCTTTTTCACATTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGCCAGAGCAGAACATAAAAGAT-3′ were used for the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE, respectively. The full-length fragment was PCR-amplified from human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA and subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 100 ng of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and amplified by PCR. For TIZ expression analyses of samples from various human cells and tissues, a forward primer (5′-GTGAATGAACCCCCAGTAATGTG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-TGTTTAGTAAGCTTTGAAGATTGG-3′) were used. The expected size of the PCR product is 443 bp. For PBMC samples, a forward primer (5′-CATTCTGGAGAGATACCCTACAAG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GTCACATCTCTCACATTCATAGGG-3′) were used. The expected size is 207 bp. The forward and reverse primers for β-actin were 5′-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3′ and 5′-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3′, respectively. The PCR products were separated on 2.0% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The full-length cDNA of TRAF6 was subcloned into the pM vector downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain sequences, and TIZ cDNA was cloned into pVP16 containing the VP16 transcription activation domain. The pM-TRAF6 and pVP16-TIZ plasmids along with the GAL4/Tx-luc reporter vector were transfected into 293-EBNA cells, and luciferase assays were performed as described below. Cells seeded at 1 × 105/well in 24-well plates were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 50–100 ng of pAP1-Luc or pNF-κB-Luc and the indicated amounts of various constructs were used, and the total amounts of DNA were kept constant by supplementing with control vector DNAs. 16–20 h after transfection, cells were lysed with 150 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 20 μl of lysates were used for detection of luciferase activity with a luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Wilbad, Germany). The partial cDNA of TIZ (74-2) was subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for bacterial GST fusion protein expression. The transformedEscherichia coli culture was stimulated with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 2 h, and the whole cell lysate was obtained by sonication. The GST proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. 2 μg of purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with lysates of transfected 293-EBNA cells and 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were extensively washed in the lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting as described below. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as described (21Kim H.-H. Lee D.E. Shin J.N. Lee Y.S. Jeon Y.M. Chung C.H. Ni J. Kwon B.S. Lee Z.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min on ice and scraped into microcentrifuge tubes. The whole cell extracts were vigorously pipetted in and out, sonicated for 5 min with a setting of 2-s pulse and 7-s rest at 50% amplification (Vibra Cell, Sonics & Materials, Danbury, CT), and then microcentrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 ×g. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), and 10–20 μg of cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.) or anti-TRAF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were mixed with 2 μl of anti-TRAF6 and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times in the lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting. The full-length hTIZ and TRAF6 were subcloned into the pDsRed1-C1 and pEGFP-C2 vectors (CLONTECH), respectively. COS-7 cells were transfected with pDsRed1-C1-TIZ and pEGFP-C2-TRAF6 using Superfect (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instruction. 24 h after transfection, confocal microscopy was performed with Carl Zeiss Axiovert 135 m microscope and LSM410 at Korea Basic Science Institute (Daejeon, Korea). 293-EBNA cells were plated into six-well plates (8 × 105/well). The next day, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pEBG-JNK and 2 μg of other indicated DNAs plus 8 μl of SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). The total amounts of DNA were kept constant by adding control vector DNAs. 20–36 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared as described above. 300 μg of cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitated beads were extensively washed and subjected to kinase reactions as previously described (23Kim H.-H. Tharayil M. Rudd C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 296-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) except omitting radioactive ATP and detecting the phosphorylated c-Jun substrate by Western blotting with anti-phospho-c-Jun (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and scraped into a microcentrifuge tube. Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.1% and cells were incubated for 15 min with occasional agitation. After microfugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min, the pellet was lysed in 15 μl of a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min on ice. 75 μl of storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) was added, agitated for 10 s by vortexing, and then microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured with the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). The NF-κB binding site oligomer 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was random labeled with [α-32P]ATP and Klenow enzyme. 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with ∼20,000 cpm of probe in 20 μl of the reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) for 30 min at 20 °C. The DNA-bound NF-κB proteins were subjected to 4–5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses followed by autoradiography. Differentiation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was carried out as previously described (24Matsuzaki K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yamaguchi K. Yasuda H. Shima N. Morinaga T.

Findlay D.M. Iitaka M. Katayama S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood was obtained from healthy volunteers and mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque 1077; Sigma) for 30 min at 900 × g. The recovered PBMC were washed and suspended in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 48-well plates for the observation of cell morphology and at 7 × 106 cells/well in six-well plates for RNA preparation and were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The next day, incubation with 50 ng/ml RANKL (Peprotech EC, London, UK) and 100 ng/ml M-CSF (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was started. The RANKL/M-CSF treatment was continued for 14 days, with half of the medium being changed every 3–4 days. Cells at 0, 5, 10, and 14 days of treatment were photographed or harvested for RT-PCR analyses. Raw264.7 cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS, seeded at 4 × 104/well in 24-well plates, and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with the mixture of 1 μg of plasmid, 3 μl of TfxTM-50 reagent (Promega), and 200 μl of serum-free medium. After a 1-h incubation, 800 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS were added, and cells were cultured for another day. The medium was then changed to α-MEM plus 10% FBS containing 50 ng/ml RANKL. After 3 days of culture, the medium was replenished, and the culture was continued. The next day, cells were washed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase Assay Kit (Sigma). To find a new molecule that binds TRAF6, the yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out. Since the N-terminal region of TRAF6 has been suggested to be sufficient for the effector functions of TRAF6 (16Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this part might interact with potential downstream targets and regulators of TRAF6 function. Therefore, we used the N-terminal 274 amino acid residues, encompassing the Ring and zinc finger domains, of human TRAF6 as the bait. When a HeLa cell cDNA library was screened, 14 positive clones were obtained. One clone (74-2; encodes amino acids 95–213 of TIZ) showed the strongest binding on filter and liquid β-galactosidase assays. The yeast two-hybrid interaction of the 74-2 clone with TRAF6 was specific, since this clone did not interact with TRAF2, TRAF3, and a non-TRAF family protein, let alone the control GAL4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 1 A). Full-length cDNA was cloned by RACE PCR from human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA. The nucleotide sequence comparison by BLAST searches did not reveal any sequences that can be considered identical to this gene. This novel gene was named TIZ, and its sequence information was deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AY044432). Cloning of a partial cDNA for mouseTIZ, which corresponds nucleotides 879–1733 of humanTIZ and shows 99.6% identity to human TIZ (data not shown), further suggests that TIZ is a new gene. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed a region homologous to the (Krüppel-associated box) (KRAB) domain at the N terminus (amino acids 4–75) and 14 repeats of the C2H2 type zinc finger motif at the C-terminal region (amino acids 174–558) (Fig.1 B). Among the 14 zinc finger repeats, 10 have authentic CX 2CX 12HX 3H sequences, whereas four had variations in the histidine residues. The amino acid sequences of TIZ showed the highest homology to human zinc finger protein 85 (82% homology by the ClustalW program). The relative closeness of TIZ to other zinc finger proteins analyzed using the ClustalW algorithm is shown in Fig. 1 C. TIZ showed very low sequence identity (less than 15%) to the zinc finger proteins A20, Cezanne, and TRABID, which were previously reported to bind TRAF proteins. RT-PCR analyses showed expression of TIZ in various human cell types and tissues (Fig. 1 D). No apparent induction of TIZ expression contingent to tumorigenesis was detected in an examination of three cancers and their control normal tissues (Fig.1 D, lane 6 versus lane 7, lane 9 versus lane 10, and lane 11 versus lane 12). The result of yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 A) suggested specific interaction of TIZ with TRAF6 in yeast. To directly assess the binding capability of TIZ to TRAF6, the TIZ partial cDNA from the yeast two-hybrid positive clone 74-2 was subcloned into a GST fusion vector. When the GST-TIZ and control GST proteins were incubated with lysates from 293-EBNA cells transfected with TRAF6 (Fig.2 A, lane 2) or the control (lane 1) expression plasmids, GST-TIZ specifically bound both the endogenous (lane 4) and transfected (lane 6) TRAF6 protein, while GST alone did not interact with TRAF6 (lanes 3 and 5). To confirm the interaction in mammalian cells, we performed the two-hybrid assay in 293-EBNA cells. Cotransfection of pM-TRAF6 encoding the full-length TRAF6 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and pVP16-TIZ encoding the conjugate of VP16 transactivation domain and TIZ greatly induced transcription of the reporter gene under the control of the Gal4-responsive element (Fig. 2 B). Coimmunoprecipitation of TIZ and TRAF6 also supported the interaction of these proteins in mammalian cells (Fig. 2 C). We next examined the intracellular distribution of TIZ and TRAF6. TIZ and TRAF6 were expressed as the red fluorescent protein and green fluorescent protein fusion proteins, respectively, in COS-7 cells, and the confocal microscopy was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 D, both TIZ and TRAF6 were detected in perinuclear cytoplasmic regions as dotlike structures. Weak signals of TIZ were also observed in the nucleus (Fig. 2 D, ii). When transfected into 293 cells, the nuclear signal was stronger (data not shown). The superimposition of the red and green channels revealed yellow signals in many, but not in all, locations, indicating colocalization of TIZ and TRAF6 in discrete intracellular regions (Fig. 2 D, iv). Two well characterized effects of TRAF6 signaling are the activation of NF-κB transcription factor and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). We investigated whether TIZ has effects on the signaling functions of TRAF6. Overexpression of TRAF6 in 293 cells has been reported to result in NF-κB activation (15Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Confirming previous reports, transient transfection of TRAF6 into 293-EBNA cells led to a great increase in the reporter luciferase activity under the control of NF-κB (Fig.3 A). Cotransfection of TIZ reduced the TRAF6-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). The inhibitory effect of TIZ was specific to TRAF6 as the NF-κB activation induced by TRAF2 and TRAF5 was not affected (Fig. 3 A). Whether the effect of TIZ on NF-κB activation was due to a reduced DNA binding of the transcription factor was assessed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The transfection of TRAF6 caused a retarded electrophoretic mobility of NF-κB binding element oligonucleotides in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3 D,lane 2), which was suppressed upon cotransfection of TIZ (Fig. 3 D, lane 4). This inhibition was not due to a reduction in TRAF6 expression, since comparable levels of TRAF6 were detected in Western blotting analyses (data not shown). We next examined whether TIZ can also regulate JNK activation by TRAF6. The kinase activity of JNK was stimulated by TRAF6 transfection (Fig. 3 D, lane 2). This TRAF6-induced JNK activation was attenuated by cotransfection of TIZ (Fig. 3 D, lane 4). JNK can phosphorylate and activate c-Jun that forms with other Jun and Fos family protein AP-1 transcription complexes (26Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of TIZ on AP-1 activation by the luciferase reporter assay. TRAF6 transfection into 293-EBNA cells increased the AP-1-responsive luciferase activity, and cotransfection of TIZ abrogated the TRAF6-induced AP-1 activation (Fig. 3 E). The inhibitory effects of TIZ on the TRAF6-induced activation of NF-κB, JNK, and AP-1 suggest that TIZ may play a role as a negative regulator of TRAF6. TRAF6 has been shown to be an important signaling component for RANK, a tumor necrosis factor receptor family protein essential for osteoclast differentiation (20Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A.

In fission yeast the stress-activated MAPK, Spc1, like the mammalian p38 kinase responds to a variety of stresses including osmotic stress, heat stress, oxidative stress, nutritional limitation, UV radiation, and DNA damage. Spc1 (also known as Sty1 or Phh1) is activated by the Wis1 MAPK kinase, which is in turn activated by two MAPK kinase kinases, Wak1 (also known as Wik1 and Wis4) or Win1 (7Toone W.M. Jones N.

Attenuation of Spc1 activity is accomplished by the actions of two tyrosine phosphatases, Pyp1 and Pyp2 (11Miller J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G.

The completion of the fission yeast genome sequencing project has revealed the existence of a large number of open reading frames (ORFs) of no known function or apparent homologues. To provide information regarding the localization of some of these gene products in the cell, we have developed a GFP random insertional mutagenesis system (17Chua G. Taricani L. Stangle W. Young P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 138: E53Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This system utilizes GFP-ura4+ PCR-generated cassettes randomly integrated into the genome. GFP in-frame fusion integrants are expressed under the control of native promoters allowing us to examine expression levels and intracellular localization of their protein products under a variety of growth conditions. The affected genes from cells displaying specific intracellular GFP localizations are isolated by inverse PCR and are sequenced (17Chua G. Taricani L. Stangle W. Young P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 138: E53Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To search for novel genes expressed in stationary phase, we screened for GFP in-frame fusions that had increased expression under glucose limiting conditions. We report the isolation of a novel stress protein named Ish1+ (induced in stationary phase) localized to the nuclear envelope and the plasma membrane. Ish1 expression is elevated in response to a number of environmental stimuli including glucose starvation and osmotic stress and is regulated by the Spc1 MAPK pathway through Atf1. We also report the isolation of a novel nuclear protein, Bis1 (binds toish1), isolated by two-hybrid screening, and we show that it specifically interacts with Ish1 in vivo. Bis1 is the fission yeast homologue of the strongly conserved ES2 family of proteins known from Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, andCaenorhabditis elegans. They are of unknown function although we show that both ish1 and bis1contribute to viability in stationary phase.

The ish1 gene was PCR-amplified using High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with genomic DNA as template and primers sporf9 and sporf12 (TableII). The 2052-bp fragment was cloned into pREP1 under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt1promoter (22Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K.

Open table in a new tab pREP1-GFP was constructed by removing the NdeI restriction site residing in the GFP(S65T) open reading frame using a silent mutation created by overlap extension PCR (24Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The resulting fragment with BamHI and XmaI sites added by PCR was subcloned into pREP1. The ish1 ORF was PCR-amplified using primers sporf9 and sporf10 (Table II) that incorporated AseI andSalI restriction sites, and the product was cloned into pREP1-GFP, resulting in pREP-ish1-GFP and is referred to as pLT1-2. pLT1-2 was digested with BglII and BamHI to excise a fragment encoding Ish1 amino acids 581–684. The remaining vector backbone was gel-purified and then self-ligated to create pREP1-ish1ΔC104-GFP and is referred to as pLT1-3. An N-terminal deletion of Ish1 comprising amino acids 279–684 was made using primers sporf11 and sporf10 (Table II) that incorporateNdeI and SalI restriction sites. The productΔN278ish1 was then cloned into pREP1-GFP to create pREP1-ΔN278ish1-GFP and is referred to as pLT1-4. The entire ish1 gene from −351 to +2052 bp was PCR-amplified using primers sporf5 with sporf12 or sporf10 (Table II) incorporating PstI and SalI restriction sites. pREP1 was digested with PstI andSalI to excise the 1200-bp fragment encoding thenmt1 promoter sequence. The ish1 PCR products were cloned into the gel-purified vector backbones pREP1 or pREP1-GFP to create pLT2-1 or pLT2-2, respectively. PCR-based gene targeting (25Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1080-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was used to replace a 1934-bp fragment of the ish1coding region with the ura4+ gene leaving 118 bp of the C-terminal ORF of ish1 (Fig.1 A). The PCR primers used, sporf1 and sporf2 (Table II), included 80 bp of flanking sequence homologous to the ish1 sequence in the genome. Gene replacement was confirmed by PCR using primers sporf3 and sporf4 (TableII) and Southern blot analysis. Sporulation of the diploid and extensive out-crossing (6 times) was performed to ensure that no background mutations were present. Bis1 was identified as a two-hybrid target interacting with Ish1. The bis1 gene from −254 to +1330 base pairs relative to the 1154-bp ORF was PCR-amplified using primers lanko1 and lanko2 (Table II) with High FidelityTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) to create pGEM-T-bis1. pGEM-T-bis1 was digested withXbaI, and the ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and then the plasmid was digested withClaI. The ura4+ gene was excised from pZA25 using SmaI and ClaI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the XbaI (blunt-ended)/ClaI site of pGEM-T-bis1 to generate pGEM-T-bis1::ura4+ . Thebis1::ura4+ cassette in this recombinant vector was then PCR-amplified using High FidelityTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used to replace bis1 in a haploid strain (ura4-D18 h− ) by one-step gene disruption (20Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). Stable ura4+ haploids were selected, and exact gene replacement was confirmed by PCR. The strain was out-crossed extensively to ensure that no background mutations were present. The bis1 ORF was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using primers lan1 and lan2 or lan1 and lan3 (Table II), incorporating NdeI and SalI restriction sites, with High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR products were cloned into pREP2 or pREP2-YFP containing the ura4-selectable marker (23Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), resulting in pREP2-bis1 and pREP2-bis1-YFPreferred to as pLT3-1 and pLT3-2, respectively. pLT3-1 and pLT3-2 were transformed into cells, and positive transformants were selected in the presence of 15 μm thiamine. The YFP gene from pEYFP (Invitrogen) was excised from the vector by digesting with EcoRI and blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The pREP2 vector was digested withSalI, and the blunt-ended YFP fragment was cloned into the SalI/SmaI sites of pREP2 to create pREP2-YFP. The full-length GST-Bis1 protein fusion was degraded in Escherichia coli.Therefore, a 354-bp fragment encoding amino acids 267–384 of the C-terminal region of bis1 was fused to the C terminus of GST in pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Expression was induced in E. coli with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 1 h because this fusion protein was also rapidly degraded by proteases. The GST-Bis1 fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-agarose column and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as described in the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Biosciences). To generate polyclonal antibodies against Bis1, the GST-Bis1 fragment was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, excised, eluted, and mixed with Titer Max Gold Adjuvant (Cedarlane) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The rabbit was boosted at day 28 and day 40. Serum was collected on day 50 and used as a source of antibody for Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence experiments. A Leica fluorescence microscope equipped with a high performance CCD camera (Sensicam) and Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging System) was used for all imaging. Cells were collected onto Whatman 934-AH glass microfiber filters (Fisher) and fixed with 100% ice-cold methanol at −20 °C for 20 min. The immunofluorescence protocol used is described in Sawin and Nurse (28Sawin K.E. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 97: 509-516Google Scholar). Rabbit GST-Bis1 polyclonal antiserum generated in the lab (1:5000) was used with AlexaTM 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugate (1:250) (Molecular Probes). Stained cells were counterstained with 1 μg/ml DAPI. Protein extracts (29Rhind N. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3782-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (20 μg or 50 μg, Bio-Rad protein assay) were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and detected by polyclonal anti-GST-Bis1 antibody or monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1000) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoreactive bands were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000) and the luminol-based ECL detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein loading was monitored by Coomassie Blue staining of gels. Harvested cells in HB buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 15 mmMgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100) (20Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar), supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), were broken by vortexing with glass beads and centrifuged to prepare a cleared whole-cell extract. Cell extracts (300 μg, Bio-Rad protein assay) were incubated with 10 μl of polyclonal anti-GST-Bis1 antibody in a 500-μl volume in HB buffer at 4 °C for 3 h, and 60 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively with HB buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, 25 μg of total protein was loaded for detection of proteins in the total yeast lysate; 10% of total immunoprecipitated material was loaded for detection of the immunoprecipitated protein, and 90% was loaded for detection of the coimmunoprecipitate. The proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Cells were grown to stationary phase in YEA or EMM medium, and incubation was continued for 6 days. A portion of each culture was removed at day 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 and plated on YEA or EMM after appropriate dilution to determine cell viability. Samples were taken in duplicate over a 6-day period, and the experiment was independently repeated two times. DNA encoding amino acids 34–684 of ish1 (ΔN33ish1) was PCR-amplified with primers ish1lexA1 and ish1lexA2 (Table II) incorporating BamHI and NotI restriction sites using High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The ΔN33ish1 ORF was fused to the 3′ end of the LexA DNA-binding domain in pEG202 (30Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) by cloning into theBamHI and NotI sites of pEG202 to construct pEG202-ΔN33ish1lexA. An S. pombe cDNA library (obtained from ATCC 87289) was screened (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid experiments were performed with Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain Y1003 (MAT a/MAT α URA3::lexAop-lacZ/8lexA-ADE2::URA3 ura3-1/ura3-1 leu2-2/leu2-3 his3-11/his3-11 trp1-1/trp1-1 ade2-1/ade2-1 can1-100/can1-100) (32Evangelista M. Blundell K. Longtine M.S. Chow C.J. Adams N. Pringle J.R. Peter M. Boone C. Science. 1997; 276: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Approximately 3,000,000 cDNA clones were screened against the Ish1 bait. DNA encoding amino acids 91–384 of bis1 was PCR-amplified with primers bis1lexA(ΔN90) and bis1lexA3 (Table II) with High Fidelity Taq polymerase incorporating BamHI andNotI restriction sites. pEG202-ΔN90bis1lexA was constructed as outlined above. Approximately 2,000,000 cDNA clones were screened using this bait. An insertional mutagenesis cassette containing GFP on the 5′ terminus was used to isolate in-frame insertional mutants that expressed GFP (17Chua G. Taricani L. Stangle W. Young P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 138: E53Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A GFP fusion, lt13-26, was isolated based on the localization of the GFP to the nuclear envelope and the plasma membrane under glucose starvation conditions. In zygotic asci the GFP localized only to the nuclear envelope (17Chua G. Taricani L. Stangle W. Young P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 138: E53Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GFP expression increased by ∼5-fold following glucose and nitrogen starvation as well as during hyper- and hypo-osmotic stress (data not shown).lt13-26 is expressed throughout the cell cycle in growing cultures (Fig. 2 A). Sequencing revealed that lt13-26 was a single copy chromosomal fusion with an 873-bp 3′-truncation of the ish1 gene and expression remaining under the control of the ish1 native promoter. Cells expressing lt13-26 were indistinguishable from wild type cells with respect to growth and morphology. We will refer to the original integrant, lt13-26, as ish1ΔC291-GFPfrom this point. The predicted full-length ish1 gene product was a 684-amino acid protein of unknown function and a calculated molecular mass of 76 kDa (GenBank™ accession number AL07867.1, locus SPBC365.12c). Computer searches revealed a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) motif from amino acids 227–285 and 366–452 (ProDom data base). LEA motif proteins are induced in plants by a variety of stresses including dessication, heat stress, and osmotic stress (33Dure III, L. Inclose T.J. Bray E.A. Plant Responses to Cellular Dehydration during Environmental Stress. American Society of Plant Physiology, Riverside, CA1993: 91-103Google Scholar, 34Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). The LEA motif has also been identified in LEA-1, F25H58.5, and K08H10.2, proteins of unknown function in C. elegans. Ish1 exhibits 21–23% overall identity to these proteins (Proteome data base). Additionally, searches revealed a similarity to the C terminus of S. pombeSPAC23C4.05c (identity = 44:159 (27%), positives = 74:159 (45%)) as well as the N terminus of S. cerevisiae probable membrane protein YML128c (also known as Gin3p or Msc1p) (35Thompson D.A. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1999; 153: 621-641PubMed Google Scholar) (identity = 46:362 (19%), positives = 87:362 (36%)). Ish1, SPAC23C4.05c, and YML128c have one putative transmembrane domain near their N termini. In the presence of thiamine to repress the nmt1 promoter, cells containingish1, ish1-GFP, ΔN278ish1-GFP, orish1ΔC104-GFP expression constructs displayed normal growth and morphology (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of thiamine, overexpression of ish1, ish1-GFP, andish1ΔC104-GFP was toxic, arresting cell proliferation (Fig. 2 B). Microscopic examination showed no obvious morphological changes, and arrest appears to be in G2 based on morphological criteria. Examination of the cells 15 h after induction showed similar localization of Ish1-GFP to that seen in the original integrant, ish1ΔC291-GFP (Fig.2 A). Overexpression of ΔN278ish1-GFP was not toxic. ΔN278Ish1-GFP appears to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that the N-terminal region is necessary for nuclear envelope and plasma membrane targeting and/or localization of Ish1. Deletion of the N-terminal sequence renders the protein incapable of normal localization thus sparing the toxic effects observed with the full-length protein. We speculate that Ish1 at high concentration somehow interferes with membrane function or the function of some protein in the membrane and that the observed toxicity is the result. Deletion of the N terminus of Ish1 renders the protein incapable of being correctly targeted, and the toxicity is thus not observed. Expression of ish1ΔC291-GFP is under the control of its native promoter; therefore, it was used to examine the expression of the Ish1 protein in various mutant backgrounds. Western blotting performed using a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody shows that Ish1ΔC291-GFP has a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa, whereas Ish1-GFP migrates at ∼120 kDa (Fig. 3,A and B). The other bands in the Western blot are the result of nonspecific binding of the GFP antibody, which are detected in wild type cells not expressing GFP. Ish1ΔC291-GFP expression was examined in a Δspc1 mutant strain to inactivate the MAPK pathway (14Kanoh J. Watanabe Y. Ohsugi M. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and in a Δpyp1mutant strain, an inhibitor of Spc1, to activate it (12Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Ish1ΔC291-GFP protein expression is almost undetectable in aΔspc1 mutant strain (Fig. 3 A). However, increased activity of Spc1 as occurs in a Δpyp1 mutant strain resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in Ish1 expression (Fig.3 A). Because expression and activity of Atf1 are regulated by Spc1 MAPK (13Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we examined Ish1 expression in a Δatf1 mutant background. There is no detectable level of Ish1 protein in theΔatf1 mutant background (Fig. 3 A) showing that Ish1 is regulated by the Spc1 MAPK pathway via Atf1. In a Δatf1 Δpyp1 mutant background, Ish1 is detectable but very low, suggesting that when Spc1 is hyperactivated a second transcription factor might make a small contribution. The response to osmotic stress occurs at least in part throughatf1 (13Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Under 1.2 m KCl stress, Ish1 expression in a Δpyp1 mutant background is similar to that in"

This study focuses on the structural characteristics of influenza virus protein NS2 (NEP), which interacts with the nuclear export machinery during viral replication, and has been proposed to act as an adapter molecule between the nuclear export machinery and the viral ribonucleoprotein complex. For this purpose, we have purified recombinant NS2 under nondenaturing conditions, and have investigated its structure and aggregation state using optical spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, as well as hydrodynamic techniques. Our results indicate that isolated NS2 exists as a monomer in solution, and adopts a compact, but very flexible conformation, which shows characteristics of the molten globule state under near physiological conditions. Proteolytic sensitivity suggests that, despite its overall plasticity, the structure of NS2 is heterogeneous. While the C terminus of the protein adopts a relatively rigid conformation, its N terminus, which is recognized by the nuclear export machinery, exists in a highly mobile and exposed state. It is proposed that the flexibility observed in the nuclear export domain of NS2 is an important element in the recognition of substrate proteins by the nuclear export machinery.

Active transport of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane is an important mechanism in the regulation of gene transcription and translation. Signal-mediated transport is typically initiated by soluble transport receptors that recognize cis-acting nuclear transport signals in their substrates and target their cargo to the nuclear pore complex. Translocation through the nuclear pore, release of substrate after transport, and directionality of the transport process are thought to be achieved mainly through action of the GTPase Ran and its regulatory factors (1Komeili A.

Virol. 1996; 40: 2743-2756Crossref Google Scholar), and is thought to catalyze the import of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) into the nucleus at early times after infection (9O'Neill R.E.

In addition, NP interacts with the nuclear export receptor Crm1 in vitro and has been proposed to achieve the nuclear export of progeny vRNPs during virion assembly (12Elton D. Simpson-Holley M. Archer K. Medcalf L. Hallam R. McCauley J. Digard P. J. Virol. 2000; 75: 408-419Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). M1 is also transported into the nucleus (13Ye J. Robinson D. Wagner R.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1964-1970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it associates with the vRNPs (14Martin K. Helenius A. Cell. 1991; 67: 117-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). While it has been shown to be essential for vRNP export (14Martin K. Helenius A.

Virol. 1996; 40: 2743-2756Crossref Google Scholar). The small protein NS2 is the latest influenza protein for which an interaction with the nuclear export machinery has been identified. NS2s of both type A and type B influenza viruses contain a HIV-1 Rev-like nuclear export signal (NES) at their N terminus that has been shown to interact with cellular nucleoporins in a yeast two-hybrid system, and that can mediate the nuclear export of heterologous proteins (18O'Neill R.E.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7375-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, full-length NS2, as well as peptides corresponding to the NS2 NES, can functionally replace the HIV-1 Rev effector domain (18O'Neill R.E. Talon J. Palese P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 19Paragas J. Talon J. O'Neill R.E. Anderson D.K. Garcia-Sastre A. Palese P. J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). As in case of Rev, the integrity of the NS2 NES is essential for nuclear export of the protein, but not for interaction of NS2 with the soluble export receptor Crm1 (19Paragas J. Talon J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6751-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the recognition of NS2 by the nuclear export machinery is currently the subject of intense discussion. NS2 was found to be essential for export of progeny vRNPs in some studies (18O'Neill R.E. Talon J. Palese P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Neumann G. Hughes M.T. Kawaoka Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6751-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and was also found indispensable for the generation of functional virus-like particles in a plasmid transfection system (19Paragas J.

Virol. 1999; 80: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, the C terminus of NS2 has been shown to interact with M1 bothin vivo and in vitro (26Yasuda J. Nakada S. Kato A. Toyoda T. Ishihama A. Virology. 1993; 196: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Ward A.C. Castelli L.A. Lucantoni A.C. White J.F. Azad A.A. Macreadie I.G. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 2067-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that NS2 mediates the export of vRNPs by acting as an adapter protein between the nuclear export machinery and the M1·vRNP complex (18O'Neill R.E. Talon J. Palese P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 19Paragas J. Talon J. O'Neill R.E. Anderson D.K. Garcia-Sastre A. Palese P. J.

Rev-like NESs, as found in NS2, are thought to be crucial for stabilization of the ternary RanGTP·NES·Crm1 complex that is responsible for export of transport substrates by this Crm1-dependent pathway (22Askjaer P. Jenson T.H. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). While the interactions involved in signal-mediated nuclear import have been the subject of intense study in recent years, the molecular processes involved in the assembly of this ternary export complex, as well as in the specific recognition of the export substrates by the nuclear transport machinery, remain ill defined. Structural studies of the nuclear export complex itself and of its principal constituents in solution will therefore provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the nuclear export process. This study focuses on the structural characteristics of NS2 that allow it to interact with its ligands. Our results indicate that the nuclear export domain of isolated NS2 exists in an exposed and highly flexible conformation in solution. The C terminus of the protein, in contrary, adopts a relatively rigid structure, but lacks a tightly packed hydrophobic core under near physiological conditions. It is proposed that the high degree of flexibility observed in the nuclear export domain of NS2 is associated with the recognition of substrate proteins by the nuclear export machinery. The NS2 cDNA of influenza strain InfA/PR/8/34 was subcloned into a pET21b expression vector (Novagen). This construct was designed to allow expression of a full-length version of NS2 that carried no tags or additional residues. The correct NS2 sequence in the resulting pET21bNS2 plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, pET21bNS2 was transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and the cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.8–1.0 at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. At this point, protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After incubation for 20 h at 18 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). The cells were broken by sonication using a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 rpm in a JA-20 rotor (Beckman). NS2 was captured by gel filtration on a Sephacryl-S300 26/60 HR column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate. The separation was performed using elution buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), and NS2 was found to elute as a single peak at about 239 ml as confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The NS2 containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a YM3 filter (Amicon). Further purification of NS2 was accomplished by gel filtration on a Sephadex-75 16/60 HR column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using elution buffer B (150 mmNaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Again, NS2 was found to form a single peak that eluted at about 78 ml, and the appropriate fractions were pooled and the buffer exchanged to 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, by ultrafiltration and dilution. Subsequently, NS2 was passed through a Hitrap SP column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and bound proteins were eluted with 1m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. While contaminant proteins were bound to the column, NS2 remained in the flow through. Protein quantitation was performed by absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 12,660 m−1cm−1 calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein (29Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11517) Google Scholar). Following purification, NS2 was dialyzed against protein storage buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), concentrated to about 1 mg/ml by ultrafiltration, and transferred to 4 °C. Further buffer exchange and protein concentration was accomplished by dialysis and ultrafiltration as necessary. Denaturing isoelectric focusing (IEF) of purified NS2 was performed using the PhastSystemTM automated electrophoresis system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). IEF was carried out utilizing a dry IEF PhastgelTM rehydrated with 6.25% PharmalyteTM4–6.5 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in 8 m urea, and protein detection was accomplished by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Before separation, NS2 samples were incubated for 2.5 h in protein storage buffer + 8 m urea. To assure completion of the focusing process, all samples were applied at both the cationic and the anionic end of the gel. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry of purified NS2 was performed at the UAB Mass Spectrometry Core Facility on a Voyager Elite matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) with delayed extraction. Internal calibration with reference proteins thioredoxin (11674.5 Da) and apomyoglobin (16952.5 Da) was used for molecular mass determination. For N-terminal sequencing, NS2 was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidiene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and Automatic Edman degradation (6 cycles) of the NS2 band was carried out at the UAB Protein Sequencing Core Facility using a Model PI 2090E (Beckman) sequencer. Near ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy of NS2 was performed on 0.5 mg/ml NS2 in protein storage buffer using a 1-cm cell. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C utilizing a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer, and the NS2 UV absorbance spectra were corrected by subtraction of the buffer baseline. The ability of recombinant NS2 to associate with influenza virus matrix protein M1 of both viral and bacterial origin was assayed by far-Western blot similar as described in Ref. 26Yasuda J. Nakada S. Kato A. Toyoda T. Ishihama A. Virology. 1993; 196: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar. Briefly, purified InfA/PR/8/34 virus was prepared as described in Ref. 30Sha B. Luo M. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. Recombinant, hexahistidine-tagged InfA/PR/8/34 M1 protein was produced in E. coli using the pET21b expression vector. Protein expression was accomplished by growing BL21(DE3)pET21b M1 cells for 16 h at 37 °C in the absence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Subsequently, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, and lysed by sonication as described above. Purification of M1 was achieved by incubation of the cell lysate supernatant with chelating Sepharose (Amersham Bioscience Inc.), and elution was performed according to the manufacturers instructions. Detection of M1 bound NS2 was accomplished utilizing monospecific, mouse anti-NS2 antibodies that had been raised against a hexahistidine-tagged, affinity-purified version of bacterially expressed NS2. 2B. S. Lommer, J. F. Kearney, and M. Luo, unpublished results. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation of NS2 was performed at the UAB Analytical Ultracentrifuge Analysis Facility on a Beckman XL-A Analytical Ultracentrifuge using an AN-60 Ti rotor (Beckman). NS2 samples at a concentration of 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 mg/ml NS2 in protein storage buffer were stored for 1 week at 4 °C before analysis. Subsequently, double sector cells were loaded with 120 μl of protein sample or protein storage buffer, respectively, and sedimentation equilibrium data were obtained at 29,000, 34,000, and 48,000 rpm at 20 °C. Protein detection was carried out by absorbance at 280 nm after equilibrium was reached. The equilibrium data was edited by deletion of absorbance changes at the protein and reference meniscus interface. In addition, absorbance values greater than 1.5 at the steepest part of each absorbance versus radial position exponential were deleted to ensure that only data obeying Beer's law were used in the nonlinear regression analysis. The partial specific volume of NS2 was calculated as 0.7367 cm3/g from its amino acid sequence. For modeling sedimentation equilibrium data, the data were merged, and a global nonlinear least squares analysis of the edited data sets was performed using the software packages XL-A v4.0 (Beckman) and Origin v4.1 (Microcal). Fitting the experimental data to both a single ideal species model and to a monomer-dimer self-association model was attempted. In addition, whole cell apparent weight average molecular masses were determined from each individual data set as well. Analytical gel filtration of purified NS2 was carried out on a Sephadex-75 16/60 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). NS2 at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in protein storage buffer was loaded onto the column, and the protein was eluted with the same buffer. If the gel permeation properties of NS2 were determined under denaturing conditions, NS2 was incubated for 4.5 h in protein storage buffer + 8 m urea prior to elution with this buffer. Protein elution was followed by absorption at 260 and 280 nm, and the elution profiles were corrected by subtraction of the appropriate buffer baselines. Purity and homogeneity of the observed NS2 peaks were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and by observation of theA 280/A 260 absorbance ratio over the NS2 peak as described in Ref. 31AB P.B. UNICORN version 2 (30) User Manual 18-1121-98. Edition AA. Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden1996Google Scholar. For determination of the Stokes radius, the column was calibrated using the Amersham Biosciences Inc. gel filtration low molecular weight calibration kit. Blue dextran 2000 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used to determine the void volume of the gel filtration column both in the presence and absence of 8 m urea. The frictional ratiof/f 0 of NS2 was calculated according to Ref. 32Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar using the following equation, f/f0=α/(3νM/4πN)1/3Equation 1 M is the molecular weight, α designates the Stokes radius, υ is the partial specific volume, and N is Avogadro's number. CD spectroscopy of NS2 was carried out on an Aviv model 62DS CD spectrometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder. Far-UV CD spectra of NS2 were recorded at 25 °C on 0.8 mg/ml NS2 in 20 mm borate/boric acid, pH 7.5, using a 0.01-mm cell. The data were averaged over 2 repeat scans and corrected by subtraction of the buffer baseline. The secondary structure content of NS2 was estimated by analysis of the normalized NS2 spectrum (188–240 nm) as a combination of 3 reference spectra (α-helix, β-sheet, random coil) using the program PROSEC (Aviv Associates). To verify the results, a synthetic spectrum with the same structural components as determined for NS2 was created using the program BLEND (Aviv Associates) and compared with the original NS2 spectrum. Near-UV CD spectroscopy of NS2 was carried out at 25 °C using a 1-cm cell. Data was acquired on 1.0 mg/ml NS2 in protein storage buffer, or on 1.0 mg/ml NS2 in protein storage buffer containing 6 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). Each data set was averaged over 5 scans, and the spectra were corrected by subtraction of the appropriate buffer baselines. Infrared absorption spectra of 10.0 mg/ml NS2 in protein storage buffer were acquired at room temperature (23.1 °C) using a PROTA FT-IR instrument (Bomen). The data were averaged over 400 scans, corrected by subtraction of the air, buffer, and cell baselines, and normalized. The secondary structure content of NS2 was determined by analysis of the NS2 amide I band as a linear combination of the spectra of 32 reference proteins of known x-ray crystallographic structure using the PROTA software (Bomen). Fluorescence spectroscopy of NS2 was performed on a SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a 1-cm cell, and samples were stirred during data acquisition to minimize artifacts due to photochemical degradation. After excitation at 290 nm, protein fluorescence emission spectra were collected on 0.026 mg/ml NS2 (A 280 = 0.05) in protein storage buffer, or in protein storage buffer containing 6 m GdmCl, respectively. Due to rapid photodegradation of NS2, fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out using individual NS2 samples containing 0–600 mm acrylamide. 4,4-Dianilino-1,1-binaphthyl-5,5-disulphonic acid (ANS) binding studies were performed at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm using a molar NS2/ANS ratio of 1:3. Spectra were corrected for buffer fluorescence and for variation of light source intensity and detector responseversus wavelength (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Analysis of NS2 quenching data was carried out according to Ref. 34Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar using the following modified form of the Stern-Volmer equation (35Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), F0/FeV[Q]=1+KSV[Q]Equation 2 where [Q] designates the concentration of the quenching agent and F 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities at wavelength λ in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively. While V characterizes the static component of the quenching process, K SVdescribes its collisional component. The effective quenching constantK SV(eff) was obtained from the initial slope of the Stern-Volmer plot and normalized for increase of the solution viscosity due to GdmCl as described in Ref. 34Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar. Thermal denaturation of NS2 was monitored by CD spectroscopy at 220 nm. 0.026 mg/ml NS2 in 20 mm borate/boric acid, pH 7.5, in a 1-cm cell was heated under stirring from 10 to 90 °C using increments of 0.5 °C. The temperature inside the sample cell was monitored by directly inserting a thermistor into the cell. To assure reversibility of the denaturation process, the sample was allowed to cool to room temperature after the experiment was complete, and the far-UV CD spectrum of the renatured protein was compared with the spectrum of NS2 collected before the heating experiment. Differential scanning calorimetry of NS2 was carried out on Model 6100 Nano II Differential Scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.) equipped with a capillary cell. Freshly purified NS2 at a concentration of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 mg/ml in 20 mm borate/boric acid, pH 7.5, and/or in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, was heated from 5–100 or 5–80 °C, respectively, using heating rates between 0.5 and 2 °C/min. The denaturation data was corrected by subtraction of the buffer baseline and converted to partial molar heat capacity using the program CpCalc (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.). Reversibility of the denaturation process was confirmed by subsequent cooling of the sample to 5 °C, followed by additional rounds of heating. The partial heat capacities of the fully unfolded polypeptide were estimated according to Refs. 36Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar and37Privalov P.L. Makhatadze G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar. Solvent-induced unfolding of NS2 was carried out by addition of GdmCl and was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy and far-UV CD spectroscopy. When unfolding was analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy, 0.026 mg/ml NS2 was incubated in protein storage buffer containing 0–6m GdmCl for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, fluorescence spectra were collected as described above using an excitation wavelength of 273 nm, as at this wavelength the folded and unfolded forms of NS2 showed no difference in UV absorbance. When NS2 unfolding was followed by far-UV CD spectroscopy, 0.26 mg/ml NS2 was incubated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm borate/boric acid, 0–6 m GdmCl, pH 7.5, for the same amount of time. CD spectra were collected at 25 °C using a 2-mm cell, and the data was corrected as described above. Completeness of the unfolding process was assured by examination of fluorescence and CD data of NS2 samples that had been exposed to GdmCl for different periods of time (5–90 min). Reversibility of the unfolding process was tested by examination of CD or fluorescence spectra of NS2 samples that had been unfolded by exposure to 6 m GdmCl and had subsequently been refolded by 1:10 (v/v) dilution in GdmCl-free buffer. The solvent-induced unfolding data of NS2 was analyzed assuming a two-state mechanism of unfolding.

https://openalex.org/W2027099781,"The 321-residue XylS and XylS1 proteins, encoded by the pWW0 and pWW53 plasmids respectively, differ in only 5 residues at positions 4, 53, 90, 137, and 153. As a result, the effector profile of XylS is wider than that of XylS1, and XylS mediates higher levels of transcription from its cognate-regulatable promoter than does XylS1. We generated a series of XylS-pWW0 mutants and found that the single mutants Asp-137 → Glu and His-153 → Asn exhibited an activation pattern different from that of the wild-type regulator. In the double-mutant XylSD137E,H153N the effector profile for benzoates was similar to that of XylS1. This suggests that these two residues are crucial for effector recognition and regulator activation to stimulate transcription. XylS-dependent transcription from its cognate promoter is mediated by RNA polymerase with ς32 or ς38, whereas XylS1 uses RNA polymerase with ς32 or ς70. We also found that point mutations at positions 137 and 153 of XylS led RNA polymerase to mediate transcription with ς70 rather than with ς38, as demonstrated by primer extension analysis in a ς70-thermosensitive background proficient and deficient in ς38. This suggests that a positive transcriptional regulator can choose the RNA polymerase complex that mediates transcription from a given promoter. The 321-residue XylS and XylS1 proteins, encoded by the pWW0 and pWW53 plasmids respectively, differ in only 5 residues at positions 4, 53, 90, 137, and 153. As a result, the effector profile of XylS is wider than that of XylS1, and XylS mediates higher levels of transcription from its cognate-regulatable promoter than does XylS1. We generated a series of XylS-pWW0 mutants and found that the single mutants Asp-137 → Glu and His-153 → Asn exhibited an activation pattern different from that of the wild-type regulator. In the double-mutant XylSD137E,H153N the effector profile for benzoates was similar to that of XylS1. This suggests that these two residues are crucial for effector recognition and regulator activation to stimulate transcription. XylS-dependent transcription from its cognate promoter is mediated by RNA polymerase with ς32 or ς38, whereas XylS1 uses RNA polymerase with ς32 or ς70. We also found that point mutations at positions 137 and 153 of XylS led RNA polymerase to mediate transcription with ς70 rather than with ς38, as demonstrated by primer extension analysis in a ς70-thermosensitive background proficient and deficient in ς38. This suggests that a positive transcriptional regulator can choose the RNA polymerase complex that mediates transcription from a given promoter. Gene regulators respond to specific environmental, cellular, and other signals by stimulating or inhibiting transcription, translation, or some other event in gene expression so that the rate of synthesis of the gene product is appropriately modified (1Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos-González M.I. Espinosa-Urgel M. Segura A. Curr. Opin.

Research efforts in our laboratory have focused on the regulation of the TOL plasmid-encoded catabolic pathway for the metabolism of benzoate and alkylbenzoates. Genes encoding the TOL meta-cleavage pathway in pWW0 are grouped into a single operon whose expression is positively regulated at the level of transcription by the xylS gene product, which is activated by benzoate effectors (for review, see Ref.3Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 31: 341-374Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Another well studied TOL plasmid is pWW53, which bears two functional homologous meta-pathway operons, together with two functional copies of the xylS regulatory genes (xylS1 and xylS3) (4Keil S.

XylS-pWW0 and XylS1-pWW53 differ in five amino acids, whereas XylS3 shows conserved sequence similarity with these two proteins only at their C-terminal end (6Assinder S.J. Williams P.A. J. Gen.

Biol. 1990; 211: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the amino-end part of XylS is involved in effector recognition and XylS activation. XylS1-pWW53 and XylS-pWW0 differ in only 5 amino acids (Cys-4, Cys-53, Gly-90, Asp-137, and His-153 in XylS versus Arg-4, Gly-53, Asp-90, Glu-137, and Asn-153 in XylS1), but despite this minor difference the latter exhibited a much narrower effector profile than XylS-pWW0 (7Gallegos M.T. Williams P.A. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5024-5029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, XylS1-pWW53 recognizes only 3MB and 3CB as effectors, whereas XylS-pWW0 recognizes in addition other alkyl- and chlorobenzoates with substituents at positions 2 or 4 (14Ramos J.L. Stolz A. Reineke W. Timmis K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8467-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6427-6434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in effector profile is consistent with the changes occurring at the N-terminal end of these regulators. Both XylS and XylS1 mediate transcription with RpoH (ς32) in the early log phase (7Gallegos M.T. Williams P.A. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5024-5029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Marqués S. Manzanera M. González-Pérez M.M. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, XylS-pWW0-dependent transcription from Pm is subsequently mediated by RNA polymerase with ς38 (16Marqués S. Manzanera M. González-Pérez M.M. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas in the case of XylS1 the ς factor used by RNA polymerase is ς70 (7Gallegos M.T. Williams P.A. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5024-5029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the minor differences at the protein sequence level between the two XylS proteins also impose dependence on the ς used by RNA polymerase. In light of these effects we decided to introduce stepwise mutations in XylS-pWW0 to determine their effects on transcriptional activity of the mutants. The bacterial strains were Escherichia coli MC4100 (F−, araD139 Δ(argF-lac) U169rpsL150 (Strr) relA1flbB5301 deoC1 ptsF25rbsR), E. coli RH90 (MC4100rpoS59::Tn10) (17Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol.

This last strain has a short deletion at the rpoD gene so that ς70 is nonfunctional at 42 °C (19Harris J.D. Heilig J.S. Martı́nez I.I. Calendar R. Isaksson L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of rpoS59::Tn10 into the UQ285 background (this study). Bacteria were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented, when required, with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 10 μg/ml tetracycline. Growth was determined turbidometrically at 660 nm. The following previously constructed plasmids were used. pCMX2 is a tetracycline resistance derivative of pSELECT containing the entirexylS gene inserted into the BamHI site (21Manzanera M. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pERD100 is an IncQ group plasmid that carries a fusion of Pm to a promoterless ′lacZ gene and encodes resistance to tetracycline (22Egan S.M.

Plasmid pJLR107 has a 401-base pair PstI fragment of the TOL plasmid containing the Pm promoter fused to a promoterless ′lacZ gene in pMD1405 (pBR replicon) and encodes resistance to ampicillin (23Ruı́z R. Ramos J.L. Egan S.M.

Sorensen S.J. Jensen L.B. Gene. 1997; 186: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DNA preparation, digestion with restriction enzymes, and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, isolation of DNA fragments, ligations, transformations, transduction with P1 phage, and sequencing reactions were done according to standard procedures (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

The external primers were 5′-GGCACTGGGATCGTTCAAGC-3′ and 5′-GGATTTTTGCTTATTGAACG-3′. After DNA amplification, the resulting DNA was digested with XhoI andBglII, and the 761-base pairXhoI-BglII xylS mutant fragments were inserted between the XhoI-BglII sites of pCMX2 to yield plasmids pCMX2::xylS* (the asterisk indicates that one or more of the amino acids in the wild-type protein has been changed). In a first round of mutagenesis we generated single mutants at positions 4, 53, 90, 137, and 153 as indicated in Table I. These single mutants were used to construct the double mutants shown in Table I. All the xylS mutant alleles generated in this study were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids pCMX2::xylS* bearing the xylS* mutant alleles were digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the 1609-base pair EcoRI-XbaI fragments, which contained the entire set of xylS* mutant alleles, were subcloned between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pLOW2 to generate plasmids pLAR1 through 18, which encoded the mutant XylS proteins shown in Table I.Table IInduction ratio mediated by wild-type XylS-pWW0 and several single, double, and triple mutants of this regulator with 3-methyl-, 3-chloro- or 3-bromobenzoate as effectorsREGULATOR3MB3CB3BrBWild-type XylS-pWW0392318C4R321410C53G372520G90D361712D137E20108H153N20108C4R+C53G1797C4R+G90D1465C4R+D137E1143C4R+H153N943C53G+G90D361712C53G+D137E22108C53G+H153N19106G90D+D137E2186G90D+H153N26128D137E+H153N522C4R+D137E+H153N322C53G+D137E+H153N522G90D+D137E+H153N322XylS1-pWW53422E. coli MC4100 bacteria that bear pERD100 (Pm∷′lacZ) and pLOW2 (XylS) or pLRA-X (encoding for the XylS mutants shown in the table) were grown on Luria-Bertani medium with tetracycline and kanamycin. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed in permeabilized cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Induction ratio is defined as the enzyme level in cells grown in the presence of the inducer to the level determined in cells grown without an effector.

E. coli bearing the wild-type xylS allele or xylS mutant alleles in pLARx (the x indicates a number between 1 and 18) plus pERD100 or pJLR107 were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Cultures were diluted 100-fold in the same medium supplemented or not with 1 mm benzoate analog. After 5 h of incubation, β-galactosidase activity was assayed in permeabilized whole cells as described previously (26González-Pérez M.M. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2286-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the XylS protein were produced and used to detect XylS proteins fractionated in SDS-PAGE gels with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to peroxidase according to the protocol described by Jones and Gregory (27Jones E.L. Gregory J. Antibodies: A Practical Approach. II. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 155-178Google Scholar). RNA was extracted with a modification of the guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol method (16Marqués S. Manzanera M. González-Pérez M.M. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The RNA concentration was determined by measuringA 260. Hybridization of the32P-5′-end-labeled single-stranded DNA primer (105 cpm) complementary to the mRNA transcript produced from the Pm promoter and primer extension with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase were done as described previously (16Marqués S. Manzanera M. González-Pérez M.M. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In all assays 20 μg of total RNA was used as the template. The oligonucleotide used in the reverse primer extension reactions was 5′-GATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTG-3′. cDNA products were analyzed in a urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and the intensities of the bands in the autoradiography were densitometrically determined. All assays were done at least three times, and nonsignificant differences were detected in the levels of the different extended products. The wild-type XylS regulator and the series of single point mutant regulators constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis were cloned in the low copy number plasmid pLOW2 as described above. The resulting plasmids were transformed in E. coli MC4100 (pERD100), and β-galactosidase activity in response to the addition of 3MB was determined (TableI). This benzoate analog was chosen in this first series of assays because it is the best effector for both XylS-pWW0 and XylS1-pWW53. The level of transcription mediated by the wild-type XylS-pWW0 increased about 40-fold with respect to the basal level, whereas the XylS1-pWW53 protein mediated only a 4-fold induction (Table I). Each of the single point mutants of XylS-pWW0 were also assayed, and the results showed little effect for the changes Cys-4 → Arg, Cys-53 → Gly, and Gly-90 → Asp and a modest effect for the point mutants Asp-137 → Glu and His-153 → Asn (the activity decreased to about 50% that measured for the wild-type XylS-pWWO protein) (Table I). Given that the induction level mediated by XylS1 with 3MB was significantly lower than in the single mutants, we generated all possible double mutations. The level of induction of the double mutant XylSD137E,H153N was similar to that of XylS1 (Table I). The combination of either the Asp-137 → Glu or His-153 → Asn mutation with Cys-4 → Arg resulted in levels of activity lower than that found with any of the single mutants. However, when Asp-137 → Glu or His-153 → Asn was combined with a mutation in position 53 or 90, the activity was similar to that seen with the Asp-137 → Glu or His-153 → Asn mutation alone (Table I). This prompted us to analyze the combination of double mutant XylSD137E,H153N with the rest of the mutations. The result was that these mutants behaved like the double mutant and exhibited an induction level similar to that determined with XylS1-pWW53 (Table I). These results, therefore, suggest that residues 137 and 153 in XylS-pWW0 play a key role in effector recognition and activation of this regulator. To determine whether the effect of the mutations was specific for 3MB, we tested the level of induction with two other substituted benzoate analogs that are effectors of XylS-pWW0, 3CB and 3-bromobenzoate. In general, 3CB and 3-bromobenzoate induced less β-galactosidase activity than 3MB with any of the mutants, and the reduction in the induction level for each of the mutants with these effectors followed a pattern similar to the decreases observed with 3MB as the effector (Table I). To test whether the decrease in activation reflected worse stability of the mutant proteins, we performed Western blots with total protein from E. colibearing the XylS-pWW0 mutant alleles and used a polyclonal antibody against the XylS protein. In all cases the amount of XylS mutant protein was similar (not shown), and therefore, differences in expression levels mediated by each mutant regulator from Pm cannot in principle be ascribed to altered stability of the mutant proteins. Based on the above results we concentrated our efforts on the characterization of the single XylSD137E and XylSH153N mutants and the double mutant XylSD137E,H153N. We tested the effector profile of the mutant regulators with all possible mono- and di-substituted methylbenzoates. Fig. 1 shows the results for the wild-type XylS-pWW0. The order of strength of inducibility was 3MB > 2,3DMB > B > 3,4DMB > 2MB = 4MB = 2,5DMB > 3,5DMB = 2,6DMB, with the last two dimethylbenzoates being considered noneffectors for XylS. Fig. 1 shows the induction profile of the single mutants XylSD137E and XylSH153N and the double mutant XylSD137E,H153N. The two single mutants recognized most of the effectors, but as with the benzoates substituted at position 3, all mutants exhibited lower levels of induction than the wild type. In contrast, the double mutant XylSD137E,H135N seemed not to respond to 3,4DMB, 2MB, or 4MB and exhibited an effector profile similar, if not identical, to that of the XylS1-pWW53 regulator (Fig.1). To further confirm the crucial role of residues 137 and 153 of XylS-pWW0 in effector recognition and regulator activation, we introduced as many mutations as possible by random overlapping mutagenesis at positions 137 and 153 in the XylS protein. We sequenced about 20 putative mutants for each position and found 5 new mutants at position 137 (aspartic acid was replaced by glutamic acid, proline, serine, arginine, and leucine) and two new mutants at position 153 (histidine was replaced by glycine and aspartic acid) (the mutant proteins were shown to be stable as deduced from the level of protein made by the cells and revealed by Western blot immunodetection of XylS proteins). We determined β-galactosidase expression from Pm mediated by each mutant in response to a series of substituted benzoates. Replacement of aspartic 137 with arginine or proline resulted in a mutant regulator unable to stimulate transcription with any benzoate effector (Table II), whereas replacement of aspartic acid by glutamic acid or serine reduced activation capacity to about 50% that observed for the wild type. Replacement with apolar leucine resulted in a mutant with very low activity. At position 153 replacement of histidine with glycine or aspartic acid resulted in mutants that showed no activity (Table II). These results suggest that residues 137 and 153 influence the ability of XylS to activate transcription from Pm.Table IIEffect of mutations at positions 137 and 153 of XylS on V max induction from PmRegulatorNone3MB3CB3BrBBXylS-pWW0602350140011001050D137E501250500400300D137P5050505050D137S70900400350300D137R50100705070D137L60400200200150H153N501400500400450H153G60150100100100H153D60100808070Conditions were as in Table 1, except that the XylS mutants were those shown below.

(16Marqués S. Manzanera M. González-Pérez M.M. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that 3MB induces the heat shock response upon addition to cell cultures and that RNA polymerase uses ς32 to mediate the XylS1- and XylS-dependent expression from Pm. Once the cultures reached the mid-log growth phase, RNA polymerase uses ς38 to mediate transcription from Pm in the case of XylS and ς70 in the case of XylS1. We tested whether transcription mediated by XylS mutants from a Pm:′lacZfusion followed the pattern of induction of the wild-type regulator when induction was assayed in a ς38-deficient background. The results obtained confirmed that expression from Pm in the mid-log growth phase mediated by XylS1 is ς38-independent, whereas transcription stimulation from Pm with the XylS regulator is dependent on ς38 (not shown). In contrast, in all three mutants we tested, the dependence on ς38 was lost. To further confirm that the level of β-galactosidase activity reflected the transcriptional activity from Pm, we determined the level of expression from Pm in different backgrounds by using ς70ts mutants proficient and deficient in the synthesis of ς38. The parental strain of these isogenic strains isE. coli P90A5c. This strain bearing the xylS orxylS1 alleles is able to transcribe the Pm promoter in response to the addition of 3MB regardless of the incubation temperature, as expected (Fig.2 A). E. coli UQ285 has a ς70ts that is thermosensitive at 42 °C. Because expression from Pm with XylS seems to be dependent on ς38whereas with XylS1 it seems to depend on ς70, one would expect transcription from Pm to occur at 30 °C in UQ285 and at 42 °C with XylS and at 30° but not at 42 °C with XylS1. We tested transcription from Pm in XylS- and XylS1-proficient backgrounds in the absence and in the presence of 3MB. In these genetic backgrounds, no transcription from Pm took place in the absence of the effector (not shown). In the presence of 3MB, transcription occurred at 30 °C with either XylS or XylS1 (Fig. 2 B), but at 42 °C transcription from Pm was seen only in the XylS-proficient background (Fig. 2 B) (as a control of the correct functioning of the UQ285 strain, note that transcription from the ς70 tandem Pr1 and Pr2 promoters occurred at 30 °C but not at 42 °C (not shown)). We then tested transcription stimulation from Pm at 30 °C and 42 °C with XylSD137E and XylSH153N. The results obtained were similar with both mutants and are shown for XylSD137E in Fig. 2 B. XylSD137E behaved like XylS1 rather than like XylS; we interpret this result to indicate that XylSD137E facilitated transcription from Pm with ς70rather than with ς38 in the logarithmic growth phase. To further confirm the switch in ς factors in RNA polymerase to transcribe Pm depending on the regulator used, we constructedE. coli EEZ286, which in addition to the ς70tsmutation has an inactive ς38 allele. In this mutant background, transcription from Pm did not occur in the absence of 3MB; however, in the presence of the effector and in cultures incubated at 30 °C, transcription from Pm took place in the XylS1 background but not in the XylS background (Fig. 2 C). Mutants XylSD137E and XylSH153N, in contrast with XylS, were able to stimulate transcription from Pm, as shown for XylSD137E in Fig. 2 C. XylS and XylS1 are 98.44% identical and differ in only 5 of 321 residues, all of which are located in the N-terminal end. The availability of these two different alleles of the regulator is of great interest, because these “minor” differences are clearly reflected in the regulator ability to induce transcription from Pm with different effectors and in the interactions with the transcriptional machinery. With regard to the kinetic properties, Gallegos et al. (7Gallegos M.T. Williams P.A. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5024-5029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first reported that the induction rate from Pm in the XylS-pWW0 regulator was about 6–10-fold as high as that in XylS1 and that XylS-pWW0 regulator had a wider effector profile than XylS1-pWW53. The introduction of stepwise mutations in XylS-pWW0 revealed that the single mutations with the greatest effect on the degree of transcriptional activation and the effector profile were those that involved residues 137 or 153. This was further confirmed when the effector profile for effectors in the double mutant XylSD137E,H153N were found to be similar to those of the XylS1-pWW53 regulator. This indicated that these residues may be involved in effector interactions. The importance of the involvement of residues 137 and 153 in interactions with effectors was confirmed when random mutations at these positions resulted in point mutants (i.e. XylSD137R, XylSD137P, XylSH153G, and XylSH153D) that had lost the ability to recognize effectors. Recently the MarR regulator, which recognizes 2-hydroxybenzoate (salicylate) as an effector, has been crystallized with the aromatic carboxylic acid (28Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this regulator salicylate is bound in two sites, SalA and SalB; in both sites the salicylate carboxylate hydrogen bound to the positively charged lateral chain of arginine residues. The salicylate hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bound to the hydroxyl chain of a threonine at the SalA site and to the backbone carboxyl of an alanine at the SalB site. This indicates that substituents on the aromatic ring can establish interactions with different residues. On the basis of these results it is tempting to speculate that in XylS, histidine 153 might be involved in interactions with substituents on the benzoate aromatic ring, because mutations in this residue to uncharged or negatively charged amino acids resulted in loss of the ability to recognize benzoate derivatives. This in turn may be due to loss of interactions with the carboxyl group. The change His-153 → Asn resulted in a less efficient regulator, but the amide lateral chain of glutamine may allow certain interactions with benzoate derivatives. Given the negative character of aspartic acid 137, this residue cannot be involved in interactions with the carboxyl chain of benzoate. Instead, residue aspartic acid 137 may be involved in other interactions with substituents or in the intramolecular signal transmission chain that leads to activation of the regulator. In fact, altering the charge of this residue influenced the ability of the regulator to recognize benzoates. Our previous study revealed cysteine 41 as another amino acid that may be part of the XylS effector pocket. The phenotype of mutants XylSD137R and XylSH153G regarding the lost ability to recognize benzoates is similar to the one we found when cysteine 41 was replaced with leucine (12Michán C. Zhou L. Gallegos M.T. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22897-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at position 41, certain mutations resulted in other phenotypic changes. For example, replacement of cysteine 41 with arginine resulted in a mutant that exhibited a semiconstitutive phenotype (i.e. it mediated a high level of transcription from Pm in the absence of effectors). Mutant XylSC41G showed altered effector specificity; it did not recognize 4MB but retained the ability to recognize 3MB (12Michán C. Zhou L. Gallegos M.T. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22897-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That different mutations in positions 41, 137, and 153 give rise to different phenotypes is consistent with the different roles of residues 41, 137, and 153 in interactions with effectors or signal transmission to achieve the active form of this transcriptional regulator. However, whether any of these residues interacts with the effectors is still unknown. Details of these interactions await resolution of the three-dimensional structure of this regulator with and without the effector. The XylS protein has so far been difficult to purify because of the intrinsic insolubility of the protein, a characteristic shared by many proteins of the XylS/AraC family of regulators (29Egan S.M. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Fawcett W.P. Wolf R.E. Mol.

Genet. 1992; 235: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, we recently solubilized the N-terminal end of XylS upon fusion to MalE and are now trying to obtain further insights into the structural characteristics of the N-terminal end of XylS. 2R. Ruı́z, S. Marqués, and J. L. Ramos, unpublished information. Two members of the XylS family, SoxS and MarA, which are about 110 amino acid long, are equivalent to the C terminus of the XylS family of proteins. This coincidence suggests that the C-terminal end in members of the XylS/AraC family is involved in DNA binding and probably in interactions with the transcriptional machinery. A study by Michán et al. (31Michán C. Kessler B. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) shows that although the N and C termini of XylS have specific functions, they are not independent, and they cross-talk. Their relationship is further supported by the present finding that mutations at the N terminus influence which ς factor the RNA polymerase chooses to stimulate transcription from Pm. In fact, the Pm promoter is unique in that XylS-dependent transcription from Pm requires RNA polymerase with either ς32 or ς38, whereas XylS1 uses ς32 or ς70 with RNA polymerase. 3-Methylbenzoate induces the heat shock response (16Marqués S. Manzanera M. González-Pérez M.M. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and upon initial transcription with ς32, this ς factor is replaced by ς38 for XylS and ς70 for XylS1. It is also interesting to note that minor changes in XylS influence the preferred ς factor that RNA polymerase chooses for transcription from Pm. Single point mutations at positions 137 and 153 of XylS are sufficient to allow RNA polymerase to function with ς70 instead of ς38. As described under “Results,” the transcription initiation point from Pm is the same regardless of the ς factor RNA polymerase used to transcribe the Pm promoter, and although ς70 and ς38 belong to the same class of ς factor (32Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 33Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol.

In summary, XylS1 and XylS are almost identical, differing in only five residues. Two of the five amino acids, at positions 137 and 153, had major effects on effector recognition and significantly influenced the effector pattern. These residues in XylS also influence whether XylS mediates transcription from Pm with RNA polymerase using either ς70 or ς38. Further studies with this system are expected to reveal the mechanisms by which subtle changes in XylS can influence transcription from Pm to such a significant degree.

The minimal RNA recognition motif for TGT has been found to involve a UGU sequence in the anticodon loop of the queuine-cognate tRNAs. Recent studies have shown that the enzyme is capable of recognizing the UGU sequence in alternative contexts (Kung, F. L., Nonekowski, S., and Garcia, G. A. (2000) RNA 6, 233–244) and have investigated the role of the first U of the UGU sequence in tRNA recognition by TGT (Nonekowski, S. T., and Garcia, G. A. (2001) RNA 7, 1432–1441). The TGT reaction involves the breakage and re-formation of a glycosidic bond. To rule out a potential chemical mechanism involving the 2′-hydroxyl at position 34, we synthesized and evaluated an RNA minihelix with 2′-deoxy-G at 34. The high level of activity exhibited by this analogue indicates that the 2′-hydroxyl of G34 is not required for catalysis. Furthermore, we find that TGT can recognize analogues composed entirely of DNA, but only when 2′-deoxyuridines replace the thymidines in the DNA. The requirement for uridine bases for recognition is perhaps not surprising given the UGU recognition motif for TGT. However, it is not clear if the uracil requirement is due to specific recognition by TGT or due to the effect of uracils on the conformation of the oligonucleotide. tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) catalyzes the exchange of queuine (or a precursor) for guanine 34 in tRNA.

Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998Crossref Google Scholar). One of the more elaborately modified nucleosides is queuine (7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-yl-aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine). tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) 1TGTtRNA-guanine transglycosylasequeuine7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-yl-aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanosineRUMTm5U54-tRNA methyltransferase catalyzes the exchange of queuine (or a precursor) for guanine 34 in the anticodon of certain tRNAs. The minimal RNA recognition motif for TGT has been found to involve a UGU sequence in the anticodon loop of the queuine-cognate tRNAs (tyrosine, aspartate, asparagine, and histidine) (2Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UGU sequence is undeniably the major determinant for tRNA recognition by TGT. However, provided that TGT can position the UGU sequence in the active site in the proper orientation, the UGU sequence need not reside in the anticodon loop to be recognized. Recent studies have shown that TGT can recognize the UGU sequence in at least 2 additional minihelical contexts, at the base of the TΨC stem in yeast tRNAPhe and in the anticodon position in the absence of U33 (4Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, tRNA recognition by TGT is more flexible than previously believed. This observation prompted an examination of the ability of TGT to recognize RNAs containing modifications of the UGU sequence. The initial studies that identified the UGU sequence as the major identity element utilized only canonical base (C, G, A, U) replacements (2Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,3Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments have demonstrated that a DNA analogue of an RNA minihelix corresponding to the anticodon arm of Escherichia coli tRNATyr, ECYMH (dECYMH) was inactive. 2A. W. Curnow and G. A. Garcia, unpublished data. However, there are two fundamental differences between RNA and DNA, the lack of the 2′-hydroxyls and the presence of thymidine rather than uracil in DNA. Therefore, dECYMH has a TGT sequence rather than a UGU sequence. tRNA-guanine transglycosylase 7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-yl-aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanosine m5U54-tRNA methyltransferase Given the importance of the UGU sequence in TGT recognition, it is possible that the inactivity of dECYMH was due to the presence of thymidine rather than the loss of the 2′-hydroxyls. To investigate the role of the 2′-hydroxyl in TGT recognition and catalysis, we have studied a deoxyguanosine 34 analogue of ECYMH (Fig. 1,dG34ECYMH). This analogue is a substrate for TGT with less than a 10-fold reduction in activity. To further probe the ability of TGT to recognize RNA analogues lacking the 2′-hydroxyl, modified DNA analogues of the previously described minihelix ECYMH (2Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Curnow A.W. Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A.

RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar) and SCFMH(TΨC) (dUdSCFMH(TΨC)) (5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were synthesized and characterized. These analogues (containing deoxyuracil (dU) bases rather than thymidine bases) all serve as substrates for TGT, indicating that the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase from E. coli can recognize and modify DNA. Reagents were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, or Invitrogen unless otherwise noted. Buffered phenol, glycerol, and HEPES were from United States Biochemical (USB). Tris/HCl buffer was from Research Organics. 8-[3H]Guanine (10 Ci/mmol) was from Moravek Biochemicals. TGT was isolated as previously described (4Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar,5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The RNA minihelix, ECYMH, was chemically synthesized by automated chemical synthesis performed on an Expedite nucleic acid synthesis system (model 8909, PerSeptive Biosystems) using the manufacturer's protocols and reagents. However, the RNA phosphoramidite monomers (G, C, A, and U) and CPG columns were from Glen Research. dG34ECYMH was the generous gift of Dr. Houng-Yau Mei (Bioorganic Chemistry, Pfizer Global Research and Development, Ann Arbor, MI). The dU-DNA analogues, dUdECYMH, dUdUGU+1, and dUdSCFMH(TΨC) were from Invitrogen. The oligos were resuspended in 300–800 μl of HM 7.3 buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mmMgCl2). Concentrations of the analogues were determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients at 260 nm calculated from the base composition of each oligonucleotide. All native and denaturing PAGE were performed on a Phast System (Amersham Biosciences) as previously reported (2Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Typical native band shift assays were performed as follows: TGT (3 μm) was incubated with excess RNA (45–100 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium phosphate. The reaction mixtures were then analyzed by native PAGE using 8–25% gradient polyacrylamide gels. Approximately 4 μl were loaded onto each lane. The capability of the RNAs to form a stable complex with TGT was assayed via denaturing PAGE as follows: TGT (7 μm) was incubated with excess RNA (45–100 μm) in the presence of 400 μm 9-methylguanine at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium phosphate. SDS buffer (10 μl of 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added to the reaction mixtures, and the incubation was continued for an additional hour at 25 °C. Approximately 4 μl were loaded onto each lane. In both native and denaturing PAGE, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein, although the gels were scanned in gray scale to generate the figures. A guanine incorporation assay was used to obtain the steady-state kinetic parameters as previously reported (2Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17264-17267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A.

A slight modification was made to the precipitation step of the assays: the analogues were precipitated for 1 h at −20 °C rather than at room temperature. This improved the assay by reducing the background radioactivity. The dU-DNA analogues, dUdUGU+1 and dUdSCFMH(TΨC), were assayed at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 20 μm, whereas the concentration for dUdECYMH ranged from 0.2 to 40 μm and the concentration for dG34ECYMH ranged from 0.1 to 60 μm. The TGT concentration was 180 nm. Aliquots (70 μl) were taken at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 min after the reaction had been initiated with enzyme and quenched by precipitation with 2 ml of ethanol and 10 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3. After the addition of the ethanol, the test tubes containing the samples were covered with parafilm and placed in the freezer (−20 °C) to chill for 1 h. The precipitated RNAs were collected on glass fiber filters (GF/C filter, Whatman), washed three times with EtOH, and dried. The amount of radioactivity on each filter was quantified by liquid scintillation. Disintegrations per minute (DPM) were converted into picomoles of radiolabeled guanine using the appropriate specific activities. The initial velocities (vi) obtained from linear regression of guanine incorporation versus time were plotted versussubstrate concentrations. V max andKm were obtained by nonlinear regression of these hyperbolic plots to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Values fork cat were obtained by dividing theV max values by the TGT concentration (180 nm) and the aliquot volume (70 μl). Assays were conducted in triplicate, and the average of the data points (vi) and the error bars generated from the standard deviation within each point were plotted. The initial velocity of ECYMH at 10 μm was determined in all assays to normalize the specific activity of TGT from assay to assay. The observation that TGT recognition of tRNA is flexible enough to accommodate the UGU sequence in alternate contexts (4Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) prompted the investigation of the capability of TGT to recognize a modified RNA minihelix. A 2′-deoxyguanosine 34 analogue of ECYMH (dG34ECYMH) was synthesized and shown to be a substrate for TGT with an 8-fold decrease in k cat and a 3-fold decrease in Km with respect to ECYMH (TableI). The substantial activity of dG34ECYMH rules out any requisite participation of the 2′-hydroxyl in the chemical mechanism of the TGT reaction. This conclusion is consistent with mutagenesis studies that implicate an aspartic acid residue as the enzymic nucleophile (9Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15734-15739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14123-14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that any potential H-bonding interaction between the 2′-hydroxyl of G34 and TGT is not critical for binding or activity.Table IKinetic parameters for the dU-DNA analoguesAnalogueK m 1-aStandard errors are shown in parentheses.

RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab To determine the importance of the remaining 2′-hydroxyls, a DNA analogue of ECYMH (dUdECYMH) was synthesized and characterized. This analogue is comprised entirely of 2′-deoxyribonucleotides. However, because of the importance of the UGU sequence in TGT recognition, it contains deoxyuracil bases in place of thymidine bases. This allows the effect of the ribose backbone to be examined exclusively. In addition to dUdECYMH, the dU-DNA analogues of the alternate substrates UGU+1 (4Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar) (dUdUGU+1) and SCFMH(TΨC) (5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (dUdSCFMH(TΨC)) (Fig.1) were also synthesized and evaluated. Native PAGE band shift experiments demonstrate that all of the dU-DNA analogues bind to TGT (Fig.2 A). This indicates that none of the 2′-hydroxyls are critical for binding to TGT. The RNA analogue with the single deoxyribose substitution, dG34ECYMH, qualitatively exhibited the highest ratio of RNA-bound TGT to free TGT (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). It is not clear why the removal of the 2′-hydroxyl of G34 results in apparently tighter binding than the RNA analogue, ECYMH. Although it is unlikely that the overall conformation of dG34ECYMH differs significantly from ECYMH, it is possible that a local change in the sugar pucker of the G34 could be responsible for the apparently tighter binding. 2′-deoxyribonucleotides typically favor a C2′-endo(N) sugar pucker, whereas ribonucleotides are frequently found in a C3′-endo(S) conformation (11Saenger W.

It seems likely that the predominantly RNA nature of dG34ECYMH yields a structure that is virtually identical to that of the native RNA substrate for TGT. The almost certain change in conformation at position 34 because of the deoxyguanosine could result in an orientation in the active site that is suboptimal for catalysis, but does not interfere with binding. dUdECYMH and the other dU-DNA analogues do show qualitatively less band shift than either ECYMH or dG34ECYMH (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the slightly higher Km values of the dU-DNA analogues are consistent with weaker binding. All of these results suggest that the loss of the 2′-hydroxyl at position 34 leads to a reduction in catalysis, possibly because of suboptimal orientation. The loss of the remaining 2′-hydroxyls appears to have a very small effect on binding, which may be because of a conformational effect. All the analogues were able to form a complex that was stable to mild denaturing conditions (∼50 kDa, Fig. 2 B). Previous reports strongly suggest that this complex is a covalent intermediate formed between RNA and aspartate 89 of TGT (9Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15734-15739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14123-14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consistent with its tighter binding, dG34ECYMH formed a significantly more intense covalent complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). In fact, dG34ECYMH produces the largest amount of complex formation of any substrate analogue (RNA or DNA) tested to date, to our knowledge. Although it has not yet been firmly established that the stable complex represents a true mechanistic intermediate (e.g. chemical and kinetic competence of the covalent complex), there is a direct correlation between the formation of this complex and enzymatic activity (5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This correlation is consistent with our findings that all the dU-DNA analogues are substrates for TGT (Fig. 3). In general, the activity of the dU-DNA analogues mirrored their RNA analogues (Table I). For example, dUdECYMH, which was the most active DNA analogue, was derived from the “normal” RNA substrate ECYMH. The reduction in thek cat values for dUdECYMH (5-fold) and dG34ECYMH (7-fold) with respect to ECYMH suggests that the orientation of dG34 is not optimal for catalysis. The decreased activities of the alternate RNA substrates UGU+1and SCFMH(TΨC) demonstrate that catalysis for these analogues is also affected by suboptimal orientation of the UGU sequence as compared with the normal RNA substrate. The essentially identicalk cat values of dUdUGU+1 and dUdSCFMH(TΨC), relative to their respective RNA analogues, indicate that the ribose backbone does not significantly aid in any rearrangement that might enhance catalysis. The most prominent result presented in Table I is that removal of all the 2′-hydroxyls has a relatively minor effect (5- to 14-fold reduction) onk cat. Despite the small increases inKm , the overall specificities (k cat/Km) are quite comparable to the RNA analogues, especially for the alternate substrates UGU+1 and SCFMH(TΨC). The activity of the dU-DNA analogues can be explained in one of two ways. The first explanation is that TGT is not sensitive to the differences between RNA and DNA. However, we know that this is not strictly accurate because the analogue containing thymidine (dECYMH) is inactive. Yet, replacement of the thymidine bases with deoxyuracil does restore activity with TGT; thus, TGT recognition is not strictly dependent upon the ribose backbone or any conformational effects of the 2′-hydroxyls. The capability of TGT to recognize the UGU sequence in alternate contexts (4Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggests that TGT recognition is fairly indiscriminate. However, recent results from our laboratory (4Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1432-1441PubMed Google Scholar) show that TGT recognition is blocked when the UGU sequence is locked into certain conformations (e.g. the anticodon loop “U-turn”). An alternative explanation is that the dU-DNA analogues are able to emulate the RNA analogues despite differences in the preferred conformations of deoxyribonucleotides versusribonucleotides. The most prevalent (and most recognizable) form of DNA is the B-form double helix in which the sugar conformation is 2′-endo (11Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer Advanced Texts in Chemistry, Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 55-65Google Scholar). Because it lacks the 2′-hydroxyls, DNA can also exist in several different forms, including A-DNA and Z-DNA (11Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer Advanced Texts in Chemistry, Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 55-65Google Scholar). Conversely, RNA exists predominantly in the A-form with a 3′-endo ribose conformation. Given the greater flexibility of DNA, it is possible that DNA analogues can adopt a conformation that is similar to the corresponding RNA in solution. Paquette et al. (12Paquette J. Nicoghosian K., Qi, G.-R. Beauchemin N. Cedergren R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) compared the conformation of a tRNA with its “tDNA” and “anti-tDNA” (the complement of tDNA) analogues. By examining the mung bean nuclease cleavage patterns of tRNAMet, tDNAMet, and anti-tDNAMetthese authors demonstrated that the global structures of tRNA and tDNA were quite similar, although the core regions of the tDNAs are more exposed than the tRNA. Furthermore, tDNAMet and anti-tDNAMet are both cleaved by the restriction enzymesHhaI and CfoI, which verifies the presence of base-paired stems. Based on these studies, the authors conclude that nucleic acid conformation is largely determined by the interactions of the bases and those elements common to both DNA and RNA. One role of the 2′-hydroxyls (in tRNA at least) is to increase the stability of the molecule (12Paquette J. Nicoghosian K., Qi, G.-R. Beauchemin N. Cedergren R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Studies using transition metal complexes have confirmed that the global structure of tDNAPhe resembles that of tRNAPhe but that the base paired stem conformations differ somewhat (13Lim A.C. Barton J.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11029-11034Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Those results are most consistent with a more B-like conformation for the tDNA double helical regions. Additionally, Holmes and Hecht have shown that Fe·bleomycin cleaves tRNAHisand tDNAHis at the same major site, U35 or T35 respectively (14Holmes C.E. Hecht S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25909-25913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the above studies were conducted using canonical base replacements (A, C, G, T, and deoxyribose for the tDNA analogues) and demonstrate that tDNA and tRNA can have similar conformations in solution. Additional studies have revealed that the presence of modified bases further increases the capability of DNA to mimic RNA (15Guenther R.H. Hardin C.C. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Dao V. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11004-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Dao V. Guenther R. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11012-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Dao V. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Nawrot B. Sochacka E. Kraszewski A. Jankowska J. Everett K. Agris P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 3: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, DNA analogues of the yeast tRNAPhe anticodon stem loop containing modifications such as deoxyuracil, 5-methylcytidine (m5C), and 1-methylguanine (m1G) are able to bind Mg+2. This binding is dependent upon the presence of the modified bases (15Guenther R.H. Hardin C.C. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Dao V. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11004-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Mg+2 is bound in the upper part of the DNA hairpin (16Dao V. Guenther R. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11012-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in a position that is analogous to that seen in the x-ray crystal structure of yeast tRNAPhe (19Quigley G. Teeter M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the modified DNA analogues were able to bind to poly(U)-programmed 30 S ribosomal subunits and competitively inhibit the binding of native tRNAPhe (17Dao V. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Nawrot B. Sochacka E. Kraszewski A. Jankowska J. Everett K. Agris P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2125-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). They were also able to inhibit protein expression in a coupled transcription-translation system (18Basti M.M. Stuart J.W. Lam A.T. Guenther R. Agris P.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the fully modified DNA analogue demonstrates that the helix is in the B-form. However, the conformation of the anticodon loop includes the formation of the U-turn and is strikingly similar to that of yeast tRNAPhe (18Basti M.M. Stuart J.W. Lam A.T. Guenther R. Agris P.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the structure of tRNA is not strictly dependent on the ribose backbone and underscores the importance of modified bases in tRNA structure and function. In light of these experiments, it is perhaps less surprising that tDNA analogues of tRNA can be aminoacylated. E. colitDNAPhe (with a 3′-terminal riboadenosine) and E. coli tDNALys were aminoacylated by their respective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (20Khan A.S. Roe B.A. Science. 1988; 241: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion,E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase will aminoacylate a tDNAfMet analogue (21Perreault J.-P. Pon R.T. Jiang M.-Y. Usman N. Pika J. Ogilvie K.K. Cedergren R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Giegé et al. (22Aphasizhev R. TheobaldDietrich A. Kostyuk D. Kochetkov S.N. Kisselev L. Giege R. Fasiolo F. RNA. 1997; 3: 893-904PubMed Google Scholar) have utilized a mutant T7 RNA polymerase to selectively incorporate deoxyribose derivatives of each base (dA, dG, dC, or dU) in order to study the effect of replacing a subset of 2′-hydroxyls. Their results indicate that the yeast methionyl-tRNA synthetase will tolerate dA and dU substitutions, but large decreases in charging occur for dG or dC analogues. Similarly, yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase will efficiently charge dC and dA analogues but not dG or dU analogues (22Aphasizhev R. TheobaldDietrich A. Kostyuk D. Kochetkov S.N. Kisselev L. Giege R. Fasiolo F. RNA. 1997; 3: 893-904PubMed Google Scholar). The recognition of DNA analogues of RNA substrates also extends to some RNA editing and modifying enzymes. For example, a substrate containing all DNA residues (except for a single ribonucleotide at the cleavage site) can be cleaved by the hammerhead ribozyme, albeit with reduced efficiency (23Dahm S.C. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Yang J.-H. Perreault J.-P. Labuda D. Usman N. Cedergren R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11156-11160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Pyle A.M. Cech T.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). From a catalytic perspective, a predominately DNA analogue of the ribozyme domain is capable of cleaving an RNA substrate (26Yang J.-H. Usman N. Chartrand P. Cedergren R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5005-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other examples of RNA catalysis with DNA substrates include Group I introns (27Herschlag D. Cech T.R. Nature. 1990; 344: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and RNase P (28Perreault J.-P. Altman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Lee J.-Y. Characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase P and Its RNA SubunitDoctoral dissertation. University of Michigan, 1991Google Scholar). There is also some evidence that other tRNA modification enzymes are capable of recognizing DNA analogues. A tDNAfMet analogue is threonylated to a small degree by a crude yeast extract and is able to inhibit the threonylation of tRNAfMet (21Perreault J.-P. Pon R.T. Jiang M.-Y. Usman N. Pika J. Ogilvie K.K. Cedergren R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, these results need to be verified under more stringent conditions. A dU-containing DNA minihelix analogue of the TΨC stem and loop of yeast tRNAPhe was reported to be a substrate for E. coli m5U54-tRNA methyltransferase (RUMT) (30Guenther R.H. Bakal R.S. Forrest B. Chen Y. Sengupta R. Nawrot B. Sochacka E. Jankowska J. Kraszewski A. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This analogue, presumably acting as a weak competitive substrate, was also able to inhibit the methylation of tRNA substrates and reduced the aminoacylation of yeast tRNAPhe. Although some activity was seen, this activity was not linear with respect to time. Furthermore, these authors later reported that RNA mutants with single (dU54 or dU55) or double (dU54dU55) mutations were not substrates forE. coli RUMT (31Sengupta R. Vainauskas S. Yarian C. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R.H. Koshlap K.M. Agris P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1374-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No explanation was given in this later report to account for the activity previously seen with the entirely deoxyribose analogue. Therefore, there is some ambiguity as to whether or not RUMT will recognize a DNA analogue. The tRNA editing enzyme that catalyzes the precise addition of the 3′-terminal CCA sequence to tRNAs (the CCA-adding enzyme, ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase) will recognize tDNA analogues provided they have a 3′-terminal ribonucleotide (32Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA. 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar). Both full-length and minihelix DNA analogues of the TΨC stem and loop of tDNAVal and tDNAAlawere substrates for the E. coli CCA-adding enzyme. Interestingly, the minihelix analogues were slightly better substrates than the full-length analogues for the CCA-adding enzyme (32Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA. 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the deoxyuridine-containing DNA analogues with E. coli TGT clearly demonstrates that TGT recognition is not critically dependent upon the native ribose backbone. However, the 2′-hydroxyl probably does influence binding, either through conformational effects or direct interactions with TGT. These experiments also demonstrate that TGT is capable of recognizing DNA provided that a UGU sequence can be found. This suggests that under certain conditions (e.g. in the E. coli mutant that lacks the enzymes deoxyribouracil-triphosphatase (dUTPase) and uracil N-glycosylase (E. coli dut − ung − strain, Ref. 33Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4905) Google Scholar) it is possible that there may be a physiological role for queuine modification of DNA. We thank members of our laboratory for critical reviews of this manuscript and helpful discussions."
