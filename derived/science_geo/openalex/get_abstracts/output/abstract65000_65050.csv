https://openalex.org/W2048712968,"Stimulation at several mesencephalic and diencephalic sites abolished responsiveness to intense pain in rats while leaving responsiveness to other sensory modes relatively unaffected. The peripheral field of analgesia was usually restricted to one-half or to one quadrant of the body, and painful stimuli applied outside this field elicited a normal reaction. Analgesia outlasted stimulation by up to 5 minutes. Most electrode placements that produced analgesia also supported self-stimulation. One placement supported self-stimulation only in the presence of pain."

This syndrome of sensory neglect appears to be involved in some of the deficits in feedinig and attack which follow bilateral lateral hypothalamic lesions."

https://openalex.org/W1529401899,"Abstract This paper demonstrates that regulation of synthesis of the two globin chains in the rabbit reticulocyte is complex: cells contain about 1.5 times more ribosome-associated α mRNA than β, but ribosomes initiate translation of each α mRNA only about 65% as frequently as a β mRNA. Hence regulation of globin synthesis occurs not only as a result of mRNA availability, but also as a consequence of selective ratios of initiation. These experiments utilize seven antibiotics—emetine, anisomycin, sparsomycin, blasticidin, cycloheximide, fusidic acid, and streptovitacin. We show that at concentrations which inhibit protein synthesis in reticulocyte extracts 60 to 80%, all reduce the rate of propagation of nascent globin chains, but do not directly inhibit initiation of new chains. This results in accumulation of large polyribosomes, in which the mRNA molecules are saturated with ribosomes. Under these conditions protein synthesis is not limited by chain initiation and the relative amount of the two globin chains produced should be proportional to the relative amount of the mRNA; indeed we find that all drugs induce a change in the ratio of α:β globin synthesized from 1.0 to about 1.5. Using two techniques to determine the classes of polyribosomes which are synthesizing each globin chain, we have confirmed the finding of Hunt et al., (Hunt, T., Hunter, T., and Munro, A., Nature, 220, 481 (1968)) that β chains are made on larger polyribosomes than α chains. We believe that this is due solely to the decreased rate of ribosome attachment to an α mRNA relative to a β mRNA. In accord with this notion, we show that in the presence of any of the seven translation inhibitors, both classes of globin chains are made on the same classes of very large polyribosomes, and that these ribosomes contain relatively more nascent α chains than β chains."
https://openalex.org/W1601584877,"Antibodies to prostaglandins B1, F1α, and F2α recognize structural changes on the cyclopentane ring and, in part, the degree of saturation of the C5—C6 bond. Structural modifications in these two parts of the molecule are also known to be responsible for the varying physiological functions of the prostaglandins. The antiprostaglandins F1α and F2α distinguish the homologous prostaglandins from prostaglandins F1β and F2β in which the hydroxyl group on C11 is trans to the hydroxyl group on C9. The position of the double bond in the cyclopentane ring is also recognized by antibodies, suggesting that prostaglandins E and A in biological fluids may be estimated in terms of generated prostaglandin B by assay before and after base-catalyzed conversion of prostaglandin E, or prostaglandin A to prostaglandin B, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1669384271,"Abstract The interaction of 125I-insulin with crude membrane preparations from isolated fat cells has many properties in common with the interaction of insulin with biologically significant receptors in intact fat cells. Specific binding of 125I-insulin to the membranes is a saturable process with respect to insulin and to membranes, and native insulin competes for binding in a way expected from the biological identity of the 2 molecules. Reduced and desoctapeptide insulins do not compete with 125I-insulin for binding, and desalanine insulin is indistinguishable from native insulin. Proinsulin binds to the membranes with an affinity which is 20 times less than that of native insulin. Insulin in the incubation medium containing fat cell membranes is not significantly destroyed under the conditions used in the binding assay. The 125I-insulin-membrane complex can be dissociated by acid, and the insulin thus released from this complex is similar to native insulin by several physical properties, by its ability to bind to membranes, and by its ability to stimulate glucose oxidation in isolated fat cells. The rate constants of insulin-membrane association (8.5 x 106 mole-1 sec-1) and dissociation (4.2 x 10-4 sec-1) have been measured independently, and the dissociation constant (5 x 10-11 m) based on these rate constants is similar to that (7.5 x 10-11 m) calculated separately from equilibrium data. These constants are similar to those calculated for the interaction of insulin with intact fat cells. Measurements of the rate constants at various temperatures indicate that binding is much tighter at lower temperatures because the decrease in dissociation rate is disproportionately greater than the decrease in association rate. Thermodynamic calculations reveal a ΔF of -14 kcal mole-1, a ΔH of -28 kcal mole-1, a ΔS of -45 cal mole-1 deg-1. Binding of 125I-insulin to membranes is unaffected by the nature of the buffer used or by a number of different ionic species, heavy metals, or by metal-complexing agents. The optimum pH for binding occurs sharply at about 7.5, and the pH range over which binding occurs is rather narrow. A sharp thermal transition, with a midpoint at 53°, results in irreversible inactivation of binding activity. Insulin binding to membranes is markedly affected by the ionic strength of the medium. Increasing concentrations of NaCl up to 2 m cause a dramatic (6-fold) increase in insulin binding. This probably results from the appearance (unmasking) on the membrane of new binding sites for insulin. The latter are kinetically identical with those normally exposed. These effects of 2 m NaCl, which appear to be qualitatively similar to the effects of digesting the membrane with phospholipase C, are readily reversible by decreasing the ionic strength of the medium. Modification of the membranes with several protein reagents suggests that tyrosyl and possibly histidyl residues may be important in the binding interaction. No evidence is present for the involvement of sulfhydryl, tryptophanyl, or carboxyl groups of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1555658886,"Abstract Physicochemical studies of the human serum albumin-Cu(II)-l-histidine (HSA-Cu(II)-l-His) ternary complex at pH 7.5 indicate several interesting features. 1. The dissociation constants of the HSA-Cu(II)-l-His ternary complex and the HSA-Cu(II) binary complex are 1.38 x 10-22 and 6.61 x 10-17, respectively. 2. The absorption spectrum of the ternary complex system has characteristics similar to those of the NH2-terminal peptide (1-24) of bovine serum albumin in the presence of Cu(II) and l-His. The computed spectrum of HSA-Cu(II)-l-His has a λmax at 540 nm, a shift of 15 nm toward red from that of HSA-Cu(II) (λmax = 525 nm). 3. The calculated moles of protons liberated in the formation of HSA-Cu(II)-l-His from HSA and Cu(II)-l-His2 are 0.28. While this may originate from an α-amino group, the number is much less than what would be expected if a peptide nitrogen of HSA were involved in the binding. 4. Cu(II) in the ternary complex is most likely bound to both HSA and l-His. The possible binding mode changes from all nitrogen, as shown in HSA-Cu(II), to either a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen or an additional involvement of imidazole nitrogen. 5. Equilibria, existing in the ternary complex system, suggest that the ternary complex may play an important role in the biological transport of Cu(II)."
https://openalex.org/W1556841387,"The amino acid sequence has been determined for the first 72 residues of a lysine-rich histone from rabbit thymus. These are the residues contained in a fragment released from the histone by treatment with N-bromosuccinimide. Peptides derived by tryptic, thermolysin, and chymotryptic digestion of this 72-residue fragment were used to reconstruct the total sequence. Analysis of the sequence revealed some unusual aspects of the structure of the fragment, which comprises about one-third of the histone molecule. Thirty of the first 40 residues are accounted for by lysine, alanine, and proline; this portion of the fragment includes sequences of 4, 2, and 3 consecutive basic residues. The last 32 residues contain all the hydrophobic amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine) of the fragment but have few basic residues and no prolines. The NH2 terminus of the histone is acetylated. Comparison of the sequence of the NH2-terminal half of this lysine-rich histone with the entire sequences of the slightly lysine-rich and arginine-rich histones shows that all three have similar characteristics, that is, an NH2-terminal region rich in basic amino acids and a COOH-terminal portion rich in hydrophobic residues. Tryptic peptides from the NH2-terminal N-bromosuccinimide fragment of two other thymus lysine-rich histones have been isolated. These peptides (with partial sequences) were aligned by direct identity or analogy with the complete amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal N-bromosuccinimide fragment of the lysine-rich histone studied previously. It was found that there were from 7 to 14 amino acid differences between fractions. One of the amino acid interchanges eliminates a major phosphorylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1493580233,"DNA-binding proteins made by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at specific times in their cell cycle were chromatographed on DNA-cellulose and analyzed with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Some small proteins (less than 25,000 mol wt) were made in S (the period of DNA synthesis), but not during G1 (the period following mitosis and preceding DNA synthesis). These were relatively low in tryptophan and could in part be histones. Larger DNA-binding proteins were made equally in early and late interphase. Proteins from cells labeled in the absence of calf serum during the S period had a different electrophoresis gel pattern compared to cells labeled in the presence of calf serum. Proteins from G1 cells labeled with or without serum had similar patterns. These results suggest that effects of serum are localized temporally in the cell cycle. Comparing our results with those of Salas and Green (Nature (New Biol.), 229, 165 (1971)), we suggest that the G0 state of nongrowing cells is distinct from the normal G1 phase of proliferating cells."
https://openalex.org/W1528547809,"The ability of trypsinogen to catalyze its own activation was studied at pH 8.1 in the presence of Ca++ ions. The lag phase portion of the classical S-shaped curve of activation was shortened by increasing the trypsinogen concentration but was extended by pretreatment of the zymogen with diisopropyl fluorophosphate or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Despite these pretreatments, however, full activation was achieved. In confirmation of the proposed catalytic activity of trypsinogen, acetyltrypsinogen, which cannot be activated by trypsin or acetyltrypsin, was able to activate chymotrypsinogen at a rate about 10-5 that of trypsin and to hydrolyze p-toluenesulfonyl arginine methyl ester at a very slow rate. Pretreatment of the acetyltrypsinogen with diisopropyl fluorophosphate and soybean trypsin inhibitor did not affect the rate at which it carried out these two reactions, thus excluding the presence of trypsin or acetyltrypsin. The conclusion is drawn that the activities observed were not due to contamination of the zymogen preparations with active enzyme but were due to an activity inherent in the zymogens. The S-shaped curve of trypsinogen activation is now interpreted as two separate phases: a slow initial formation of trypsin by self-activation of the zymogen, followed by a rapid acceleration of the reaction due to catalysis by the product, trypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1512444837,"Abstract The phenylalanine inhibition of skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase has been further studied. Even at high levels of the inhibitor the plots of reaction rates as a function of phosphoenolpyruvate concentration give hyperbolic curves; the inhibition by phenylalanine is of the mixed type. The enzyme exhibits a homotropic cooperative effect with respect to this inhibitor. This property is strongly dependent on pH. Serine, cysteine, and alanine reversed this inhibition. The reactivating amino acids greatly increase the I0.5 but do not alter the cooperativity of the inhibitor. These effects were not found with 2-phosphoglyceric acid, an isosteric inhibitor. In fact, the inhibition is independent of pH and it is not reversed by the amino acids. Furthermore the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to this inhibitor. The reassociation of the enzyme from its subunits markedly decreases the homotropic cooperative effect of phenylalanine. It is concluded that this amino acid is an allosteric inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1543393685,"Abstract A polysaccharide composed of 3-O-methyl-d-mannose and d-mannose in the molar proportion of 10:2 has been isolated from Mycobacterium phlei. This methylmannose polysaccharide (MMP) did not contain acidic or basic groups, acyl esters, or a reducing end. MMP had a molecular weight of 2084 ± 35 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium and had a partial specific volume of 0.663 cc per g as found both by sedimentation equilibrium and summation of the molal volumes of the hexose residues. The structure of MMP was investigated by methylation analysis, Smith degradation, and immunochemistry. In order to distinguish between mannose and 3-O-methylmannose residues in the polysaccharide after exhaustive methylation, MMP was isolated from cells grown in the presence of l-[methyl-14C]methionine, under conditions which resulted in the incorporation of radioactivity exclusively into the methyl groups of the 3-O-methylmannose residues. Exhaustive methylation of [methyl-14C]MMP with nonradioactive methyl iodide and hydrolysis of the fully methylated polysaccharide yielded radioactive 2,3,6-tri-O-methylmannose as the major component. Radioactive 2,3-di-O-methylmannose, and nonradioactive 3,4,6-tri-O-methylmannose and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylmannose were obtained as minor components. These findings showed that all of the 3-O-methylmannose residues were (1 → 4)-linked with 1 residue containing a substituent at position 6 as well. One of the two mannose residues was (1 → 2)-linked and the other occupied a terminal position in the polysaccharide. Smith degradation of MMP converted the 2 mannose residues to glycerol and ethylene glycol, yielding a polysaccharide containing only 3-O-methylmannose. Exhaustive methylation of Smith-degraded [methyl-14C]MMP and hydrolysis of the fully methylated polysaccharide yielded radioactive 2,3,6-tri-O-methylmannose as the major component, although a small quantity of radioactive 2,3-di-O-methylmannose and a trace of radioactive 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylmannose were still detected. With some slight discrepancies, these results indicate that the ten 3-O-methylmannose residues are (1 → 4)-linked and occur in a homologous chain which probably forms a macrocyclic ring. The 2 mannose residues are attached to each other in a (1 → 2)-linkage and occur as a nonreducing end of the polysaccharide, or as a side chain on the postulated macrocyclic ring. Further evidence in support of a (1 → 2)-linked mannobiose side chain was provided by testing MMP as an inhibitor of the precipitin reaction between Kloeckera brevis phosphomonoester mannan and antisera obtained against whole cells of the yeast. MMP and α-(1 → 2)-linked mannotriose were equally effective as inhibitors of this precipitin reaction, which is specific for α-(1 → 2)-linked mannose residues at a terminus. Smith-degraded MMP, which had the mannobiose side chain removed, failed to inhibit the precipitin reaction. These results confirm the presence of at least 2 α-(1 → 2)-linked mannose residues at a terminal position of MMP."

Although the amount of myofibrillar protein increased during the 4-day period, the concentration of this component decreased. Microsomes prepared from hypertrophied muscle had an increased RNA concentration. The combined microsomes and pH-5 enzyme from hypertrophied muscle supported a faster rate of protein synthesis in vitro than the same system prepared from an equal weight of contralateral muscle which was used as a control."

https://openalex.org/W1963917863,In the morphogenesis of embryonic feather germs the formation of dermal cell groupings is associated with the development of a highly regular pattern of birefringence in the dermis. This birefringence is due to a lattice-like system of collagenous tracts along which dermal cells become progressively aligned and grouped in regularly spaced sites. The experimental results suggest that this fibrous lattice is of major significance in the morphogenesis of feather germs and in their characteristic pattern of distribution.

https://openalex.org/W1509618688,"Abstract Fatty acid synthetase from lactating rat mammary gland is shown to be a cold-labile multienzyme complex. The native (13 S) form slowly dissociates into half-molecular weight (9 S) subunits on aging in the cold. Fatty acid synthetase activity observed on addition of the 9 S subunits to the assay system between 20 and 30°, is shown to result from rapid reassociation of the subunits to the 13 S form. Dissociation of the enzyme into subunits is accompanied by a change in the number of protein sulfhydryl groups accessible to 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), but reassociation to the parent form is not dependent on the presence of a reduced thiol. The dissociation does not involve oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups, as the total number of sulfhydryl groups titratable with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) in the presence of 6 m urea was the same in the native enzyme and its subunits. Blocking more than two of the 28 subunit sulfhydryl groups with p-chloromercuribenzoate restricted the ability of the subunits to undergo heat-induced reassociation. Evidence is presented which suggests that although protein sulfhydryl groups may be involved in the dissociation-reassociation phenomenon, hydrophobic bonding is probably a more critical factor. Similar studies carried out with the fatty acid synthetase purified from rat liver indicate that this enzyme too exhibits cold lability."

Conversely, single rats subjected to jump threshold measurements or to shocks identical to those used in the aggression paradigm show significant elevations in tail blood pressure.

These changes were accompanied by a twofold increase in the activity of the ornithine-urea cycle as measured in liver slices. The activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase rose threefold in frogs adapted to saline. These results suggest that changes in activities of urea cycle enzymes may be important in the adaptation of aquatic organisms to environments of varying salinities.
https://openalex.org/W2131399220,"Activation of aerobically aged rat liver and Pseudomonas acidovorans tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.1.12) by reducing agents was studied in an attempt to define the chemical nature of the species which achieves the reduction. With the use of two enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase, reductive activation by sodium ascorbate, sodium borohydride, hydroperoxide, and dithiothreitol was shown to be caused by superoxide, O2-, and hydroperoxide, H2O2, as well as by direct reduction, i.e. direct transfer of electrons from the added compound to the enzyme. The ability of catalase to prevent the activation of tryptophan oxygenase by tryptophan indicates this activation involves processes similar to the reducing agents. A study of the effect of binding of nonproductive tryptophan analogues to the catalytic or allosteric sites of the pseudomonad enzyme showed the involvement of the catalytic site in activation by sodium ascorbate. Activation by tryptophan was shown to require a substrate or catalysis. The nonspecific nature of reductive activation of tryptophan oxygenase supports the view that oxidative inactivation of the enzyme is an artifact of handling and purification."

https://openalex.org/W1483972651,"Abstract The inactivation of yeast pyruvate kinase at temperatures near 0° and the stabilization achieved by addition of 50% glycerol or 0.1 m KCl and 24 mm MgCl2 recently documented (Kuczenski, R. T., and Suelter, C. H., Biochemistry, 9, 939, 1970) prompted an examination of the effects of glycerol and other cryoprotectants on the kinetic activity of this enzyme. We now report that addition of glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, trimethylphosphine oxide, or dextran to an assay mixture containing less than Km levels of substrates activates yeast pyruvate kinase often to the same extent as that observed by addition of the positive modifier, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, in the absence of the cryoprotectant. Maximum effects were observed with 33% glycerol, 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 14% trimethylphosphine oxide. The activation by glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide at 30° results from a lowering of the Km for phosphoenolpyruvate from 1.1 mm to 0.3 to 0.4 mm and the Hill slope (nh) from 3.1 to 2.1. Kinetic analysis at 0° in the absence of the cryoprotectant gave a Km of 0.13 mm and nh = 0.94. These changes in the kinetics of yeast pyruvate kinase are discussed in terms of the effect of temperature and solvent on the structure of both water and enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1941698939,"Abstract The possible role of tyrosine residues in the catalytic function of bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease A (DNase) has been investigated. Nitration of the DNase with tetranitromethane resulted in a highly selective modification involving a single tyrosine side chain. However, a significant side reaction was observed throughout the course of the nitration; side products consisting of covalently cross-linked polymers of DNase were formed, and more than 50% of the enzyme was polymerized at reagent concentrations as low as 5-fold those of DNase. The monomeric fraction was isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and the loss of enzymatic activity was shown to parallel the formation of a single 3-nitrotyrosine residue per enzyme molecule. Peptides containing 3-nitrotyrosine were isolated from tryptic and chymotryptic digests of the nitrated DNase. Compositions and yields of these peptides indicated that nitration had occurred at a single primary site on the enzyme. Acetylation of the available tyrosine side chains in native DNase with N-acetylimidazole caused a total loss of activity against calf thymus DNA as substrate. Seven to eight of the 16 tyrosine residues in DNase were acetylated. Activity could be rapidly restored by the action of hydroxylamine; consequently an irreversible structural rearrangement had not occurred as a result of the acetylation. Spectrophotometric titration of native DNase indicated that between eight and nine tyrosine side chains were ionized in the pH range from 7 to 11, in good agreement with the results obtained by acetylation. A specific Ca2+-binding site on DNase was destroyed by the nitration of a single tyrosine residue. Ca2+ was no longer able to stabilize the nitrated enzyme against thermal denaturation, chymotryptic digestion, or mercaptoethanol reduction of an essential disulfide linkage. A comparison of the optical rotatory behavior of the native and nitrated DNase clearly indicated that, unlike the native enzyme, nitrated DNase did not undergo a conformational rearrangement upon addition of Ca2+. These results suggest that the substrate site and the specific Ca2+-binding site are interdependent and probably in close proximity on the enzyme molecule. The essential histidine residue in DNase was shown to undergo the same Cu2+-facilitated alkylation at the nitrogen-3 position in the inactive, nitrated enzyme as has been reported for native DNase. Also, the Ca2+-mediated refolding of mercaptoethanol-reduced nitrotyrosyl-DNase was similar to that exhibited by the native enzyme in that both disulfide bonds were rapidly re-formed in the absence of excess reducing agent. These results further indicate that a major conformational change was not induced by the specific nitration reaction and points to the existence of a second Ca2+-binding site on the enzyme, a site which is unaffected by nitration."

The necessary specificity is achieved by precipitation of labeled S100 in antibody excess with carrier S100 and anti-S100 antibody, followed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized precipitate in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The specificity of the method is shown by applying the technique to cell lines which do not synthesize S100. Quantitative recovery is demonstrated by a second precipitation from a labeled glial cell extract. The differential rate of S100 protein synthesis in confluent CHB4 cells is 0.06%. The S100 protein in confluent cultures of CHB4 appears to be quite stable when compared to total protein, and is not rapidly degraded."

These subunits retained most of the cold-agglutinin activity as well as the specificity of the parent antibodies. However, as might be anticipated from theories of the importance of antibody size and number of subunits for complement binding, the IgM subunits were only very weakly lytic compared with the intact cold agglutinins. The findings are consistent with the presence of ten antibody-combining sites on the IgM molecule."

(eight or more times that tolerated by methicillin-sensitive (MS) strains), are also resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, including other semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins1–7. They can cause major disease6−11 and thus may pose a serious therapeutic problem."
https://openalex.org/W1551667110,"Abstract Rabbit muscle 5'-AMP aminohydrolase was shown to be susceptible to a protein concentration-dependent, dilution-induced inactivation at protein concentrations used in normal spectrophotometric assays; i.e. 0.5 µg per ml. Inactivation was less evident at saturating concentrations of substrate and at pH 6.3. These properties accounted for the AMP concentration versus initial velocity profiles which at pH 7.0 and 0.5 µg of enzyme per ml were sigmoidal but hyperbolic at 50 µg per ml; at pH 6.3 substrate saturation versus initial velocity profiles were hyperbolic at both protein concentrations. Kinetic parameters for deamination of AMP determined by stopped flow spectrophotometry at 50 µg per ml where dilution inactivation was not observed are reported as a function of pH. The potassium-activated enzyme exhibits normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the pH range 6.15 to 7.2; Vmax = 1730 ± 260 µmoles min-1 mg-1 at 30° and is invariant over the same pH range; Km increases slightly at the higher pH."
https://openalex.org/W2026140075,"“METHICILLIN resistance” has been found in a number of strains of staphylococcus isolated in French hospitals. Chabbert and Baudens1 found in 1961 that ten of eighty-two strains investigated (12 per cent) were resistant to methicillin. In 1962 they found twenty-one resistant strains out of 127 (17 per cent), and in 1963 twenty-six out of 134 (19 per cent)2,3. Courtieu et al.4 found a similar picture in their investigation of hospitals in other parts of France. In 1964 they found thirty-one resistant strains out of 216 (14 per cent). The frequency found in France seems to be different from that found among strains isolated in England and the United States5–8."
https://openalex.org/W1523314161,"Abstract The p-nitrophenyl esters of a homologous series of straight chain fatty acids were used as substrates for elastase and chymotrypsin. The net second order catalytic constants for enzymatic hydrolysis were divided by the saponification rate constants to correct for the inherent reactivity of each substrate. Enzyme specificity is discussed in terms of these corrected specificity constants. As the straight chain length increases, the specificity constants for both enzymes increase regularly to a maximum and then decline. The respective optimum chain length for each enzyme is consistent with known reactivities with other substrates and inhibitors as well as with the structure of the enzyme active site as revealed by x-ray crystallography. The data are viewed as supporting the previous finding that the specificity constant of chymotrypsin provides a sound basis for assessing the specificity of this enzyme in its most meaningful form. In addition it appears warranted to use the specificity constant as a basis for assessing and discussing elastase specificity. Evidence is presented that contrary to a prior report in the literature, the chymotrypsin catalyzed hydrolysis of m- and o-carboxyphenyl heptanoate is best described as rate-determining deacylation rather than rate-determining acylation. Several of the deacylation rate constants reported here are significantly smaller than have been previously reported under similar conditions. The present results for the series acetate through hexanoate are compared with a previously investigated micellar catalyst and found to exhibit a greater activation free energy increment per CH2 group. More interesting is the appearance of odd-even alternation with side chain carbon number in the log rate constant. This is interpreted as suggesting a certain degree of conformational rigidity and the possibility that several substrate side chains interact in the enzyme-substrate complex."

Animals irradiated during metestrus or the day thereafter exhibit significant increases in the factors studied, while those irradiated on the 3rd day after metestrus maintain fewer implantations after exposure to 300, 500, and 600 roentgens, and fewer living fetuses after exposure to 100 to 600 roentgens."

https://openalex.org/W2171791566,"Abstract 5-Hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate synthetase (HMPG synthetase) catalyzes hydrolysis and acyl transfer reactions with δ-substituted α-ketoglutarates, presumably through the formation of an α-ketoglutaryl enzyme intermediate. With α-ketoglutaramate as the substrate, maximal velocities of 18, 26, and 36 are observed for acyl transfer to water, methylamine, and ethanolamine, respectively. The corresponding maximal velocities with ethyl α-ketoglutarate as the acyl donor are 19, 38, and 68. These results suggest that both acylation and deacylation are partially rate limiting for reactions involving α-ketoglutaramate and ethyl α-ketoglutarate. Aliphatic alcohols increase the rate of hydrolysis of α-ketoglutaramate and ethyl α-ketoglutarate. These rate accelerations increase with increasing chain length of the alcohol until a maximal value is reached and are interpreted as a specific effect on the rate of deacylation of the acyl enzyme. Based on this assumption, the rate of transfer of the acyl group from the enzyme to water, to methylamine, and to ethanolamine has been calculated and found to be independent on the nature of the acyl donor. In contrast to the effects observed on hydrolysis, aliphatic alcohols act as competitive inhibitors with respect to amines in acyl transfer reactions and thus provide evidence for an amine-binding site on the enzyme. Organic solvents increase both hydrolysis and transfer reactions involving amines; however, these effects can be distinguished from those of alcohols by several kinetic criteria."

https://openalex.org/W1998297372,An analysis is undertaken to determine the continuous distribution of circulation rates which would be necessary for a single tissue type to display a simple exponential response for the exchange of a solute with blood. It is shown that there can be no more than one real solution. This indicates that heterogeneous circulation cannot be invoked to explain anomalies to the popular assumption that blood perfusion is the process limiting the rate of blood-tissue exchange.

https://openalex.org/W1606510090,"Abstract The α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the p-nitroanilides of glutaryl- and succinyl-l-phenylalanine and of N-acetyl-l-tyrosine has been studied over a range of enzyme concentrations in which the percentage of monomer decreases from more than 99.8% to less than 34%. The measurements were made at 22.5° and pH 6.2 in 0.2 m ionic strength phosphate buffer, so that the results of an ultracentrifuge study of α-chymotrypsin oligomerization (Rao, M. S. N., and Kegeles, G., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 80, 5724 (1958)) could be used to calculate the distribution of the enzyme among monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms. The hydrolysis of all three substrates was found to be first order in substrate concentration and first order in monomer concentration. Within experimental error, second order rate constants deduced from stopped flow measurements at high enzyme concentrations by assuming that oligomers are inactive were found to equal those derived from the effect of substrate concentration on catalysis by monomeric α-chymotrypsin. The simplest interpretation of the results of this study is that only monomeric α-chymotrypsin is catalytically active. This conclusion contradicts an earlier report (Inagami, T., and Sturtevant, J. M., Biochemistry, 4, 1330 (1965)) that oligomers must be assumed active in the α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tyrosine p-nitroanilide."
