https://openalex.org/W2088513299,"Metazoan organisms may discriminate between self and non-self not only by the presence of foreign antigens but also by the absence of normal self markers. Mammalian adaptive immune responses use the first strategy, with the additional requirement that foreign antigens are recognized in the context of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products at the cell surface. Aberrant cells which fail to express MHC products adequately can therefore avoid detection. A more primitive but complementary defence system, eliminating such cells on the basis of absent self-markers, is suggested by a re-interpretation of phenomena associated with metastasis and natural resistance. We now show that murine lymphoma cells selected for loss of H-2 expression are less malignant after low-dose inoculation in syngeneic hosts than are wild-type cells, and that the rejection of such cells is non-adaptive. On the basis of our data, we suggest that natural killer cells are effector cells in a defence system geared to detect the deleted or reduced expression of self-MHC."
https://openalex.org/W1969331809,"The wild-type functions of the genes ced-3 and ced-4 are required for the initiation of programmed cell deaths in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The reduction or loss of ced-3 or ced-4 function results in a transformation in the fates of cells that normally die; in ced-3 or ced-4 mutants, such cells instead survive and differentiate, adopting fates that in the wild type and associated with other cells. ced-3 and ced-4 mutants appear grossly normal in morphology and behavior, indicating that programmed cell death is not an essential aspect of nematode development. The genes ced-3 and ced-4 define the first known step of a developmental pathway for programmed cell death, suggesting that these genes may be involved in determining which cells die during C. elegans development."

This isochronic course of synaptogenesis in anatomically and functionally diverse regions indicates that the entire cerebral cortex develops as a whole and that the establishment of cell-to-cell communication in this structure may be orchestrated by a single genetic or humoral signal. This is in contrast to the traditional view of hierarchical development of the cortical regions and provides new insight into the maturation of cortical functions."
https://openalex.org/W1971908328,"In the fission yeast S. pombe the cdc25+ gene function is required to initiate mitosis. We have cloned the cdc25+ gene and have found that increased cdc25+ expression causes mitosis to initiate at a reduced cell size. This shows that cdc25+ functions as a dosage-dependent inducer in mitotic control, the first such mitotic control element to be specifically identified. DNA sequencing of the cdc25+ gene has shown that it can encode a protein of MW 67,000. Evidence is described showing that cdc25+ functions to counteract the activity of the mitotic inhibitor wee1+, and indicating that both mitotic control elements act independently to regulate the initiation of mitosis."

For DNA molecules, this effect can be overcome by the simple procedure of periodically inverting the electric field. Tuning the frequency of the field inversions from 10 to 0.01 hertz, makes it possible to resolve selectively DNA's in the size range 15 to greater than 700 kilobase pairs."

https://openalex.org/W1587299930,"We have developed a new method for the isolation of proteins for microsequencing. It consists of electrophoretic transfer (electroblotting) of proteins or their cleavage fragments onto activated glass filter paper sheets immediately after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins are immobilized on the glass fiber sheets by ionic interactions or by covalent attachment. A wide range of proteins can be prepared in this fashion with no apparent restriction due to solubility, size, charge, or other intrinsic properties of the proteins. As little as 50 ng of the transferred proteins can be detected using Coomassie Blue or fluorescent dye staining procedures and even smaller amounts of radiolabeled proteins by autoradiography. After detection, the protein-containing bands or spots are cut out and inserted directly into a gas-phase sequenator. The piece of glass fiber sheet acts as a support for the protein during the sequencing. Amounts of protein in the 5- to 150-pmol range can be sequenced, and extended runs can be obtained from the blotted samples because of improved stepwise yields and lower backgrounds. The method has been successfully applied to the sequencing of a variety of proteins and peptides isolated from one-dimensional and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W1981587090,"Splicing in vitro of a messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor (pre-mRNA) is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the C proteins (anti-C) of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA)-ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles. This antibody, 4F4, inhibits an early step of the reaction: cleavage at the 3' end of the upstream exon and the formation of the intron lariat. In contrast, boiled 4F4, or a different monoclonal antibody (designated 2B12) to the C proteins, or antibodies to other hnRNP proteins (120 and 68 kilodaltons) and nonimmune mouse antibodies have no inhibitory effect. The 4F4 antibody does not prevent the adenosine triphosphate-dependent formation of a 60S splicing complex (spliceosome). Furthermore, the 60S splicing complex contains C proteins, and it can be immunoprecipitated with 4F4. Depletion of C proteins from the splicing extract by immunoadsorption with either of the two monoclonal antibodies to the C proteins (4F4 or 2B12) results in the loss of splicing activity, whereas mock-depletion with nonimmune mouse antibodies bodies has no effect. A 60S splicing complex does not form in a C protein-depleted nuclear extract. These results indicate an essential role for proteins of the hnRNP complex in the splicing of mRNA precursors."

https://openalex.org/W2158385323,"The peripheral nervous system of vertebrates arises from the neural crest and the ectodermal placodes. Construction of quail-chick chimaeras has provided significant information on the migration and fate of the neural crest and placodal cells. Transplantation of neural crest tissue to various sites in these chimaeras has demonstrated that the differentiation of neural crest cells is controlled by environmental influences during their migration and, particularly, during gangliogenesis. Experiments with in vitro and monoclonal antibody techniques have shown that these environmental cues act on a heterogeneous population of neural crest cells whose developmental potencies are partly restricted to definite differentiation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2133899724,"Paternal and maternal genomes apparently have complementary roles during embryogenesis in the mouse, and both are essential for development to term. However, there is no direct evidence to show that functional differences between parental genomes remain intact after activation of the embryonic genome at the 2-cell stage. In this study we demonstrate that transfer of paternal or maternal nuclei from early haploid preimplantation embryos back to fertilized eggs from which one pronucleus was removed resulted in development to term, but only if the remaining pronucleus was of the parental type opposite to the donor nucleus. Hence, functional differences between parental chromosomes are heritable and they survive activation of the embryonic genome and probable reprogramming of donor embryonic nuclei by epigenetic factors in the egg cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2121959523,"X-ray fiber diffraction analysis of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has led to the building of a molecular model of the intact virus, based on a map at 3.6 A resolution derived from five separated Bessel orders. This has been made possible by advances in the solution of the fiber diffraction phase problem. It is now possible to understand much of the chemical basis of TMV assembly, particularly in terms of intersubunit electrostatic interactions and RNA binding. Consideration of the molecular structure in conjunction with physical chemical studies by several groups of investigators suggests that the nucleating aggregate for initiation of TMV assembly is a short (about two turns) helix of protein subunits, probably inhibited from further polymerization in the absence of RNA by the disordering of peptide loop near the inner surface of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2059163294,"In all vertebrate groups, the progenitors of the germ line, the primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise extragonadally and move to the developing gonad early in embryonic development. We have examined the behavior of isolated pregonadal and gonadal PGCs in vitro on feeder layers of an embryo-derived cell line. Histochemically and serologically identified pregonadal germ cells are found to be actively motile in vitro and, furthermore, show behavior characteristic of invasive cells. PGCs isolated from the developing gonad, however, show little locomotory activity and are not invasive on the same cellular substrate. These observations suggest that PGCs undergo a major change in phenotype at the time of their entry into the gonad anlagen."
https://openalex.org/W2005415007,"The genetic loci fushi tarazu (ftz), hairy (h), and engrailed (en) must be expressed during embryogenesis for the correct segmental organization of the Drosophila embryo to be established. Transcripts from these genes accumulate in periodic patterns at the blastoderm stage of development. We demonstrate that generation of the normal pattern of ftz RNA requires the h+ function whereas formation of the h pattern does not require the ftz gene. In addition, we show that the en pattern is altered in both h and ftz mutant embryos. The nature of these changes and the cuticular phenotype of h mutant larvae suggest that both h and ftz phenotypes are a consequence of incorrect compartmentalization and that the effect of h is mediated via ftz and other genes."
https://openalex.org/W2006551065,"Early in life, abnormal visual experience may disrupt the developmental processes required for the maturation and maintenance of normal visual function. The effects of retinal image deprivation (monocular form deprivation) on four psychophysical functions were investigated in rhesus monkeys to determine if the sensitive period is of the same duration for all types of visual information processing. The basic spectral sensitivity functions of rods and cones have relatively short sensitive periods of development (3 and 6 months) when compared to more complex functions such as monocular spatial vision or resolution (25 months) and binocular vision (greater than 25 months). Therefore, there are multiple, partially overlapping sensitive periods of development and the sensitive period for each specific visual function is probably different."

https://openalex.org/W1527418628,"Heparin and heparin oligosaccharides prepared by nitrous acid depolymerization were fractionated by affinity chromatography on immobilized antithrombin and by gel chromatography. The anticoagulant activities of high affinity heparin of Mr greater than or equal to 7,800 could be readily neutralized by the plasma protein histidine-rich glycoprotein (see also Lijnen, H.R., Hoylaerts, M., and Collen, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3803-3808), whereas oligosaccharides falling below 18 saccharide units (Mr 5,400) became increasingly resistant to neutralization. An octasaccharide with characteristic marked ability to accelerate the inactivation of Factor Xa by antithrombin retained greater than 50% of its activity even at a histidine-rich glycoprotein/oligosaccharide molar ratio of 500:1. Histidine-rich glycoprotein, like the platelet-derived heparin neutralizing protein platelet factor 4 (Lane, D.A., Denton, J., Flynn, A.M., Thunberg, L. and Lindahl, U. (1984) Biochem J. 218, 725-732), therefore requires interaction with saccharide sequences in addition to the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide of heparin in order to efficiently express its antiheparin activity. Heparan sulfate isolated from pig intestinal mucosa (HS I, Mr approximately 20,000) and from human aorta (HS II, Mr approximately 40,000) exhibited anti-Factor Xa activities of 180 and 20 units/micromol [corrected], respectively. A fraction corresponding to about 5% of HS I bound with high affinity to immobilized antithrombin and contained all of the anticoagulant activity of the starting material. While these heparan sulfates were readily neutralized by platelet factor 4, they were relatively resistant to neutralization by histidine-rich glycoprotein, although complete neutralization could be attained in the presence of molar excess of this protein. These findings may be of importance in relation (a) to the functional role of endogenous anticoagulant polysaccharides at the vascular wall and (b) to clinical situations in which heparin or heparin-related compounds are administered as exogenous anticoagulants."
https://openalex.org/W2058938422,"An electrophysiological stimulation paradigm similar to one that produces Pavlovian conditioning was applied to synaptic inputs to pyramidal neurons of hippocampal brain slices. Persistent synaptic enhancement was induced in one of two weak synaptic inputs by pairing high-frequency electrical stimulation of the weak input with stimulation of a third, stronger input to the same region. Forward (temporally overlapping) but not backward (temporally separate) pairings caused this enhancement. Thus hippocampal synapses in vitro can undergo the conditional and selective type of associative modification that could provide the substrate for some of the mnemonic functions in which the hippocampus is thought to participate."
https://openalex.org/W2074130456,"Anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id) that contain an internal image component that mimics the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) were used to immunize chimpanzees. Four injections of the rabbit anti-Id preparation elicited an antibody response to HBsAg (anti-HBs). The antibody specificity appeared to be against the anti-Id, since the anti-Id immunogen was shown to bind the chimpanzee anti-HBs. Two chimpanzees immunized with the anti-Id, along with two control animals that were either untreated or received a nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulin G preparation, were challenged with infectious hepatitis B virus. Both control chimpanzees developed clinical and serological characteristics consistent with an active hepatitis B virus infection, whereas the two anti-Id treated chimpanzees were protected from infection. Since chimpanzees provide a relevant model of a human response to hepatitis B virus immunization and infection, these results indicate that anti-Id preparations such as that described here might be candidates for vaccines against human diseases."

A monoclonal anti-anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab3) of IgG1 isotype was obtained after immunization of mice. The Ab3 and the Ab1 showed identical binding specificities and bound with similar avidities to the same tumor antigen. The induction of Ab1-like Ab3 by Ab2 was not restricted to mice, since Ab3 could also be induced in rabbits. Both the mouse- and the rabbit-derived Ab3 bound the same gastrointestinal cancer-associated antigen as Ab1. These findings indicate that Ab2 induced the formation of antigen-specific Ab3, probably because it bears the internal image of the tumor-associated antigen. This Ab2 may therefore have potential for modulating the immune response of cancer patients to their tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1590154399,"Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) purified after microtubule assembly cycles from bovine brain had been shown to contain about 10 esterified phosphates (mol/mol), which were relatively phosphatase resistant and essentially confined to the projection domain which contributes to the visible arms on microtubules. The kinase responsible for phosphorylating these sites had not been identified. We have approached this question by using a phosphatase that releases the bulk of these residues and then determining which kinase can now add additional residues corresponding to those released. Three kinases were chosen because of their abundance in brain and/or proximity to microtubules. Of these only Ca/phospholipid-dependent kinase was able to recognize the previously occupied sites. We also found that MAP-2 isolated from rat brain without assembly cycles contained more phosphate than previously recognized, greater than 30 mol/mol, suggesting that 20 of these had been inadvertently released by phosphatase during assembly cycles. All 3 kinases (Ca/phospholipid-dependent, cAMP-dependent, and Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) recognized more sites in the bovine than in the rat MAP-2."

Nucleotides at certain positions in the operator are conserved in all sites, as are amino acids at certain positions in the recognition alpha-helices of repressor and Cro. Here we focus on one of the conserved amino acids, a serine found at position 2 of each recognition helix. We show that, contrary to a previous model, both serines contact the same conserved position in the operator, position 4. We suggest a simplified view of how repressor and Cro recognized similar operator sites but distinguish differently among them."
https://openalex.org/W1565144839,"Total lipid, sucrose, glucose, sorbitol and myo-inositol contents in individual layers from normal and alloxan-diabetic rabbit retinas were measured using gravimetric and enzymatic microtechniques. Pure samples of nine retinal layers were microdissected from freeze-dried retinal cryosections. The lipid content was measured by loss of weight after ethanol and hexane extraction. Retinal lipid varied 3-fold across the retina and was not influenced by diabetes. Sucrose, glucose, sorbitol, and myo-inositol were measured with fluorimetric microassays. Sucrose infused intravenously prior to sampling the tissue did not traverse the outer blood retinal barrier of the normal or the diabetic retina. In both normals and diabetics, glucose followed a diffusional curve, with outer and inner retinal concentrations, respectively, equal to choroidal blood and vitreal glucose concentrations. Sorbitol was elevated in all retinal layers of diabetic animals. The peak sorbitol concentrations, of 2 mmol/kg defatted dry weight in diabetics, were not high enough to be osmotically significant. Retinal myo-inositol, of the order found in brain tissue (10-30 mmol/kg defatted dry tissue), was decreased by 22-40% in all retinal layers of the diabetics. The results indicate that diabetes affects the metabolism of retinal structures independently of the small blood vessel disease that is the hallmark of diabetes of long duration. It is conceivable that primary intraretinal metabolic alterations cause, aggravate, or perpetuate the well known degenerative processes that occur in retinal blood vessels in diabetes."

Stationary flickering patterns were presented to each eye, and the resulting fused pattern was perceived to be moving. To determine direction of motion, the visual system seems to integrate image components differing by 90 degrees in spatial and temporal phase. On the other hand, image speed seems to be derived from displacement of features over time. A model of neural direction selectivity is discussed in light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W1521087309,"Biotinidase has been purified from human serum to a specific activity of 1900 units/mg protein by a five-step procedure. After ammonium sulfate precipitation (33-55% cut) it was purified by DEAE-Sephacel, hydroxylapatite, octyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The purified enzyme showed a single silver staining band with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions. Biotinidase is a glycoprotein. The sialic acid residues in the molecule are not required for enzyme activity. The Mr of human serum biotinidase estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Ferguson plot) and by sedimentation analysis was 68,000. Human serum biotinidase showed maximum activity in the pH range 6.0 to 7.5 with N-(d-biotinyl) p-aminobenzoate as substrate. However, with biocytin as substrate, the maximal activity of the enzyme was in the pH range 4.5 to 6.0. Using structural analogs of the substrate we have shown that biotinidase is not a general proteolytic enzyme and has specific structural requirements in the substrate for hydrolysis."

In older embryos and in adults these antigens are localized in discrete laminae within the inner and outer synaptic layers. The antibody binds to several gangliosides that undergo both qualitative and quantitative changes during neuronal development (Grunwald, G.B., Fredman, P., Magnani, J.L., Trisler, D., Ginsburg, V., and Nirenberg, M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 4008-4012). The simplest of these gangliosides was isolated from lipid extracts of 10-day chick embryonic retinas by DEAE-Sepharose and silicic acid column chromatography. About 300 micrograms was obtained from 9.3 g (wet weight) of retina. The isolated ganglioside was identified as GT3 by enzymatic analysis and by a comparison of its properties with the authentic ganglioside. By immunostaining thin-layer chromatograms with antibody 18B8, GT3 was detected in gangliosides from human neural tissue including cerebellum, optic nerve, and spinal cord, but not in gangliosides from human liver, pancreas, small intestine, adrenals, thyroid, or erythrocytes. GT3 was also found in five of seven human melanoma cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1513874533,"Abstract The complete covalent structure of a cytochrome P-450, form 4, isolated from liver microsomes of beta-naphthoflavone-induced rabbits was determined. The S-carboxyamidomethylated protein was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, endoproteinase Lys-C, and trypsin before and after succinylation. Selected peptides from CNBr digests of alkylated rabbit cytochrome P-450 forms 3a and 3c were also isolated and sequenced. Form 4 exhibited microheterogeneity due to the presence of several truncated forms. The existence of multiple NH2-terminal residues for form 4 was confirmed by the isolation and sequence analysis of the corresponding tryptic peptides. The predominant form contained 514 residues, corresponding to Mr 58,030. A peptide having Gly-232 and Gln-246 replaced by Ser and Asn residues, respectively, was also found in the isozyme preparation investigated here. The amino acid sequences of form 4 and selected peptide sequences from forms 3a and 3c were compared with the primary structures of forms 2 and 3b (previously determined in this laboratory). This comparison identified some 90 invariant residues. A cysteinyl residue at position 456, earlier reported as the heme-binding cysteine 436 (Heineman, F. S., and Ozols, J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14988-14999), was also present in forms 4, 3a, and 3c. Other single invariant residues identified were form 4/forms 2,3b, Trp-132/121, and His 270/252. The tyrosyl residues at positions 71/62 and 365/348 were also invariant. The latter is present in the conserved segment of the protein, residues 363/346 to 375/359, and may be involved in the substrate binding of cytochrome P-450. Also a lysyl residue, formerly identified by other laboratories to be involved in the electron transfer between the reductase and cytochrome P-450 form 2, was invariant in all five species. This lysyl residue corresponds to Lys-402 in form 4 or Lys-384 in the other forms."
https://openalex.org/W1522778435,"Bovine Factor X is isolated in two chromatographically separable forms, Factor X1 and Factor X2. Whereas only a single form of Factor Xa, the active protease, exists, the activation peptides also exist as two chromatographically distinct species. These peptides have been shown to differ at a tyrosyl residue by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and in their composition after alkaline hydrolysis. On the basis of the spectral properties, and elution position of the modified tyrosine on Dowex 1 columns and on an amino acid analyzer, it has been concluded that Factor X2 contains a tyrosyl-O-SO4 residue at position 18 in the activation peptide whereas Factor X1 contains only tyrosine. Alternative explanations such as differences in carbohydrate composition, differences in phosphate content, or differences in the number of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues were demonstrated to be unrelated to the difference in chromatographic behavior between bovine Factors X1 and X2."
https://openalex.org/W1498464386,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step of the pathway that is the principal source of NADPH in many cells. Earlier studies of cells from several species indicated that the intracellular enzyme is under severe and unexplained restraint or inhibition. Moreover, the intracellular enzyme of human erythrocytes exhibits sigmoid kinetics, whereas the purified enzyme exhibits only classical kinetics. We here report that most of the NADP in the human erythrocyte is bound by soluble proteins. In addition, the fraction of unbound NADP that is in the oxidized form, [NADP+]/[NADP], varies in a sigmoid manner relative to the fraction of bound NADP that is in the oxidized form. These features of intracellular binding of NADP: 1) account for the previously unexplained inhibition and sigmoid kinetics of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase within human erythrocytes and 2) represent a system in which activity of a rate-limiting enzyme is largely determined by the binding and release of substrate and product by intracellular proteins other than the enzyme itself."

https://openalex.org/W1592223340,"Abstract The importance of cysteine residues on the function and regulation of calcineurin was investigated using chemical modification by sulfhydryl reagents. Calcineurin was stable toward incubation with several commonly employed reagents but not toward p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid and N-ethylmaleimide, which partially inactivated the Ca2+-supported activity and rapidly abolished its activation by Ni2+. Ni2+ provided only slight protection from inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide which argued against labeling of the Ni2+ binding site(s). In contrast, protection was provided by Ca2+; this is probably due to allosteric effects, since Ca2+ binds to the B subunit while the A subunit contains all of the cysteine residues of calcineurin. These results suggest that activation of calcineurin by Ni2+ is synergistic with Ca2+ and indicates an important role for the Ca2+-binding subunit in the activation process. Labeling of calcineurin by [14C]N-ethylmaleimide was biphasic. An initial, rapid phase was without effect on the Ni2+ activity; inactivation correlated with a second, slower phase of modification. Differential labeling in the presence and absence of Ca2+ suggested that inactivation correlates with labeling of two residues. A kinetic analysis of the reaction order indicated that modification of only one of these groups may be responsible for inactivation; thus, 1 cysteine residue on the catalytic subunit appears to be important in establishing the Ni2+-activated conformation of calcineurin."
https://openalex.org/W1482936657,"R-loop mapping of DNA:RNA hybrids formed between mutant pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs and appropriate human pro-alpha 2(I) genomic clones was employed to define the location of mutations which result in the synthesis of shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chains in skin fibroblasts from two variants of osteogenesis imperfecta. Hybridization of the genomic clone NJ-9 with pro-alpha 2(I) mRNA from a patient with a mild atypical form of the disease resulted in the identification of mutant pro-alpha 2(I) mRNA lacking the sequences which correspond to exon 11 of the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene. Exon 11, a 54-base pair exon, encodes amino acids 73 to 90 of the alpha 2(I) chain. Also, electron microscopy of R-loop structures formed between the genomic clone NJ-1 and mRNA from a variant with a perinatal lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta visualized pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs which did not hybridize to the sequences of exon 28, a 54-base pair exon coding for amino acids 448 to 465 of the alpha 2(I) chain. Moreover, nuclease S1 mapping of the variant's mutant pro-alpha 2(I) mRNA, employing the human pro-alpha 2(I) cDNA clone Hf-15, confirmed the location of the mismatch to the sequences corresponding to exon 28. Although the data do not determine the exact nature of the mutations, they illustrate the use of R-loop mapping as an alternative approach to S1 mapping analysis for the detection and localization of collagen mRNA deletions."

https://openalex.org/W1992137366,"The search for molecules controlling sex determination in mammals has been, and continues to be, a field replete with controversy. At present, there are several key questions that remain to be answered: 1) What is the relationship between the different male-specific antigens that have been defined using different immunological criteria? 2) On which chromosome (chromosomes) do the genes for these male-specific antigens reside? and 3) Do the male-specific antigens that have been studied for so many years actually play a primary role in sex determination, or do they have other (secondary) roles in this process? Historical Perspective The male-specific antigen H-Y was first discovered in the 1950s as a transplantation antigen that caused female mice of certain inbred strains to reject male skin of their own strains. Subsequently, H-Y-specific T cell responses were generated in vitro, thus facilitating assays for the antigen (for review, see Simpson, Immunology Today 3, 97-106, 1982). In the early 1970s male-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of female mice grafted with male skin. These antibodies were assumed to be directed against the H-Y antigen defined previously by transplantation, although there was no direct evidence to support this. Wachtel et al. (Nature 757, 235-236, 1975) first proposed the idea that the serologically defined H-Y antigen might be the molecule responsible for triggering testis differentiation in the gonadal anlage in embryos. According to their hypothesis, any embryo expressing the (serologically defined) H-Y antigen and its receptor would develop a testis-which, under normal circumstances, is sufficient to induce differentiation of the male genital tract. In addition, their hypothesis predicted that all individuals with a testis would be positive for the (serologically defined) H-Y antigen. Silvers et al. (Cell 28,439-440, 1982) questioned the validity of the serological typing for the male-specific antigen (antigens) for several reasons, including the variable reproducibility of the test in different laboratories. Since there was little evidence that the serological entity was the male antigen, H-Y, defined as a transplantation antigen, they suggested that it be called SDM (serologically detectable male) antigen. Studies of individuals having a sex-reversed phenotype (i.e., XY females and XX males) provide a means to test the hypothesis that the H-Y antigen is necessary for male development. In all the sex-reversal studies discussed below, H-Y typing was done with T cells, since this assay is Minireview"
https://openalex.org/W1603145956,"Monensin was used to ascertain the location in the biosynthetic pathway where the 77,000-Mr membrane-bound subunit form of dopamine beta-hydroxylase is post-translationally converted to the 73,000-Mr soluble form. Treatment with low concentrations of monensin (less than or equal to 50 nM) completely depleted the cells of the norepinephrine and dopamine, had a small effect on protein synthesis, and enhanced post-translational processing of only dopamine beta-hydroxylase which was previously synthesized and presumably packaged into neurosecretory vesicles. At these low concentrations, exit from the Golgi apparatus did not appear to be blocked since stimulated secretion of a group of high molecular weight [35S]methionine-labeled proteins was not inhibited. Treatment with higher concentrations of monensin (200 nM) prevented the secretion of the [35S] methionine-labeled proteins normally released with a secretagogue, and also prevented the secretion of [3H] mannose-labeled proteins including dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Surprisingly, a group of lower molecular weight [35S]methionine-labeled proteins was now released from monensin-treated cells. Treatment with high concentrations of monensin (greater than or equal to 200 nM) appeared to block the secretory pathway prior to the packaging step, probably in the Golgi apparatus. If the proteins were packaged prior to monensin treatment, they were released upon stimulation with secretagogues. Monensin treatment (200 nM) enabled the post-translational processing of newly synthesized dopamine beta-hydroxylase, from the 77,000-Mr to the 73,000-Mr subunit form, to go to completion. The susceptibility of this 73,000-Mr subunit form to endoglycosidase H digestion was unaltered, suggesting that dopamine beta-hydroxylase from monensin-treated cells may have the same high mannose oligosaccharide content as native dopamine beta-hydroxylase. These experiments indicate that the post-translational processing of dopamine beta-hydroxylase occurs in the Golgi apparatus and may continue in immature granules prior to their acidification."
https://openalex.org/W1601323238,"The pyridine dinucleotide-dependent dihydropteridine reductase from rat liver has been crystallized from various inorganic salts and from polyethylene glycol/ethanol mixtures using a vapor diffusion method. The crystal form most amenable to x-ray diffraction studies is monoclinic, space group C2, a = 224.3 A, b = 46.5 A, c = 94.9 A, beta = 99.0 degrees with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. These crystals grow to over 1 mm in length, diffract to at least 2.3 A resolution, and are relatively stable to irradiation with x-rays."

https://openalex.org/W1582980048,"Abstract Insecticyanin, a blue biliprotein from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, has been crystallized in a form suitable for a high resolution x-ray analysis. The crystals grow by vapor diffusion against solutions of polyethylene glycol 8000 at pH 5.5. They belong to the space group P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 115.0 A; c = 71.1 A. Insecticyanin is believed to be a tetramer in solution; there are two subunits per asymmetric unit. The crystals diffract to at least 2.2 A resolution and appear reasonably resistant to radiation damage."
https://openalex.org/W1531714303,"In the fungus Podospora anserina, the su12-1 mutation was previously found to decrease translational accuracy and to alter the ribosomal protein S7. The mutant protein is more basic than the wild type. Among the revertants of the two ribosomal mutations su12-1 and su12-2, 29 contained a second mutation very closely linked to su12. Biochemical analysis of these revertants by functional poly(U) tests and electrophoretical study of the ribosomes led to two conclusions. First, some revertant strains contain new mutant forms of S7. This suggests that su12 is the structural gene for the ribosomal protein S7. Second, the su12-2 revertants display antisuppressor properties in vivo and in vitro (i.e. increased translational accuracy). The electrophoretical patterns of their ribosomal proteins show new, more acidic, forms of S7. Therefore, su12 can be mutated towards either a lower or a greater translational accuracy corresponding to two opposite modifications of the global charge of the ribosomal protein S7. A more acidic form than wild type leads to increased accuracy and a more basic form to decreased accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W1555780532,"Hybrids were created by fusion of primary rat hepatocytes with well-differentiated Reuber H35 rat hepatoma cells. Seventeen hybrids were screened for bile acid synthesis using [26-14C]cholesterol. As [26-14C]cholesterol was converted to bile acid, 14CO2 was released. Using this assay, four hybrids (8B, 12C, 13C, and 13D) were identified which synthesized bile acid. These four hybrids also incorporated [14C]taurine into bile acid. Bile acids were identified by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and their rates of synthesis were quantitated by isotope dilution. Reuber H35 cells synthesized little or no bile acid. However, hybrids 8B, 12C, 13C, and 13D synthesized chenodeoxycholic acid, alpha-muricholic acid, and cholic acid and secreted them into the media. The rates of synthesis of individual bile acids varied among these hybrids. For example, the relative percentage of cholic acid ranged from 11.1% (hybrid 8B) to 50.4% (hybrid 13C). The bile acids synthesized and secreted by the most active hybrid, 12C, were greater than 93% conjugated. In summary, hybrids were created that retain the capacity to synthesize, conjugate, and secrete three major rat bile acid species. Such hybrids are unique model systems that will allow the study of the biochemical and genetic regulation of bile acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560933109,"The molecular interactions between components of the heparin-catalyzed antithrombin III/thrombin reaction were investigated by light scattering. When heparin was added to antithrombin III, the molecular weight increased to a maximum and then decreased to that of a 1:1 (antithrombin III X heparin) complex. The initial molecular weights at low heparin to antithrombin III ratios were consistent with the formation of a 2:1 (antithrombin III X heparin) complex in which only one antithrombin III molecule had undergone the conformational change measured by protein fluorescence enhancement. The peak molecular weight never reached that of a complete 2:1 complex. This behavior was observed for bovine and human antithrombin III in the presence of both unfractionated heparin and high molecular weight-high affinity heparin. Pentosane polysulfate also caused some multiple associations. Bovine antithrombin III and thrombin formed a 1:1 complex that underwent further aggregation within minutes, while the human proteins did not aggregate on this time scale after forming the 1:1 complex. In the presence of stoichiometric amounts of heparin, the bovine proteins formed an initial complex of Mr = 230,000 (corresponding to a dimer of heparin-antithrombin III-thrombin) which underwent further aggregation. The human proteins, however, formed a 1:1 (antithrombin III X thrombin) initial complex in the presence of heparin, followed by aggregation. These interactions of thrombin and antithrombin with heparin suggest complex interactions that could relate to heparin function."

https://openalex.org/W1543320562,"Apohemoglobin S formed a gel in the cold (5 degrees C) with a protein concentration in the supernatants after centrifugation of the gels (Csat) near 27 g/dl, in 0.02 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. Under the same experimental conditions in mixtures of apohemoglobin S and deoxyhemoglobin S the solubility of hemoglobin S in the cold was decreased from Csat greater than 40 g/dl in the absence to about 18 g/dl in the presence of apohemoglobin S. Conversely, in the same mixture, Csat of apohemoglobin S was decreased to about 5 g/dl. Also, gelling occurred in mixtures of oxyhemoglobin S and its apoderivative. Apohemoglobin A alone did not form gels; however, it induced fiber formation in deoxyhemoglobin S in the cold; unlike apohemoglobin S, it was not included in the precipitate. Gels of apohemoglobin S were not birefringent, and inspection at the electron microscope failed to show the presence of organized structures. Excluded volume effects were probably at the origin of the decreased solubility of hemoglobin S and apohemoglobin S in the presence of each other."
