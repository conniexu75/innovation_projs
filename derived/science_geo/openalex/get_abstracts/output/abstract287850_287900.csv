https://openalex.org/W2055831519,"The ontogeny of neurotransmitters in autonomic neurons proceeds through the successive stages of early expression, definitive expression, modulation, and regulation, extending from embryonic life to maturity. Although different extracellular signals influence development at different stages, a number of signals that influence development continue to govern transmitter function during maturity. The sequential ontogenetic stages parallel the progressive restriction of mutability of phenotypic expression; however, some degree of neuronal mutability appears to persist through maturity."

This occurs during the few seconds required for passage of the water across the gill, and removal proceeds unabated at ambient substrate concentrations as low as 38 nanomoles per liter."

The biosynthesis of this presumed pheromone depends on the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in plants that are ingested by the larvae. In addition, these secondary plant substances control the morphogenesis of the scent organs. This morphogenetic effect of an alkaloid has not been observed previously."
https://openalex.org/W2073995517,"Examination of the ultrastructure of preserved tissue in the abdomen of a fossil fly (Mycetophilidae: Diptera) entombed in Baltic amber revealed recognizable cell organelles. Structures that corresponded to muscle fibers, nuclei, ribosomes, lipid droplets, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria were identified with the transmission electron microscope. Preservation was attributed to inert dehydration as well as the presence of compounds in the original sap which functioned as natural fixatives. This evidence of cell organelles in fossilized soft tissues represent an extreme form of mummification since Baltic amber is considered to have formed about 40 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2031166644,"The slave-raiding behavior of Harpagoxenus canadensis closely resembles the territorial behavior of its host species, Leptothorax muscorum. Of primary importance is the discovery that both species of ants recruit nest mates into battle using an alarm-recruitment system which is a probable evolutionary precursor of more specialized forms of slave-raiding recruitment. The behavior of these species supports the hypothesis that slave raiding in leptothoracine ants evolved from territorial behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2064044358,"Ruthenium-106 has been observed to migrate in ground water at about the same velocity as tritium from the site of an underground nuclear explosion to a pumped satellite well 91 meters distant. This finding contradicts the prediction, based on laboratory batch sorption measurements, that ruthenium-106 should migrate at a much lower rate than tritium. To predict migration of radionuclides in ground water, more relevant laboratory measurements are required."
https://openalex.org/W2014861909,"The graphical presentation of the results of complex computer model calculations is frequently as important as the computation, since it is generally through such presentations that the modeler and the modeler's audience derive the maximum amount of information. In this article graphical techniques for presenting multidimensional model results are reviewed and examples are given of the most useful forms of presentation. Color graphics is used increasingly for the presentation of model results, and three types of color displays are discussed here: the chromatic plot, the binary chromatic plot, and the ternary chromatic plot. Their use is illustrated with examples from computer modeling of air quality in the urban atmosphere."

Accordingly, renewed economic growth will require constraining inflation, as well as private initiatives and public policies that reflect the nature of technological progress and of the American people."

https://openalex.org/W2085084387,"The US could soon resume dumping radioactive materials into the oceans. The Navy has expressed an interest in getting rid of the radioactive reactors of old nuclear submarines by scuttling the vessels in deep water, and the Department of Energy is looking to the seas as a potential repository for thousands of tons of slightly contaminated soil from the cleanup of abandoned atomic weapons facilities. This could ease the way for a resumption of marine disposal of waste material from commercial operations too. These possibilities have begun to stir up opposition from environmentalist groups, and EPA, which is responsible for regulating ocean dumping is at the center of the turmoil. Currently plans are to dump only limited amounts and types of radwastes from government programs, however, opponents are concerned that if these plans are allowed to go ahead, they may be a prelude to more extensive dumping. EPA's regulations, which were published in 1977 and are still in force, make it difficult to dump anything into the oceans; however, EPA is rewriting the regulations. The revisions are based on the principle that ocean dumping, like other actions that affect the environment, should be governed by cost-benefit analysis. The revisions weremore » also prompted by the desire to bring US policy into line with international law, in this case the London Dumping Convention. The chief thrust of the proposed regulations it to incorporate the LDC ocean dumping rules into US law. One important result would be to change the way that low-level wastes are defined for the purpose of ocean dumping. EPA's new ocean dumping regulations are sure to attract a lot of interest and controversy. (DP)« less"

https://openalex.org/W4242412883,"An article reporting a congressional hearing on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (News and Comment, 20 Nov., p. 887) incorrectly states that the institute allowed an unnamed individual to produce a preparation called ""Jim's Juice"" under what is known as a ""compassionate investigational new drug"" permit. The NCI, which does not have authority to issue such IND's, was not involved in the matter. The article also refers to an internal memo written by an NCI researcher about the alleged misuse of an experimental drug called Mitoxantrone. The drug in question was one known as M-AMSA, a new agent against acute leukemia."
