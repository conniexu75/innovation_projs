https://openalex.org/W2033247477,"Some of the chemical and biochemical transformations of toxic elements in the environment are discussed with special emphasis on the role played by microorganisms. When confronted with a toxic substance, microorganisms frequently adapt to detoxify it. However, the detoxification of a substance by microorganisms can yield a product that is either more or less toxic to higher organisms. The detoxification mechanisms of mercury are used as examples to demonstrate that there are biological cycles for the synthesis and degradation of toxic compounds. It is also shown that our present knowledge of the biologial cycles of toxic elements enables us to predict the behavior of other toxic elements in the environment."

On denaturation, approximately 90 percent of this collagen is recovered as a gamma component (300,000 daltons). Reduction and alkylation of the high-molecular-weight component yields alpha1(III) chains (95,000 daltons). In addition to containing cysteine, alpha1(III) chains exhibit several other compositional differences when compared to alpha1(I), alpha1(II), or alpha2 chains from human tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1972095428,"A competitive protein binding assay with a sensitivity of 80 picograms has been developed for 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), the hormonal form of vitamin D(3). lalpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) displaced tritiated hormone from a cytosol-chromatin receptor preparation isolated from chick small intestine, providing a simple assay for the hormone. The concentration of lalpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in human plasma, as determined by this assay, is approximately 6 nanograms per 100 milliliters; in patients with renal disease the concentration of this kidney-produced hormone is significantly lower."
https://openalex.org/W2018201323,"Vitamin D-deficient rats produce [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 from [3H]25-hydroxyvitamin D3 regardless of dietary content of calcium or phosphate. A daily dose of 130 picomoles of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for a period of 5 days reduces production of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to essentially zero and stimulates production of [3H]24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. A daily dose of 325 picomoles of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 has a similar but less dramatic effect. On the other hand, 650 picomoles daily of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 given to vitamin D-deficient rats had no effect. Thus it appears that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is an important factor in the regulation of kidney metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3."

https://openalex.org/W1990503067,"Bats of the genus Myotis emit intense orientation sounds for echolocation. If such sounds directly stimulated their ears, the detection of echoes from short distances would be impaired. In addition to the muscular mechanism in the middle ear, the bat has a neural mechanism in the brain for attenuation of responses to self-vocalized orientation and nonorientation sounds. This neural attenuating mechanism operates in the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, reducing its activity by about 15 decibels, and it is synchronized with vocalization."

This classification provides a way to measure coupling between cortical areas. The technique is simple, yet of wide potential utility for studying functional relationships between cortical areas. The results of applying this technique suggest how the potentials giving rise to the electroencephalogram may play a role in information processing in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1599633780,"To evaluate the long term effects on skeletal muscle of feeding a competitive inhibitor of creatine transport, β-guanidinopropionic acid was fed to rats as 1% of their diet for 6 weeks or longer. Although these rats appeared healthy on casual inspection, the P-creatine concentration in their gastrocnemius muscles decreased from a mean value of 22.5 µmoles per g wet weight to 1.6. Instead of P-creatine, the muscles contained a new phosphorylated guanidino compound in concentrations as high as 30 µmoles per g wet weight. By chromatography on Sephadex QAE-A25 this new compound was indistinguishable from phosphorylated β-guanidinopropionate formed in vitro in a reaction mixture containing β-guanidinopropionate, rabbit muscle creatine kinase, and an ATP generating system. Hydrolysis of the new compound liberated β-guanidinopropionic acid and orthophosphate in a 1:1 molar ratio. When muscles from rats fed β-guanidinopropionic acid were caused to contract under anoxic conditions, the concentration of phosphorylated β-guanidinopropionate decreased dramatically, raising the possibility that it, like P-creatine, can serve in a system to regenerate ATP. On the other hand β-guanidinopropionate is a relatively ineffective substrate for creatine kinase in vitro, and animals fed β-guanidinopropionic acid have subnormal concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, ATP, and ADP in resting muscle in vivo. These animals may prove useful in studies of the metabolic adaptations of skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1529526626,"Abstract Previous studies indicated that the ability of thiols to mimic insulin action on fat cell glucose oxidation and lipolysis was dependent on Cu2+. Evidence now presented indicates that H2O2 formed by the reaction of thiols, Cu2+, and O2 mediates the effects of these agents on isolated fat cells. Oxidation of thiols to the respective disulfides in the presence of Cu2+ accompanied the stimulatory effects on glucose metabolism. Diphenyl-1, 10-phenanthroline, which binds tightly to Cu+ but not Cu2+, blocks copper-catalyzed thiol oxidation and the stimulatory effect on fat cell glucose utilization, indicating that reduction of Cu2+ is an obligatory step for thiol action. The thiol-Cu2+ effect on fat cells is readily reversible since stimulated rates of glucose oxidation returned to control levels following addition of the chelator. Catalase inhibited the stimulatory effect of thiols but not insulin on fat cell glucose oxidation, whereas H2O2 mimicked the action of thiols and insulin on this process. As little as 10 µm H2O2 stimulated glucose utilization, whereas 1 mm H2O2 was maximally effective. Higher concentrations were less effective. The stimulatory effect of various mercaptoethanol and Cu2+ concentrations on labeled CO2 production from d-[1-14C]glucose by fat cells paralleled the peroxide formed under these conditions. Other oxidants such as MnO4= and diamide were also effective in enhancing fat cell glucose oxidation. The stimulatory effect of all three oxidants, as well as insulin, was inhibited by phlorizin and cytochalasin B, known glucose transport inhibitors. Fat cells enhanced the decomposition of added H2O2 or that generated by cysteine, Cu2+, and O2. These data are consistent with the concept that an electron transfer reaction between a fat cell component or components and oxidants results in stimulated glucose transport or metabolism or both."

In continuous blue light of intensity below 0.001 erg per square centimeter per second, adult flies emerged in pulses 24.7 hours apart, each pulse occupying about 6 hours. But in continuous light of intensity exceeding 0.1 erg per square centimeter per second, they emerged at a steady rate. This intensity range from effective darkness to effective light is roughly from starlight to moonlight. Inside this range, the emergence peaks broaden for about a week with little change of period."

https://openalex.org/W2092393717,"By means of the NASN cascade impactor the particle sizes of ambient aerosols can be measured by fractionating the particles according to their aerodynamic dimensions, and the fractions can be quantified gravimetrically. Data obtained with this instrument show that particulate matter suspended in urban air in the United States and Great Britain is remarkably uniform in distribution and that the particles are predominantly less than 1 microm in diameter. In Ankara, Turkey, the high proportion of particles larger than 1 microm in diameter are associated with the incomplete combustion of lignite; particulate concentrations in Ankara, however, are considerably higher than those measured elsewhere. The growth of particles in air during temperature inversions occurs in Cincinnati; the greater proportion of large particles found there during inversion periods can account for the reduction in visibility. Aerosols in the vicinity of highways are composed of particles larger than those found some distance away because of the reentrainment of debris by the traffic-induced turbulence. On the other hand, highway configuration and traffic volume have little effect on the size distribution of aerosols in samples collected away from the turbulence area of the roadway. Aerosols measured inside buildings are predominantly smaller in size and exhibit a narrower range of sizes than aerosols outside buildings."
https://openalex.org/W1479692334,"Abstract Addition of heparin to isolated fat cells incubated at 23° resulted in a 3-fold increase in release of lipoprotein lipase activity into the incubation medium. This increase in medium lipoprotein lipase activity was not due to enhancement or stabilization of lipase activity present in the medium. The maximum increase in lipoprotein lipase activity was obtained on addition of 0.1 unit of heparin per ml to the cells. The heparin-stimulated release of lipoprotein lipase was almost completely inhibited by the metabolic inhibitors, sodium cyanide and Antimycin-A. When protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide, and heparin added to the incubation medium, neither the release of lipoprotein lipase activity nor the intracellular enzyme activity was affected for 120 min. At the end of this 120-min incubation there was approximately 5 times as much lipoprotein lipase activity in the medium as in the cells initially. These studies suggest that intracellular lipoprotein lipase undergoes activation in association with heparin-stimulated release from fat cells."

The addition of the South American plant Solanum malacoxylon to strontium-containing diets counteracts the inhibitory action of dietary strontium, thereby indicating that the plant contains a factor which can mimic the action of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and representing the first such factor identified in a botanical source."

https://openalex.org/W1543771189,"Abstract The amino acid substitution of hemoglobin Little Rock (HbLR) is here defined as β143 (H21) His → Gln, a site which is important for binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (HbA). Studies of the effect of DPG and of chloride and phosphate on the oxygen affinities of chromatographically isolated HbLR and HbA show that HbLR has a much higher oxygen affinity than HbA at all anion concentrations. The shapes of the titration curves are consistent with binding of each species of anion studied to both the deoxy and oxy conformations of hemoglobin. Equations were developed from simple equilibrium models to calculate anion dissociation constants from the oxygen equilibrium data. The model for DPG binding assumed one oxygen-linked binding site per hemoglobin tetramer, and that for small anion binding assumed two sites. The DPG dissociation constant for deoxy HbLR (Kd = 3.3 x 10-5 m) is approximately twice that of deoxy HbA (Kd = 1.8 x 10-5 m), while the dissociation constant for oxy HbLR (Ko = 7.0 x 10-3 m) is four times that of oxy HbA (Ko = 1.7 x 10-3 m). Dissociation constants for chloride (HbLR: Kd = 2 x 10-3 m, Ko = 0.6 m; HbA: Kd = 2 x 10-3 m, Ko = 0.4 m) and phosphate (HbLR: Kd = 3 x 10-4 m, Ko = 0.1 m; HbA: Kd = 2.5 x 10-4 m, Ko = 0.1 m) are larger than the corresponding constants for DPG for both hemoglobins. However, the differences between HbLR and HbA in the binding of these anions are not significant. These data indicate the importance of the β143 histidine for the binding of DPG, but not of small anions, to HbA in solution. These findings appear to be in good agreement with crystallographic observations reported by Arnone ((1972) Nature 237, 146–149)."
https://openalex.org/W1585161268,"Abstract In previous publications (Shafritz, D. A., Drysdale, J. W., and Isselbacher, K. J. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3220–3227 and Shafritz, D. A. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 81–88) we reported the isolation and translation of RNA fractions with messenger activity from membrane-bound and free polysomes of rabbit liver with evidence for specific synthesis of albumin and ferritin in a reticulocyte cell-free system. Using both immunological and chemical purification methods, the synthesis of these proteins has now been compared with homologous membrane-bound and free liver polysomes versus the respective RNA extracts from these polysomes, translated in the heterologous reticulocyte cell-free system. Under the conditions used, there was a clear distinction in the synthesis of albumin and ferritin by isolated membrane-bound versus free liver polysomes. However, in the reticulocyte system, as a result of large increases in the relative percentage of ferritin synthesis by RNA from membrane-bound polysomes and albumin synthesis by RNA from free polysomes, this distinction was almost totally abolished. These results are consistent with an interpretation that, under conditions generally used for protein synthesis, considerable portions of ferritin messenger RNA in membrane-bound polysomes and albumin messenger RNA in free polysomes are not translated in cell-free systems derived from rabbit liver."

https://openalex.org/W1586329312,"A soluble fraction from the isthmus region of hen oviduct catalyzes the liberation of SO42- from UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate (the nucleotide that accumulates in the same tissue during egg formation). The enzyme is purified some 88-fold and is shown to catalyze the reactions: (a) UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate → UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine plus SO42-; and (b) UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4,6-disulfate → UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate plus SO42-. N-Acetylgalactosamine-4,6-disulfate is desulfated in a similar way but at approximately 13% of the rate of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate hydrolysis. The enzyme does not act upon p-nitrophenyl sulfate, N-acetylgalactosamine-4- and 6-sulfate, glucose 6-sulfate, galactose 3- and 6-sulfate, glucan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and unsaturated disaccharide mono- and disulfates derived from chondroitin sulfates. There are striking differences in the sulfatase activity among the anatomically distinct regions of the oviduct: the specific activity of the isthmus extract being 7 to 12 times greater than the values of the magnum and uterus extracts. A somewhat similar activity is detected in the extracts of rat liver and kidney, but available evidence suggests that the activity in these extracts is due to the action of an arylsulfatase which is different from the isthmus sulfatase in catalyzing the cleavage of p-nitrophenyl sulfate. We previously described the occurrence in the isthmus of specific sulfotransferases which catalyze UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-4,6-disulfate formation, respectively. The present finding of a sulfatase which acts preferentially on these sulfated sugar nucleotides gives additional support to the idea that these nucleotides have an important biological role."

https://openalex.org/W1864123157,"Abstract The activity of Photosystem I has been investigated during growth in the dark of light-grown cells (degreening) and illumination of dark-grown cells (greening) of Chlamydomonas reinhardi y-1. During degreening the decrease in chlorophyll content precedes that of P700 and plastocyanin resulting in a temporary enrichment of the photosynthetic membranes in electron transport components relative to chlorophyll. The absorption maximum around 685 nm present in light-grown cells is gradually shifted toward shorter wavelengths (671 nm). The photoreduction of methyl viologen (micromoles per mg of chlorophyll per hour) in light-grown cells is low and saturated by low light intensity (3 x 104 ergs x cm-2 s-1). During degreening the light intensity required for maximal activity increases and saturation can not be obtained even at high light intensity (5 x 105 ergs x cm-2 s-1). The photoreduction of methyl viologen decreases continually when measured at low light intensity, however, it shows a 3-fold increase during the first 3 days of degreening when measured at high light intensity. During the greening a mirror image of the above results is obtained. The P700 content and photoreduction of methyl viologen increase faster than chlorophyll accumulation. The photoreduction at low light intensity increases gradually and shows a tendency toward saturation; at high light intensity the reaction rate is higher and shows a maximum after about 3 hours of greening. The absorption spectrum shows a fast change of the maximum from around 671 nm toward longer wavelengths (680 to 685 nm) which is completed after 3 hours of illumination. However measurements of the efficiency of different Photosystem I activities with light of different wave lengths show two peaks of activity at 670 and 700 nm and a trough at 680 nm. Addition of purified plastocyanin to the reaction mixtures enhances the photoreduction of methyl viologen only in preparations from cells grown in the light, during the 1st day of degreening, and at the end of the greening. It is concluded that changes observed in the activity of Photosystem I at different stages of photosynthetic membrane development are due to changes in the relative content of electron transport components and chlorophyll as well as changes in membrane organization related to an efficient utilization of light at low intensities."

Incorporation of glucose from UDP-glucose into O-34 antigen required polymerization of mannosylrhamnosylgalactose repeating units. A single trisaccharide unit was not an acceptor for O-34 glucose. A preformed trisaccharide repeating polymer generated under restricted conditions was able to accept glucosyl residues. The product of glucose incorporation was characterized and found to be a haptenic O-polysaccharide. A glucosyl-lipid intermediate was formed, which acted as a glucosyl donor to the polymeric trisaccharide units. Glucose incorporated into the intermediate in the first step reaction was transferred to the mannosylrhamnosylgalactose polymer generated in the second step. The following two enzymatic steps were formulated. [see PDF for equation] Reversibility of Reaction 1 was demonstrated by exchange reaction of UDP between free [14C]UDP and UDP-glucose. Furthermore, these two reactions were proved by the use of isolated glucosyl-lipid as a substrate. The enzymatic activity catalyzing Reaction 1 was found in all of the cells carrying phage e34, and also in cells having the mutant phage eo34-134 defective in the formation of O-34 antigen. The catalytic activity to carry out Reaction 2 was found only in cells carrying both e15 and e34, but not in cells with e15 and eo34-134."

https://openalex.org/W1553366937,"Abstract A study of the comparative specificities of α-chymotrypsin and subtilisin Carlsberg has been focused mainly on the extent to which α-acetamido groups of some specific and nonspecific activated ester substrates affect the reactivity of each enzyme. Comparisons are based upon kc and kc:Km corrected for substrate intrinsic reactivities ((kc)n and (kc:Km)n). Among p-nitrophenyl β-phenylpropionates (α substituents: NHCOCH3, H, O2CCH3), (kc:Km)n of the specific substrate N-acetyl-(S)-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl ester ((S)-I) is 16 times higher than for p-nitrophenyl β-phenylpropionate (II); in (kc)n (S)-I is hydrolyzed 110 times faster than II. With subtilisin Carlsberg no detectable enhancement attributable to the α-acetamido group of the substrate was found in (kc:Km)n of (S)-I. With each enzyme the use of activated esters is largely responsible for the lack of a substantial α-acetamido effect upon (kc:Km)n since in (kc:Km)n of the methyl esters corresponding to (S)-I and II, the enhancement is about two orders of magnitude. The investigation was extended to include the p-nitrophenyl esters of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic and indan-2-carboxylic acids (α substituents:NHCOCH3, H, O2CCH3). The α-acetamidosubstituted member of each of the two series of semirigid substrates is constrained in a geometry similar to that postulated as the conformation of (S)-I preferred during hydrolysis by chymotrypsin and subtilisins. With both enzymes a substrate α-acetamido group-enzyme interaction makes the S isomer of p-nitrophenyl 2-acetamido-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene-2-carboxylate ((S)-IV) two orders of magnitude more reactive than its unsubstituted derivative. A similar interaction does not enhance the reactivity of p-nitrophenyl 2-acetamidoindan-2-carboxylate (VII). The reactivities of α-chymotrypsin and subtilisin Carlsberg toward the α-acetoxy derivatives of each substrate type are lower than those exhibited toward their α-acetamido and unsubstituted derivatives."
