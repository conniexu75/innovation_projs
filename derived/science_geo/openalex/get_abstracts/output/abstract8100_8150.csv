Both the blastogenic activity of concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide and the ability of immune lymphocytes to lyse P815 target cells showed the same patterns of immunosuppression and enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1967290545,"The rabbit beta-globin DNA insertion of the hybrid plasmid PbetaG1 (Maniatis et al., 1976) was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (1977). A sequence of 576 nucleotides was determined and verified by pyrimidine tract analysis of double-stranded DNA, synthesized in vitro starting from beta-globin mRNA. The derived sequence is in complete agreement with previously reported partial mRNA sequencing data and with the predictions from the primary structure of the protein. Moreover, the globin DNA insertion is missing only 13 nucleotides corresponding to the 5' terminal sequence of the mRNA. The rabbit beta-globin mRNA consists of a coding region of 438 nucleotides, flanked by a 5' noncoding region of 56 nucleotides (including the initiation codon AUG but not the 7-methyl-guanine of the ""cap structure"") and by a 3' noncoding region of 95 nucleotides (including a UGA termination codon). The features of the mRNA sequence are discussed with specific attention to the selective use of particular codons, the probable existence extensively base-paired segments at the 5' terminal region and the ribosome binding site. The faithful representation of beta-globin mRNA in the PbetaG1 DNA insertion establishes the validity of used cloned DNA, initially derived from double-stranded DNA transcripts of mRNA, for studying the structure of eucaryotic genes."

Estradiol also advanced the phase of the wheel running of sighted female hamsters without ovaries that were entrained to a photoperiod with 12 hours of light and 12 of darkness. These results, and findings from hamsters undergoing natural estrous cycles, indicate that endogenous estradiol is involved in the regulation of circadian periodicity."
https://openalex.org/W2017813247,"The distribution of microfilament bundles in cells was examined using antibodies to fibroblast myosin and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. There is no correlation between the presence of bundles of microfilaments and normal growth control. A normal cell line (Balb/c 3T3) cultured on a poorly adhesive substratum showed no microfilament bundles. Similarly, a mutant cell line (AD6) with normal growth, but a rounded shape due to defective adhesiveness to substratum, showed no bundle formation. On the other hand, two transformed cell lines with a flat morphology (Swiss SV3T3 and Balb MSV-85) showed extensive bundle formation. When a transformed cell line with poor adhesiveness (MC5-5) was treated with CSP (a major surface glycoprotein of normal cells) which increases adhesiveness to substratum, the cells formed extensive microfilament bundles without any decrease in growth. We conclude that the distribution of microfilament bundles is related to adhesiveness to substratum and cell shape but not to growth properties."

https://openalex.org/W1979513838,"Tetrahydropapaveroline (THP), a dopamine-dopaldehyde condensation product, was delivered directly into the cerebral ventricle of rats automatically every 15 minutes for 12 days. The animals were given access to both water and ethyl alcohol, the latter being presented in 12 concentrations from 3 to 30 percent. Within 3 to 6 days of the start of the infusion of THP, the rats, which normally rejected alcohol, drank alcohol solutions in increasingly excessive amounts; this was accompanied by symptoms that were similar to those of withdrawal and intoxication. These results provide evidence that an abnormal metabolite in the brain may produce the addictive state caused by alcoholic beverages."
https://openalex.org/W2044141862,"The mechanism by which the membrane proteins of Sindbis virus are initially glycosylated during growth of the virus in chick cells was studied. The experiments suggest strongly that the two viral glycoproteins are glycosylated before release from the polysome, and that this glycosylation involves transfer of a large 1800 dalton oligosaccharide to the polypeptide chains. The donor of the oligosaccharide is most probably a lipid."

The organisms grown in this system were infective to mammalian hosts, retained the morphological and biochemical characteristics of long slender bloodstream forms, and displayed variant-antigen on their surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2081503662,"Neutron scattering studies have been performed on dilute solutions of the fundamental subunit of chromatin, the nucleosome. The subunits contain approximately 195 base paris (bp) of DNA and histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Measurements of the small angle scattering curves in various H2O/D2O solvents allow the contrast dependence of the radius of gyration of the subunits to be examined and give the mean scattering density of the particle. Further application of contrast variation to the higher angle scatter curves allows the contributions from the shape and internal structure of the subunits to be analyzed separately. From these results, we are able to propose a spherically averaged structure with most of the histones closely packed into a core of radius 3.2 nm surrounded by a loosely packed DNA-rich shell of 2.0 nm thickness resulting in a particle of 5.2 nm average radius. Model calculations for ellipsoids show that the outer shape of the subunit must have an axial ratio between 0.5 and 1.4 but is probably best described by more spherical particle. These results are correlated with the diffraction from chromatin films to provide an explanation for some of the diffraction rings."

https://openalex.org/W2041431942,"Social subordination, which suppresses gonadal function in juvenile and adult male house mice, also suppresses the activity of an androgen-dependent urinary pheromone that accelerates the rate of sexual maturation in juvenile females. Pheromone production may also be suppressed by the presence of pregnant or lactating females. This suggests that the social environment may influence the fertility of population females by altering urinary pheromone activity in the male."
https://openalex.org/W2080899191,"The DNA of nuclei is cleaved by a variety of nucleases in such a way that the cuts on a given strand are always separated by an integral multiple of 10 nucleotides. However, the spacing between cutting sites on opposite strands is not known for any nuclease. In this paper, we describe the determination of the spacing, or stagger, between cuts on opposite strands produced by the action of pancreatic DNAase (DNAase I) on nuclei. When nuclei are digested with DNAase I and the resultant DNA is analyzed by gel electrophoresis without prior denaturation, a complex pattern of bands is observed. A method which gives better than 90% recovery of DNA from polyacrylamide gels was used to isolate the individual fractions corresponding to these bands. The structure of the fractions was then determined using single-strand-specific nuclease to digest single-stranded ""tails"" and using DNA polymerases to extend recessed 3'-OH termini of partially duplex regions. Our results show that each component consists of a double-stranded region terminating in single-stranded tails at both ends. Although both chains of every duplex are 10-n nucleotides long (n integer), the chains are never completely paired. The experiments with DNA polymerase show an abundance of structures in which the 3'-OH termini of these duplexes are recessed by 8 nucleotides, and by inference, there must be structures with 5'-P termini recessed by 2 or 12 nucleotides. Thus DNAase I acts on nuclei to produce DNA with staggered cuts on opposite strands, separated by (10-n + 8) and (10-n + 2) base pairs (with 5'-P and 3'-OH termini extending, respectively). Two classes of models of DNA folding in the nucleosome have been proposed by other investigators to account for the presence of DNAase I cleavage sites at 10-n intervals along each DNA chain. One class of models leads to the prediction that cuts should either be unstaggered or separated by 10 nucleotides, while the other class is consistent with staggers of 6 and 4 nucleotides. Neither prediction is verified by our data; however, all these models may be made consistent with the results by assuming that the enzyme's site of recognition on nucleosomal DNA is not the same as its site of cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2083425821,"Action potentials and slow waves were recorded from the hypoglossal nucleus of rats during licking of water from a drinking tube. Periods of licking and of rhythmic neural activity were usually highly correlated, as were their frequencies. Neural activity sometimes continued after cessation of licking; at other times, it stopped during a short interruption of licking and resumed in rhythm with licking. These observations are consistent with an oscillatory model of the control of licking."

https://openalex.org/W2009836910,"Protein preparations from commercial suppliers are contaminated with bacterial endotoxins. The continued use of these preparations indicates that many researchers are unaware of this, and they may attribute all observed effects to the proteins themselves. Intravitreous injection of bovine serum albumin has an initial inflammatory effect on the rabbit eye which occurs before an immune reaction to the antigen itself can develop. This direct inflammatory effect can be fully accounted for by endotoxin-like contaminants which are present in protein preparations obtained from commercial suppliers. A pharmaceutical (U.S. Pharmacopeia) serum albumin preparation contains no detectable endotoxin, and has no initial inflammatory effect on the eye. Since endotoxins, even in minute amounts, have a variety of effects, the use of such contaminated protein preparations in biological research can lead to erroneous conclusions and should, therefore, be avoided."

Reproductive dysfunction was seen in both female and male animals. Females treated with MSG had fewer pregnancies and smaller litters, while males treated with MSG showed reduced fertility. The MSG-treated mice showed increased body weight and decreased pituitary, thyroid, ovary, or testis weights."
https://openalex.org/W1503429275,"Stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis in transformed mouse fibroblasts by serum, thrombin, and bradykinin was blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. These RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors did not affect prostaglandin synthetase in vitro or in vivo; nor did they affect the acylation of arachidonic acid into phospholipids. Serum-stimulated release of arachidonic acid and prostaglandins from [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled cells also was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. RNA and protein synthesis appear to be required for expression of phospholipase activity; a prerequisite for prostaglandin synthesis by these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999341577,"The relationship between hnRNA and mRNA in the water mold Achlya has been investigated in several ways. Analysis of the nuclear and polysomal poly(A) RNA by sucrose density gradient centrifugation under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions showed that the populations have indistinguishable size distributions. The number average sizes were calculated to be 1150 nucleotides for nuclear and 1140 nucleotides for polysomal poly(A) RNA. Selective inhibition of rRNA synthesis was used to investigate the size distribution of hnRNA without regard to poly(A) content. Very little hnRNA was observed which sedimented more rapidly than polysomal poly(A) RNA. Hybridization experiments in which an excess of nuclear DNA was reacted with 3H-poly(A) hnRNA or 3H-poly(A) mRNA showed that both populations contain repetitive transcripts (9-10%) as well as single-copy transcripts (44%). Analysis of hybrids on hydroxyapatite in the presence of 8 M urea demonstrated that the poly(A) RNA complementary to repetitive DNA sequence components represented a population of molecules distinct from the population complementary to single-copy DNA. The complexity of whole cell, nuclear and polysomal RNA was determined by saturation hypbridization to single-copy 3H-DNA. All three populations were complementary to essentially the same fraction of the DNA. Terminal hybridization values were 3.84, 3.76 and 3.76% for whole cell, nuclear and polysomal RNA, respectively, representing a complexity of 2.1 X 10(6) nucleotides. These data suggest that the composition of the hnRNA and mRNA populations are essentially identical. No evidence for selective turnover of any sequence component or size class within the nucleus was observed."

https://openalex.org/W2149901880,"A mutant cell line derived from Chinese hamster fibroblasts is described which is defective in oxidative energy metabolism. Glucose is continuously required in the medium. As a result of a block in the Krebs cycle, these cells are auxotrophs for carbon dioxide and asparagine. Several experiments support our conclusion that the mutant cells lack appreciable levels of succinate dehydorgenase activity. Other components of the electron transport chain appear to be fully functional, although there is the possibility that electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation are uncoupled."
https://openalex.org/W1497210083,"Aggregates of Dictyostelium discoideum are surrounded by a surface sheath which functions to maintain polarity and integrity during development. We have isolated and partially characterized a component of the surface sheath. It is composed of 60% cellulose, 15% protein, 3% heteropolysaccharide (heteropolymer), 5% lipid, and 1% sulfate when isolated from migrating slugs. The sheath, isolated from aggregates prior to tip formation, has less protein, a different heteropolymer, and cellulose of a lower crystallinity than the sheath of migrating slugs. The increase in crystallinity of the cellulose during development may be important in determining the strength of the surface sheath."

https://openalex.org/W2042764111,A mutation affecting the speed of slime mold development has been genetically analyzed. Strain FR17 carries a recessive mutation on linkage group IV. A selection procedure for isolating more mutants of this type has been developed and new mutations have been tested for complementation. The aberrant morphology of these strains can be partially corrected by development in the presence of glucose.
https://openalex.org/W1590379492,"The oxidation of UDP-glucose by the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.22) from beef liver has been shown to proceed via the enzyme-bound intermediate, UDP-alpha-D-glyco-hexodialdose. The enzyme does not release this aldehyde, nor can it be trapped by reaction with hydroxylamine, thiosemicarbazide, or cyanide. Tight binding of the intermediate aldehyde can be explained by the recent observation that the essential thiol group of the enzyme forms a thiohemiacetal with the aldehyde during the course of the reaction. However, an enzyme preparation with the essential thiol derivatized with cyanide will still not release the aldehyde, indicating an additional as yet unknown binding mechanism. Derivatization ([14C]formaldehyde, followed by NaBH4 reduction) of 6 of the approximately 168 lysine residues per enzyme molecule (of six catalytic subunits) results in destruction of 47% of the enzyme activity, suggesting the involvement of an essential reactive lysine in the mechanism. Preincubation of the enzyme with UDP-glucose decreases both the loss of activity and incorporation of the label, indicating that this lysine is in the vicinity of the active site. Acid hydrolysis of the labeled preparation, followed by paper chromatography, shows that the label has a mobility, in the system used, that is identical with lysine. Elution of this spot followed by chromatography on Aminex A-5 resin showed that it contained the expected mixture of epsilon-N-methyl lysines. When enzyme that has its essential thiol derivatized with cyanide is incubated with UDP-[14C]glucose and NAD+, and then reduced with NaB3H4, a stable enzyme complex is formed which contains both labels. Acid hydrolysis of this preparation, followed by either two-dimensional paper chromatography or separation in an amino acid analyzer, results in both labels appearing in the position of lysine. It is evident that the enzyme oxidizes the UDP-[14C]glucose to the corresponding aldehyde which occurs as the Schiff's base with an essential lysine. This is then reduced by the NaB3H4 to form a secondary amine which is stable toward hydrolysis and migrates with lysine in separation procedures. As would be predicted, the enzyme can be similarly labeled by treatment with UDP-alpha-D-gluco-hexodisidose alone, followed by NaB3H4 reduction. The same hydrolysis product results from this procedure, and it behaves identically with the product formed by treating alpha-N-acetyl lysine with UDP-alpha-D-gluco-hexodialdose, reducing with NaBH4, and then hydrolyzing. This substance appears to be N5-((5-formyl-2-furanyl)methyl)lysine. When chromatographed on Aminex A-5, both the model compound and enzyme hydrolysate gave peaks corresponding to free lysine and the proposed derivative. Evidence is presented that the oxidation of UDP-glucose to the aldehyde is a concerted reaction involving the formation of the Schiff's base, rather than the formation of the aldehyde with the subsequent formation of the Schiff's base..."
https://openalex.org/W2093581610,"The synthesis, accumulation and stability of rRNA were examined in embryonic quail myoblasts differentiating in cell culture. Quail myoblasts initially divide rapidly in culture, and accumulate 28S and 18S rRNA and ribosomes at a rate which maintains a constant ribosome content during cell division. After these myoblasts fuse, cell division ceases and ribosomes accumulate in fibers, but at a reduced rate which is only one fourth that in dividing myoblasts. Measurements of rRNA stability by 3H-methyl-methionine pulse-chase analysis show that 28S and 18S rRNA formed by fibers turn over with half-lives of 45 hr, and rRNA formed by myoblasts remains stable until fusion and then also turns over in fibers. Turnover of rRNA in fibers accounts for only half the reduction in ribosome accumulation following myoblast fusion. Measurements of the incorporation of 3H-adenosine into rRNA and ATP pools show that the rates of synthesis of rRNA precursor do not decrease after myoblast fuse, but half the rRNA molecules synthesized by fibers are degraded during processing. Degradation of rRNA during processing reduces the rate of formation of 28S and 18S rRNA, and together with rRNA turnover quantitatively accounts for the reduced rate of ribosome accumulation in fibers."

Recombinant phages have been constructed in vitro by joining the smaller fragment of ribosomal DNA and the outer arms of DNA from the vector lambdagtWES-lambdaC. In one of the recombinants, the coding strand of the cloned fragment is in the proper orientation for transcription with lambda ""early"" genes; in the other two the orientation is reversed, with the coding strand in the proper position for transcription with lambda ""late"" genes."

https://openalex.org/W2086207202,"Poly(A)+ protamine mRNA was isolated from trout testis cells in a very pure form, and artificial poly(A)- protamine mRNA molecules were derived from it by enzymatic deadenylation with RNAase H from calf thymus after hybridization with oligo(dT). The deadenylated protamine mRNA was found to be active in a wheat germ cell-free system and yielded a labeled product which co-migrated with authentic protamine. These deadenylated mRNA molecules were subsequently used as markers on denaturing polyacrylamide gels to identify and allow the purification of the poly(A)- protamine components known to exist in vivo in the total cellular poly(A)- RNA. RNA species of molecular weights similar to the enzymatically deadenylated subcomponents of protamine mRNA were observed in the natural poly(A)-RNA population of the testis cells. These naturally occurring poly(A)- protamine mRNAs were isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis and further characterized by 3H-poly(U) hybridization assay, by hybridization to complementary DNA made against highly purified poly(A)+ protamine mRNA, and by their ability to direct protamine synthesis in a cell-free system."

The kinetics, voltage dependence, and pharmacological properties of the sodium and potassium currents qualitatively resemble those of the corresponding currents in squid giant axon and frog myelinated nerve fiber, suggesting that the molecular structures of the sodium and potassium channels in neuroblastoma are similar to those of the non-mammalian preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1514309044,"Clonal cell lines derived from both spontaneous and chemically induced rat and mouse brain tumors were screened for their ability to incorporate H232SO4 into galactosyl(3-O-sulfate)ceramide (sulfatide). High levels of 35SO4 incorporation into sulfatide were found only in two of the mouse cell lines studied (G26-20 and -24). Tumors produced by subcutaneous injection of these cell lines into C57BL/6 mice were also unique in that they contained high levels of both sulfatide and galactosylceramide. The synthesis of large amounts of sulfatide and galactosylceramide by a clonal cell line of neurological origin suggests that the original tumor was of oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell origin. In common with a large number of mouse and rat astrocyte cell strains and their derived tumors, these glial cells lacked the ability to synthesize gangliosides such as monosialotetraglycosylceramide and disialotetraglycosylceramide (as judged by analytical and [3H]GlcNH2 incorporation studies). This appears to be a unique characteristic of neuroblastoma-derived cell strains such as N18, NB2a, and NB41A."

https://openalex.org/W1993289566,"In adult rats amphetamine acts as a strong behavioral stimulant leading to a marked increase in random, nondirected locomotor activity. In contrast we report that amphetamine administered to preweanling rats in the presence of an anesthetized adult rat produces no visible increase in motor activity. Instead, it appears to enhance the normal tendency of neonatal rats to approach and maintain contact with conspecifics. In postweanling rats amphetamine disrupts the tendency to aggregate and produces an increase in behavioral activity comparable to that seen in adult rats. These findings may constitute the basis for an animal model of minimal brain dysfunction hyperkinesis."

https://openalex.org/W1538416613,Two chemostat methods for studying the immobilized enzyme kinetics are presented. The methods are applied to glucose-6-phosphate isomerase immobilized within a proteic membrane. The first method is based on the steady state behavior of a Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (C.S.T.R.) and the second one on a diffusion-reaction process. The apparent equilibrium ratio between glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate is measured for the immobilized enzyme system. No modification is observed with a monoenzyme membrane. In the presence of a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity the product of the first reaction is trapped by the second one and due to the local intramembrane concentrations an apparent modification of the equilibrium ratio is observed. The apparent modification is studied with the bienzyme membrane as a function of the concentration of NADP co-substrate of the second enzyme. A Michaelian relationship is observed.
