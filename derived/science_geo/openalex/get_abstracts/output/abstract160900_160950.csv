https://openalex.org/W1883449737,"Dealloying is a common corrosion process during which an alloy is 'parted' by the selective dissolution of the most electrochemically active of its elements. This process results in the formation of a nanoporous sponge composed almost entirely of the more noble alloy constituents. Although considerable attention has been devoted to the morphological aspects of the dealloying process, its underlying physical mechanism has remained unclear. Here we propose a continuum model that is fully consistent with experiments and theoretical simulations of alloy dissolution, and demonstrate that nanoporosity in metals is due to an intrinsic dynamical pattern formation process. That is, pores form because the more noble atoms are chemically driven to aggregate into two-dimensional clusters by a phase separation process (spinodal decomposition) at the solid-electrolyte interface, and the surface area continuously increases owing to etching. Together, these processes evolve porosity with a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum model. We expect that chemically tailored nanoporous gold made by dealloying Ag-Au should be suitable for sensor applications, particularly in a biomaterials context."

Previously, it has been shown that Akt can activate the transcription factor NF-κB and that this functions to block apoptosis induced by certain stimuli. The mechanism whereby Akt activates NF-κB has been controversial, with evidence supporting induction of nuclear translocation of NF-κB via activation of IκB kinase activity and/or the stimulation of the transcription function of NF-κB. Here we demonstrate that Akt targets the transactivation function of NF-κB by stimulating the transactivation domain of RelA/p65 in a manner that is dependent on IκB kinase β activity and on the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38). Activation of RelA/p65 transactivation function requires serines 529 and 536, sites shown previously to be inducibly phosphorylated. Consistent with the requirement of p38 in the activation of NF-κB transcriptional function, expression of activated Akt induces p38 activity. Furthermore, the ability of IL-1β to activate NF-κB is known to involve Akt, and we show here that IL-1β induces p38 activity in manner dependent on Akt and IκB kinase activation. Interestingly, activated Akt and the transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 synergize in the activation of the RelA/p65 transactivation domain, and this synergy is blocked by p38 inhibitors. These studies demonstrate that Akt, functioning through IκB kinase and p38, induces the transcription function of NF-κB by stimulating the RelA/p65 transactivation subunit of NF-κB.

Additionally, Akt has been shown to activate the transcription factor NF-κB to provide cell survival functions (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol.

NF-κB is activated by a variety of stimuli including cytokines and oncoproteins (20Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar, 21Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, the majority of NF-κB is found in the cytoplasm associated with a family of inhibitory molecules known as the IκBs. The canonical NF-κB activation mechanism involves the phosphorylation of IκB on two critical serine residues by the IκB kinase (IKK)1 signalsome complex (22DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB is then targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteosome, which allows liberated NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of NF-κB-responsive genes (20Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar, 21Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). Although the induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB has been highly regarded as the principal method to activate NF-κB-dependent gene expression, an alternate mechanism of NF-κB activation is emerging that involves the phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 transactivation subunit. For example, it has been shown that the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and IL-1β lead to the phosphorylation of RelA/p65 and the subsequent stimulation of NF-κB transactivation through pathways distinct from induced nuclear translocation (18Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc) has also been shown to phosphorylate RelA/p65, which leads to the association of RelA/p65 with the CREB-binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300) transcriptional co-activator (28Zhong H.

Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Recently, the generation of GSK3 and T2K (TBK1) knockout mice has highlighted the physiological importance of modulating transactivation functions of NF-κB, because cells generated from these animals are capable of inducing NF-κB nuclear translocation but are deficient in their ability to stimulate transactivation functions of NF-κB (30Hoeflich K.P.

Shahinian A. Henzel W.J. Elia A.J. Shillinglaw W. Mak T.W. Cao Z. Yeh W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, evidence has been presented that the stress-activated kinase p38 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB transcription function at a level distinct from the induction of nuclear translocation (32Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Schmitz M.L. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that dual controls exist for NF-κB with mechanisms controlling induction of nuclear translocation of NF-κB as well as regulating the inherent transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Reports describing processes whereby Akt stimulates NF-κB activity have indicated different mechanisms whereby this process may occur. Two studies indicated that Akt, either in the context of tumor necrosis factor signaling or in response to growth factor stimulation, stimulated NF-κB nuclear translocation via the activation of the IKK complex (16Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 17Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Another study indicated that Akt alone could not induce nuclear translocation of NF-κB but synergized with PMA to induce this response (19Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Arguments against the involvement of Akt in controlling nuclear accumulation of NF-κB have been recently reported (34Delhase M. Li N. Karin M. Nature. 2000; 406: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Others, including ourselves, have provided evidence that Akt signaling involves the stimulation of the transcription function of NF-κB (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 18Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we showed that the ability of oncogenic Ras to activate NF-κB transcriptional activity is dependent on Akt activity (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In a separate study, Sizemore et al. showed that IL-1β induces phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 subunit in an Akt-dependent manner and that IL-1β activated the RelA/p65 transcriptional activation domain (18Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the ability of Akt to stimulate the transactivation potential of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB requires IKK and p38. Expression of activated Akt in IKKβ null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) significantly reduces transcriptional activity of NF-κB. In addition, mutation of serine 529 and the IKKβ phosphorylation site serine 536 (24Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) within the RelA/p65 transactivation domain, sites previously shown to be inducibly phosphorylated, decreases the activation of NF-κB-mediated transcription in response to Akt. Since p38 has been determined to activate NF-κB by targeting the transactivation function of NF-κB, we examined the role of p38 in Akt-mediated NF-κB transactivation. Treatment of cells with IL-1β or expression of an activated form of Akt stimulates the phosphorylation and activation of p38. Interestingly, IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of p38 requires Akt and IKK. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 kinase activity by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 significantly reduces Akt- and IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. The stimulation of the RelA/p65 transactivation domain is most likely not due to a direct phosphorylation event on RelA/p65 by p38 (32Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Schmitz M.L. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar); rather, we provide evidence that p38 activates RelA/p65 in response to Akt through cooperation with the CBP/p300 transcriptional co-activator. These studies define new mechanisms for Akt-mediated NF-κB transactivation and demonstrate that Akt utilizes IKK and the p38 MAPK to stimulate the transactivation potential of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB. Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin unless otherwise indicated. Human 293T kidney cells and IKK null mouse embryo fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin unless otherwise indicated. The specific p38 MAPK pharmacological inhibitor SB203580 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem) were used at a working concentration of 600 nm and 2 μm, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Recombinant human IL-1β (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or recombinant mouse IL-1β (Life Technologies) was used at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. 3x-κB luciferase reporter constructs contain 4 κB DNA binding consensus sites from the MHC class I promoter fused upstream to firefly luciferase. The Gal4 luciferase constructs (Gal4-Luc) contain five Gal4 DNA consensus binding sites derived from the yeast GAL4 gene upstream of luciferase, and Gal4-p65 constructs have the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of p65 (37Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Activated Akt as well as dominant negative constructs have been described previously (38Klippel A.

Wild type, dominant negative p38, MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6), and IKK constructs have been described previously (25Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Briefly, oligonucleotides were made corresponding to the sequence in RelA/p65 overlapping the serines 529 and 536. PCR was performed, and products were digested with DpnI and subsequently transformed into the XL-1 Blue strain of Escherichia coli. All mutants were verified by sequencing. NIH3T3 cells at 60–80% confluency were transiently transfected using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasmid constructs (1–2 μg of DNA total) were diluted in serum-free medium and mixed with the Superfect reagent. Complexes were allowed to form for 10 min before serum-containing medium was added to the mixture. The cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and Superfect-DNA complexes were added to the cells and placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Three hours after the addition, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with fresh serum-containing medium. Human 293T cells at 70–80% confluency were transfected by the calcium phosphate protocol. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 10 min at room temperature. Extracts were collected and cleared by centrifugation at high speed. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. d-Luciferin was used as a substrate, and relative light units were measured using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Berthold Analytical Instruments). Results were normalized to an internal β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid (PCMV-LacZ) by a β-galactosidase colorimetric assay followed by spectrophotometric quantitation (Promega, Madison, WI). In addition, cells transfected with Akt, p38, or IKK mutant constructs were co-transfected with pCMV-LacZ and assayed for transfection efficiency and/or cell death by counting β-galactosidase-positive cells as previously described (41Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed by preparing whole cell extracts in the presence of protease inhibitors or by lysing cells in 2× SDS sample buffer. The indicated primary antibodies were incubated, washed, and visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) and ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blotting antibodies were obtained from the following companies: Akt and p38 antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); M2 FLAG epitope and α-tubulin antibodies (Sigma), and HA epitope antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA). The p38 kinase assays were performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). Various cellular stimuli can activate NF-κB-dependent transcription, at least in part, through mechanisms independent of signaling pathways that influence nuclear translocation. These signaling pathways stimulate the transactivation domain of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB, presumably by targeting basal or induced levels of NF-κB in the nucleus (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 26Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory has established that Akt activates NF-κB by stimulating the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain I of RelA/p65. In addition, expression of a dominant negative mutant of IKKβ inhibited the ability of Akt to activate NF-κB (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Our results imply that Akt requires IKK to efficiently stimulate the transactivation function of NF-κB. To further address this question, we were interested in determining if Akt could activate NF-κB-dependent transcription in a setting where endogenous IKK is absent. The multisubunit IKK complex contains two primary catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and each has been shown to be involved in NF-κB activation at the level of nuclear accumulation (20Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). We utilized nullizygous IKKα and IKKβ mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and performed transient transfection experiments with M-Akt or full-length wild type RelA/p65 and an NF-κB reporter construct (3X-κB Luc). As seen in Fig.1 A, wild type RelA/p65 activated the NF-κB-responsive promoter equally in the wild type, IKKα−/−, or IKKβ−/− cells as expected. However, in response to activated Akt, the IKKβ−/− cells were deficient in NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation, and, furthermore, reintroduction of IKKβ by transfection restored this activity. Consistent with the role of Akt in regulating NF-κB transcriptional activity, IKKβ−/− cells were inhibited in their ability to activate a Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter when transfected with activated Akt and a fusion (Gal4-p65) between the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the transactivation domain I of RelA/p65 (data not shown). To determine if the reduction of NF-κB activity was due to aberrant expression of these proteins, the extracts were reanalyzed for M-Akt, IKKα, and IKKβ expression by Western blot, and both the IKKα−/− and IKKβ−/− MEFs show equal levels of M-Akt protein (data not shown). This result demonstrates that Akt requires endogenous IKKβ for efficient stimulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription in a manner distinct from the induction of nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Since Akt expression alone does not induce nuclear localization of NF-κB and because Akt requires IKK for activation of NF-κB (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Since IKKβ has been reported to phosphorylate RelA/p65 on serine 536in vitro and in vivo, it was important to determine if this site is essential for Akt-mediated RelA/p65 transactivation (24Mercurio F.

To address this question, we utilized a plasmid encoding the Gal4-p65 fusion protein, where sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 have been joined with sequences encoding the transactivation domain of RelA/p65 (37Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). This plasmid, when co-transfected with a Gal4-Luc reporter, allows us to determine whether cellular signals up-regulate gene expression by specifically targeting the transactivation domain of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB. To examine the importance of the reported IKKβ phosphorylation site, Gal4-p65 was mutated at serine 536 and for control purposes at serine 529 (Gal4-p65 S536A and S529A). The Gal4-p65 S529A mutant was examined, because serine 529 has been previously shown to be important for transactivation of NF-κB in response to tumor necrosis factor (26Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with Gal4-Luc, wild type Gal4-p65, Gal4-p65 S529A, or Gal4-p65 S536A in the presence (M-Akt) or absence (VC) of activated Akt. As shown in Fig.1 B, M-Akt stimulates the transactivation function of RelA/p65 but has little or no effect on gene expression when serine 529 or serine 536 are mutated to alanine. In addition, stimulation of cells with IL-1β also required serines 529 and 536 for efficient activation of NF-κB transactivation function (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a known IKKβ phosphorylation site, serine 536, and a known tumor necrosis factor-inducible site, serine 529, are each required for Akt to efficiently stimulate the transactivation domain of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB. Previous data from our laboratory and from others have suggested that the stress-activated kinase p38 is required for activation of NF-κB by expression of oncogenic Ras or by IL-1β treatment (33Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 42Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, p38 and IL-1β have been shown to modulate the transactivation potential of NF-κB independent of signals that induce nuclear accumulation and DNA binding (18Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining if p38 was required by IL-1β and Akt to modulate the transactivation potential of NF-κB, since it has also been demonstrated that Akt modulates the transactivation functions of NF-κB (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 18Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, it was important to determine if Akt can stimulate the phosphorylation of p38 and therefore lead to its activation. To address this question, FLAG-tagged wild type p38 (FLAG-p38) and activated Akt were transiently transfected into human 293T cells. 48 h post-transfection, extracts were prepared and analyzed for the presence of phosphorylated p38 using a p38 phosphospecific antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, activated Akt induces the phosphorylation of FLAG-p38, suggesting that p38 is a downstream target of Akt signaling. The activity of p38 in response to M-Akt was also measured by p38 kinase assay, and, as shown in Fig. 2 A, M-Akt stimulated the activity of p38 to phosphorylate the transcription factor ATF-2, a known p38 substrate. These extracts were also analyzed for equivalent FLAG-p38 and α-tubulin (to control for loading) expression (Fig. 2 A, bottom panels). Interestingly, IL-1β has been shown to activate both Akt and p38; however, it has not been demonstrated that p38 is a target of IL-1β-"

Recently, we identified a novel autosomal dominant form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C) in humans that is due to mutations within the coding sequence of the human caveolin-3 gene (3p25). These LGMD-1C mutations lead to an approximately 95% reduction in caveolin-3 protein expression, i.e. a caveolin-3 deficiency. Here, we created a caveolin-3 null (CAV3 -/-) mouse model, using standard homologous recombination techniques, to mimic a caveolin-3 deficiency. We show that these mice lack caveolin-3 protein expression and sarcolemmal caveolae membranes. In addition, analysis of skeletal muscle tissue from these caveolin-3 null mice reveals: (i) mild myopathic changes; (ii) an exclusion of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex from lipid raft domains; and (iii) abnormalities in the organization of the T-tubule system, with dilated and longitudinally oriented T-tubules. These results have clear mechanistic implications for understanding the pathogenesis of LGMD-1C at a molecular level."

These <i>t</i> tests employ either the observed variance among replicates within treatments or a Bayesian estimate of the variance among replicates within treatments based on a prior estimate obtained from a local estimate of the standard deviation. The Bayesian prior allows statistical inference to be made from microarray data even when experiments are only replicated at nominal levels. We apply these new statistical tests to a data set that examined differential gene expression patterns in IHF<sup>+</sup> and IHF<sup>−</sup> <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells (Arfin, S. M., Long, A.

These analyses identify a more biologically reasonable set of candidate genes than those identified using statistical tests not incorporating a Bayesian prior. We also show that statistical tests based on analysis of variance and a Bayesian prior identify genes that are up- or down-regulated following an experimental manipulation more reliably than approaches based only on a <i>t</i> test or fold change.

However, a conserved property of the primary VDAC isoform from all organisms tested is its ability to adopt multiple conductance states (3Colombini M. J. Membr.

Treatment of isolated mitochondria with agents that favor VDAC closure, such as β-NADH, limits metabolite flux across the outer membrane and inhibits mitochondrial function (5Benz R. Wojtczak L.

This ability of VDAC to adopt a closed configuration and inhibit ADP-coupled respiration has been suggested to contribute to the Crabtree effect (9Lee A.C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a paradoxical response in which treatment of respiring cells with glucose leads to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (10Crabtree H.G. Biochem. J. 1929; 23: 536-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OMM permeability has also been reported to play an important role in apoptosis. Failure of the OMM to sequester cytochrome c in the intermembrane space can induce apoptosis (11Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar). The pro- and anti- apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins have been shown to exert their activity by regulating mitochondrial functions (12Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar, 13Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some members of the Bcl-2 family (such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) are permanent residents of the OMM whereas many pro-apoptotic members of the family (such as Bax, Bad, and Bid) can be translocated from the cytosol to the OMM following an apoptotic signal. The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL exhibits both structural and functional similarity to prokaryotic pore-forming proteins. Both, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit cytochrome c release by regulating OMM integrity or permeability (12Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar, 13Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that VDAC may have a role in regulating cytochrome c release by forming together with Bax, a high conductivity channel that can release cytochrome c from the intermembrane space to the cytosol (14Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Wiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Recently we have found that early in apoptosis, prior to the loss of OMM integrity and the release of cytochrome c, the OMM becomes impermeable to small metabolites (15Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This impermeability might lead to further disruptions of mitochondrial homeostasis and ultimately to the loss of OMM integrity. Following growth factor withdrawal, both the loss of OMM permeability and cell death are inhibited in Bcl-xL-expressing cells (15Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Bcl-xL maintains OMM permeability remains controversial. In this study, we describe a direct biochemical activity of Bcl-xL protein in regulating the conductivity of VDAC. We demonstrate that Bcl-xL can increase the probability of VDAC to be in an open configuration under conditions that favor VDAC closure. Therefore, it is suggested that in response to an apoptotic signal that would result in VDAC closure, Bcl-xL promotes the open configuration of VDAC and maintains metabolite exchange between the mitochondria and the cytosol. FL5.12 cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 300 pg/ml recombinant mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3) (PharMingen). For growth factor withdrawal, cells were washed three times in serum-free medium and resuspended in full medium with (control) or without IL-3. Full-length humanBcl-xL was cloned into the pET-16b bacterial expression vector (Novagen), and recombinant protein was purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli on a Ni2+column using a standard commercial kit (Novagen). Following elution of the protein with increasing concentrations of imidazole (100 mm to 1 m) the different fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The fractions that contained the recombinant protein (>95% purity) were combined and dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. The recombinant protein was concentrated to 2 mg/ml using a centrifugal filter (Millipore), divided into aliquots, and kept frozen (−80 °C) until used. For Western blot analysis, the 13.6 anti-Bcl-xL polyclonal antibody and the 7H8-2C12 anti-cytochrome c antibody (PharMingen) were used. Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver by differential centrifugation as previously described (16Parsons D.F. Williams G.R. Chance B. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1966; 137: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Following removal of soluble protein by hypotonic shock and centrifugation, the mitochondrial membranes were stored in 1 mm KCl, 1 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 15% (v/v) Me2SO as 1-ml aliquots at −85 °C. VDAC protein was purified from single aliquots of the mitochondrial membranes using a hydroxyapatite/celite column as previously reported (17Freitag H. Benz R. Neupert W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and as modified (18Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S.Z. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The VDAC protein was dissolved in 3% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 15% Me2SO, and stored at −20 °C (short term) or −85 °C (long term). Mitochondria were isolated from FL5.12 cells and phosphocreatine levels were measured by HPLC as described previously (15Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Where indicated, mitochondria were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence or absence of recombinant Bcl-xL prior to the measurement of phosphocreatine or Western blot analysis. Mouse liver mitochondria were isolated by tight dounce homogenization and differential centrifugation in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, recombinant Bcl-xL was incubated with mitochondria at the specified concentration for 10 min at room temperature. Immediately prior to use in respiration studies, mitochondria were diluted into 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 containing 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm succinate, 3 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. β-NADH and ADP were added at concentrations of 100 μm. Oxygen consumption was measured in a functionally airtight water-jacketed chamber at room temperature using a polarographic oxygen electrode. Membranes were made from monolayers of diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine by the method of Montal and Mueller (19Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar) and as modified (20Colombini M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recordings were made under voltage-clamp conditions using calomel electrodes with saturated KCl bridges. Current was filtered at 90 Hz using a Butterworth filter. Mitochondria isolated from growth factor-deprived cells have lost the ability to exchange organic metabolites such as ATP, ADP, and phosphocreatine with the cytosol (15Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It was previously suggested that this is because of a decrease in OMM permeability to small anionic metabolites. In IL-3-dependent FL5.12 cells, changes in OMM permeability following IL-3 withdrawal can be detected by measuring phosphocreatine levels in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (15Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). To determine whether Bcl-xL can restore outer membrane anion permeability when added directly to mitochondria impaired in phosphocreatine exchange, recombinant Bcl-xL was generated. Recombinant Bcl-xL efficiently incorporated into mitochondria isolated from growth factor-deprived cells (Fig. 1 B). Addition of recombinant Bcl-xL resulted in an 80% (±15%) decrease in the amount of phosphocreatine present in the intermembrane space (Fig.1 C). This indicates that Bcl-xL can facilitate the equilibration of phosphocreatine across the OMM. Bcl-xLdid not appear to induce phosphocreatine release by nonspecifically disrupting the integrity of the OMM as the release of cytochromec from these same mitochondria was not observed (Fig.1 D). As a positive control for cytochrome crelease, mitochondria were subjected to hypotonic shock. Hypotonic shock results in matrix swelling and the nonspecific disruption of the OMM. Under these conditions both cytochrome c and phosphocreatine were released from isolated mitochondria. Hexokinase, another protein reported to interact with the OMM (21Adams V. Griffin L. Towbin J. Gelb B. Worley K. McCabe E.R. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1991; 45: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), failed to induce either phosphocreatine or cytochrome c release (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that Bcl-xLcan act at the mitochondria to restore outer membrane permeability to anions without disrupting the ability of the membrane to retain intermembrane space proteins. Bcl-xL forms ion channels in vitro(22Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 23Lam M. Bhat M.B. Nunez G. Ma J. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17307-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that a channel activity of Bcl-xL may be directly responsible for the equilibration of phosphocreatine across the outer membrane. To test this possibility, the ability of Bcl-xL channels to pass phosphocreatine was examined by reconstitution into planar phospholipid membranes. Recombinant Bcl-xL was inserted into an uncharged phospholipid membrane in the presence of a 2-fold chemical gradient of Na2+ phosphocreatine−2. All permeant ions tend to flow down their concentration gradient carrying charge across the membrane. The more permeant ions will carry a greater charge across the membrane resulting in a current. The voltage that brings this current to zero (the reversal potential) is related to the relative permeability of the ions. The current through the membrane, recorded as a function of voltage, is illustrated before and after addition of Bcl-xL (Fig. 2). The intercept, indicated by the arrow, shows the voltage at which no current flowed through the Bcl-xL channels. For comparison, the reversal potential would have been 0 mV in the absence of selectivity, and +9 mV if only phosphocreatine were able to permeate. The reversal potential measured for Bcl-xLchannels (−14.1 ± 1.5 mV (mean ± 1 S.D.)) is consistent with a channel that is unable to pass phosphocreatine (Fig. 2). Furthermore, this reversal potential was indistinguishable from that recorded under identical conditions for gramicidin channels (−14.1 ± 0.5 mV) (data not shown). Because it is well established that gramicidin channels are ideally selective for cations over anions and that they are impermeable to molecules larger than water (24Finkelstein A. Andersen O.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1981; 59: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the channels formed by both gramicidin and Bcl-xL must be impermeable to phosphocreatine. Thus, Bcl-xL ion channels do not directly increase the permeability of the outer membrane to metabolic anions such as phosphocreatine. Bcl-xL must influence the properties of the outer membrane indirectly, possibly by promoting the ability of other channels to pass complex anions. The major outer membrane channel, VDAC, is permeable to anionic metabolites in the open state, but exhibits a large reduction in permeability to anions such as phosphocreatine when the channel adopts closed configurations (15Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 25Hodge T. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, VDAC must be closed for phosphocreatine to be retained in isolated mitochondria. In vitro, the presence of a membrane potential closes VDAC and has been shown to favor Bcl-xL channel formation (22Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bcl-xL can alter OMM permeability via an effect on VDAC when residing in the same membrane, the ability of recombinant Bcl-xL to alter VDAC channel properties was examined. Purified rat liver VDAC reconstituted into a planar phospholipid membrane exhibits decreased channel conductance (closed states) when a voltage is applied across the membrane. In results from a typical experiment, average conductance through VDAC channels is illustrated before and after Bcl-xL addition (Fig.3 A). Bcl-xL caused an increase in conductance (channel opening) at potentials between −25 mV and +25 mV. This increase correlates with the amount of Bcl-xL added in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in membrane conductance reflects an increase in VDAC channel conductance rather than an additive effect of independent Bcl-xL and VDAC channels because the conductance of Bcl-xL channels is much lower than that of VDAC channels. The failure of Bcl-xL addition to increase conductance through VDAC at potentials greater than +25 mV or less than −25 mV define a limit past which Bcl-xL does not influence VDAC closure. To further explore the effect of Bcl-xL on VDAC channel properties, single-channel experiments that determine the conductance of each state and transitions between states were performed. Sample traces from one such experiment show the conductance (slope of trace) and transitions between states (vertical connecting lines) as voltage was varied between ± 50 mV (Fig.3 B). The probabilistic nature of single-molecule behavior does not allow one to observe differences merely by examining one trace. From analysis of many such traces, the probability of observing the channel in its highest conducting state (the open probability) was determined (Fig. 3 C). VDAC channels have two gating processes working at opposite potentials (26Song J. Midson C. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2926-2944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Bcl-xLincreased the open probability primarily for the gating process that occurs at positive potentials, indicating an asymmetric effect. Because this effect was observed when Bcl-xL was added to both sides of the membrane, the asymmetry is likely a property of VDAC. A second-order effect on VDAC conductance was also observed. The single-channel conductance of VDAC in both the open and closed states was reduced by about 5% when Bcl-xL was added. This may reflect an interaction between the proteins or may be attributed to a physical interference with VDAC conductance caused by the close proximity of the proteins in the membrane. The single-channel experiments indicate that Bcl-xL increases the conductance of VDAC by increasing the probability of the channel to be open. This also explains the ability of Bcl-xL to increase the permeability of the OMM. To explore this property further, the ability of Bcl-xL to maintain outer membrane permeability to relevant anions such as ADP was tested under conditions that are known to close VDAC. β-NADH favors VDAC closure in planar phospholipid membranes (8Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and decreases the permeability of the outer membrane to ADP in isolated mitochondria (9Lee A.C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of recombinant Bcl-xL to mitochondria isolated from mouse liver resulted in a dose-dependent incorporation of Bcl-xL onto the mitochondria (Fig.4 A). Examining ADP-dependent respiration in the presence and absence of recombinant Bcl-xL tested whether Bcl-xL can affect the permeability of the OMM. Consistent with the high outer membrane permeability expected when VDAC is open, the addition of recombinant Bcl-xL had no measurable effect on ADP-dependent respiration in the absence of β-NADH (data not shown). However, recombinant Bcl-xL prevented β-NADH addition from prolonging the time it takes the mitochondria to complete the respiratory burst induced by a defined amount of ADP (Fig.4 B). ADP-dependent respiration requires both the diffusion of ADP across the outer membrane and the facilitated transport of ADP across the inner membrane by the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT). A steady-state level of ADP is maintained in the intermembrane space resulting in equal fluxes across both membranes. At physiological levels of ADP, the diffusion-based flux through the outer membrane can become rate-limiting. This is manifested as a delay in the time that the change in PO2, which corresponds to the conversion of a given bolus of ADP to ATP, is achieved. The delay in the transition between state III (ADP present) and state IV (ADP converted to ATP) was used to calculate the change in outer membrane permeability by using the method of Lee et al. (9Lee A.C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Lee A.C. Colombini M. Methods Cell Sci. 1997; 19: 71-81Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The respiration data were fitted to a theoretical expression that accounts for the diffusion through VDAC in the outer membrane and the saturable transport across the inner membrane by the ANT, using Equation 1,d[ADP]/dt=−PA×([ADP]media−[ADP]ims)=−(Vmax×[ADP]ims)/(Km+[ADP]ims)Equation 1 where PA is the OMM permeability × area andV max and Km represent kinetic properties of ANT. The fitted parameters were the permeability of the outer membrane and the kinetic constants for the ANT. Whereas the ANT kinetic parameters varied little, significant differences in outer membrane permeability were observed in response to β-NADH and were prevented by the presence of recombinant Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL prevented β-NADH from retarding the completion of an ADP-induced respiratory burst in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in reductions in the calculated ADP concentration gradient across the OMM (Fig. 4 C). These parameters were used to calculate the changes in OMM permeability in the presence of β-NADH, in response to increased amounts of recombinant Bcl-xL (Fig. 4 D). The results suggest that Bcl-xL promotes adenine nucleotide flux across the OMM under conditions that would normally favor VDAC closure. Recombinant Bcl-xL protein favors the open state of VDAC in a planar phospholipid membrane. This results in an increase in the probability of VDAC opening when a potential (−25 mV to +25 mV) is applied. Furthermore, mitochondria that have incorporated recombinant Bcl-xL do not demonstrate a β-NADH-induced delay in completing a defined change in PO2 in response to a given dose of ADP. Thus, Bcl-xL can maintain the permeability of the outer membrane to ADP in the presence of a VDAC closing stimulus. Previously, it was suggested that Bcl-xL might modulate VDAC activity by keeping it in a closed configuration and preventing cytochrome c release (28Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL does not result in a reduction in respiration rate as would be expected if either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL were to close VDAC, and it seems unlikely that under normal conditions Bcl-xL closes VDAC. It is possible though that under some conditions Bcl-2/Bcl-xL stabilize VDAC and prevent formation of a cytochrome c-releasing pore (13Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 29Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study support the hypothesis that Bcl-xL functions to maintain VDAC in an open configuration under conditions that favor VDAC closure. This open configuration of VDAC does not enable the passage of cytochrome c, but maintains free metabolite exchange across the OMM, supporting oxidative phosphorylation. Whereas VDAC appears to close following growth factor withdrawal (15Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), the signal that induces VDAC closure is not known. It is possible that the translocation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax to mitochondria might directly or indirectly result in VDAC closure. Alternatively, VDAC closure may result as a consequence of changes in cellular metabolism. For instance, an early cellular response to growth factor withdrawal is a decrease in both the mitochondrial membrane potential and the rate of electron transport (30Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This decrease in mitochondrial function may result in NADH accumulation because oxidative phosphorylation is required to efficiently regenerate NAD from NADH. Alternatively, changes in metabolite flux across the OMM may be responsible for inducing a potential across the outer membrane (31Lemeshko S.V. Lemeshko V.V. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2785-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There are several possible ways by which Bcl-xL could maintain the open configuration of VDAC. Bcl-xL may alter the gating properties of VDAC by physically interacting with it. Based upon co-immunoprecipitation studies of detergent-solubilized membranes, it has been reported that Bcl-xL can interact with VDAC (28Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether this reflects an actual physical association of the proteins within the membrane, or the innate properties of hydrophobic proteins following membrane dissolution. Alternatively, Bcl-xL may insert into the membrane and alter the local electrical or lipid environment of the membrane and inhibit VDAC closure indirectly. If the action is indirect, it must be exerted in close proximity to VDAC. In any event, the action of Bcl-xL is to favor the open configuration of VDAC. Factors favoring the closed state, such as high electric fields, can overcome the effects of Bcl-xL. Recombinant Bcl-xL can regulate metabolic anion exchange across the OMM. This demonstrates for the first time a direct function for an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in an organelle to which it is targeted. The regulation of VDAC gating properties may at least partially explain the ability of Bcl-xL to promote cell survival. By facilitating the continued exchange of metabolites across the OMM during periods of cellular stress, Bcl-xL protects against a disruption in mitochondrial physiology that results in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (30Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the demonstration that metabolite flux through VDAC can be regulated by Bcl-xL may explain how Bcl-2 proteins impact on both the redox state and pH of the cell (32Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 33Gottlieb E. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Maintaining ADP-coupled oxidative phosphorylation should limit lactate production, reduce the amount of glucose consumed by glycolysis, and preserve greater substrate availability for the production of reducing equivalents through the pentose phosphate shunt. Changes in both pH and redox state have been associated with apoptosis. Thus, the ability of Bcl-2 proteins to regulate transport across mitochondrial membranes could account for their ability to affect a wide variety of apoptotic pathways.

Chiral analysis revealed that 4-HPNE formed from 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13S-HPODE) retains >90% Sconfiguration, whereas it is nearly racemic from 9S-hydroperoxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9S-HPODE). 9-Hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid is >90%S when derived from 9S-HPODE and almost racemic from 13S-HPODE. Through analysis of intermediates and products, we provide evidence that (i) allylic hydrogen abstraction at C-8 of 13S-HPODE leads to a 10,13-dihydroperoxide that undergoes cleavage between C-9 and C-10 to give 4S-HPNE, whereas direct Hock cleavage of the 13S-HPODE gives 12-oxo-9Z-dodecenoic acid, which oxygenates to racemic 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid; by contrast, (ii) 9S-HPODE cleaves directly to 3Z-nonenal as a precursor of racemic 4-HPNE, whereas allylic hydrogen abstraction at C-14 and oxygenation to a 9,12-dihydroperoxide leads to chiral 9S-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid.

Within this group, the most abundant member was identified as 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE)1. In the ensuing years, 4-HNE has achieved status as one of the best recognized and most studied of the cytotoxic products of lipid peroxidation (4Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 5Comporti M. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition to studies on its bioactivity, 4-HNE is commonly used as a biomarker for the occurrence and/or the extent of lipid peroxidation. The reviews on the production of 4-HNE include its involvement in cell cycle control (6Fazio V.M. Rinaldi M. Ciafre S. Barrera G. Farace M.G. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the oxidative alterations in Alzheimer's disease (7Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 8Keller J.N. Mattson M.P. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 9: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and its participation in the formation of etheno DNA-base adducts (9Nair J. Barbin A. Velic I. Bartsch H. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Despite the volumes of literature on the occurrence and activities of 4-HNE, there are comparatively few studies on how it is formed. It is recognized that linoleic acid and arachidonic acid are among the potential precursors for 4-HNE formation and that the nine carbons of 4-HNE are represented by the last nine carbons of these ω-6 essential fatty acids. It was also reported in the early work (4Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar) that 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid is a precursor. In 1990, Porter and Pryor (10Porter N.A. Pryor W.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 541-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) presented a hypothesis paper that proposed several mechanisms of 4-HNE formation involving the 4,5-epoxy derivative as the intermediate. The first experimental evidence for a pathway from fatty acid hydroperoxides to 4-HNE stemmed from the work of Gardner and Hamberg (11Gardner H.W. Hamberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6971-6977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the biosynthesis of 4-HNE in broad bean extracts. They established that the aldehydic product of the reaction of 9-hydroperoxylinoleic acid with hydroperoxide lyase, namely 3Z-nonenal, can be converted to 4-hydroperoxy-2E-nonenal (4-HPNE) by a reaction of molecular oxygen, mainly catalyzed in this case by a 3Z-alkenal oxygenase. 4-HPNE is a simple reduction step removed from 4-HNE. Gardner and Hamberg (11Gardner H.W. Hamberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6971-6977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also substantiated an additional route to 4-HNE via peroxygenase reactions utilizing the co-substrates 3Z-nonenal and 4-HPNE; the existence of a nonenzymatic pathway was also implicated. Subsequent work by Gardner and Grove (12Gardner H.W. Grove M.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that 3Z-nonenal is a substrate for soybean lipoxygenase, which thus could function as a 3Z-alkenal oxygenase and that the product is 4-HPNE. More recently, Noordermeeret al. (13Noordermeer M.A. Feussner I. Kolbe A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) implicated nonenzymatic oxygenation of 3Z-alkenals (via 4-hydroperoxy intermediates) as the major pathway of production of 4-HNE and related 4-hydroxyalkenals in plant extracts. 4-HPNE also has been detected as a nonenzymatic breakdown product of 13-HPODE (14Lee S.H. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the present work, we utilized both 9-HPODE and 13-HPODE as model fatty acid hydroperoxides to study the mechanisms of nonenzymatic formation of the 4-hydroxyalkenals. Both fatty acid hydroperoxides give rise to 4-H(P)NE, but each has differing rates and susceptibilities to inhibition by α-tocopherol. The use of chiral starting materials and analyses of stereochemistry of the products reveal a pathway from ω-6 hydroperoxides (13-HPODE) to the 4-hydroxyalkenals and insights into the stereochemistry of the nonenzymatic reactions. 13S-HPODE was synthesized from linoleic acid using soybean lipoxygenase (Sigma, Type V) and purified by preparative SP-HPLC (Alltech Econosil silica, 1.0 × 25 cm, hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid 100:1.5:0.1 by volume at 4 ml/min). 9S-HPODE was synthesized using a lipoxygenase preparation from tomato fruit (15Matthew J.A. Chan H.W.-S. Galliard T. Lipids. 1977; 12: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and purified using the same SP-HPLC conditions as above. The hydroperoxides were stored as a 5 mg/ml stock solution in acetonitrile or methanol under argon at −80 °C. 25-μg aliquots of the linoleic acid hydroperoxides were transferred into 1.5-ml plastic tubes and evaporated from the solvent under a stream of nitrogen. In some experiments, α-tocopherol from a stock solution in ethanol, 5 or 10% (w/w), was added prior to evaporation. The tubes were placed in a 37 °C oven and removed after a 1-, 2-, or 4-h incubation. 30 μl of column solvent was added, and the complete content was injected on an RP-HPLC column (Waters Symmetry C18 5 μm, 0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (60:40:0.01 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored using an HP 1040A diode array detector. For product identification and chiral analyses, 5-mg aliquots of 13S- and 9S-HPODE were autoxidized for 5 h at 37 °C. 4-HPNE was prepared from an incubation of 1 mg of 9S-HPODE with a crude bacterial lysate of a hydroperoxide lyase from melon fruit expressed inEscherichia coli (16Tijet N. Schneider C. Muller B.L. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 4-HPNE (retention time 5.7 min) was isolated using a Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (60:40:0.01) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The collected product was evaporated from acetonitrile, extracted using a 100-mg C18 cartridge (Varian) eluted with diethyl ether, and dried over Na2SO4. An aliquot of the 4-HPNE was reduced with triphenylphosphine to 4-HNE, repurified by RP-HPLC (retention time 4.6 min), and derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to the trimethylsilyl ether derivative. GC-MS analysis yielded the following diagnostic fragments: m/z 199 [M+ − CHO]; m/z 157 [CHO–C2H2–CH–OSi(CH3)3+]; and m/z 129 [CHO–C2H2–CH–OSi(CH3)3+− CO]. 1H NMR spectra of 4-HPNE were recorded in CD3CN on a Bruker WM 400-MHz spectrometer using residual CH3CN as an internal reference (δ = 1.92 ppm): 9.58 ppm, d, J = 7.8 Hz, H1; 6.9 ppm, dd, J= 15.9 Hz, 6.2 Hz, H3; 6.25 ppm, ddd, J = 15.9 Hz, 7.8 Hz, 1.2 Hz, H2; 4.6 ppm, q, J ∼ 6.5 Hz, H4. 9-Hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid was prepared from a 5-mg reaction of 13S-HPODE with an expressed and purified recombinant hydroperoxide lyase from melon fruit in 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (16Tijet N. Schneider C. Muller B.L. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After 5 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 1 n HCl up to pH 4.5 and extracted twice with 30 ml of ethyl acetate containing 250 μg α-tocopherol. The pooled organic phases were washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude mixture was kept under an atmosphere of oxygen at 37 °C for 7 days. 9-Hydroxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid and 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid were isolated by RP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS column (1.0 × 25 cm) eluted with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (37.5:62.5:0.01 by volume) at 4 ml/min (retention times of 5.4 and 7.3 min, respectively). The collected fractions were evaporated from acetonitrile, and the products were extracted using a 100-mg C18 cartridge (Varian) eluted with ethyl acetate and dried over Na2SO4. For the GC-MS analysis, 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid was reduced with triphenylphosphine, treated with methoxime hydrochloride and ethereal diazomethane, and purified by RP-HPLC. Thesyn- and anti-isomers gave essentially the same fragment ions at m/z 240 [M+− OCH3], 114 [COC2H2CH=NOCH3]+, and 86 [C2H2CH=NOCH3]+.1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Bruker WM 400 MHz spectrometer using residual CHCl3 as internal reference (δ = 7.26 ppm). 9-Hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid: 9.61 ppm, d,J = 7.7 Hz, H12; 6.79 ppm, dd, J = 15.9 Hz, 6.3 Hz, H10; 6.30 ppm, ddd, J = 15.9 Hz, 7.7/7.8 Hz, 1.0 Hz, H11; 4.65 ppm, dt, J = 6.2 Hz, 0.9 Hz, H9; 2.36 ppm, t, J = 7.4 Hz, H2. 9-Hydroxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid: 9.59 ppm, d,J = 7.8 Hz, H12; 6.82 ppm, dd, J = 15.7 Hz, 4.7 Hz, H10; 6.31 ppm, ddd, J = 15.7 Hz, 7.8 Hz, 1.4 Hz, H11; 4.43 ppm, m, 1H, H9. The 8,13-diHPODEs and 9,14-diHPODEs were isolated from a 5-mg autoxidation of 13S-HPODE or 9S-HPODE, respectively, by RP-HPLC (Beckman Ultrasphere ODS 10 μm, 1.0 × 25 cm eluted with a solvent of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.01) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min). For 1H NMR analysis, the collected 8,13-diHPODEs were reduced with NaBH4, methylated, and further purified by SP-HPLC using a Whatman Partisil 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) and a solvent of hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (90:10:0.1 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded in C6D6 using residual benzene as internal reference (δ = 7.24 ppm). Aliquots of the samples collected from the initial RP-HPLC separation were used for analysis by LC-ESI-MS. LC-coordination ion spray-MS of the Ag+ adduct ions of the linoleic acid dihydroperoxides was performed on a triple-stage quadrupole TSQ7000 instrument (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) using conditions essentially as described (17Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The HPLC parameters were: Beckman Ultrasphere Si column (0.2 × 25 cm) eluted with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (90:10:0.1 by volume) at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min. A solution of AgBF4 in isopropanol (0.3 mm) was mixed to the column effluent before the ESI interface using a syringe pump at a pump rate of 75 μl/min. For the GC-MS analysis the pairs of diastereomers were collected from RP-HPLC, reduced with triphenylphosphine, methylated using ethereal diazomethane, and further purified by SP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere Si column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (90:10:0.1 by volume) at 1 ml/min. The collected products were hydrogenated using 5% palladium on alumina and treated with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide/pyridine. GC-MS was performed on a Finnigan Incos 50 mass spectrometer connected to an HP5890A gas chromatograph. For GC, an 8-m OV1701 column was used with a temperature program starting at 150 °C (1 min isotherm) and a rate of 15 °C/min to 300 °C (4 min isotherm). 4-HPNE and 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid were quantified using an external calibration curve obtained by injecting aliquots of 4-HNE (5–100 ng) on the RP-HPLC system used for product analysis and plotting against peak height. 100 μg of a racemic standard of 4-HNE (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were reacted with a molar excess of methyl oxime hydrochloride in 20 μl of pyridine at room temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of methylene chloride and washed three times with 500 μl of water to remove residual reagent and pyridine. The 4-HNE methoxime derivatives were separated on a Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.01 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 235 nm. The two isomers (synand anti) eluted at 10.4 and 11.2 min retention time, respectively. The later eluting isomer was analyzed by chiral phase HPLC using a Chiralpak AD (0.46 × 25 cm) column eluted with hexane/ethanol (90:10 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored using an HP 1040A diode array detector. 20 μg of the chemically synthesized 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid were reduced with triphenylphosphine and treated with methyl oxime hydrochloride in pyridine overnight. The sample was extracted, washed, evaporated, and dissolved in 20 μl of methanol. To this solution a few drops of ethereal diazomethane were added, and the sample was evaporated immediately. The syn- and anti-methoxime (MOX) isomers (retention times of 10.0 and 10.8 min, respectively) were isolated from RP-HPLC (Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column 0.46 × 25 cm) using acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (37.5:62.5:0.01 by volume) as solvent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Chiral analysis of the earlier eluting isomer was performed using the chiral phase HPLC conditions described above. From a 5-mg autoxidation of 13S-HPODE and 9S-HPODE (5 h at 37 °C), 4-HPNE and 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid were isolated by RP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS 10-μm column (1.0 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.01) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The products were reduced with an excess of triphenylphosphine and then further derivatized, purified, and analyzed essentially as described for the racemic standards. The enantiomers of the racemic 4-HNE methoxime derivative and methyl-9-hydroxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid methoxime derivative were collected from the chiral phase HPLC separations. The four products were evaporated from solvent under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in 50 μl of dry acetonitrile. 1 μl of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene and a few grains of 1-(2-naphthoyl)imidazole (Fluka) were added. The reaction was kept at room temperature overnight, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 1 ml of methylene chloride, washed three times with water, and evaporated; finally the naphthoate derivatives were purified by SP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere Si column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (100:1:0.1 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For UV and CD spectroscopy, the collected products were evaporated from column solvent and dissolved in acetonitrile to a final A 239 nm of 1 absorbance unit (4-HNE derivatives) or 0.2 absorbance units (methyl-9-hydroxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid derivatives). CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-700 spectropolarimeter. The 13- and 9-linoleic acid hydroperoxides were autoxidized in 25-μg aliquots as a dry film in open 1.5-ml plastic tubes at 37 °C for 1, 2, or 4 h. At each time point column solvent was added to the tubes, and the complete sample was injected on RP-HPLC. The time course of the decay of 9- and 13-HPODE in the presence and absence of α-tocopherol is shown in Fig.1. Over the course of 4 h at 37 °C the plain hydroperoxides are about 90% degraded, whereas in the presence of α-tocopherol the degradation is slowed down to about 70–80% remaining hydroperoxides after 4 h. The polar products formed in the autoxidation reactions were analyzed by RP-HPLC (Fig.2). In these chromatograms, the autoxidations of 13S-HPODE (Fig. 2 A) and 9S-HPODE (Fig. 2 B) were analyzed after 1 h, and the autoxidation of 13S-HPODE in the presence of 5% (w/w) α-tocopherol was analyzed after 4 h (Fig. 2 C). The polar products with distinctive UV chromophores were designated as 1–7. Compounds 1 and 3 were formed from both hydroperoxides. Compounds 2, 4, and 5 were products of the 13-hydroperoxide, and 6 and 7 were products from 9-HPODE. The arrows in Fig. 2 indicate the retention time of 4-HNE, detected only as a minor product from 13S- and 9S-HPODE in these experiments (<5 ng/25 μg HPODE). Over the course of the 4-h period of autoxidation, no additional abundant products were formed, and there were only minor changes in the product pattern. Compound 3 was identified as 4-HPNE based on identical UV spectra (λmax 223 nm in RP-HPLC column solvent; Fig. 3) and co-chromatography with a synthesized standard. Furthermore, treatment of compound 3 with triphenylphosphine yielded a product that co-chromatographed on RP-HPLC with authentic 4-HNE. The UV spectra of compounds 1 and 3 (4-HPNE) were almost indistinguishable, but compound 1 eluted at a much earlier retention time. The reduction of compound 1 with triphenylphosphine resulted in a slightly more polar product on RP-HPLC and with a UV spectrum almost identical to 4-HNE (Fig. 3). Based on the chromatographic and spectroscopic data, compound 1 was suspected to be 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid, a C-12 aldehyde derivative that retains the original carboxyl group of the starting fatty acid hydroperoxide. An authentic standard of 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid was synthesized through the following steps: (i) preparation of 13S-HPODE from linoleic acid using soybean lipoxygenase, (ii) cleavage of the hydroperoxide using a recombinant hydroperoxide lyase from melon fruit (16Tijet N. Schneider C. Muller B.L. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), (iii) autoxidation of the 12-oxo-9Z-dodecenoic acid cleavage product in the presence of α-tocopherol, and (iv) isolation of the 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid by RP-HPLC. The identification of compound 3 as 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid was confirmed by 1H NMR and by GC-MS analysis of the triphenylphosphine-reduced methyl ester methoxime derivative. Compound 2 was identified by LC-MS and 1H NMR as 11-oxo-9Z-undecenoic acid (data not shown). This product is not directly involved in the pathways leading to the formation of the 4-hydro(pero)xyalkenals. Further characterization of this product and its mechanism of formation will be reported elsewhere. As determined by the RP-HPLC analysis, compounds 4 and 5 (derived from 13S-HPODE; Fig. 2 A) and 6 and 7 (derived from 9S-HPODE, Fig. 2 B) were formed consistently in the same relative amount to each other during the 4-h time period of autoxidation. They showed identical UV spectra indicative of atrans,trans conjugated diene (λmax231 nm; Fig. 3) (18Ingram C.D. Brash A.R. Lipids. 1988; 23: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), giving the strong implication that these products were pairs of diastereomers. LC-ESI-MS analysis of the Ag+-adduct ion revealed two [M + Ag+] adduct ions at m/z 451 and 453 for compounds 4, 5, 6, and 7 (Fig. 4). This corresponds to a molecular weight of 344, which is compatible with linoleic acid dihydroperoxides. To reveal the position of the hydroperoxide groups on the fatty acid carbon chain, GC-MS analysis (electron impact mode) was performed on the reduced, methylated, and hydrogenated bis-trimethylsilyl-ether derivatives. The mass spectra of derivatized compounds 4 and 5 (derived from 13S-HPODE) showed characteristic ions at m/z 459 [M − CH3]+, 245 [CH3CO2 C8H13OSi(CH3)3]+and 331 [HCOSi(CH3)3C5H9OSi(CH3)3 C5H11]+(indicating the C-8 hydroxyl), and 403 [CH3CO2C8 H13OSi(CH3)3C5H9OSi(CH3)3]+and 173 [HCOSi(CH3)3 C5H11]+(indicating the C-13 hydroxyl) (Fig.5 A). Finally, 1H NMR of the reduced compounds 4 and 5 (8,13-dihydroxyoctadecadienoates) fully supported the structures. 1H NMR (400 MHz, in deuterated benzene using 7.24 ppm for the residual protons in the solvent) gave for the methyl ester of the 8,13-dihydroxyoctadecadienoate derivative of compound 4: δ (ppm) 0.94, t, 3 protons, H18; 0.98 (d, two protons, –OH, J8,-OH = J13,-OH = 3.5 Hz); 1.2–1.8 (m, 18 protons, H3-H7, and H14-H17); 2.14 (t, 2 protons, H2); 4.00 (m, 2 protons, H8, H13); 5.67 (m, 2 protons, H9, H12); and 6.24 (m, 2 protons, H10, H11). These data confirm the symmetry of the 1,6-dihydroxy-2,4-diene system; the olefinic region shows two complex multiplets, each comprised of two superimposed protons (H10/H11 at 6.24 ppm and H9/H10 at 5.67 ppm), and similarly a superimposed signal for the two geminal hydroxy protons (H8, H13 at 4.00 ppm). The fact that these signals consist of overlapping pairs of protons of identical chemical shift results in nonlinear effects that precluded a ready assignment of the coupling constant across the double bonds. For example, decoupling of the signal for H9/H12 at 5.67 ppm caused the downfield signal for the internal pair of olefinic protons to simplify to a singlet (rather than a doublet), a predictable result based on the lack of coupling between the two superimposed proton signals for H10/H11 (19Silverstein R.M. Bassler G.C. Morrill T.C. Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds. 4th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 181-247Google Scholar). Despite their complexity, the 1H NMR spectra were entirely supportive of the structures deduced from the UV and MS data.Figure 5Mass spectra (electron impact mode) of 8,13-dihydroperoxy-9E,11E-octadecadienoic acid (A) and 9,14-dihydroperoxy-10E,12E-octadecadienoic acid (B) of the reduced, methylated, and hydrogenated trimethylsilyl ether derivative.

GC-MS analysis of the equivalent derivatives of compounds 6 and 7 derived from 9S-HPODE showed major fragments at m/z 459 [M − CH3]+, 259 [CH3CO2C9H15OSi(CH3)3]+and 317 [HCOSi(CH3)3C5H9OSi(CH3)3C4H9]+(indicating the C-9 hydroxyl), and 417 [CH3CO2C9H15OSi(CH3)3C5H9OSi(CH3)3]+and 159 [HCOSi(CH3)3C4H9]+(indicating the C-14 hydroxyl) (Fig. 5 B). Compounds 6 and 7 were thus identified as 9,14-dihydroperoxyoctadeca-10E,12E-dienoic acids, also presumably a pair of diastereomers with the 9S,14S and 9S,14Rconfiguration. In Fig.6 the time course of the formation of 4-HPNE (compound 3) and 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid (compound 1) during the autoxidation of 13S- and 9S-HPODE is shown. Starting with 25 μg of 13S-HPODE, ∼100 ng of 4-HPNE are detected after 4 h of autoxidation, whereas from the same amount of 9S-HPODE, less than half as much 4-HPNE is detected (Fig. 6 A). In the formation of 9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid, more is generated from 9S-HPODE (∼100 ng from 25 μg) than from 13S-HPODE (∼30 ng from 25 μg) (Fig.6 B). Autoxidations of 25-μg aliquots of 13S-HPODE as a dry film were carried out in the presence of 5% α-tocopherol for 1, 2, and 4 h. As shown in Fig. 1, the rate of decay of the hydroperoxide is decreased in the presence of α-tocopherol. A representative chromatogram obtained after 4-h autoxidation at 37 °C shows the formation of compound 1 (9-hydroperoxy-12-oxo-10E-dodecenoic acid) as the major product with absorbance at 220 nm (Fig. 2 C). 4-HPNE (compound 3) and the UV-absorbing conjugated diHPODEs are only minor products in these experiments. To provide insights into the mechanism(s) of formation of 4-HPNE, an HPLC method for the chiral resolution of the more stable reduction product 4-HNE was developed. Injection of underivatized 4-HNE on the chiral column used resulted in the reaction of 4-HNE with the chiral stationary phase (Chiralp"
https://openalex.org/W2049180642,"Bax is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that commits the cell to undergo programmed cell death in response to apoptotic stimuli. To gain further insights into Bax mechanisms, we have identified a novel Bax-binding protein, termed Bif-1, by using a yeast two-hybrid cloning technique. Bif-1 is an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic protein that contains a predicted Src homology 3 (SH3) domain located near its C terminus but shares no significant homology with members of the Bcl-2 family. A Northern blot analysis indicates that Bif-1 is expressed in most tissues with abundant expression in heart and skeletal muscle. Bif-1 is capable of interacting with Bax as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence studies. Induction of apoptosis in murine pre-B hematopoietic cells FL5.12 by interleukin-3 withdrawal results in increased association of Bax with Bif-1, which is accompanied by a conformational change in the Bax protein. Overexpression of Bif-1 promotes Bax conformational change, caspase activation, and apoptotic cell death in FL5.12 cells following interleukin-3 deprivation. Bif-1 thus represents a new type of regulator of Bax-mediated signaling pathways for apoptosis.AF350371"

Removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains by chondroitinase ABC digestion did not significantly affect binding. In coprecipitation experiments, biglycan and decorin bound to collagen VI and equally competed with the other, suggesting that biglycan and decorin bind to the same binding site on collagen VI. This was confirmed by electron microscopy after negative staining of complexes between gold-labeled proteoglycans and collagen VI, demonstrating that both biglycan and decorin bound exclusively to a domain close to the interface between the N terminus of the triple helical region and the following globular domain.

Tris-buffered saline 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide Collagens are a large family of extracellular structural proteins made up of three α chains that are intracellularly associated and folded into specific structures including characteristic triple helical domains (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). The major class, recognized as the fibril-forming collagens, contains molecules with one large uninterrupted triple helical domain (for review, see Refs. 1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar and 2von der Mark K. Seibel M.J. Robins S.P. Bilezikian J.P. Dynamics of Bone and Cartilage Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1999: 3-29Google Scholar). Other members of the collagen family have one or more non-triple helical domains, which may constitute the major part of the protein. Most of these collagens do not form prominent lateral aggregates in a manner similar to that of the fibril-forming collagens. Instead, they form complex aggregates together with other matrix macromolecules. Collagen VI is one example, forming multimolecular filamentous beaded structures after secretion from the cell (for review, see Ref. 3Timpl R. Chu M.L. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 208-242Google Scholar). This collagen is composed of three different peptide chains (α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI)), which form the basic unit consisting of a relatively short triple helical domain flanked by two large multidomain globular regions (4Chu M.L.

These are composed primarily of repeating units of von Willebrand type A domains (5Chu M.L. Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.J. Glanville R. Mayer U. Mann K. Deutzmann R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Collagen VI assembles intracellularly into antiparallel, overlapping dimers that then align and form tetramers (6Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These structures are stabilized by disulfide bonds. Secreted tetramers assemble extracellularly in a characteristic end-to-end fashion into thin (3–10 nm) beaded filaments with a periodicity of about 100 nm (7Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R.

N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 460: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Collagen VI is ubiquitous. It can be found intermingled with fibril-forming collagens and is often enriched in the pericellular matrix (for review, see Refs. 3Timpl R. Chu M.L. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P.

This suggests an important role for collagen VI in tissue integrity. Collagen VI has been shown to interact with several different matrix constituents. It may have a role in the development of the matrix supramolecular structure as well as in tissue homeostasis by mediating interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix. More specifically, interactions of collagen VI with collagen XIV, collagen IV, the fibrillar collagens type I and II, decorin, microfibril-associated glycoprotein MAGP-1, and hyaluronan as well as the α1β1 and α2β1integrins and the cell surface proteoglycan NG2 have been demonstrated (13Brown J.C.

A family of extracellular matrix proteins with characteristic leucine-rich repeats has several members that show tight binding to collagens. They are present in collagen networks and modulate their functional properties. One extensively studied example is the small proteoglycan decorin. Biglycan and decorin represent two distinct but closely related members of a subgroup within the family of leucine-rich repeat proteins in the extracellular matrix. They contain 10 leucine-rich repeats of each some 25 amino acids. Decorin and biglycan are proteoglycans with one and two chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains, respectively (for review, see Refs. 23Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J.

Inactivation of the decorin gene leads to alterations of the collagen fibrillar network, primarily in skin (30Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Decorin is found primarily at a distance from cells, but biglycan is distributed mainly close to the cells and even pericellularly (31Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J.

Biglycan can be extracted from, e.g. cartilage and purified under denaturing conditions. Such preparations have been used in studies of functional properties indicating that biglycan can inhibit binding of decorin to collagen VI (16Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, native biglycan and decorin were shown to interact tightly via their core protein with the same binding site close to the N-terminal region of the collagen VI helical domain, possibly via the α2(VI). Native decorin was shown to bind to collagen VI with higher (10×) affinity than has been shown previously for the molecule isolated under denaturing conditions (16Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pepsinized collagen VI was prepared from human placenta (34Odermatt E. Risteli J. van Delden V. Timpl R. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue was homogenized in formic acid and incubated with pepsin for 24 h at room temperature. After a series of salt precipitations, the collagen VI was purified by gel filtration, dialyzed into dilute acetic acid, and freeze dried (34Odermatt E. Risteli J. van Delden V. Timpl R. Biochem.

Recombinant α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains and the N-terminal fragment N9–N2 of the α3(VI) chain were purified as described previously (21Tillet E. Wiedemann H. Golbik R. Pan T.C. Zhang R.Z. Mann K.

The N6–C5 fragment of the α3(VI) chain was produced by excising the NheI-BamHI fragment from the pCI-neo α3(VI) N9–C5 cDNA construct (12Lamandé S.R. Shields K.A. Kornberg A.J. Shield L.K.

The expression construct was transfected into 293-EBNA cells using FuGENETM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), and transfected cells were selected in growth medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin. The recombinant α3(VI) chain containing an N-terminal His tag, the first six N-terminal domains (N6–N1), the triple helical domain, and the complete C-terminal domain (C1–C5) was isolated from serum-free conditioned medium under native conditions by nickel affinity chromatography on a chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified further by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Collagen I was prepared by acid extraction from the fibrous proximal part of bovine flexor tendon (28Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem.

Recombinant human biglycan (37Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine decorin (38Day A.A. McQuillan C.I. Termine J.D. Young M.R. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were produced in human HeLa cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively (26Svensson L. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Medium was changed every 2nd day, and the collected medium was stored frozen at −20 °C until purification. For purification of proteoglycans, thawed medium (900–1,400 ml) was applied onto a 20-ml Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, equilibrated in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was washed with 4 volumes of equilibration buffer, and bound material was eluted with a gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in equilibration buffer. Fractions containing decorin/biglycan were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, and diluted with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. They were subsequently applied onto a 2-ml column of Blue Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove traces of bovine serum albumin. The flow-through was collected, concentrated in an ultrafiltration chamber (Amicon PM-10), checked for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and frozen in aliquots. Proteoglycans were prepared from confluent bovine fibroblast monolayer cultures (25Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were labeled for 20 h with either 20 μCi/ml [3H]leucine or 50 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate. The medium was passed through a 2-ml column of DE52 cellulose (Whatman), eluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mmNaCl, pH 7.4. Bound proteoglycans were eluted in 100 mmTris/HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by desalting on a 10 ml column of Sephadex G-50 (25Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant proteoglycans were purified as described above and radiolabeled using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, 10 μg of protein was added to 0.5 mCi of Na125I in a vial containing 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and one IODO-BEAD. The reaction was terminated after 15 min. Free isotope was removed by desalting on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Decorin from bovine articular cartilage was purified as described previously (39Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Heinegård D. Björne P.A. Cöster L. Franzén A. Gardell S. Malmström A. Paulsson M. Sandfalk R. Vogel K. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. Mark Hickery). The decorin was digested with 0.2 unit of crystalline papain (papaya latex, Sigma)/mg of proteoglycan in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm cysteine/HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 60 °C for 16 h. The digest was then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and applied onto a 1.7-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To block nonspecific binding of glycosaminoglycans to the DEAE column two different solutions, containing 6-sulfated chondroitin sulfate (see below) and bovine serum albumin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) at 1 mg/ml, had been chromatographed under similar conditions prior to the sample. Dermatan sulfate was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing glycosaminoglycans were identified by the dimethylmethylene blue assay (41Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), pooled, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. Chondroitin 6-sulfate was isolated from nucleus pulposus as described previously (42Antonopoulos C.A. Fransson L.Å. Heinegård D. Gardell S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 148: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hyaluronic acid (Healon) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Native radiolabeled proteoglycans were tested for binding to precipitated collagens. Samples were combined with collagen VI at 20 μg/ml and bovine serum albumin at 50 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS),1 and subsequently incubated for 18 h at 20 °C. Alternatively, samples were combined with acid-extracted collagen I at 100 μg/ml and bovine serum albumin at 500 μg/ml in 30 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (25Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by incubation for 18 h at 37 °C. Precipitated material was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at the respective temperatures. The pellets and the supernatants were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide 4–12% gradient gels (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of collagen in the samples were determined by scanning after staining with Coomassie Blue. The radiolabeled components were detected by fluorography with sodium salicylate (44Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). For quantification of the radiolabeled proteoglycans, fluorographs were scanned using a digital scanner and evaluated using the Gel-Pro AnalyzerTM software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). For inhibition experiments, native radiolabeled proteoglycans were combined with collagen VI as described above but in the presence of 4 μg of nonlabeled decorin or 5 μg of biglycan, respectively. The quotient of decorin and biglycan found in the precipitate was calculated after quantification as described above. To remove glycosaminoglycan chains from recombinant proteoglycans, digestion with chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) (1.0 milliunit/μg of proteoglycan) at a final proteoglycan concentration of 16–48 μg/ml in TBS was performed. The progress of the digestion was monitored at 232 nm, showing formation of unsaturated disaccharides. Samples were taken to further analysis immediately after complete digestion, typically after 0.5–2 h at 37 °C to minimize the risk of core protein self-aggregation after removal of glycosaminoglycan chains. 5 μg/ml collagen VI in TBS was adsorbed overnight onto microtiter plates (Maxisorb plates, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). This and all of the following steps were done at room temperature. To avoid nonspecific interactions, wells were blocked for 1 h with 0.03 mg/ml κ-casein (Sigma) in TBS. Coated wells were incubated overnight with recombinant biglycan at different concentrations (0–1.2 μg/ml) in TBS containing 0.03 mg/ml κ-casein and 0.05% Tween. In control experiments, only κ-casein was coated onto the plate, or the incubation step with biglycan was omitted. The amount of bound biglycan was determined by incubation with affinity-purified, polyclonal anti-biglycan antibodies. Bound IgG was detected with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Enzyme activity was measured with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate at 405 nm. To check the specificity of the interaction, biglycan was preincubated in inhibition experiments with collagen VI at different concentrations before being added to wells coated with the collagen. Purified dermatan sulfate chains were tested for their ability to inhibit the interaction of biglycan with collagen VI. Wells coated with the collagen were preincubated with 0–200 μg/ml dermatan sulfate for 3 h before the proteoglycan was added as described above. For studies of interactions of recombinant proteoglycans, collagen VI, or recombinant fragments (α1(VI), α2(VI) and fragments N9–N2 and N6–C5 from α3(VI)) were adsorbed to breakable Combiplates (Labsystems, Lund, Sweden) as described above. After blocking with κ-casein, radiolabeled proteoglycans or core proteins (100,000 cpm) were incubated overnight, and individual wells containing bound radiolabeled protein were then analyzed in an LKB γ-counter. Between steps, wells were rinsed three times with 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Collagen VI (100–200 μg/ml in 10 mmsodium citrate, pH 3.2) was immobilized on sensorchips Pioneer B1 or CM-5 (the latter having a carboxylated dextran matrix with a degree of carboxylation approximately two times that of Pioneer B1) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with a 1:1 mixture of EDAC and N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma). Remaining active groups on the matrix were blocked with 1m ethanolamine hydrochloride (BDH, Poole, U. K.) at pH 8.5. The running buffer during these immobilization steps was 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (BIAcore AB). For kinetic studies of core protein binding, recombinant proteoglycans were taken immediately after digestion with chondroitinase ABC (described above), diluted with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20 to final concentrations of 10–400 nm, and injected over the collagen surfaces at 40–50 μl/min. The sample buffer, which was the same when intact proteoglycans were studied, was also used as running buffer. Each kinetic evaluation represents three to seven different protein concentrations tested. Colloidal gold particles of 5 nm ± 15% were prepared by reduction of HAuCl4 with thiocyanate (45Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Colloidal gold was titrated and conjugated (46Baschong W. Wrigley N.G. J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1990; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to purified recombinant biglycan or decorin (intact or chondroitinase ABC-digested) or recombinant collagen VI fragments. Briefly, proteins were conjugated to colloidal gold for 30 min at room temperature and then mixed with polyethylene glycol 20000 (molecular weight 20,000) to a final concentration of 0.025% polyethylene glycol. Gold-labeled or nonlabeled proteoglycans (biglycan at 1.2 μg/ml, decorin at 0.8 μg/ml, i.e. concentrations ∼10 nm) were incubated in vitro for 1 min on ice with collagen VI at 10 μg/ml (20 nm) in TBS and instantly adsorbed onto a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid that was rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Alternatively, the same amounts of proteoglycans were incubated with recombinant collagen VI fragments. The grid was immediately blotted, washed with two drops of water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate for 15 s. Samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage and 75,000 × magnification. Evaluation of the data from electron micrographs was done as described previously (47Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Purified, native [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans were tested for binding to precipitating collagen VI. An assay for pepsin-extracted collagen VI was developed in which 50–70% of collagen VI was precipitated. Under these experimental conditions, 16% of the total biglycan was recovered bound to collagen VI, whereas the proportion of decorin bound was 18% (Fig.1, a and c). The binding of radiolabeled proteoglycans was competed for when nonlabeled, purified proteoglycans were added (Fig. 1 a). The addition of either decorin (panel II) or biglycan (panel III) resulted in a markedly decreased binding of radiolabeled proteoglycans of both types (Fig. 1, a and c). In a corresponding assay with collagen I, more than 95% of the decorin was coprecipitated with the collagen fibrils. Biglycan was almost totally recovered in the supernatant, and less than 5% was found precipitated with the collagen (Fig. 1 b). The capacity of biglycan, decorin, and glycosaminoglycans to inhibit binding of proteoglycans in the precipitation assay was examined further. Almost complete inhibition of decorin binding was achieved when the molar concentration of nonlabeled proteoglycan exceeded that of collagen VI (Fig. 2), indicating that the proteoglycan binding site(s) on collagen VI are saturable and limited in number. Isolated biglycan was equal or even slightly more efficient in inhibiting decorin binding to collagen VI than decorin (Fig. 2). The amounts of collagen VI in the precipitates were not different in the presence or absence of proteoglycans or glycosaminoglycans, as revealed by Coomassie staining of the gels prior to fluorography (not shown). In conclusion, the inhibition experiments show that the native biglycan and decorin interact close to or at the same defined site(s) on collagen VI. The isolated biglycan core protein, prepared by treatment of the intact proteoglycan with chondroitinase ABC, competed for collagen VI binding to the same extent as the intact proteoglycan (Fig. 2). Neither free chondroitin sulfate nor hyaluronic acid inhibited the binding of radiolabeled decorin (Fig. 2). Incubation of pepsin-extracted collagen VI-coated wells with biglycan at different concentrations showed saturation of binding sites at 8–10 nm biglycan (Fig.3). Scatchard plot analysis of the data gave a K D of 1.1 nm (not shown). Preincubation of collagen VI-coated wells with excess purified dermatan sulfate chains did not alter the binding of biglycan. The interaction of biglycan with the surface coat of collagen VI was inhibited by preincubation of the biglycan with collagen VI in solution (not shown). Incubation of coated collagen VI fragments with radiolabeled biglycan only showed binding to α2(VI) but significantly lower compared with pepsin-extracted, triple helical collagen VI. No binding was observed to α1(VI) nor to the fragments N9–N2 and N6–C5 of the α3(VI) chain (Fig. 4).Figure 4Binding of radiolabeled, recombinant biglycan to collagen VI and recombinant collagen VI fragments in solid phase assay and in solution. Pepsin-extracted collagen VI, α1(VI), α2(VI), N9–N2 and N6–C5 fragment of α3(VI), or κ-casein (control) was adsorbed onto breakable microtiter strips followed by incubation with radiolabeled recombinant biglycan. Biglycan showed binding to α2(VI), but it was significantly lower compared with collagen VI. In solution, as visualized by ele"

Subsequent internalization of agonist-occupied receptors occurs as a result of the binding of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor followed by interaction with the AP2 adaptor and clathrin proteins. Receptor internalization is known to require D-3 phosphoinositides that are generated by the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases form a family of lipid kinases that couple signals via receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors. The molecular mechanism by which phosphoinositide 3-kinase acts to promote β-adrenergic receptor internalization is not well understood. In the present investigation we demonstrate a novel finding that β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase form a cytosolic complex, which leads to β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1-mediated translocation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase to the membrane in an agonist-dependent manner. Furthermore, agonist-induced translocation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase results in rapid interaction with the receptor, which is of functional importance, since inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity attenuates β-adrenergic receptor sequestration. Therefore, agonist-dependent recruitment of phosphoinositide 3-kinase to the membrane is an important step in the process of receptor sequestration and links phosphoinositide 3-kinase to G-protein-coupled receptor activation and sequestration.

Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The class I PI3Ks are heterodimeric enzymes consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits that are divided into the subgroups IA and IB. The class IA PI3K (consisting of p110 α, β, and δ catalytic subunits) associates with the p85 regulatory subunit and is essential for coupling signals through receptor tyrosine kinases (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The class IB PI3K (p110γ catalytic subunit) associates with the p101 adaptor subunit and is activated by βγ subunits of G-proteins (2Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F.

Stimulation of a variety of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) through Gβγ-mediated activation of PI3Kγ leads to an increase in the level of 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), which in turn mediates diverse cellular effects including cell proliferation, cell survival, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and endocytosis (3Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The exposure of a GPCR to agonist produces rapid attenuation of its signaling ability that involves uncoupling of the receptor from its cognate heterotrimeric G-protein. The cellular mechanism mediating agonist-specific or homologous desensitization is a two-step process in which agonist-occupied receptors are phosphorylated by a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase and then bind arrestin proteins (4Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Homologous desensitization of agonist-occupied β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) occurs after translocation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2; β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1)) to the plasma membrane. βARK1 association with the plasma membrane is facilitated by binding to liberated Gβγ subunits and the interaction of its pleckstrin homology domain to the membrane phospholipids (5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). After βARK1-mediated βAR phosphorylation, the phosphorylated receptor becomes desensitized by binding β-arrestin (4Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

In addition to functioning as docking proteins linking GPCRs to components of the endocytic machinery, β-arrestins also bind other intracellular regulatory proteins such as c-Src (8Luttrell L.M.

Mouse NIH-3T3 and HEK 293 cells were maintained in either Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium or minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1:100 penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 units/ml) at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of ∼1–3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and, at 70–80% confluence, were transiently transfected using the transfection reagent FUGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, re-plated in triplicate, allowed to grow overnight, and serum-starved for 2–4 h before agonist stimulation. The cDNA encoding bovine βARK1 and the carboxyl terminus of βARK1 (βARKct) was described previously (15Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Genomic DNA isolated from mouse tail was used for amplification of β1AR gene by polymerase chain reaction with Pfu Taq polymerase (Stratagene) using the 5′ primer (5′-AATTCgCCgCCATGgACTACAAggACgACgATgATAAgggCgCgggggCgCTCgCCCTg-3′) containing an EcoRI site for subcloning followed by Kozak consensus sequence and a FLAG tag and 3′ primer (5′-AAGCTTCTACTTGGACTCCGAGGA-3′) containing a consensus stop codon with a HindIII site for subcloning. Pfu Taqpolymerase-amplified PCR product was subcloned in zero-blunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and was cut withEcoRI/HindIII and subcloned into pRK5 mammalian expression vector. The cloned β1AR in pRK5 was then sequenced to check for its authenticity. FLAG-tagged β2AR was a generous gift from Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz. HA-tagged pCMV-PI3Kp110γ wild type (PI3Kγ), HA-tagged pCMV-PI3Kp110γ mutant (ΔPI3Kγ) (Δ942–981, deletion in ATP binding site) were generous gifts from Dr. Charles S. Abrams (17Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-PI3Kα was a generous gift from Dr. Michael J. Waterfield. Cell monolayers were scraped in 1 ml of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin and disrupted further by using Dounce homogenizer. Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The collected supernatant was further subject to a centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 25 min. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) and used as membrane fraction, and the supernatant was diluted in lysis buffer and used as the cytosolic fraction. Heart samples also underwent similar procedures to obtain membrane and cytosolic fractions. Purity of the membrane fraction preparation was confirmed by measuring enzyme activity of the membrane marker enzyme K+-stimulatedp-nitrophenylphosphatase (18Bers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 555: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (membrane fraction: 9.4 μmol/mg of protein/min, cytosol: 2.6 μmol/mg of protein/min). PI3K assays were carried out as previously described (19Naga Prasad S.V. Esposito G. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and cytosolic extract was used for immunoprecipitation with either the C5/1 monoclonal antibody directed against βARK1 (20Choi D.J. Koch W.J. Hunter J.J.

Beads were washed and assayed for PI3K activity. The organic phase was spotted on TLC plates and resolved by chromatography. No associated background PI3K activity was found with beads used for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). TLC plates were subjected to autoradiography, and PIP was quantified by phosphorimaging. PtdIns(4)P (Sigma) was used as a standard. Lipids were prepared as previously described (19Naga Prasad S.V. Esposito G. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol.

Immunoblotting and detection of PI3K, βARK1, HA-PI3Kγ, HA-ΔPI3Kγ, and Myc-PI3Kα were carried out as previously described (19Naga Prasad S.V. Esposito G. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitating antibodies were added to 500 μg of cell lysate in lysis buffer followed by the addition of 35 μl of 1:1 protein A- or G-agarose. Samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1× SDS gel loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were incubated with antibodies recognizing PI3K, Myc (Santa-Cruz), and HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:2000 dilution and the βARK1 monoclonal antibody at 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were subsequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence. β2AR sequestration was performed as previously described (7Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/dish and transfected the following day with plasmids containing either the β2AR (150–250 ng), PI3Kγ (4.0 μg), or ΔPI3Kγ (4.0 μg) cDNAs. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were split into six-well Falcon plates at a density of 750,000 cells/well. The following day the media was replaced with minimal essential medium containing 1 μm isoproterenol and 100 μm ascorbate for 0 to 30 min. In separate experiments, cells transfected with β2AR were treated with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (100 μm) for 15 min before isoproterenol stimulation. To determine the amount of internalized receptor, 100-μl aliquots of whole cells were added to 150 μl of binding buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)). Total binding was determined in the presence of 175 pm125I-CYP alone, the number of internalized receptors was determined by using 175 pm125I-CYP plus 100 nm CGP12177, and nonspecific binding was determined using 175 pm125I-CYP plus 1 μmpropranolol (7Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Sequestration was calculated as the ratio of (specific receptor binding of 125I-CYP in the presence of CGP12177)/(specific receptor binding of 125I-CYP in the absence of CGP12177). Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described (21Barak L.S. Warabi K. Feng X. Caron M.G. Kwatra M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7565-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids containing the β2AR (2 μg) and β-arrestin-GFP (2 μg) or the β2AR and β-arrestin-GFP along with either PI3Kγ (2.5 μg) or ΔPI3Kγ (2.5 μg). Cells were split into 35-mm dishes with glass bottoms for observation using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. The cells were treated with isoproterenol (1 μm) for the indicated times (0 to 5 min), and the fluorescence images were exported as Tiff files by the LSM software to Adobe Photoshop. β2AR phosphorylation was performed in intact cells as previously described (7Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with plasmids containing the FLAG β2AR (2 μg) and vector DNA (2.5 μg), the FLAG β2AR (2 μg) and PI3Kγ (2.5 μg), or the β2AR (2 μg) and ΔPI3Kγ (2.5 μg). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed and metabolically labeled for 1 h with medium containing 100 μCi of32P/ml. After stimulation with 10 μmisoproterenol for 5 min, incubations were terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/well, and then cells were solubilized with the addition of 0.75 ml/well of radioimmune precipitation buffer. After centrifugation at 38000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were processed for immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-β2AR as described above. Phosphorylated receptors were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. Four-month-old adult C57BL/6 wild type mice of either sex were used for this study. Microsurgical procedures and hemodynamic evaluation of pressure overload hypertrophy induced through transverse aortic constriction (T) was performed as previously described (19Naga Prasad S.V.

After 7 days of aortic constriction, mice were anesthetized, and both carotid arteries were cannulated to measure the trans-stenotic pressure gradient (22Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Hearts were then rapidly excised, and individual chambers were separated, weighed, and frozen in liquid N2for later biochemical analysis. In separate experiments, adult wild type mice underwent intravenous infusion of 10 μmisoproterenol for 3 min at 50 μl/min. Hearts were removed and flash-frozen in liquid N2 for later biochemical analysis. The animals in this study were handled according to approved protocols by the animal welfare regulations of Duke University Medical Center. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons was performed using an unpaired Student'st test. Results for the β2AR sequestration by CYP binding was analyzed using Graphpad Prism. Since both βARK1 and PI3Kγ are activated by βγ subunits of G-proteins, we explored whether they interact to form a complex in the cytosol. We used a mouse NIH-3T3 cell line since it has a relatively low level of endogenous PI3K activity compared with other cell lines (data not shown). Cells were transfected with βARK1 and HA-PI3Kγ cDNAs, and βARK1 was immunoprecipitated from extracts using a monoclonal antibody directed against the βARK1 catalytic domain (20Choi D.J. Koch W.J. Hunter J.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17223-17229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, PI3K activity and protein were found associated with βARK1. The association was independent of PI3K activity since co-transfection with a catalytically inactive PI3K mutant (HA-ΔPI3Kγ, deletion in the ATP binding site) did not prevent the association of the PI3K mutant with βARK1 (Fig.1 C). Furthermore, the association of PI3K with βARK1 occurred with either PI3K isoform (Fig. 1 D), and the associated PI3K activity was wortmannin-sensitive (Fig. 1 E). Lysates from cell extracts before immunoprecipitation were immunoblotted for βARK1, PI3Kγ, and ΔPI3K to determine levels of expression. Since βARK1 associates with PI3K, we tested whether βARK1 could also promote translocation of PI3K to the cell membrane in response to agonist stimulation. Experiments were performed in NIH-3T3 cells co-transfected with βARK1 and PI3Kγ cDNAs, and the endogenous βAR receptors were stimulated with 10 μmisoproterenol for 2 min. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared and analyzed for βARK1-associated PI3K activity. Little change in the βARK1-associated PI3K activity was noted in the cytosolic fraction after isoproterenol stimulation (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the membrane fraction showed a significant increase in the βARK1-associated PI3K activity (Fig. 2, A and D) at 2 min after agonist stimulation. The βARK1-mediated recruitment of PI3Kγ to the membrane was analyzed by immunoprecipitating βARK1 from both fractions and blotting for HA-PI3K. As shown in Fig. 2 B, treatment with isoproterenol resulted in a greater level of βARK1-associated PI3Kγ protein in the membrane. Taken together these data show that βARK1 and PI3Kγ interact to form a complex in the cytosol, and βARK1 recruits PI3Kγ to the membrane in an agonist-dependent manner. The agonist-dependent translocation of βARK1 to the membrane requires the presence of Gβγ subunits (5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). We tested whether Gβγ subunits were required for the translocation of the βARK1·PI3Kγ complex to the membrane by overexpressing the carboxyl-terminal portion of βARK1, the βARKct, which is known to inhibit the ability of βARK1 to bind Gβγ (15Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the βARK1 and PI3Kγ plasmids along with or without the βARKct cDNA. Robust PI3K activity was found associated with immunoprecipitated βARK1 in the absence of βARKct (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the agonist-dependent translocation of βARK1-associated PI3K activity was abolished in the presence of the βARKct (Fig. 2, C and D). These data suggest that the sequestration of Gβγ by βARKct can interrupt the process of βARK1-mediated translocation of PI3Kγ to the membrane (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, in the presence of βARKct, there was also loss of βARK1-associated PI3K activity in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2, C and D). Since the βARKct contains the same PH domain as βARK1, it appears that βARKct competitively inhibits the βARK1/PI3K interaction. We tested this using cells expressing βARK1, βARKct, and either PI3Kγ or PI3Kα followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against either HA-PI3Kγ or Myc-PI3Kα. As shown in Fig.2 E, both βARK1 and βARKct were found to interact with either of the PI3K isoforms. To exclude the possibility that overexpression of the βARKct altered the level of expression of either βARK1 or PI3Kγ, lysates prepared from the co-transfected cells were immunoblotted for βARK1, βARKct, and PI3Kγ. No significant difference in the level of expression levels for either βARK1 or PI3Kγ was seen in presence of the βARKct (data not shown). The ability of βARK1 to translocate PI3K to the cell membrane suggests a mechanism for co-localization of PI3K with βARs. To test this, we used HEK 293 cells transfected with either FLAG epitope-tagged β1AR or β2AR plasmids and monitored the association of PI3K to the receptor after agonist stimulation. HEK 293 cells are known to contain adequate levels of βARK1 to support agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation (8Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were split into separate dishes and stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol from 0 to 10 min. The FLAG epitope was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and PI3K activity was measured. As shown in Fig.3, A–D, FLAG β1AR- and FLAG β2AR-associated PI3K activity was observed by 2 min after agonist stimulation, with gradual decline by 10 min. Moreover, the PI3K activity associated with the FLAG β1AR and β2AR was wortmannin-sensitive (Fig. 3 E). In addition, we could also detect the agonist-dependent association of endogenous PI3Kγ protein with the transfected FLAG β2AR at 2–10 min after isoproterenol treatment (data not shown). Because β2AR endocytosis is regulated by βARK1, and βARK1-mediated PI3K translocation provides a mechanism for the interaction of PI3K with receptor, we determined whether the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, could attenuate βAR internalization. Agonist-dependent sequestration was studied in HEK 293 cells transfected with the FLAG β2AR plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4 A, a significant attenuation in the rate of β2AR sequestration was observed in wortmannin-treated cells for up to 20–30 min. Similarly, a 50% reduction in sequestration was also observed with LY294002-treated cells (data not shown). To directly address whether PI3K is required for the process of βAR sequestration, a time course of agonist-dependent sequestration was studied in HEK 293 cells transfected either with the FLAG β2AR, FLAG β2AR and PI3Kγ, or FLAG β2AR and ΔPI3Kγ plasmids. Similar to the pattern of inhibition by wortmannin, ΔPI3Kγ-transfected cells showed a significant attenuation in the rate of receptor sequestration (Fig. 4 B). These data demonstrate a role for PI3K in the process of βAR internalization possibly due to the local production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Alteration of receptor endocytosis with overexpression of the ΔPI3Kγ mutant could result if ΔPI3Kγ inhibited either recruitment of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor or directly inhibited receptor phosphorylation. To exclude these possibilities, cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing FLAG β2AR, β-arrestin 2-GFP, and either PI3Kγ or ΔPI3Kγ cDNAs and were monitored for the recruitment of β-arrestin 2-GFP using confocal microscopy. In cells transfected with ΔPI3Kγ, there was prompt recruitment of β-arrestin 2-GFP to the receptor after exposure to agonist (Fig. 4 C). To directly test the effect of ΔPI3Kγ expression on receptor phosphorylation,32Pi metabolic labeling was performed in HEK 293 cells transfected with plasmids containing FLAG β2AR and either the PI3Kγ or ΔPI3Kγ cDNAs. As shown in Fig.4 D, the level of agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation was not affected by the expression of ΔPI3Kγ. Thus, the effect of overexpression of ΔPI3Kγ on β2AR sequestration is not related to processes that are involved with β2AR phosphorylation or β-arrestin 2 recruitment. Since normal βAR function is critical for maintenance of cardiac function, particularly during periods of increased workload (23Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 237-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether PI3K and βARK1 interact in an organ of in vivo relevance such as the heart. The monoclonal βARK1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate βARK1 from myocardial extracts prepared from normal mouse hearts. The immunoprecipitate was tested for the presence of associated PI3K protein by immunoblotting. As a positive control, the PI3K polyclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate total PI3K from separate extracts prepared from the same heart. As shown in Fig. 5 A, PI3K was co-immunoprecipitated along with βARK1 from the myocardial extract. To determine whether the association of βARK1 with PI3K in the heart would also result in the βARK1-mediated translocation of PI3K to the membrane, anesthetized mice were stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μm) by infusion through a cannulated jugular vein for 3 min. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from the treated hearts, and PI3K activity was measured after immunoprecipitation with the βARK1 monoclonal antibody. As show in Fig. 5 B, a significant increase in βARK1-associated PI3K activity was found in the membrane fraction after isoproterenol treatment (fold induction over untreated, 5.60 ± 1.10, p < 0.05,n = 3). No difference in βARK1-associated PI3K activity was found in the cytosolic fraction after isoproterenol treatment (fold induction over untreated, 1.19 ± 0.47,n = 3). We previously documented an induction of both βARK1 and PI3Kγ in the pressure overloaded heart (19Naga Prasad S.V. Esposito G. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Choi D.J. Koch W.J. Hunter J.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17223-17229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and, therefore, tested whether the interaction of βARK1 with PI3K would also be enhanced in the hypertrophied heart. As shown in Fig. 5,C and D, greater wortmannin-sensitive PI3K activity and protein were found complexed with βARK1 in hypertrophied hearts compared with sham-treated hearts. There is increasing evidence for a requirement of D-3 phosphoinositides in the process of membrane trafficking and receptor internalization (9Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 10Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol.

Since, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is the main product catalyzed by the lipid kinase activity of P13K (3Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), we investigated whether there is a mechanism that links the agonist-dependent recruitment of PI3K to GPCR endocytosis. The data presented here provide evidence for an interaction between βARK1 and PI3K in the cytosol. Then, in response to agonist, PI3K undergoes βARK1-mediated translocation to the membrane. Furthermore, the βARK1-dependent translocation of PI3K allows for colocalization of PI3K with the receptor, which is of functional importance since catalytically inactive PI3K or inhibitors of PI3K activity attenuate βAR sequestration. These studies thus demonstrate that the agonist-dependent recruitment of PI3K to the membrane is an important step in the process of receptor sequestration and links class I PI3Ks to GPCR signaling and endocytosis. Recent structural studies of PI3Kγ show that it contains many modular regions including a helical domain (also called a HEAT sequence motif) (14Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) that could be involved in protein-protein interactions (24Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 25Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 1999; 96: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Since the HEAT sequence is common to PI3Kα, -β, and -γ isoforms, it is possible that this is the common interacting domain for all PI3Ks. Indeed, in this study we show that βARK1 can interact with both PI3Kγ and -α isoforms but cannot rule out the possibility of βARK1 interacting with PI3Kβ, since it was not tested. In this regard there is increasing interest in the role of the PI3Kβ isoform in cell signaling as shown by a recent study demonstrating activation of downstream signal molecules like v-Akt (protein kinase B) and protein kinase Cε by PI3Kβ after GPCR stimulation (26Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, the HEAT domain of PI3K could provide the necessary structure for the interaction of PI3Ks with βARK1. Depending on the cellular signaling pathway that is activated (i.e. growth factor stimulation versus GPCR stimulation), the PI3K isoform that interacts with βARK1 might change. Our data are consistent with a mechanism that allows βARK1 to mediate agonist-dependent translocation of PI3Kγ to the membrane. Several studies have shown activation of PI3Kγ in the presence of Gβγ but have not documented PI3Kγ recruitment to the membrane after agonist stimulation. Our data suggest that a PI3K molecule interacting with βARK1 is recruited to the plasma membrane by βARK1, and this recruitment is Gβγ-dependent, since expression of the βARKct (a Gβγ-sequestering peptide) interrupted the βARK1-mediated translocation of PI3K to the membrane. It is interesting that there was a loss of βARK1-associated PI3K activity in cytosolic fractions with overexpression of βARKct despite the equal expression of βARK1 or PI3Kγ. These data indicate that the βARKct can compete with βARK1 for interaction with PI3Kγ and further points to the carboxyl-terminal PH domain of βARK1 as the interacting domain, since it is common within both βARKct and βARK1. This conclusion is also supported by our data showing that both the βARKct and βARK1 can be co-immunoprecipitated along with either of the PI3K isoforms. Based on these experiments, it appears that overexpression of the βARKct acts to inhibit the recruitment of βARK1 to the membrane by sequestering Gβγ subunits (16Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and may also directly interrupt the βARK1/PI3Kγ interaction. A previous study shows that the PI3K yeast homologue,Vps34p, plays an important role in endocytosis (27Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study shows that treatment with wortmannin blocks agonist-induced β2AR endocytosis (28Sorensen S.D. Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 603-610PubMed Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that in transfected HEK 293 cells, the presence of agonist promotes the association of wortmannin-sensitive PI3Kγ activity with both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. Moreover, treatment with PI3K inhibitors or overexpression of catalytically inactive PI3K attenuates β2AR sequestration. Previous studies show that both the clathrin adaptor molecule AP2 (11Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and β-arrestins (10Gaidarov I. Krupnick J.G. Falck J.R. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with high affinity and PtdIns (4,5)P2 at a 1000-fold lower affinity. Therefore, in our experiments with overexpression of ΔPI3K, generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 would be inhibited, resulting in an increase in the concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P2, which would be much less efficient in promoting receptor endocytosis. Studies in macrophages have shown inhibition of phagocytosis in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, and this inhibition prevented recruitment of dynamin to endocytic vesicles (29Gold E.S. Underhill D.M. Morrissette N.S. Guo J. McNiven M.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that generation of phosphoinositides by PI3K within the receptor complex may regulate internalization of β2ARs through recruitment of dynamin (30Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Importantly, whereas phosphoinositides have been implicated in receptor internalization after platelet-derived growth factor (31Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and insulin receptor (9Corvera S. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) stimulation, we provide evidence here for the involvement of phosphoinositides after βAR stimulation. Taken together these data demonstrate an important role of PI3Kγ in the process of βAR internalization, possibly due to the local production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Although the observed attenuation of βAR sequestration by ΔPI3K suggests a critical role for generation of phosphoinositides in βAR sequestration, it is also possible that ΔPI3K interrupts either β-arrestin recruitment to the phosphorylated receptor or directly inhibits βARK1-mediated βAR phosphorylation by sequestering Gβγ. To exclude these possibilities we showed that overexpression of ΔPI3K inhibits neither the β-arrestin 2-GFP recruitment to the receptor nor βARK1-mediated β2AR phosphorylation. These data suggest that inhibition of βAR internalization is not linked to events that are involved with phosphorylation and desensitization of the receptor. To determine the association of PI3K with βARK1 in a tissue ofin vivo relevance, we studied the heart under several conditions. In the unstimulated heart, βARK1 and PI3K form a complex in myocardial extracts. Importantly, after isoproterenol stimulation there was increased βARK1-associated PI3K activity in myocardial membranes corroborating the cell culture studies. We have shown in earlier experiments an increase in both βARK1 and PI3Kγ activity in the pathophysiological state of in vivo pressure overload hypertrophy (19Naga Prasad S.V. Esposito G. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Choi D.J. Koch W.J. Hunter J.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17223-17229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Our present results show that in the hypertrophied heart there is an increase in βARK1-associated PI3K activity and protein that may be important for the regulation of adrenergic receptors during this pathologic state. For instance, under conditions of in vivo pressure overload hypertrophy, there would be a higher level of βARK1-mediated PI3K recruitment to the membrane. This would lead to both diminished receptor number (due to more efficient receptor sequestration) and impaired receptor function (enhanced phosphorylation from increased βARK1 activity). Consistent with this hypothesis are the characteristic findings of diminished βAR number and reduced βAR coupling to G-proteins in failing human hearts and in experimental models of heart failure (23Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 237-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that in pathophysiological states such as hypertrophy and heart failure, alterations in PI3K activation and recruitment may contribute to abnormalities in βAR function. A recent study using rat cardiomyocytes links the v-Akt (protein kinase B)-glycogen synthase kinase 3β pathway to activation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) transcription (26Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which is widely considered a marker for cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Furthermore, studies using adenoviral-mediated expression system in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes show that activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, is mediated by a PI3K pathway (33Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with our earlier findings of activation of PI3K in hearts with pressure overload hypertrophy (19Naga Prasad S.V. Esposito G. Mao L. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and, combined with our present study, support our view for an important role of phosphoinositides and PI3K in cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Based on our study we propose the idea that agonist-stimulated recruitment of PI3K is linked to βAR internalization. PI3K that colocalizes with the receptor may serve to increase the local membrane concentration of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, thus enhancing the functional interaction of determinants of the endocytic process such as β-arrestin, AP-2, clathrin, and dynamin. Whether the process leads to a more efficient recruitment of GPCRs to preformed clathrin-coated pits or the newly formed pits are interesting possibilities to explore further."
https://openalex.org/W2047701578,"The mechanism for coupling between Ca2+ stores and store-operated channels (SOCs) is an important but unresolved question. Although SOCs have not been molecularly identified, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels share a number of operational parameters with SOCs. The question of whether activation of SOCs and TRP channels is mediated by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) was examined using the permeant InsP3R antagonist, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) in both mammalian and invertebrate systems. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with human TRPC3 channels, the actions of 2-APB to block carbachol-induced InsP3R-mediated store release and carbachol-induced Sr2+ entry through TRPC3 channels were both reversed at high agonist levels, suggesting InsP3Rs mediate TRPC3 activation. However, electroretinogram recordings of the light-induced current in Drosophila revealed that the TRP channel-mediated responses in wild-type as well as trp andtrpl mutant flies were all inhibited by 2-APB. This action of 2-APB is likely InsP3R-independent since InsP3Rs are dispensable for the light response. We used triple InsP3R knockout DT40 chicken B-cells to further assess the role of InsP3Rs in SOC activation.45Ca2+ flux analysis revealed that although DT40 wild-type cells retained normal InsP3Rs mediating 2-APB-sensitive Ca2+ release, the DT40InsP3R-k/o cells were devoid of functional InsP3Rs. Using intact cells, all parameters of Ca2+ store function and SOC activation were identical in DT40wt and DT40InsP3R-k/o cells. Moreover, in both cell lines SOC activation was completely blocked by 2-APB, and the kinetics of action of 2-APB on SOCs (time dependence and IC50) were identical. The results indicate that (a) the action of 2-APB on Ca2+ entry is not mediated by the InsP3R and (b) the effects of 2-APB provide evidence for an important similarity in the function of invertebrate TRP channels, mammalian TRP channels, and mammalian store-operated channels.

Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). The cytosolic Ca2+ signals generated in response to receptors are complex, involving two closely coupled components: rapid, transient release of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1followed by slowly developing extracellular Ca2+ entry (1Berridge M.J.

G protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors, through activation of phospholipase C, generate the second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), that diffuses rapidly within the cytosol to interact with InsP3 receptors on the ER, which serve as Ca2+ channels to release luminal-stored Ca2+ and generate the initial Ca2+ signal phase (1Berridge M.J.

The resulting depletion of Ca2+ stored within the ER lumen serves as the primary trigger for a message that is returned to the plasma membrane, resulting in the slow activation of store-operated channels (SOCs), which mediate the process known as capacitative Ca2+ entry (3Putney J.W.

This second Ca2+ entry phase of Ca2+ signals serves to mediate longer term cytosolic Ca2+ elevations and provides a means to replenish intracellular stores (3Putney J.W. Bird G.S.

Whereas receptor-induced generation of InsP3 and the function of Ca2+ release channels to mediate the initial Ca2+ signaling phase is well understood, the mechanism for coupling ER Ca2+ store depletion with Ca2+entry remains a crucial but unresolved question (5Parekh A.B.

This activation appears to reflect a specific molecular interaction between the two channel proteins (20Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K.

Given the uncertainty with respect to the function and coupling of store-operated Ca2+ entry, the current report focuses on two central questions: first, whether InsP3 receptors are involved in the operation of SOCs and TRP channels; and second, whether members of the TRP family of channels are operationally related to SOCs. The studies provide further assessment of the involvement of the InsP3 receptor in coupling to entry channels by comparing vertebrate and invertebrate TRP channel function with store-operated channels functioning in mammalian cells in which all three of the InsP3 receptor subtypes have been genetically deleted. The results indicate that although InsP3Rs do not mediate the action of 2-APB on Ca2+ entry, the effects of 2-APB provide evidence for an important similarity in the function of invertebrate TRP channels, mammalian TRP channels, and mammalian store-operated channels.

Cells were washed, and dye was allowed to de-esterify for a minimum of 15 min at 20 °C. Approximately 95% of the dye was confined to the cytoplasm as determined by the signal remaining after saponin permeabilization (39Short A.D. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored with excitation at 340 and 380 nm; Ca2+measurements are shown as 340/380-nm ratios obtained from groups of 10–12 cells. Details of these Ca2+ measurements were described previously for the T3–65 clone of HEK293 cells (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

Resting Ca2+ levels in the two DT40 cell lines were similar, ∼100–130 nm, and in T3–65 HEK293 cells, resting Ca2+ was 50–100 nm. All measurements shown are representative of a minimum of three and, in most cases, a larger number of independent experiments. The procedures for cell permeabilization were as described earlier (41Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Rys-Sikora K.E. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, suspensions of DT40 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were gently stirred and incubated with 0.0025% saponin in an intracellular-like medium (140 mm KCl, 10 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.0) at 37 °C until 95% permeabilization occurred (normally after 6–7 min). After permeabilization, cells were washed twice in saponin-free intracellular-like medium at 4 °C and kept cold before use in experiments. To avoid problems of lipid dilution of added hydrophobic compounds, the final cell concentration in all experiments was kept at exactly 5 × 105 cells/ml. Ca2+ flux measurements were conducted as previously described (42Rys-Sikora K.E. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

The accumulation of45Ca2+ into intracellular organelles was measured using permeabilized DT40 cells (5 × 105cells/ml) maintained with gentle stirring at 37 °C in intracellular-like medium containing 50 μmCaCl2 (with 150 Ci/mol 45Ca2+), buffered to 0.1 μm free Ca2+ with EGTA, 3% polyethylene glycol, and 5 μm ruthenium red (to prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation) in a total volume of 2 ml. Effectors mentioned in the figures (InsP3, adenophostin-A, and 2-APB) were added at the times shown. Oxalate with GTP when present were added immediately before the start of uptake. At the required times, 200-μl aliquots were removed from the stirred uptake medium, diluted immediately into 4 ml of ice-cold intracellular-like medium containing 1 mmLaCl3, then rapidly vacuum-filtered on glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B), washed, and counted. The figures show ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation with that component of Ca2+ retained by cells and filters in the absence of ATP subtracted (∼0.1% of total Ca2+). All experiments shown are typical of at least three and, in most cases, a larger number of separate experiments. Wild-type (Canton S), trp, and trpl mutant flies were immobilized on coverslips in bee's wax, and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed as previously described using orange (580 nm) light (45Li H.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To introduce 2-APB or the control solution into the retina of a live fly, a small hole was generated near the edge of the eye using a glass needle. The hole was covered immediately with Vaseline to prevent dehydration of the exposed tissue. 2-APB (100 mm in Me2SO) or Me2SO (negative control) was diluted 1:200 into Ringer's solution, and glass needles (tip diameter ∼8 μm) containing these solutions were inserted into the holes in the retina. The chemicals were driven into the eye by application of brief pressure using a 1-ml syringe connected to the needles. The injections caused an immediate change in the ERG amplitudes due to an alteration in electrical resistance. This initial change was also observed with vehicle only and therefore did not represent an effect of the 2-APB. InsP3and adenophostin-A were from Calbiochem. ATP, GTP, EGTA, carbachol, polyethylene glycol, saponin, ruthenium red, Hepes, and oxalate were purchased from Sigma. 2-APB used in intact cell studies was from Sigma. For the 45Ca2+ studies using permeabilized DT40 cells, we utilized 2-APB from Tocris (Ballwin, MO) since Sigma 2-APB induced significantly greater inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump-mediated Ca2+uptake. Thapsigargin was from LC Services, Woburn, MA. Fura-2/acetoxymethylester was from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. The DT40 cell line was from Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki, Kyoto, Japan. For Ca2+ flux experiments, free Ca2+ concentrations were controlled using EGTA, computing all complexes between EGTA, ATP, Ca2+, Mg2+, monovalent cations, and protons, as previously described (46Ghosh T.K. Mullaney J.M. Tarazi F.I. Gill D.L. Nature. 1989; 340: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mechanism of coupling between intracellular Ca2+stores and the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry channels has remained an elusive process.

Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), provided some new information on the possible role of the InsP3 receptor in capacitative Ca2+ entry (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). 2-APB blocks the activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry in response to store depletion with Ca2+ pump blockers or ionomycin (17Ma H.-T.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28562-28568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, 2-APB blocks receptor-induced activation of mammalian TRPC3 channels (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 21van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28562-28568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). TRPC3 channels can also be activated directly by application of diacylglycerol (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 36Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar); however, this direct stimulation of TRPC3 channels is not blocked by 2-APB, suggesting its action is not directly on the Ca2+ entry channels but, instead, on the coupling process, leading to channel activation in response to receptor stimulation (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Using the T3–65 clone of HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPC3 channels (48Hurst R.S. Zhu X. Boulay G. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the experiment shown in Fig. 1appeared to reinforce this conclusion. In these cells, TRPC3 channels can be distinguished from SOCs by their ability to mediate a substantial entry of Sr2+ in response to agonists of phospholipase C-coupled receptors (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Carbachol acting through endogenous muscarinic receptors was observed to be a particularly effective activator of TRPC3 channels. Compared with other phospholipase C-coupled receptors in the same cells, for example purinergic receptors (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), muscarinic receptor-induced InsP3 levels are sustained longer as a result of less efficient receptor desensitization (49Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). At a low dose (1 μm), carbachol induced a modest transient release of Ca2+ from internal stores in the absence Ca2+, and a substantial entry of Sr2+ upon the addition of the divalent cation, typical of the activation of TRPC3 channels in these cells. In the presence of 75 μm 2-APB, both the release and entry responses to 1 μm carbachol were abolished (Fig. 1 B). At higher concentrations of carbachol (Fig. 1,C and E), both the release phase and the entry phase were more pronounced. However, the inhibitory action of 2-APB was substantially decreased. With 10 μm carbachol, significant release and entry were observed in the presence of 2-APB (Fig. 1 D), and at 100 μm carbachol, release and entry were reduced by only ∼50% by 2-APB (Fig. 1 F). This could suggest that the higher levels of InsP3 induced by muscarinic activation prevent the action of 2-APB on both InsP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release and TRPC3 channel activation. Such an effect would be consistent with the action of 2-APB on the InsP3 receptor, which has been shown to be reduced at higher InsP3 concentrations (47Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The implication from this is that the InsP3 receptor could be the mediator of both release and entry, a conclusion consistent with the substantial evidence indicating a direct interaction between TRP channels and InsP3 receptors (18Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mohayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I.N. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 19Kiselyov K.I. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X.

Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the higher activation of phospholipase C results in more diacylglycerol (as well as InsP3) to stimulate TRPC3 channels (36Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), resulting in the observed decrease in 2-APB sensitivity since the action of diacylglycerol on TRPC3 channels is insensitive to 2-APB (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Whether or not this is the case, it still remains that 2-APB blocks receptor-induced TRPC3 activation. The central question of whether the action of 2-APB on TRPC3 channels reflects its"

https://openalex.org/W2145399009,"The molecular details of 1→3-β-glucans, a fungal cell wall component, induced inflammatory responses are not well understood. In the present study, we conducted a systematic analysis of the molecular events leading to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production after glucan stimulation of macrophages. We demonstrated that activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is essential in zymosan A (a source of 1→3-β-glucans)-induced TNF-α production in macrophages (RAW264.7 cells). Zymosan A-induced TNF-α protein production was associated with an increase in the TNF-α gene promoter activity. Activation of the TNF-α gene promoter was dependent on activation of NF-κB. Time course studies indicated that DNA binding activity of NF-κB preceded TNF-α promoter activity. Inhibition of NF-κB activation led to a dramatic reduction in both TNF-α promoter activity and TNF-α protein production in the response to zymosan A. Mutation of a major NF-κB binding site (κ3) in the gene promoter resulted in a significant decrease in the induction of the gene promoter by zymosan A, while mutation of Egr or CRE sites failed to inhibit the response to zymosan. Together, these results strongly suggest that NF-κB is involved in signal transduction of 1→3-β-glucans-induced TNF-α expression."

Human ficolin/P35 as well as mannose-binding lectin (MBL) activates the complement lectin pathway in association with MBL-associated serine proteases. To elucidate the origin and evolution of ficolins, we separated ∼40 kDa (p40) and ∼50 kDa (p50) N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins from hemolymph plasma of the solitary ascidian. Binding assays revealed that p40 recognizes N-acetyl groups in association with a pyranose ring and that p50 recognizesN-acetylglucosamine alone. Based on the amino acid sequences of the proteins, we isolated two clones each of p40 and p50 from the ascidian hepatopancreas cDNA and determined the entire coding sequences of these clones. Because all of the clones contained both collagen-like and fibrinogen-like domains, we concluded that these were homologs of the mammalian ficolin family and designated ascidian ficolins (AsFCNs). The fibrinogen-like domain of the AsFCNs shows 45.4–52.4% amino acid sequence identity with the mammalian ficolin family. A phylogenetic tree of the fibrinogen-like sequences shows that all the fibrinogen-like domains may have evolved from a common ancestor that branched off an authentic fibrinogen.

Ficolin/P35 acts as an opsonin and enhances phagocytosis of Salmonella typhimuriumby neutrophil (20Teh C. Le Y. Lee S.H. Lu J. Immunology. 2000; 101: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It also activates the lectin complement pathway in association with MASPs (21Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that ficolins are involved in host defense through innate immunity in the vertebrate. The molecular details of invertebrate innate immune systems and their possible connection to vertebrate innate immunity have not been fully elucidated. Ascidians occupy a pivotal intermediary position between invertebrates and vertebrates. Therefore, studies on the host defense mechanisms of ascidian could provide us with important information about the evolution of a primitive innate immune system of vertebrates. The recent identification of cDNA encoding the third component of complement (AsC3) (22Nonaka M. Azumi K. Ji X. Namikawa-Yamada C. Sasaki M. Saiga H. Dodds A.W. Sekine H. Homma M.K. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 387-391PubMed Google Scholar), two types of MASP (AsMASPa and AsMASPb) (23Ji X. Azumi K. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6340-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and glucose-binding lectin (GBL) (24Sekine H. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Azumi K. Mizuochi T. Fujita T. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 349Crossref Google Scholar) suggests that the lectin complement pathway is present in ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi. This implies that lectins homologous to vertebrate MBL or ficolins might exist in ascidian. Here we describe the isolation and cloning of GlcNAc-binding lectins with a collagen-like domain and a fibrinogen-like domain, designated as ascidian ficolins (AsFCNs), from hemolymph plasma of the solitary ascidian, H. roretzi. The solitary ascidian, H. roretzi, was obtained from local dealers in Fukushima, Japan. Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Acidified Sepharose 4B was prepared by treating Sepharose 4B with 0.1 m HCl at 50 °C for 3 h. GlcNAc-agarose, fetuin, asialofetuin, bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated with lactose (Lac-BSA), and cellobiose (Cel-BSA) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO); BSA conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc-BSA), N-acetyllactose (LacNAc-BSA), and NeuAcα2–3N-acetyllactosamine (Sia-LacNAc-BSA) from Dextra Laboratories (UK); neoglycoproteins of Man-BSA, Glc-BSA, GlcNAc-BSA, and Gal-BSA from E. Y. Laboratories (San Mateo, CA); GlcNAc from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), and Na125I and [α-32P]dCTP from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hemolymph was collected from the solitary ascidian by cutting the tunic matrix without injuring internal organs, followed by centrifugation. To remove galactose-binding proteins and nonspecific binding proteins, the hemolymph plasma was directly applied to an acidified Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with starting buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2. The fractions that passed through were applied to a GlcNAc-agarose column. After washing the column with starting buffer, two major proteins designated p40 and p50 were eluted with starting buffer containing 150 mm GlcNAc. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 containing, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and then chromatographed on a Mono Q column, followed by elution with a linear NaCl gradient to 0.5 m. The preparation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using the Laemmli system. The ascidian ficolin-like proteins (p40 and p50) were labeled with Na125I and IODO-GEN from Pierce, Rockford, IL. The glycoproteins ovalbumin, bovine pancreatic RNase B, human fetuin, and human asialofetuin and the neoglycoproteins lactose-conjugated BSA (Lac-BSA), cellobiose-conjugated BSA (Cel-BSA),N-acetylglucosamine-conjugated BSA (GlcNAc-BSA), mannose-conjugated BSA (Man-BSA), glucose-conjugated BSA (Glc-BSA), galactose-conjugated BSA (Gal-BSA),N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated BSA (GalNAc-BSA),N-acetyllactosamine-conjugated BSA (LacNAc-BSA), NeuAcα2–3N-acetyllactosamine-conjugated BSA (Sia-LacNAc-BSA) were used for binding assays. In each neoglycoprotein, ∼19–42 mol of carbohydrate were conjugated to 1 mol of BSA. Ovalbumin contains high mannose-type and hybrid-type oligosaccharides (25Tai T. Yamashita K. Ogata-Arakawa M.

Glycoproteins and neoglycoproteins were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at the concentrations indicated in the figures. 100 μl of each solution was dot-blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using an Immunodot microfiltration apparatus (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The dotted membrane was blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mNaCl and 3% (w/v) BSA. The membrane was rinsed with 25 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 (Buffer A) and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 125I-labeled p40 (400,000 cpm/ml) or 125I-labeled p50 (350,000 cpm/ml) in Buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. After the incubation, the membrane was washed with Buffer A and air-dried. Binding of the radioactive ascidian lectins was measured using a Bio-imaging analyzer BAS-1800II (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and is indicated as the intensity of the photostimulated luminescence (PSL). For inhibition assays, 100 μl of each GlcNAc-BSA solution (0.00032–5.0 μg/100 μl) was dot-blotted onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked and rinsed as described above.125I-labeled p40 and p50 were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C without or with 1, 10, or 100 mm GlcNAc, 10 mm sodium acetate, or 10 mm N-acetylglycine in Buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. The mixture was then overlaid on the membrane and binding of the radioactive lectin to the GlcNAc-BSA was determined as described above. Neoglycolipids were prepared by reductive amination from dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) and the following carbohydrates as described previously (30Mizuochi T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Lachmann P.J. Childs R.A. Thiel S. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13834-13839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): GlcNAc, di-N-acetylchitobiose (GlcNAc2), tri-N-acetylchitotriose (GlcNAc3), tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose (GlcNAc4), penta-N-acetylchitopentaose (GlcNAc5), hexa-N-acetylchitohexaose (GlcNAc6), and GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6(GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Man (GlcNAc2Man3). The neoglycolipids were applied to two TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), chromatographed, and developed using chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume). After drying, one TLC plate was used for the binding assay with 125I-labeled p40 (400,000 cpm/ml). The other TLC plate was sprayed with primulin reagent and then subjected to a Lumino-image analyzer LAS-1000 (Fujifilm) for lipid detection of neoglycolipids. For amino acid sequencing, p40 or p50 was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. The bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, excised, and then analyzed using an ABI protein sequencer model 476A. To obtain the internal amino acid sequences, p40 or p50 was digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease according to Cleveland's method (31Cleveland D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Digested peptides were electroblotted, followed by the same method as described above. Ascidian hepatopancreases were removed immediately before use. RNA was isolated from the hepatopancreases and hemocytes using the acid guanidine thiocyanate method, and the poly(A)+ fraction was purified by passage through an oligo (dT)-cellulose column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). cDNAs were prepared using SUPERSCRIPTTMII Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). Four degenerated primers were synthesized based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of p40 and its V8 protease fragments: TGLRNQ (5′-ACNGGNYTNMGNAAYCA-3′), RNQLQE (5′-MGNAAYCARYTNCARGA-3′), FQRRMD (5′-TCCATNCKNCKYTGRAA-3′), and WTVFQR (5′-CKYTGRAANACNGTCCA-3′). A nested PCR was performed to amplify a portion of the cDNA using ascidian hepatopancreas cDNA as a template and two primer sets (5′-ACNGGNYTNMGNAAYCA-3′ and 5′-TCCATNCKNCKYTGRAA-3′ for the first and 5′-MGNAAYCARYTNCARGA-3′ and 5′-CKYTGRAANACNGTCCA-3′for the second). PCR products of the expected size were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Wisconsin, WI) and sequenced. 5′- and 3′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) were then conducted to complete the cDNA sequence using a kit (Marathon,CLONTECH). Two sets of gene-specific primers (GSPs) were synthesized: 5′-AGTTTCTGTTTTCTGATCCACTCTG-3′ and 5′-TGTTTTCTGATCCACTCTGTTGTCC-3′ for 5′RACE and 5′-CGAAGTAAGAATGGACAACAGAGTG-3′ and 5′-AAGAATGGACAACAGAGTGGATCAG-3′ for 3′-RACE. The RACE products were cloned and sequenced. A complete stretch of p40 cDNA was constructed by overlapping the sequences of these PCR products, and it was designated AsFCN1. We also identified another cDNA sequence, termed AsFCN2. Four degenerated primers were synthesized for PCR to amplify the p50 cDNA. These were based on the amino acid sequences VMQKVM (5′-GTNATGCARAARGTNATG-3′), AEGVTG (5′-GCNGARGGNGTNACNGG-3′), WTVFQR (5′-CKYTGRAANACNGTCCA-3′), and VYCDLT (5′-GTNARRTCRCARTANAC-3′). A nested PCR was performed using ascidian hepatopancreas cDNA as a template and two primer sets (5′-GTNATGCARAARGTNATG-3′ and 5′-CKYTGRAANACNGTCCA-3′for the first and 5′-GCNGARGGNGTNACNGG-3′ and 5′-GTNARRTCRCARTANAC-3′ for the second). PCR products of the expected size were cloned and sequenced as described. To complete the p50 cDNA sequence, 5′- and 3′-RACE were conducted using GSPs (5′-CTGCTATACCCCTGCATCCATCAGG-3′ and 5′-ACCCCTGCATCCATCAGGGACTTCA-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-CGAACAGAGGTTGGAAATGGAAATC-3′ and 5′-GTTGGAAATGGAAATCGAGAAGAAA-3′ for 3′RACE). Its clone was designated AsFCN3. Using different sets of GSPs (5′-TCCTTTCCAGGATATAGCCCCGTAC-3′ and 5′-GGATATAGCCCCGTACTTGCTCACT-3′ for 5′-RACE, and 5′-CGCAGAAACCCAGCAA- CAAATCGTC3-′ and 5′-ACCCAGCAACAAATCGTCGAAGGAA-3′ for 3′-RACE), another cDNA sequence, designated AsFCN4, was identified. DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52494) Google Scholar) using a DNA sequencer (Model 4000; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The labeling reaction was performed using a Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing kit (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH). Sequencing primers were synthesized by Nisshinbo (Tokyo, Japan). A membrane filter blotted with 2 μg of poly(A)+ fraction from hepatopancreases and hemocytes was hybridized with 32P-labeled specific cDNA fragments of the ascidian ficolins (AsFCN1, nucleotides 14–336; AsFCN3, nucleotides 69–384; AsFCN4, nucleotides 7–326) at 42 °C overnight in 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 9 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After a final washing at 55 °C for 40 min in 0.1× SSC (1.5 mm sodium citrate, 15 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS, the filter was exposed to an autoradiogram imaging screen, and the image was then read using a bioimaging analyzing system (BAS 1000, Fujifilm). The fibrinogen-like sequences of four ascidian ficolins, of eight members of the mammalian ficolin family, including human ficolin/P35 (12Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N.

Biophys. 1998; 360: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), of other proteins with a fibrinogen-like domain, and of fibrinogens were aligned using ClustalW software (EMBL Data Library, Heidelberg, Germany). A pairwise distance matrix was obtained by calculating the proportions of different amino acids. The matrix was then used to construct trees by the neighbor-joining method (33Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Bootstrap analysis was used to assess the reliability of branching patterns. For each tree, 1000 bootstrap replications were performed. The hemolymph plasma was subjected to affinity chromatography on a GlcNAc-agarose column, and ascidian ficolin-like lectins were eluted with GlcNAc like human ficolin/P35. Two major proteins with molecular masses of ∼40 and ∼50 kDa by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions were found in the eluate from GlcNAc-agarose column (Fig.1 A) and were tentatively designated p40 and p50, respectively. Further purification was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column. As shown in Fig.1 B, each fraction of purified p40 and p50 showed a single band by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Under non-reducing conditions, p40 and p50 are resolved mainly into 180 and 240 kDa components and 150, 300, and 450 components, respectively. Two-dimensional electrophoresis indicated that these proteins could be reduced to ∼40 kDa and ∼50 kDa, respectively (data not shown). These results suggest that p40 and p50 are composed of subunits linked to form homopolymers via disulfide bonds, as is the case with human ficolin/P35. To investigate the lectin activity of p40, its binding specificity for various glycoproteins and neoglycoproteins was evaluated. In a binding assay with neoglycoprotein, p40 bound GlcNAc-BSA, GalNAc-BSA, and Sia-LacNAc-BSA but not to the other neoglycoproteins (Fig. 2 A). In particular, p40 recognized GlcNAc with the most sensitivity (GlcNAc > GalNAc > Sia-LacNAc). Furthermore, it was notable that p40 did not bind to LacNAc-BSA with carbohydrate structure of Galβ1–4GlcNAc, suggesting that this lectin can recognize non-reducing terminal carbohydrate residues carryingN-acetyl group such as GlcNAc, GalNAc, and NeuAc. Another binding assay was performed with natural glycoproteins, i.e.ovalbumin (OVA) with high mannose-type and hybrid-type oligosaccharides, bovine RNase B (RN) with only high mannose-type oligosaccharides, human fetuin and human asialofetuin, both with complex-type oligosaccharides and O-linked oligosaccharides. The results showed that p40 bound to fetuin, which has oligosaccharides with N-acetylneuraminic acid at their non-reducing termini (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, one of the simplest chemicals containing an N-acetyl groups,N-acetylglycine, inhibited p40 binding to GlcNAc-BSA (Fig. 2 C). We next performed similar binding assays using neoglycolipids prepared by reductive amination from dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) and the following carbohydrates as described previously (30Mizuochi T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Lachmann P.J. Childs R.A. Thiel S. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13834-13839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): GlcNAc, GlcNAc2, GlcNAc3, GlcNAc4, GlcNAc5, GlcNAc6, and GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6(GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Man (GlcNAc2Man3). These conjugates were chromatographed on a TLC plate, which was then used for a binding assay with 125I-labeled p40. As shown in Fig. 2 D, radiolabeled p40 bound to all the neoglycolipids with the exception of GlcNAc-DPPE. The failure of p40 to bind to GlcNAc-DPPE may be caused by a structural change in the pyranose ring by reductive amination from DPPE. These results suggest that carbohydrate recognition by p40 may require not only anN-acetyl group but also an intact pyranose ring structure. As shown in Fig.3 A, p50 bound to GlcNAc-BSA in a dose-dependent manner and bound weakly to GalNAc-BSA, but did not bind to the others (Man-BSA, Glc-BSA, Gal-BSA, Lac-BSA, Cel-BSA, LacNAc-BSA, and Sia-LacNAc-BSA). It also did not bind to any of the glycoproteins tested (data not shown). An inhibition assay with GlcNAc showed that more than 10 mm GlcNAc completely inhibited p50 binding to GlcNAc-BSA (Fig. 3 B). Thus, it is likely that p50 exclusively recognizes GlcNAc at non-reducing terminal. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of p40 (27 amino acids) and p50 (24 amino acids) were determined. These sequences showed no significant similarity to other known proteins. In p40, the amino acid sequence, HNEDLXTGLPNQLQEHXSLPESGVIIE, was obtained and an additional weak arginine (R) and threonine (T) appeared at positions 1 and 22 (shown inbold) of the mature protein, respectively. After fragmentation of p40 and p50 with S. aureus V8 protease, partial internal amino acid sequences were also determined. The NH2-terminal sequence (VYCDLTSDGGGWTVFQRRMDGSVDF) of one of the peptides from p40 was the same as that of a peptide from p50. This sequence has significant similarity to a portion of the fibrinogen-like sequences in mammalian ficolin, tenascin and fibrinogen. Using degenerated primers prepared based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of p40 and p50, and those of the fragmented peptides, we performed nested PCR. The cDNA sequence completed by 5′- and 3′-RACE showed that p40 cDNA contains a 972-base pair open-reading frame (ORF) encoding 324 amino acids preceded by a leader peptide of 17 amino acids, which we designated AsFCN1 (Fig. 4). The predicted molecular size of mature AsFCN1 was calculated to be 34,799 Da. In the cDNA cloning of AsFCN1, another cDNA clone was identified with hepatopancreas cDNA. This cDNA clone, termed AsFCN2, encodes 324 amino acids, which had 92.6% identity with AsFCN1 and had the same domain structure (Fig. 4). The p50 cDNA contains a 1,068-base pair ORF encoding 356 amino acids preceded by a leader peptide of 21 amino acids. The predicted molecular size of mature p50, designated AsFCN3, was calculated to be 38,229 Da. The overall amino acid sequence identity between AsFCN1 and AsFCN3 was 69.3%. In the cDNA cloning of AsFCN3, we also identified another clone, termed AsFCN4. AsFCN4 cDNA contains a 1023-base pair ORF encoding 341 amino acids, which has 76.2%, 69.2, and 70.9% identities to AsFCN1, 2, and 3, respectively. Because AsFCN1 and AsFCN3 contained three and four potentialN-linked glycosylation sites, respectively, the molecular sizes observed on SDS-PAGE seem to result from glycosylation. Both AsFCN1 and AsFCN3 have a short collagenous sequence, five Gly-X-Y triplet repeats (where X andY represent any amino acid) and a COOH-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, suggesting ficolin-like lectins. As shown in Fig. 4, alignment of the amino acid sequences of these four AsFCNs indicated that they are closely similar to each other, especially in their fibrinogen-like domains. The fibrinogen-like domain sequences of the AsFCNs showed from 45.4 to 52.4% identity with those of human ficolins. Because the fibrinogen-like domains of the AsFCNs are highly homologous, the 5′-UT sequences of AsFCN1, 3, and 4 were used as probes in Northern blots. As shown in Fig. 5, the major transcripts of AsFCNs1, 3, and 4 expressed in the hepatopancreas are about 1.3, 1.4, and 1.3 kilobases long, respectively. From a comparison with the signal intensities, it appears that AsFCN3 and 4 are the major products in ascidian hepatopancreas. The faint signal observed in the AsFCN1 blot could result from both AsFCN1 and 2 transcripts because the sequences of AsFCN1 and AsFCN2 cDNAs are very similar. No detectable signals of AsFCNs were observed in Northern blots with the poly(A)+fraction from ascidian hemocytes (data not shown). The phylogenetic relationships between AsFCNs and other fibrinogen-like proteins were analyzed by neighbor-joining trees using the regional amino acid sequences of their fibrinogen-like domains. As shown in Fig.6, all of the sequences in fibrinogen-like proteins examined such as AsFCNs, mammalian ficolins, tenascins, angiopoietins, and horseshoe crab tachylectins roughly formed a single large branch. In this tree, four AsFCNs formed a tight cluster. The branch of the AsFCNs did not originate directly from that of the mammalian ficolins, which also formed independently a tight branch, making it difficult to define their origin. Members of the tenascin family also formed a unique branch between the branches of the AsFCNs and the mammalian ficolins. The phylogenetic relationship of these three groups is not convincing, because the relevant bootstrap values are not high enough to support the branching definitely. The fibrinogen-like sequences of AsFCNs were slightly more similar to those of mammalian ficolins (45–52% identity) than to those of tenascins (45–48% identity). In this study, we isolated two novel ascidian lectins present in hemolymph from a solitary ascidian, H. roretzi by affinity chromatography using GlcNAc-agarose followed by chromatography on Mono Q, and cloned four lectins from cDNA libraries of the ascidian hepatopancreas. The deduced amino acid sequences of these ascidian lectins predict that they have major features of the mammalian ficolin family. Because these lectins contained three structural domains consisting of an NH2-terminal domain containing cysteine residues, a collagen-like domain, and a fibrinogen-like domain, we designated these lectins as ascidian ficolin, AsFCN 1, 2, 3, and 4. Most remarkably, these AsFCNs are the first invertebrate lectins to be identified that have characteristic collagen-like and fibrinogen-like domains. In comparison with the mammalian ficolin family, AsFCNs have shorter collagen-like domains (5 Gly-X-Y repeats, whereas those of the mammalian ficolin family contain 11–19 Gly-X-Y repeats). The fibrinogen-like domains of AsFCNs are 45.4 to 52.4% identical with those of the mammalian ficolin family, which also specifically recognize GlcNAc. A phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of the fibrinogen-like domains indicated that the fibrinogen-like proteins formed a cluster independent of the primary fibrinogen sequences (Fig.6), suggesting that all the fibrinogen-like domains may have evolved from a common ancestor that branched off an authentic fibrinogen. In this tree, four AsFCNs form a group that is independent of the mammalian ficolin family. Another phylogenetic tree, which was constructed based on the entire amino acid sequences of AsFCNs and the mammalian ficolin family, indicated that the AsFCNs again form a tight cluster (data not shown). These results suggest that the gene duplication that produced these four genes was a recent event that most probably occurred in the tunicate lineage. The tree did not clearly define the origin of AsFCNs from a common lineage with mammalian ficolins and suggests that the fibrinogen-like domains of AsFCNs may be related to those of the tenascin family. However, the slightly higher identity of the fibrinogen-like sequences of AsFCNs with those of mammalian ficolins compared to other fibrinogen-like domains (i.e. 45–48% for tenascins, 36–44% for angiopoietins, and 34–42% for fibrinogens) may support a common ancestor for both ascidian and mammalian ficolins. An advanced phylogenetic tree containing the sequences of lower vertebrate ficolins that have not yet been identified may reveal the definite origin of AsFCNs. We identified two ascidian ficolin proteins, p40 and p50. Based on the amino acid sequence of p40, we cloned AsFCN1 and AsFCN2. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of AsFCN1 and AsFCN2 showed that the NH2-terminal half was the same except for two amino acids, histidine (H) and serine (S) of AcFCN1, and arginine (R) and threonine (T) of AsFCN2, respectively (Fig. 4). The latter two amino acids were also recognized as an additional signal in the amino acid sequence analysis of p40. Therefore, it is possible that p40 contains both AsFCN1 and AsFCN2. With Northern blot analysis, we showed major expression of AsFCN1, 3 and 4 transcripts in ascidian hepatopancreas (Fig. 5). In this experiment, we could not design a specific probe for AsFCN2 because of its high similarity with AsFCN1. The message obtained with the AsFCN1 probe contained that of AsFCN2. Fig. 5 shows lower expression of AsFCN1/2 in hepatopancreas, which corresponds to the quantity of p40 in ascidian hemolymph (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, the p50 transcript seems identical to that of the AsFCN3 transcript since a different size of AsFCN4 transcript is observed in Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5). In this respect we have not yet identified the AsFCN4 protein. Binding studies with neoglycoproteins, glycoproteins, and neoglycolipids indicate that p40 (AsFCN1/2) is able to bind to anN-acetyl group in association with a pyranose ring. The horseshoe crab lectins, tachylectin 5A and 5B, which have similar fibrinogen-like structures but lack collagen-like domains, also recognize the N-acetyl group (34Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10086-10091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In this respect p40 (AsFCN1/2) is similar to the horseshoe crab lectins, but differs in its requirement for a pyranose ring. In addition, collectin-like lectin has been identified in a different species of ascidian as a GalNAc-binding lectin with a collagen-like domain, although the complete structure has not been elucidated (35Nair S.V. Pearce S. Green P.L. Mahajan D. Newton R.A. Raftos D.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 125: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that this lectin and AsFCN1/2 diverged from the same ancestor and have similar physiological functions through their lectin activities. On the other hand, the binding specificity of p50 (AsFCN3) involves recognition of GlcNAc alone (Fig. 3). Thus, each fibrinogen-like domain of AsFCNs has a lectin activity associated with a different sugar specificity. Although the AsFCNs have much shorter collagen-like sequences than the mammalian ficolins, the present study elucidated the structural and functional features common to the ascidian and mammalian ficolins, including domain structure, multimeric property, and lectin activity. In the primitive complement system of ascidian, the activation pathway consisting of at least of C3 (21Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), factor B (36Ji X. Namikawa-Yamada C. Nakanishi M. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 43Crossref Google Scholar), and MASPs (22Nonaka M. Azumi K. Ji X. Namikawa-Yamada C. Sasaki M. Saiga H. Dodds A.W. Sekine H. Homma M.K. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 387-391PubMed Google Scholar) has been demonstrated and corresponds to the mammalian alternative and lectin pathways. Although an ascidian MBL homolog has not been fully identified, we have identified a similar lectin, termed glucose-binding lectin (GBL), which lacks a collagen-like domain in its NH2-terminal region and which specifically recognizes glucose residues (23Ji X. Azumi K. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6340-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). GBL is associated with ascidian MASPs that activate ascidian C3 (21Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that human ficolin/P35, associated with MASPs, activates the lectin complement pathway (20Teh C. Le Y. Lee S.H. Lu J. Immunology. 2000; 101: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that AsFCNs function as the recognition molecule of the ascidian lectin pathway. Our preliminary experiments show that p40 (AsFCN1/2) is associated with AsMASPs and activates ascidian C3. Data are accumulating that show that the engagement of ligands by MBL or ficolin results in activation of the MASPs, which in turn activate C3 directly (6Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). MASPs have been identified in lamprey (37Endo Y. Takahashi M. Nakao M. Saiga H. Sekine H. Matsushita M. Nonaka M. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4924-4930PubMed Google Scholar) and ascidian (22Nonaka M. Azumi K. Ji X. Namikawa-Yamada C. Sasaki M. Saiga H. Dodds A.W. Sekine H. Homma M.K. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 387-391PubMed Google Scholar) and C3 in ascidian (21Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and sea urchin (38Al-sharif W.Z. Sunyer J.O. Lambris D. Smith L.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2983-2997PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the prediction that MBL or ficolin MASPs and C3 may be the minimum ancestral components of the complement system. Thus, the identification of AsFCNs described in this report may contribute to the clarification of the primitive complement system."

Interestingly, CARD11 and CARD14 are members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family that function to assemble signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. We report here that CARD10 is a novel CARD/MAGUK family member that signals the activation of NF-κB through BCL10. CARD10 and other members of the CARD/MAGUK family likely play an important role in receptor-mediated activation of BCL10 and NF-κB. Plasmids expressing CARD10 with C-terminal FLAG epitopes were constructed using pCMV-Tag 4A (Stratagene). Constructs encoding epitope-tagged BCL10 were described previously (19Srinivasula S.M.

The BCL10 antibody was described previously (25Ye H. Dogan A. Karran L. Willis T.G. Chen L. Wlodarska I. Dyer M.J. Isaacson P.G. Du M.Q. Am. J.

For mammalian two-hybrid assays, 293T cells in 6-well plates (35-mm wells) were transfected with the following plasmids: 750 ng of pCMV-CARD10/BD, 750 ng of pCMV-AD fused to individual CARD domains, 250 ng of pFR-Luc firefly reporter (Stratagene), and 250 ng of pRL-TK renilla reporter (Promega). For NF-κB assays, 293T cells were transfected with the following plasmids: 900 ng of pNF-κB luciferase reporter (Stratagene), 100 ng of pRL-TK renilla reporter (Promega), and 1000 ng of indicated expression plasmids. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and firefly luciferase activity was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). In addition, renilla luciferase activity was determined and used to normalize transfection efficiencies. 293T cells transfected with plasmids were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer and incubated with indicated antibodies. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed extensively, and then subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-FLAG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). In vitro binding assays between BCL10 and CARD10 proteins were performed as described previously (26Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 615-619PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, BCL10 wt and the L41R mutant were expressed in DH5-α bacteria as GST fusion proteins, and equal amounts of protein were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An equal amount of CARD10 protein, labeled with [35S]methionine, was incubated with the protein-bound Sepharose beads in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Brij, and protease inhibitors) for 3 h. The beads were washed four times with the same buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were then resolved on a 10% SDS gel and visualized by autoradiography. We performed a mammalian two-hybrid analysis and screened Millennium Pharmaceuticals' collection of CARD domains for a selective interaction with the CARD domain of BCL10. The CARD domain of CARD10 interacted with the CARD of BCL10 resulting in a 340-fold increase in relative luciferase activity (Fig.1 A). Co-expression of CARD10-CARD with 22 other CARD domains failed to activate luciferase expression indicating that the CARD of CARD10 interacts selectively with the CARD of BCL10. Human CARD10 is a novel CARD family member of 1032 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 116 kDa (Fig.1 B). Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that CARD10 has a domain structure that is similar to CARD9, CARD11, and CARD14, whose N-terminal CARD domains also interact selectively with the CARD activation domain of BCL10 (10, 11; see Figs. 1 B and2 A). CARD10 is comprised of at least five putative functional domains, an N-terminal CARD domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tripartite structure consisting of a PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a GUK domain with homology to guanylate kinase. Although the CARD domain of CARD10 (residues 31–117) shows significant similarity to those found in other CARD family members (Fig. 2 B), it is most similar to the CARD domains of CARD11 (58% identity), CARD14 (46% identity), and CARD9 (46% identity). Adjacent to the N-terminal CARD domain are coiled-coil structures with extensive regions of heptad repeats that function in protein oligomerization and activation (27Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The COILS2 program (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3459) Google Scholar) predicts with a probability of greater than 70% at least four coiled-coil structures in CARD10 (residues 138–206, 210–256, 263–307, and 326–456) that are interrupted by regions with a lower coiled-coil potential. The PDZ/SH3/GUK tripartite structure found at the C terminus (Fig. 2, A, C,D, and E) classifies CARD10 as a novel member of the MAGUK family of proteins that function to organize signaling complexes at plasma membranes (29Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that CARD10 is expressed as a 4.4-kilobase transcript in a variety of adult tissues, including heart, kidney, and liver (Fig. 2 F). CARD10 was also expressed abundantly in fetal lung, liver, and kidney tissues, as well as in multiple cancer cell lines, including HeLa S3, chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma SW480 cells, and lung carcinoma A549 cells (data not shown).Figure 2Domain structure and tissue distribution of human CARD10.

We therefore examined the interactions between these two proteins when overexpressed in cells. Immunoprecipitation of T7-tagged BCL10 quantitatively co-precipitated FLAG-tagged CARD10 (Fig.3 A). This interaction was dependent on the CARD domains of both proteins, because CARD10 failed to associate with a variant BCL10 with a point mutation (L41R) that disrupts CARD-mediated homodimerization (19Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Lin J.H. Poyet J.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17946-17954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, a CARD10 truncation mutant lacking its CARD domain failed to co-precipitate with BCL10. We next tested whether CARD10 interacts with endogenous BCL10 when overexpressed in cells (Fig. 3 B). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous BCL10 co-precipitated FLAG-tagged CARD10 but not a FLAG-tagged CARD10 truncation mutant lacking its CARD domain. We also examined the interaction of radiolabeled CARD10 with GST-BCL10 in vitro and found that CARD10 associates directly with BCL10 through a CARD-CARD interaction (Fig. 3 C). Our finding that CARD10 specifically associates with BCL10 prompted us to examine whether CARD10 induces NF-κB activity, using a luciferase reporter gene system. When CARD10 was expressed in 293T cells, NF-κB activity was induced 90-fold compared with empty vector (Fig.4 A). NF-κB activity was dependent on the IKK complex, because dominant-negative versions of IKKγ and IKKβ blocked the ability of CARD10 to induce the activation of NF-κB (data not shown). To determine the role of individual domains in NF-κB signaling, we constructed a series of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of CARD10 (Fig. 4 B). The N-terminal CARD domain of CARD10 was essential for NF-κB signaling, because deletion of this domain eliminated the induction of NF-kB activity (Fig. 4 C). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the truncation mutant was expressed at a level comparable with wt protein that induces NF-κB activity 30- to 40-fold (compare Fig. 4,A and C). Deletion of the C-terminal GUK domain did not interfere with the ability of CARD10 to induce NF-κB activity. However, further deletion of the SH3 and PDZ domains reduced the levels of NF-κB activity to levels 2- to 3-fold less than that obtained with wt protein. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the C-terminal truncated proteins were expressed at levels similar to each other and wt protein indicating that reductions in activity were not because of reduced levels of expression (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the PDZ and SH3 domains are required for maximal activation of NF-kB activity by CARD10. We have identified CARD10 as a specific regulator of BCL10. Our finding that CARD10 both binds to BCL10 and signals NF-κB activation through its N-terminal CARD domain suggests that this molecule functions as an upstream activator of BCL10. CARD10 is one of four CARD proteins identified thus far that assemble with BCL10 and signal the activation of NF-κB (10Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.-L. Merriam S.

These molecules (CARD10, CARD9, CARD11, and CARD14) likely function to transduce distinct upstream stimuli to the activation of BCL10 and NF-κB. Interestingly, this subclass of CARD proteins is related in both sequence and structure (Fig. 2). Besides containing closely related N-terminal CARD domains that interact specifically with BCL10, each molecule contains coiled-coiled domains that could mediate self-association resulting in aggregation and activation of BCL10 in response to upstream signals. BCL10 might then engage and oligomerize IKKγ resulting in the activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB (17, 30; see Fig. 5). Thus, CARD10 and the other BCL10 activators (CARD9, CARD11, and CARD14) likely function in a manner analogous to Apaf-1 and CARD4 that induce oligomerization and activation of their respective downstream CARD binding partners. A unique feature of CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14 is the presence of C-terminal PDZ/SH3/GUK domains that suggest a role for these proteins in signal transduction by receptors at the plasma membrane. A recent study implicating BCL10 as a mediator of antigen receptor signaling in B and T cells (24Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) suggests that CARD10 and the other CARD/MAGUK family members might function to recruit BCL10 to receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1646516450,"The stability of data bits in magnetic recording media at ultra-high densities is compromised by the thermal 'flips'--magnetic spin reversals--of nano-sized spin domains, which erase the stored information. Media that are magnetized perpendicular to the plane of the film, such as ultrathin cobalt films or multilayered structures, are more stable against thermal self-erasure than conventional memory devices. In this context, magneto-optical memories seem particularly promising for ultrahigh-density recording on portable disks, and bit densities of approximately 100 Gbit inch(-2) (ref. 7) have been demonstrated using recent advances in the bit writing and reading techniques. But the roughness and mobility of the magnetic domain walls prevents closer packing of the magnetic bits, and therefore presents a challenge to reaching even higher bit densities. Here we report that the strain imposed by a linear defect in a magnetic thin film can smooth rough domain walls over regions hundreds of micrometres in size, and halt their motion. A scaling analysis of this process, based on the generic physics of disorder-controlled elastic lines, points to a simple way by which magnetic media might be prepared that can store data at densities in excess of 1 Tbit inch(-2)."
https://openalex.org/W1982944039,"In addition to a role in DNA repair events in yeast, several lines of evidence indicate that the Rad23 protein (Rad23p) may regulate the activity of the 26 S proteasome. We report evidence that a de-N-glycosylating enzyme, Png1p, may be involved in the proteasomal degradation pathway via its binding to Rad23p. Interaction of Rad23p and Png1p was first detected by two-hybrid screening, and this interaction in vivo was confirmed by biochemical analyses. The Png1p-Rad23p complex was shown to be distinct from the well established DNA repair complex, Rad4p-Rad23p.

This would be achieved by removing bulky N-linked glycans from misfolded glycoproteins that are translocated from the lumen of the ER into the cytosol for degradation. However, a physical link between the proteasome and this deglycosylating enzyme has not yet been described. Rad23p is known to have a pivotal role in nucleotide excision repair (14Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 15de Laar W.L. Jaspers N.G.L. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

Yeast Rad23p stoichiometrically forms a complex with Rad4p to form nucleotide excision repair factor 2 (NEF2). Unlike other NER proteins, the biochemical functions of NEF2 still remain largely unknown. However, NEF2 was recently shown to bind specifically to damaged DNA in an ATP-independent manner (17Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

While the absence of Rad4p (rad4Δ) causes extreme sensitivity to UV light in yeast, rad23Δ mutants exhibited only moderate UV sensitivity, indicating that Rad23p may affect the efficiency of the excision repair process rather than directly mediating the repair of damaged DNA (20Guzder S.N.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). One structural feature of Rad23p is that it contains a ubiquitin-like domain (UbL) at the N terminus that can bind to the 26 S proteasome (24Schauber C. Chen L. Tonganonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This association appears to be important for DNA repair (24Schauber C. Chen L. Tonganonkar P. Vega I.

Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, Rad23p was shown to have an overlapping function with Rpn10p, a 19 S proteasome subunit that is known to be a multiubiquitin chain-binding receptor for the proteasome (27Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the Rad23p is a negative regulator of multiubiquitin chain assembly (28Ortolan T.G. Tonhaokar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, thus far, the link between DNA repair and proteasome degradation with respect to Rad23p function remains elusive. We report here a finding that the deglycosylation enzyme, Png1p, exists as a high molecular weight complex with Rad23p. The Png1p-Rad23p complex was found to be distinct from the well established DNA repair complex, Rad4p-Rad23p (NEF2). In addition, we report that the Png1p-Rad23p complex interacts with the 26 S proteasome. These findings led us to hypothesize that Rad23p may function to link the 26 S proteasome with other proteins, such as Rad4p or Png1p. This “escort” property of Rad23p may explain the complex effect of Rad23p-proteasome associations in a variety of cellular processes, including deglycosylation of glycoproteins slated for degradation.

Correct integration of the transformant was confirmed by colony PCR as well as the expression of Rpt1-GFP-HAp by Western blotting using mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Standard yeast media and genetic techniques were used (32Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

The yeast genes used in this study were isolated from the genomic DNA of W303-1a by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). For isolation of the PNG1 gene, the following primers were used: 5′-AAAAAGAATTC-ATGGGAGAGGTATACGAAAAAA-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AAAAACTCGAG-CTATTTACCATCCTCCCCACGC-3′ (3′-primer). The amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI/XhoI and cloned into EcoRI/SalI sites of pBTM116 (29Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

The Trp+ colonies were isolated, and the transformants bearing plasmids with the correct insert were identified by colony polymerase chain reaction. The expression of the Rad4Mycp was further confirmed by Western blotting. The RAD23 gene was isolated by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-AAAAAGAATTCATGGTTAGCTTAACCTTTAAAAATTTC-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AAAAAGTCGACTCAGTCGGCATGATCGCTGAATAG-3′ (3′-primer), and the amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI/SalI and cloned into pGAD424 (41Chien C.-T.

Strain L4O was transformed with pBTM116-ADE2-PNG1 (target plasmid) and a two-hybrid genomic library (pGAD library (Ref. 42James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A.

After screening 2.2 × 106transformants in a yeast genomic library, two distinct GAD library plasmids that showed a reproducible His+β-galactosidase+ phenotype in PNG1-specific manner were recovered. These candidate GAD plasmids were then transformed into strain L4O and mated with AMR70 cells with each of several plasmids encoding various lexA-plasmids. These candidate plasmids did not exhibit an interaction with thelexA-lamin or lexA-SIR4 C terminus, both of which have been used to test for potential false positives in two-hybrid library screening (39Park H.

Briefly, cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) including various protease inhibitors as described above, and equal amounts of extract (2 mg of total protein) were incubated with 20 μl of protein G-agarose with and without respective anti-Tag antibodies (rabbit anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-His6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:50 in dilution; or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), 1:250 in dilution) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A (50 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), dissolved in 20 μl of sample buffer, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, Western blotting analysis was carried out as described above. For qualitative UV sensitivity analysis, cells were grown in synthetic dextrose (SD) −Leu −Ura +galactose or −Leu −Ura +glucose medium to saturation. Cells were further cultured in the presence of 0.1 mmCuSO4 for another 2 h, and the cell density was normalized to A 600 = 1.0 (∼5.0 × 106 cells/ml). Cells were taken from the aliquot with Q-tips and streaked as a single line onto the respective plate (−Leu −Ura +galactose +0.1 mm CuSO4 or −Leu −Ura +glucose +0.1 mm CuSO4). After these plates were covered with a glass plate, they were placed 20 cm distant from the germicidal UV light (254 nm; Sylvania). Then the glass plate was slid parallel to the line of cells so that the cells were exposed to UV for different times from 0 to 8 s. The plate was then incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 4 days. If a cell line had UV sensitivity, cells would not be expected to grow all the way across the line when exposed to UV. In contrast, wild-type cells would be expected to exhibit growth across the entire line even when they were exposed to the maximum dose of UV. For quantitative assay for UV treatment, cells were grown in the respective medium (SD −Leu −Ura +glucose or SD −Leu −Ura +galactose) overnight, and after 0.1 mm CuSO4was added, they were cultured for 2 h, plated on YPAD at appropriate dilutions, and then exposed to 254-nm UV light using a UV cross-linker (UV Statalinker model 1800; Stratagene) at given doses. Cells were plated in triplicate and incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 3 days, and the number of surviving colonies were counted. Our initial assumption that Png1p might be a part of a multiprotein complex in yeast was based on the results of gel filtration analysis of a cell-free yeast extract. As shown in Fig.1, PNGase activity measurement of the gel filtration fractions showed distinct differences between the elution position of Png1p in the yeast cytosol and that of Png1p expressed inEscherichia coli. While the bacterially expressed protein showed the expected molecular mass of a monomer form (∼45 kDa), the yeast cytosol protein had a much higher molecular mass (estimated to be ∼200 kDa). This result suggested that in the yeast cytosol Png1p may bind to other proteins to form a high molecular weight protein complex. The observation described above led us to carry out two-hybrid library screening withPNG1 as a bait to search for possible Png1p-binding proteins. Upon screening 2.2 × 106 transformants with a yeast genomic library, we recovered two distinct plasmids that showed a reproducible His+ β-galactosidase+phenotype in a target plasmid (lexA-PNG1)-specific manner. Sequencing of inserts recovered from these two plasmids showed that they consisted of two different Rad23p fragments (one containing amino acid residues 218–398 and the other containing residues 229–398) fused in frame to the GAL4 activation domain sequence (Fig.2). These plasmids did not exhibit an interaction with either lexA-lamin or lexA-SIR4 C terminus, which have been used to test for potential false positives in two-hybrid library screening (39Park H. Sternglanz R. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1998; 107: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction observed was specific (data not shown). To confirm the interaction of Png1p with Rad23p in vivo, gel filtration analysis was carried out to examine the migration of these two proteins. First, we determined the elution position of Png1p inrad23Δ cells. As shown in Fig.3, a drastic shift in elution position of this enzyme to a lower apparent mass was observed inrad23Δ cells, and the elution position was similar to that for bacterially expressed Png1p. This result suggested that the high molecular complex containing Png1p might also contain Rad23p. To provide direct evidence for interaction of Rad23p and Png1p, FLAG-tagged Rad23p (FLAG-Rad23p; Ref. 24Schauber C. Chen L. Tonganonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) was expressed under an inducible CUP1 promoter. This protein construct was used to show interaction of Rad23p with the 26 S proteasome as well as with Rad4p (24Schauber C. Chen L. Tonganonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 27Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Png1p is known to be present in extremely low abundance in cells under normal experimental conditions (8Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), while Rad23p is relatively abundant (17Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, only a minute fraction of Rad23p was expected to be bound to Png1p; this would make it difficult to observe co-migration of Png1p and Rad23p. For this reason, Png1p was overexpressed using a inducible GAL1 promoter in apng1Δ rad23Δ strain for this experiment (TSY190; for details of genotypes of strains, see “Experimental Procedures”). When both proteins were expressed, Png1p exhibited two peaks of activity, one corresponding to the higher molecular mass peak and one similar to bacterially expressed Png1p (Fig.4 A). FLAG-Rad23p was shown to co-migrate with the first peak and not with the second peak (Fig. 4,A and B). The proteasome was shown to be present in fractions 34–40 by activity assay as well as Western blotting using anti-Rpt1p antibody, showing that the first PNGase activity peak did not contain the proteasome complex (data not shown). When only Png1p was overexpressed in the absence of Rad23p (rad23Δ), the higher molecular weight peak was not detectable (data not shown; see also Fig. 3). When only Rad23p was overexpressed in the absence of Png1p (png1Δ), the elution position of Rad23p was shifted to a lower molecular weight (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that when Png1p was expressed, all of Rad23p detected co-migrated with Png1p. Having biochemical evidence that Png1p binds to Rad23p in yeast cytosol, we determined which domain of Rad23p was involved in interaction with Png1p using the two-hybrid assay. Deletion constructs of GAL4 activation domain-RAD23 were tested for binding against lexA-PNG1. As shown in TableII, deletion of N-terminal portions of Rad23p did not have a significant effect on its binding to Png1p. In sharp contrast, when the C-terminal region of Rad23p was truncated, no interaction with Png1p was observed. This result most likely suggested that the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) of Rad23p (see Fig. 2) was important for its binding to Png1p.Table IIMapping of interaction domains of the Rad23p to Png1p assessed by yeast two-hybrid assaypGAD424 constructsGrowth on SD minus histidine plateβ-Galactosidase assay 2-aNo color change on β-galactosidase assay; number of plus signs indicates the intensity of color on β-galactosidase assay.Rad23p-(1–398) (full-length)+++Rad23p-(77–398) (minus N terminus)++++Rad23p-(186–398)++++Rad23p-(218–398) 2-bThis plasmid was originally isolated from the pGAD library.++++Rad23p-(253–398)++Rad23p-(1–354) (minus C terminus)−−Rad23p-(1–317)−−Rad23p-(1–252)−−2-a No color change on β-galactosidase assay; number of plus signs indicates the intensity of color on β-galactosidase assay.2-b This plasmid was originally isolated from the pGAD library. Open table in a new tab Since Rad23p has been shown to require the N-terminal UbL for its interaction with the 26 S proteasome (24Schauber C. Chen L. Tonganonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), we assumed that Png1p might associate with the 26 S proteasome through Rad23p. To test this hypothesis, co-immunoprecipitation analysis with His6-tagged Png1p (Png1-His6p) and the GFP/HA-tagged 26 S proteasome subunit, Rpt1p, was carried out. The His6-tagged Png1p was expressed under the GAL1 promoter. The His6-tagged Png1p was shown to express enzyme activity (data not shown). The GFP/HA-tagged Rpt1p was previously shown to be integrated into a functional 26 S proteasome complex (31Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from cells expressing Png1-His6p with or without FLAG-Rad23p in png1Δ rad23Δ cells, and co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-His6 or anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, Png1p and Rpt1p co-immunoprecipitated considerably more than background level, which might represent nonspecific interaction of proteins with resin (compare lanes 1 and 3 withlanes 2 and 4). This interaction was observed only in the presence of Rad23p (Fig. 5; lanes 5 and 7). The fraction of Png1p-Rad23p bound to the 26 S proteasome under these experimental conditions was estimated to be 2–5% based on a comparison of intensity of a band detected by Western blotting of whole extract with the intensity of immunoprecipitate pulled down by Rpt1-GFP-HAp (data not shown). The C-terminal domain of Rad23p, identified above as a critical binding region to Png1p, was previously shown to be critical for the Rad23p-Rad4p interactions (44Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S.H. Wu X.

Exactly how v-Src interacts with these substrates remains unknown. One of its substrates, the adaptor protein Shc, is thought to play a crucial role during cellular transformation by v-Src by linking v-Src to Ras. We used Shc proteins with mutations in either the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) or Src homology 2 domain to determine that phosphorylation of Shc in v-Src-expressing cells depends on the presence of a functional PTB domain. We purified a 100-kDa Shc PTB-binding protein from Src-transformed cells that was identified as the β chain of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein LRP1. LRP1 acts as an import receptor for a variety of proteins and is involved in clearance of the β-amyloid precursor protein. This study shows that LRP1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells and that tyrosine-phosphorylated LRP1 binds in vivo and in vitro to Shc. The association between Shc and LRP1 may provide a mechanism for recruitment of Shc to the plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated by v-Src. It is at the membrane that Shc is thought to be involved in Ras activation. These observations further suggest that LRP1 could function as a signaling receptor and may provide new avenues to investigate its possible role during embryonal development and the onset of Alzheimer's disease. v-Src transforms fibroblasts in vitroand causes tumor formation in the animal by tyrosine phosphorylation of critical cellular substrates.

Protein-tyrosine kinases regulate cell division and differentiation in response to extracellular factors. Expression of constitutively active versions of these kinases results in cellular transformation in vitroand tumor formation in vivo (4Kolibaba K.S. Druker B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F217-F248PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-tyrosine kinases come in two varieties, receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases. Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain (5Hubbard S.R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Upon activation, receptors autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues thereby creating binding sites for phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)1 domain and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing signaling proteins. These proteins are activated directly or indirectly as a consequence of their interaction with the receptor (6Pawson T. Scott J.D.

In general, association with the receptor precedes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of receptor substrates (1Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev.

The extracellular ligand binding domain is missing from cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (8Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). They are often found associated with receptors that lack kinase domains themselves and are thought to function as signal transducing subunits for these receptors (9Bubeck-Wardenburg J. Wong J. Futterer K. Pappu R. Fu C. Waksman G. Chan A.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 373-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Curiously, most cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases also lack the autophosphorylation sites that act as binding sites for their substrates (8Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In some cases these sites are located on the associated non-kinase receptors (9Bubeck-Wardenburg J. Wong J. Futterer K. Pappu R.

In general, it remains to be established how activated cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases interact with their substrates. To address this issue, we have investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in v-Src-transformed cells. Shc is an adaptor protein that is involved in signal transduction by protein-tyrosine kinases (11Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F.

The shc gene encodes three proteins that all contain an amino-terminal PTB domain, a central region that contains several tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (11Pelicci G.

PTB domains bind to tyrosine residues in the context of an NPXY motif (14Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Margolis B. Borg J.P. Straight S. Meyer D. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Shc PTB domain binds to phosphorylated NPXY motifs preceded by a leucine, isoleucine, or valine residue five residues upstream of the phosphorylated tyrosine (16van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Shc SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the context of acidic or non-polar residues carboxyl-terminal to the tyrosine (17Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Shc function as binding sites for other signaling proteins. It is well established that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc binds to Grb2 (18Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 19van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is through the interaction with the Grb2-Sos complex that Shc is thought to be involved in activation of Ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (7Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Following activation of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor or the nerve growth factor receptor, Shc uses either its PTB or its SH2 domain to bind to specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites on the receptor. Binding to the receptor is a prerequisite for tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, and it is tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc that recruits the Grb2-Sos complex to the receptor at the inner leaf of the plasma membrane, in close proximity to Ras. v-Src is an activated version of the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase c-Src. Expression of v-Src results in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and in oncogenic transformation (20Levinson A.D. Oppermann H. Levontow L. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Cell. 1978; 15: 561-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 21Martin G.S. Nature. 1970; 227: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). v-Src is localized to cellular membranes through a myristyl group that is attached to its amino terminus (22Murray D. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Buser C.A. Tsang J. Sigal C.T. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Following its unique amino terminus Src contains an SH2 domain, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a protein-tyrosine kinase domain. The only well characterized autophosphorylation site in v-Src is present within its kinase domain and is known to regulate kinase activity (23Smart J.E. Opperman H. Czervlofsky A.P. Purchio A.F. Erikson R.L. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6013-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In the wild type protein the SH2 and the SH3 domain are involved in regulation of kinase activity (25Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 26Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). There are some reports that suggest that in addition the SH2 and SH3 domains may play a role in substrate selection. On the other hand, many Src mutants with inactive SH2 and SH3 domains have maintained their transforming ability (27Hirai H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that neither the SH2 domain nor the SH3 domain is necessary for the selection of substrates that are critical for cellular transformation. A large number of proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine in v-Src-transformed cells. It remains unresolved how these proteins are selected as substrates and which of these substrates mediate cellular transformation. Shc is highly phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells, and it is thought that it is Shc that mediates the Ras activation that occurs downstream of v-Src (13McGlade J. Cheng A. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8869-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, it is found that in v-Src-transformed cells Shc is associated with Grb-2 and Sos (28Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). v-Src itself does not bind to Shc, and it remains unclear exactly how v-Src selects Shc for tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, if Shc indeed mediates Ras activation it needs to recruit Grb2-Sos to the plasma membrane, and it remains unresolved how this is accomplished. To address some of these issues, we asked whether Shc relies on the presence of a functional PTB or SH2 domain for phosphorylation by v-Src. Our data show that Shc depends on a functional PTB domain for its phosphorylation in v-Src-expressing cells. The PTB domain binds to a 100-kDa protein that was purified and identified as the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein LRP1. LRP1 is a heterodimer that consists of a 500-kDa extracellular subunit that is non-covalently linked to a smaller (80–100 kDa) subunit. The small subunit contains an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. Two NPXY motifs are present in the cytoplasmic domain of LRP1. LRP1 is thought to function as an import receptor for a variety of proteins including apoE, α2-macroglobulin, and β-amyloid precursor protein (29Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The NPXY motifs were previously thought to mediate receptor internalization (30Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that at least one of the NPXY motifs present in LRP1 is involved in a signaling process that depends on protein phosphorylation and PTB domain containing signaling proteins.

The hybridoma 11H4 (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) was grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 mml-glutamine. A polyclonal anti-Shc serum was raised against a GST-Shc SH2 fusion protein. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 and anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and Babco (Richmond, CA). Wild type and mutant human Shc cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. A Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of protein synthesis and a sequence encoding the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) starting with a methionine were linked in frame by a sequence encoding 13 amino acids to the Shc cDNA starting at the first residue of the 52-kDa isoform. Mutants were generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy. Mutant fragments were sequenced to ensure fidelity and cloned back into the full-length cDNA. COS-1 cells were transfected at 50% confluency with 5 μg of HA-Shc cloned into pcDNA3 with or without 1 μg of v-src cloned into pECE; transfections were carried out using Lipofectin and Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were lysed 72 h after transfection. The GST-Shc PTB fusion protein contains residues 1–225 and the GST-Shc SH2 domain contains residues 387–473. Mutants were generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy. Mutant cDNA fragments were sequenced to ensure fidelity and cloned back into the pGEX constructs. Expression of fusion proteins was induced by incubation in the presence of 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for several hours at 30 °C. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%; insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-agarose. Glutathione-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 5 times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine. Fusion proteins were stored bound to beads at 4 °C in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.02% sodium azide, and 10% glycerol. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were excised and digested in the gel as described previously (33Shevchenko A. Chernushevich I. Ens W. Standing K.G. Thomson B. Wilm M. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 34Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7816) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were reduced by incubating with 10 mm DTT and alkylated using 50 mm iodoacetamide. Digestion was performed with trypsin at 37 °C, and resulting peptides were extracted from the gel using ammonium bicarbonate, acetonitrile, and formic acid. Samples were dried and desalted using Millipore ZipTips prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Sciex QSTAR mass spectrometer (MDS-Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada), and data were analyzed using PeptideSearch. Cells were grown to subconfluence on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmMgCl2 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 500 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (PLC lysis buffer) per 10-cm tissue culture dish. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, incubated with 5 μl of polyclonal antiserum or 1 μg of monoclonal antibody for 1 h on ice, and subsequently for 1 h with 100 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose or anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C on an agitator. Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with PLC lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were boiled 3 min in 62.5 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm DTT, 2.3% SDS, and 0.025% bromphenol blue (SDS sample buffer) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. RIPA (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) lysates were cleared by incubation with excess Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and centrifugation for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. To disrupt previously formed protein-protein complexes, cells from a 10-cm tissue culture dish were collected and boiled for 3 min in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. After boiling the lysates were diluted in 800 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. Boiled lysates were cleared by incubation with excess Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and centrifugation for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. For in vitro binding studies, fibroblast cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker with 10 μl of glutathione-agarose beads containing 1–2 μg of fusion protein. Beads were washed 4 times with PLC lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cells were lysed by swelling in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate) on ice and by Dounce homogenization. Crude membranes for protein purification were isolated by centrifugation for 45 min at 25000 × g at 4 °C. For separation into soluble and membrane-bound fractions, nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 × g at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Bio-Rad semi-dry blotting apparatus at 50 mA per gel for 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% dried milk and incubated with 1:200 dilution of polyclonal antisera in TBST 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed twice for 10 min with TBST and twice for 5 min with 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl (TBS). Membranes were then incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-protein A or horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST and washed as before. Reactive proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) serum, membranes were blocked with TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin followed by an incubation with the antiserum diluted in TBST 5% bovine serum albumin. Washes and detection were done exactly as described for other antisera. The Shc adaptor protein is a major substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation in v-Src-transformed cells (13McGlade J. Cheng A. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8869-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It has, however, remained poorly defined exactly how Shc and Src interact. To address this question we developed HA-tagged versions of the 52-kDa isoform of Shc with inactivating mutations in either the PTB (M175) or the SH2 (M401) domain (Fig. 1). These mutant domains have lost the ability to bind with high affinity to their binding sites. A wild type version and a version with mutations in both domains were used as controls (2M) (Fig.2). To test whether Shc depends on either its PTB domain or its SH2 domain for phosphorylation by v-Src, the HA-tagged mutants were expressed transiently together with v-Src in COS-1 cells. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) and anti-Shc immunoblotting. The data indicate that v-Src phosphorylates wild type Shc or Shc that lacks a functional SH2 domain (Fig. 2 A). Mutation of the PTB domain completely blocks Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in v-Src-transformed cells (comparelanes 2 and 3 or 4 and 5 in Fig. 2 A). Mutation of the SH2 domain results in a small decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation. The various Shc proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2 B). We have shown that Shc does not bind directly to Src. 2H. Barnes and P. van der Geer, unpublished observations. These observations suggest that Shc uses its PTB domain to bind to an unidentified protein before it can be phosphorylated by v-Src.Figure 2Shc depends on a functional PTB domain for phosphorylation by the v-Src protein-tyrosine kinase. Wild type or mutant HA-tagged Shc proteins were expressed transiently together with v-Src in COS-1 cells. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) (A) and anti-Shc (B) immunoblotting. COS-1 cells were transfected with v-Src and a control vector,lane 1; v-Src and wild type HA-Shc, lane 2; v-Src and M175 HA-Shc, lane 3; v-Src and M401 HA-Shc, lane 4; v-Src and 2M HA-Shc, lane 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate further the role of the PTB domain during phosphorylation of Shc in v-Src-transformed cells, we used GST fusion proteins containing the PTB domain (Fig. 1) to look for the presence of PTB domain binding proteins. Cell lysates of Src-transformed fibroblasts (14.30S3) were incubated with fusion proteins that were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, and bound proteins were analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) blotting. As a control, lysates of Ras-transformed fibroblasts (14.30R1) were also incubated with these fusion proteins. Shc immunoprecipitates were analyzed in parallel. This experiment confirms that Shc is highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in Src-transformed cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of all three isoforms of Shc (p46, p52 and p66) can be detected (Fig.3, lane 4). Several unidentified, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are present in Shc immunoprecipitates from Src-transformed cells (Fig. 3, lane 4). As expected, Shc is not tyrosine-phosphorylated or associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Ras-transformed cells (Fig. 3,lanes 1–3). Several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins present in lysates of Src-transformed cells were able to bind to either the PTB or the SH2 domain of Shc (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and6). Most of these proteins also appeared to be present in the Shc immunoprecipitate, suggesting that they represent true Shc-interacting proteins. Since Shc depends on its PTB domain for phosphorylation by v-Src, we focused on a 100-kDa protein (p100) that was present in Shc immunoprecipitates and that co-migrates with a protein that bound to the PTB domain (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and5). P100 did not bind to the GST-SH2 domain fusion protein. To find out whether p100 is truly a specific Shc-PTB domain binding protein we tested the ability of an inactive GST-Shc PTB domain fusion protein to bind to p100 (Fig. 4). In addition, Shc immunoprecipitates from Src-transformed cells lysed either in PLC lysis buffer, in RIPA, or by boiling in 0.5% SDS were tested for the presence of p100 (Fig. 4). PLC lysis buffer is a mild lysis buffer that contains 1.0% Triton X-100. RIPA is a more stringent lysis buffer that contains 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. During boiling lysis all proteins are denatured by boiling in a small volume of 0.5% SDS, and the lysate is subsequently diluted in RIPA without SDS. Protein-protein interactions that depend on the presence of functional protein-protein interaction domains are broken up. The data show that mutation of Arg-175 in the phosphotyrosine-binding site to Met results in a loss of p100 binding (Fig. 4, lane 1). Furthermore, most proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with Shc in PLC lysis buffer or RIPA, including p100, are lost upon boiling of the lysate (Fig. 4, lane 5). These data indicate that p100 specifically binds to Shc in v-Src-transformed cells and that binding depends on the presence of a functional PTB domain. To find out where in the cell p100 is localized, v-Src-transformed cells were lysed by swelling in hypotonic lysis buffer and Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the lysate was separated into a soluble and a particulate fraction by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Both fractions were suspended in PLC lysis buffer and tested for the presence of PTB-binding proteins by incubation with the immobilized fusion protein. p100 was found to be present in the particulate fraction (Fig. 5 A). This experiment indicates that p100 is associated with cellular membranes. In parallel, we have analyzed Shc immune precipitates and found that 20–30% of cellular Shc is present in the particulate fraction in v-Src-transformed cells (Fig. 5 B). In order to establish its identity, p100 was purified from membranes of v-Src-transformed S7A cells based on its ability to bind to the PTB domain. To increase recovery of p100, cells were treated before lysis with orthovanadate and peroxide, which inhibit cellular protein-tyrosine phosphatases. In a mid-sized experiment, membranes obtained from 2 × 108 cells were resuspended in 20 ml of PLC lysis buffer and incubated batchwise with ∼2 mg of GST-PTB fusion protein immobilized on 100 μl of glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed, poured into a small column, and bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm triethylamine at pH 11.5. Six 50-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) blotting (Fig. 6 A). Tyrosine-phosphorylated p100 was eluted efficiently from the PTB column. As a control, the purification was repeated with the inactive M175 mutant GST-PTB fusion protein, and the peak fractions eluted from the PTB and M175 PTB column were compared by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting and silver staining (Fig. 6, B and C). No p100 could be detected when the M175 PTB domain was used (Fig. 6,B and C). A silver-stainable band with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa was present in the material eluted from the PTB column (Fig. 6 C). As expected, this band was missing in the material eluted from the M175 mutant PTB column. To obtain sufficient material for identification of p100, the purification was scaled up 5-fold. Approximately 100 ng of p100 was purified and digested with trypsin, and fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Several fragments were selected for fra"

RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cells expressed and secreted) is a CC chemokine which recruits and activates monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, all cell types present in the lung inflammatory infiltrate induced by RSV infection. In this study we investigated the role of reactive oxygen species in the induction of RANTES gene expression in human type II alveolar epithelial cells (A549), following RSV infection. Our results indicate that RSV infection of airway epithelial cells rapidly induces reactive oxygen species production, prior to RANTES expression, as measured by oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein. Pretreatment of airway epithelial cells with the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), as well a panel of chemically unrelated antioxidants, blocks RSV-induced RANTES gene expression and protein secretion. This effect is mediated through the ability of BHA to inhibit RSV-induced interferon regulatory factor binding to the RANTES promoter interferon-stimulated responsive element, that is absolutely required for inducible RANTES promoter activation. BHA inhibits de novo interferon regulator factor (IRF)-1 and -7 gene expression and protein synthesis, and IRF-3 nuclear translocation. Together, these data indicates that a redox-sensitive pathway is involved in RSV-induced IRF activation, an event necessary for RANTES gene expression.

McCarthy C.A. Mandel G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingston, New York1995Google Scholar). Since its isolation, RSV has been identified as a leading cause of epidemic respiratory tract illness in children in the United States and worldwide. In fact, RSV is so ubiquitous that it will infect 100% of children before the age of 3. It is estimated that 40–50% of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and 25% of children with pneumonia are infected with RSV, resulting in 100,000 hospital admissions annually in the United States alone (1Hall C.B. McCarthy C.A. Mandel G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingston, New York1995Google Scholar). In addition to acute morbidity, there are long-term consequences of RSV infection in infancy: RSV has been shown to predispose to the development of hyperreactive airway disease (2Webb M.S.C. Henry R.L. Milner A.D. Arch. Dis. Child. 1985; 60: 1064-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and recurrent episodes of wheezing in asthmatic children are often precipitated by RSV infection. The mechanisms of RSV-induced airway disease and its long-term consequences are largely unknown, but the delicate balance between immunopathology and immunoprotection in the airway mucosa may be altered by an exuberant and unwanted local inflammatory response. Airway infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes is typical of RSV infection (1Hall C.B. McCarthy C.A. Mandel G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingston, New York1995Google Scholar), and activation of eosinophil and basophil leukocytes has been shown to correlate with the severity of acute RSV disease (3Garofalo R.P. Welliver R.C. Ogra P.L. Pediatr. Allergy Immunol. 1991; 2: 30-37Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Garofalo R.P. Kimpen J.L.L. Welliver R.C. Ogra P.L. J. Pediatrics. 1992; 120: 28-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The composition of the cellular response at sites of tissue inflammation is controlled by gradients of chemokines, a family of small chemotactic cytokines, which direct leukocyte transendothelial migration and movement through the extracellular matrix. RANTES is a CC chemokine highly chemoattractant for T lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils (5Alam R. Stafford S. Forsythe P. Harrison R. Faubion D. Lett-Brown M.A. Grant J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3442-3448PubMed Google Scholar), all cell types which are present or activated in the inflammatory infiltrate that follows RSV infection of the lung. Recent in vivo studies have shown elevated RANTES concentrations in nasal washes and bronchoalveolar lavages of children infected with RSV (6Teran L.M. Seminario M.C. Shute J.K. Papi A. Compton S.J.

Ramilio M.O. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1999; 18: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and we have recently shown that RANTES is strongly expressed in RSV-infected respiratory epithelial cells (8Saito T. Deskin R.W. Casola A. Haeberle H. Olszewska B. Ernst P.B. Alam R. Ogra P.L. Garofalo R. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Casola A. Saito T. Alam R. Crowe S.E. Mei F. Ogra P.L. Garofalo R.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4756-4764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are the primary target for viral infection. Therefore, it is likely that RANTES produced by infected epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of RSV-induced airway inflammation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are ubiquitous, highly diffusable and reactive molecules produced as a result of reduction of molecular oxygen, including species such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical, and they have been implicated in damaging cellular components like lipids, proteins, and DNA. In the past few years, there has been increased recognition of their role as redox regulators of cellular signaling (reviewed in Refs. 10Allen R.G. Tresini M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar and 11Prasad Gabbita S. Robinson K.A. Stewart C.A. Floyd R.A. Hensley K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 1-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Inducible ROS generation has been shown following stimulation with a variety of molecules, like cytokines and growth factors, and infection with certain viruses, like HIV, hepatitis B, and influenza (reviewed in Ref. 12Schwarz K.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Changes in the level of ROS, generated in response to some of these stimuli, have been shown to modulate the expression of several genes (10Allen R.G. Tresini M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Among the different members of the chemokine family, interleukin (IL)-8 is the only one for which redox-sensitive signaling pathways have been identified (13Simeonova P.P. Leonard S. Flood L. Shi X. Luster M.I. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1027-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 14DeForge L.E. Preston A.M. Takeuchi E. Kenney J. Boxer L.A. Remick D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25568-25576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of ROS in RANTES gene expression, as well as in other CC chemokine induction, has not been defined yet. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of RSV infection on ROS generation in human airway epithelial cells and the role of ROS in RSV-induced RANTES production. Our results indicate that RSV infection of airway epithelial cells induces ROS production, as measured by intracellular oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein, and that treatment of airway epithelial cells with the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), as well as a panel of chemically unrelated antioxidants, blocks RSV-induced RANTES protein secretion and gene expression. This effect is mediated through the inhibition of RSV-induced interferon regulatory factor (IRF) binding to the RANTES interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), an event that is absolutely required for RSV-stimulated RANTES gene transcription. In infected A549 cells, ISRE binds IRF-1, -3, and -7. IRF-1 and -7 are inducible upon RSV infection of alveolar epithelial cells and treatment with BHA inhibits their gene expression and protein synthesis. In contrast, IRF-3 is constitutively expressed and antioxidant treatment blocks its nuclear translocation. These data strongly indicate that a redox-sensitive pathway is involved in RSV-induced IRF induction and RANTES gene expression. This study provides novel insights on the role of ROS in viral-induced RANTES secretion and IRF protein activation. Identification of the molecular mechanisms involved in RANTES gene expression is fundamental for developing strategies to modulate the inflammatory response associated with RSV infection of the lung. The human Long strain of RSV (A2) was grown in Hep-2 cells and purified by centrifugation on discontinuous sucrose gradients as described elsewhere (15Ueba O. Acta Med. Okayama. 1978; 32: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). The virus titer of the purified RSV pools was 8–9 log10 plaque forming units/ml using a methylcellulose plaque assay. No contaminating cytokines were found in these sucrose-purified viral preparations (16Patel J.A. Kunimoto M. Sim T.C. Garofalo R. Eliott T. Baron S. Ruuskanen O. Chonmaitree T. Ogra P.L. Schmalstieg F. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. 1995; 13: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide, assayed using the limulus hemocyanin agglutination assay, was not detected. Virus pools were aliquoted, quick-frozen on dry ice/alcohol, and stored at −70 °C until used. A549, human alveolar type II-like epithelial cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were maintained in F12K medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Small alveolar epithelial cells (SAE) were obtained from Clonetics, San Diego, CA, and grown according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell monolayers were infected with RSV at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 (unless otherwise stated), as described (17Garofalo R.P. Sabry M. Jamaluddin M., Yu, R.K. Casola A. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8773-8781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An equivalent amount of a 20% sucrose solution was added to uninfected A549 cells, as a control. For the antioxidant experiments, cells were pretreated with the antioxidants for 1 h and then infected in the presence of the antioxidants. Since BHA was diluted in ethanol, equal amounts of ethanol were added to untreated cells, as a control. Total number of cells, cell viability, and viral replication, following antioxidant treatment, were measured by trypan blue exclusion and by plaque assay, respectively. Immunoreactive RANTES was quantitated by a double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (DuoSet, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was extracted from control and infected A549 cells by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method (18Salkind A.R. Nichols J.E. Roberts Jr., N.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of RNA were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to a radiolabeled RANTES, IRF-1, -3, and -7 cDNAs (RANTES cDNA plasmid was a generous gift of Dr A. Krensky, Stanford, CA; IRF-1, -3, and -7 cDNAs were a generous gift of Dr. Lin, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), as previously described (19Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hybridization temperature for all probes was 55 °C. After washing, membranes were exposed for autoradiography using Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C, using intensifying screens. After exposure, membranes were stripped and rehybridized with a β-actin probe. A549 cells were grown in 96-well tissue culture plates and infected with RSV at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). At different times post-infection, cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and loaded with 10 μm 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) in Hank's balanced salt solution medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice and fluorescence intensity was determined at 485 nm excitation and 590 nm emission, using an automated fluorescence reader (Flurocount, Hewlett-Packard Instruments, IL). For the experiments in which H2O2 was used as a stimulus for ROS production, cells were preloaded with 10 μm DCF-DA for 30 min, washed, and then fluorescence intensity was measured at different times following addition of H2O2. Measurements were performed in triplicates and results expressed as fluorescence mean ± S.D. of n = 3 independent experiments. A fragment of the human RANTES promoter spanning from −220 to +55 nucleotides (nt), relative to the mRNA start site designated +1 was cloned into the luciferase reporter gene vector pGL2 (Promega, Madison, WI) and defined as pGL2-220. Site mutations of the RANTES ISRE in the context of pGL2-220 plasmid were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using the following upstream and downstream mutagenic primers (mutations in lowercases): 5′-CATATTTCAGTaaaCTaaaCCGT-3′ and 3′-TATAAAGTCAtttGAtttGGCAT-5′. Logarithmically growing A549 cells were transfected in triplicate in 60-mm Petri dishes by DEAE-dextran, as previously described (20Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in 2 ml of HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 20 μl of 60 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) premixed with 6 μg of RANTES-pGL2 plasmids and 1 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase internal control plasmid. After 3 h, media was removed and 0.5 ml of 10% (v/v) Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline was added to the cells for 2 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured overnight in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The next morning, cells were infected with RSV and at 24 h post-infection cells were lysed to measure independently luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter activity, as previously described (20Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Luciferase was normalized to the internal control β-galactosidase activity. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Nuclear extracts of uninfected and infected A549 cells were prepared using hypotonic/nonionic detergent lysis, as previously described (20Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Proteins were normalized by protein assay (Protein Reagent, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and used to bind to a duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to the RANTES ISRE, whose sequences is shown: 5′-GATCCATATTTCAGTTTTCTTTTCCGT-3′, 3′-TATAAAGTCAAAAGAAAAGGCATCTAG-5′. DNA-binding reactions contained 10–15 μg of nuclear proteins, 5% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 40,000 cpm of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in a total volume of 20 μl. The nuclear proteins were incubated with the probe for 15 min at room temperature and then fractionated by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) in TBE buffer (22 mm Tris-HCl, 22 mm boric acid, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8). After electrophoretic separation, gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography using Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C using intensifying screens. Microaffinity purification of proteins binding to the RANTES ISRE was performed using a two-step biotinylated DNA-streptavidin capture assay (20Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this assay, duplex oligonucleotides are chemically synthesized containing 5′-biotin on a flexible linker (Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). Four hundred micrograms of 12-h infected A549 cells nuclear extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 50 pmol of biotin ISRE, in the absence or presence of 10-fold molar excess of non-biotinylated ISRE wild type (WT) or mutated (MUT). The binding buffer contained 8 μg of poly(dI-dC) (as nonspecific competitor) and 5% (v/v) glycerol, 12 mmHEPES, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 0.5 mm EDTA. One hundred microliters of a 50% slurry of pre-washed streptavidin-agarose beads was then added to the sample, and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 20 min with gentle rocking. Pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of binding buffer, and the washed pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE buffer, boiled, and fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis separation, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. Total cell lysates and cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were prepared as previously described, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (20Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% albumin in TBS-Tween and incubated overnight with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to IRF-1, -3, and -7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For secondary detection, we used a horseradish-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody in the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL). Data from experiments involving multiple samples subject to each treatment were analyzed by the Student Newman Keuls t test for multiple pairwise comparisons. Results were considered significantly different at a p value <0.05. To determine whether RSV infection induced ROS production, A549 cells were grown to ∼90% of confluency and infected with RSV. At different time points after infection, cells were loaded with the membrane permeable compound 2′,7′-DCF-DA, which is trapped intracellularly following cleavage by cellular esterases. DCF oxidation was measured by changes in mean fluorescence intensity in control versus infected cells (21Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 27: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,22Marchesi E. Rota C. Fann Y.C. Chignell C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When cells were infected with m.o.i. of 1, the production of ROS was detectable as early as 2 h post-infection, reaching a plateau around 4 h and declining thereafter, although the level of cellular ROS in infected cells was still higher than in control cells at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1). When cells were infected with a lower multiplicity of infection, such as 0.1 and 0.5, the kinetic of ROS production was delayed of a few hours, reaching a plateau between 6 and 8 h post-infection, reflecting the lower number of cells infected at the earliest time points. We have recently demonstrated that RSV is a potent stimulus for RANTES production in cultured human nasal, bronchial, and alveolar epithelial cells (8Saito T. Deskin R.W. Casola A. Haeberle H. Olszewska B. Ernst P.B. Alam R. Ogra P.L. Garofalo R. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Casola A. Saito T. Alam R. Crowe S.E. Mei F. Ogra P.L. Garofalo R.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4756-4764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all epithelial cell types, synthesis of RANTES required replicating virus and was dose- and time-dependent, with increased steady state levels of RANTES mRNA observed between 6 and 12 h after infection (8Saito T. Deskin R.W. Casola A. Haeberle H. Olszewska B. Ernst P.B. Alam R. Ogra P.L. Garofalo R. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,9Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Casola A. Saito T. Alam R. Crowe S.E. Mei F. Ogra P.L. Garofalo R.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4756-4764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of RSV-induced ROS generation in RANTES secretion, A549 cells were infected with RSV in the absence or presence of the chemically unrelated antioxidants dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), N-acetyl·cystein (NAC), tetramethyl thiourea (TMTU), and butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA). In preliminary studies different concentrations of antioxidants were used to identify the most effective ones in inhibiting RANTES secretion (data not shown). We found that 2% (v/v) Me2SO, 20 mmNAC, 20 mm TMTU, and 400 μm BHA were sufficient to significantly block RSV-induced RANTES production, with BHA being the most effective (Fig. 2,panel A). To confirm these results in a normal cell type, similar experiments were performed in SAE cells infected with RSV. SAE cells are derived from the small bronchioli of the lung and they show a similar pattern of RANTES induction, following RSV infection, compared with A549 cells (9Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Casola A. Saito T. Alam R. Crowe S.E. Mei F. Ogra P.L. Garofalo R.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4756-4764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in A549 cells, the antioxidants TMTU, NAC, and BHA significantly reduced RSV-induced RANTES production (Fig. 2,panel B), suggesting that indeed inducible RANTES secretion is regulated in a redox-sensitive manner. Antioxidant treatment did not significantly affect cell viability or viral replication (data not shown). Since BHA was the most effective compound in reducing RSV-induced RANTES secretion in both A549 and SAE cells, we selected this antioxidant to perform all the subsequent experiments. To directly confirm the ability of BHA to inhibit ROS, A549 cells were stimulated with 200 μm H2O2 in the absence or presence of 400 μm BHA and the amount of cellular ROS was monitored by oxidation of 2′7′-DCF. As shown in Fig.3, H2O2 was able to induce a high level of ROS production, which was almost completely inhibited by treatment with BHA. These data indicate that BHA function as a potent antioxidant in airway epithelial cells. To determine if the reduction in RSV-induced RANTES secretion by BHA was paralled by changes in the steady-state level of RANTES mRNA, A549 cells were infected with RSV for various lenghts of time, in the absence or presence of the antioxidant, and total RNA was extracted from control and infected cells for Northern blot analysis. A small increase in RANTES mRNA expression was first detected at 6 h post-infection, with maximal induction between 12 and 24 h (Fig.4). There was no further increase in mRNA levels at later time points (data not shown). Treatment with 400 μm BHA completely inhibited RSV-induced RANTES mRNA induction at 6 and 12 h post-infection and greatly reduced it at 24 h (Fig. 4). This dramatic change was not due to a nonspecific effect since total cell number and viability in the group treated with antioxidant were unchanged (data not shown) and levels of the housekeeping gene β-actin were not systematically reduced compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4). Inducible RANTES gene expression is controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (23Koga T. Sardina E. Tidwell R.M. Pelletier M. Look D.C. Holtman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5680-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Nelson P.J. Kim H.T. Manning W.c. Goralski T.J. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2601-2612PubMed Google Scholar, 25Boehlk S.

We have previously shown that in A549 cells RSV-induced RANTES promoter activation mirrors the induction of the endogenous RANTES gene mRNA, suggesting that in alveolar epithelial cells RANTES expression, following RSV infection, is controlled mainly at the level of transcription. 2A. Casola, R. P. Garofalo, H. Haeberle, T. F. Elliott, M. Jamaluddin and A. R. Brasier,J. Virol. (in press). To determine whether the antioxidant effect of BHA influenced RANTES gene transcription, A549 cells were transiently transfected with a construct containing the first 220 nucleotides of the human RANTES promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene, defined as pGL2-220. This fragment of the promoter contains all the necessary regulatory elements that drive regulated luciferase expression in A549 cells following RSV infection.2 The day after, cells were infected with RSV for 24 h in the absence or presence of BHA. Similar to what we have observed for mRNA levels, treatment with BHA almost completely abolished RSV-induced luciferase activity (Fig.5), indicating that the antioxidant effect occurs mainly by interfering with RANTES gene transcription. We have recently investigated the promotercis-regulatory elements and nuclear factors involved in the regulation of RANTES gene transcription following RSV infection of human airway epithelial cells. The results of that study have indicated that RSV-induced RANTES transcription requires cooperation of multiple response elements, including the ISRE.2 The ISRE is absolutely required for RSV-induced promoter activation, since its mutation completely blocks RSV-induced luciferase activity (Fig.6). To determine if BHA-induced inhibition of RANTES transcription was due to changes in the abundance of DNA-binding proteins recognizing the RANTES ISRE, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts prepared from A549 cells control or infected with RSV for 12 h, in the absence or presence of BHA. As shown in Fig.7, RSV infection induced a dramatic increase in ISRE binding, which was completely abolished by treatment with BHA.Figure 7Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of RANTES ISRE binding complexes in response to antioxidant treatment. Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and cells infected with RSV for 12 h, in the absence or presence of 400 μm BHA, and used for binding to the RANTES ISRE in electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Pitha P. Genin P. Nguyen H. Heylbroeck C. Mamane Y. Algarte M. Lin R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that RSV infection of A549 cells induces de novo synthesis of IRF-1 (20Casola A. Garofalo R.P. Jamaluddin M. Vlahopoulos S. Brasier A.R. J.

To determine if RSV infection of A549 cells induced IRF-7 synthesis and IRF-3 activation, we performed Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins extracted from A549 cells uninfected or infected for various lengths of time.

To study how this conjugation pathway is regulated, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening by using NEDD8 as a bait and isolated a cDNA fragment encoding a potent down-regulator of the NEDD8 expression. Here, we report this novel regulator, NUB1 (NEDD8Ultimate Buster-1). NUB1 is composed of 601 residues with a calculated 69.1-kDa molecular mass. It is an interferon-inducible protein and predominantly localized in the nucleus. The NUB1 message is specifically expressed in adult human testis, ovary, heart, and skeletal muscle tissues and is developmentally down-regulated in mouse embryos. In biochemical analysis, we found that NUB1 overexpression leads to severe reduction of NEDD8 monomer and NEDD8 conjugates in cells. This reduction is not due to down-regulation of NEDD8 transcription, but due to post-transcriptional mechanism. As expected from this activity, overexpression of NUB1 had a profound growth-inhibitory effect on U2OS cells. Thus, NUB1 is a strong down-regulator of the NEDD8 expression and appears to play critical roles in regulating biological events, including cell growth.AF300717 NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, covalently conjugates to cullin family members.

These proteins share a common distinction; the mature form is always translated in precursor form, with one or more amino acids following a Gly-Gly dipeptide that forms the C terminus of the mature protein (10Yeh E.T.H. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In the NEDD8-conjugation process, the C-terminal tail of the precursor protein is cleaved off by a C-terminal hydrolase, such as UCH-L3 (11Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The mature form has been shown to conjugate to a large number of nuclear proteins (1Kamitani T. Kito K.

The pathway of NEDD8 conjugation is thought to be catalyzed by three enzymes, termed E1 (NEDD8-activating), E2 (NEDD8-conjugating), and E3 (NEDD8-ligating), in a manner analogous to ubiquitination and sentrinization (10Yeh E.T.H.

All known NEDD8 targets in mammalian cells are cullin (Cul)1 family members, including Cul-1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, and -5 (14Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M.

Human Cul-1 is a major component of ubiquitin ligase, known as an SCF complex that catalyzes the ubiquitination of IκBα, “”β“”-catenin, and p27 (Kip1) (16Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterluety H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W.

Interestingly, the NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-1 is required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of the SCF complex containing Cul-1 (19Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A.

Thus, NEDD8 conjugation seems to be involved in many important biological functions, including NFκB signaling and cell-cycle regulation by p27, and must be strictly regulated. However, the regulation system of NEDD8-conjugation is still unclear, with the exception of the recent discovery of USP21, a novel isopeptidase for NEDD8-conjugated proteins (21Gong L. Kamitani T.

To define the unknown regulators of NEDD8 conjugation, the yeast two-hybrid system was applied in this study. From library screening, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel NEDD8-interacting protein, NUB1. Here, we report NUB1 as a strong down-regulator of the NEDD8 expression.

The sequence of each cDNA was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into mammalian cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfected cells were processed for immunostaining, Western blotting, or Northern blotting 20 h after transfection. Yeast strain L40 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Prey vector pGAD10 was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The bait plasmid pHybLex/HA-NEDD8-GG (11Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was transformed into L40 using the lithium acetate method (6Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.-F. Chang H.-M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were plated on YPD medium containing adenosine and Zeocin (YPAD/Zeo) and selected for 2 days at 30 °C. The L40 clone carrying pHybLex/HA-NEDD8-GG was cultured in YPAD/Zeo medium and sequentially transformed with 500 “μ”g of human heart cDNA (CLONTECH) fused to GAL4 DNA-activating domain vector, pGAD10. The transformed cells were incubated for 6 days at 30 °C on selection plates (Ura−, Lys−, His−, Leu−, and Zeocin+). The positive colonies were picked and replated on selection plates (Ura−, Lys−, His−, Leu−, and Zeocin+) and assayed for “”β“”-galactosidase activity on filter papers as described in the protocol ofCLONTECH. Domain search of NUB1 was performed by using several research tools as described below (all three programs are available via the World Wide Web). Coiled coil regions and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains were determined by the SMART program. Bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) was determined by the ProfileScan program. PEST sequence was determined by the PESTfind program. To demonstrate specificity of the immunoreactivity to NUB1, rabbit antiserum against GST-NUB1432–601 was preabsorbed with either GST or GST-NUB1432–601 and used for Western blot analysis as a primary antibody. For this preabsorption, 1 ml of diluted anti-NUB1 antiserum (1:1000) was incubated overnight with GST or GST-NUB1432–601 fusion protein-coated beads. After the incubation, the beads were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered, diluted to 1:10,000 with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1“%” Tween 20, containing 1“%” skim milk, and used for Western blot analysis. Protein samples were treated at 45 °C for 1 h in 150 “μ”l of 2“%” SDS treating solution containing 5“%” “”β“”-mercaptoethanol. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting was performed using the protocol provided with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies against mouse IgG or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Immunocytochemical staining was performed by the avidin-biotin-HRP complex (ABC-HRP) method (23Kamitani T. Suzuki H. Yano S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), using the Vectastain ABC kit system (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Transfected HeLa cells on a coverslip were fixed in 3.7“%” paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.1“%” Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.1“%” H2O2 for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and then washed with PBS. The cells were incubated for 10 min with PBS containing 5“%” horse serum for blocking, followed by additional incubation with anti-HA antibody (16B12) for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and treated with the ABC reagent (avidin-biotin-HRP complex) for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the enzymatic disclosing procedure was performed as reported previously (23Kamitani T. Suzuki H. Yano S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To study the level of NUB1 message in various human tissues and mouse embryos, Northern blotting was performed. Fragments of human NUB1 and NEDD8 cDNAs were cut out from pcDNA3/RH-NUB1 or pcDNA3/HA-NEDD8 (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), respectively. The fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radioactive probe was hybridized with two human multiple tissue Northern blots and a mouse embryo multiple tissue Northern blot purchased fromCLONTECH. To examine message induction by human IFN-“”β“”, Northern blotting was performed using nonradioactive probes. HeLa cells were cultured with or without human IFN-“”β“” (Calbiochem) in 6-cm dishes, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equal amounts of RNA (16 “μ”g) were resolved on a 1“%” agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by alkaline-cross-linking. As probes, fragments (400 bp) of NUB1 and GAPDH cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and purified by a Qiagen II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). These fragments were labeled with alkaline phosphatase by cross-linker using the AlkPhos Dilect system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After prehybridization for 1 h and hybridization with alkaline phosphatase-labeled probe overnight at 55 °C, the blots were washed five times. The signal was detected by the chemiluminescent method using CDP-Star (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To detect the message level of epitope-tagged protein in transfectants, Northern blot analysis was performed using a 32P-labeled oligo encoding epitope tag as a probe. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) from COS-M6 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1“%” agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes for HA tag (39 mer oligo: GATCCGCTAGCGTAATCCGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATA) and RGS-His tag (36 mer oligo: GATCCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCTCATA) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The probe for “”β“”-actin (2.0-kb human cDNA) was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes were hybridized to the membrane in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) and washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1“%” SDS. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C. The membrane was repeatedly hybridized with other probes after removing the previous probe. Cell growth assay was performed as described previously (22Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17008-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). U2OS cells (1.0 × 105) were plated in a 6-cm dish and transfected by FuGENE 6 (Roche) with 5 “μ”g of control empty pcDNA3 vector, pcDNA3/RH-NUB1, or pcDNA3/RH-Ubc12(C111S). After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with fresh medium containing 10“%” fetal calf serum and 0.6 mg/ml G418. The medium was changed every 2 days. Nine days after transfection, drug-resistant cells were harvested and counted. The data were analyzed for statistical differences by Fisher's protected least significant difference method. To identify NEDD8-interacting proteins, we screened ∼1 × 106 primary library transformants as reported previously (11Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A total of 450 colonies grew on the selection plates, 18 of which stained positive when tested for “”β“”-galactosidase expression. Subsequent analysis of DNA sequencing indicated that 7 of the 18 clones encoded human UCH-L3 (11Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, 1 of the 18 clones turned out to be a human homologue of mouse BS4 (GenBank accession no. U27462.1). Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated 3,113 bp of cDNA from a human heart cDNA library (Fig.1 A). This cDNA encodes a predicted 69.1-kDa protein of 601 amino acids. Multiple termination codons were found in the other two reading frames. The ATG initiation codon was contained within a nearly perfect Kozak consensus sequence, which is necessary for efficient translation (25Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A presumptive polyadenylation signal was found 28 bp upstream from the 3′ end of the cDNA. A BLAST search of the entire data base through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) showed that this predicted protein was 76.9“%” identical to mouse BS4 in amino acid sequence, indicating that the protein is a human homologue of mouse BS4. Since this protein negatively regulates the NEDD8 expression as described below, we designated this protein as NUB1 (NEDD8Ultimate Buster-1), and its cDNA sequence was submitted to GenBank (accession no. AF300717). Although the cDNA sequence of mouse BS4 was registered in GenBank, we could not find any publication on its biological function in the Medline data base. Thus, the function of proteins NUB1 and BS4 was totally unknown. To predict the protein function, we searched consensus sequences or domains in NUB1 by using several research tools in Web sites. As shown in Fig. 1 B, there were two coiled coil regions at the N-terminal side of NUB1. The first coiled coil region was located from Leu-36 to Ala-67. The second coiled coil region was located from Val-155 to Thr-203. At the C-terminal side of NUB1, there were two UBAs, a bipartite NLS and a PEST sequence. The first UBA domain was located from Asp-376 to Asn-413. The second UBA domain was located from Ser-477 to His-514. The UBA domain has been reported to occur in subsets of the ubiquitin-conjugation enzymes (E2), ubiquitin ligases (E3), and deubiquitinating enzymes (26Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Between these two UBA domains, a bipartite NLS was located from Arg-414 to Arg-431. Finally, a PEST sequence (27Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) was located from His-514 to His-568. Based on the domain search data, we predicted that NUB1 was a nuclear protein and its turnover was rapid because of the PEST motif. To characterize protein expression of NUB1 in human cell lines, rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for NUB1 was generated. The expression of NUB1 was surveyed in 12 different human cell lines and COS cells by Western blotting. The antiserum was preabsorbed with either GST (Fig. 2, upper panel) or GST-NUB1 (data not shown) to demonstrate specificity of the immunoreactivity to NUB1. As shown in theupper panel of Fig. 2, a 69-kDa band specific for NUB1 was strongly observed in SK-N-SH, Raji, K562, and 786–0 cells (arrowhead). A moderate signal was detected in SW837, 293, HeLa, and COS cells. In SK-MEL28, Jurkat, and HL60 cells, the band was very weak. Although the 69-kDa band was undetectable in U937 and U2OS cells, a longer exposure allowed us to detect the faint band. In contrast to this blotting, the antiserum preabsorbed with GST-NUB1 could not detect anything (data not shown). Thus, our antiserum specifically detected endogenous NUB1, and its expression level varied widely among cell lines. The sequence information on BS4, a mouse homologue of human NUB1, was deposited to GenBank on June 21, 1995, and assigned to accession number U27462.1. Although the title of the data base entry was ““”BS4: an interferon-inducible gene with novel regulatory properties,“”” BS4 has not been published in the literature so far. To confirm whether NUB1 is an INF-inducible protein, HeLa, 293, and U2OS cells were cultured with human IFN-“”β“” and the induction of NUB1 was examined by Western blotting. As shown in the upper panel of Fig.3 A, treatment with 250 units/ml IFN-“”β“” for 16 h induced expression of the NUB1 protein in HeLa cells (∼10-fold) (lane 1 versus lane 2) and 293 cells (∼5-fold) (lane 3 versus lane 4) but not in U2OS cells (lane 5 versus lane 6). Thus, we found that NUB1 is an IFN-inducible protein and that HeLa cells are very sensitive to this induction. Next, we examined the dose dependence of NUB1 protein induction by using HeLa cells treated for 16 h with various concentrations of IFN-“”β“”. As shown in theupper panel of Fig. 3 B, NUB1 protein was moderately expressed in the untreated cells (lane 1), and it could be induced with IFN-“”β“” in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–6). Furthermore, the time course of NUB1 induction was examined by using HeLa cells treated with 250 units/ml IFN-“”β“” for various times. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3 C, the expression level of NUB1 protein was not changed by 2 h after treatment (lanes 1–3), whereas it increased with time from 4 h to 16 h after treatment (lanes 4–6). Taken together, these data indicated that the NUB1 protein can be induced by IFN-“”β“” in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition to IFN-“”β“”, IFN-γ was also examined for its effects on induction of NUB1. In HeLa cells, IFN-γ could induce NUB1 protein as well as IFN-“”β“” (data not shown). To determine the expression of NUB1 message in human tissues, Northern blot analyses were performed using32P-labeled human NUB1 cDNA as probe. As shown in Fig.4 A (upper panel), 3.5 kb of NUB1 message was weakly detected in testis, ovary, heart, and skeletal muscle. In all other tissues, the message signal was much weaker or undetectable. In addition, a 2.3-kb smaller band was strongly detected in the testis but not in the other tissues. As shown in the middle panel, NEDD8 message was detected on the identical blot. Interestingly, NEDD8 message was enriched in the ovary, heart, and skeletal muscle. This tissue specificity is similar to that of NUB1. Since NEDD8, which interacts with NUB1, was originally isolated as a developmentally down-regulated message in the mouse brain, we also examined the expression of NUB1 message in developing mouse embryos. As shown in theupper panel of Fig. 4 B, 3.0-, 2.5-, and 2.0-kb NUB1 messages were detected. The 3.0-kb message was strongest, the 2.5-kb message was moderate, and the 2.0-kb message was weakest. These NUB1 messages were strongest in the day 7 mouse embryo and were markedly decreased in the day 11, day 15, and day 17 embryos (upper panel). In contrast, the strength of the NEDD8 message peaked in the day 11 mouse embryo and was markedly decreased in the day 15 and day 17 embryos (middle panel). Thus, messages of NUB1 and NEDD8 were developmentally down-regulated differently. We defined whether IFN regulates the transcription of NUB1. HeLa cells were treated for 16 h with various concentrations of IFN-“”β“”, and the level of NUB1 message was analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 4 C,upper panel). The NUB1 message could not be detected in IFN-“”β“”-untreated cells (lane 1), whereas it was induced by 0.4 units/ml IFN-“”β“” (lane 2) and increased in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–6). Thus, IFN-“”β“” up-regulates the transcription of NUB1. The subcellular localization of NUB1 was determined. HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid containing an insert of HA-NUB1 cDNA. As controls, we transfected an expression plasmid alone or a plasmid containing an insert of HA-USP21 (21Gong L. Kamitani T. Millas S. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14212-14216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or HA-NEDD8 cDNA. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.5, HA-USP21 could be detected in both the cytosol and the nucleus. HA-NUB1 and HA-NEDD8 were mostly restricted to the nucleus. This nuclear localization of NUB1 is consistent with the fact that NUB1 has an NLS in its sequence (Fig. 1 B). The yeast two-hybrid assay showed the interaction between NEDD8 and NUB1, implying that NUB1 may regulate the NEDD8-conjugation pathway. To examine this hypothesis, COS cell coexpression assay was used. HA-tagged NEDD8 was co-expressed in COS cells with RH-tagged NUB1 or a control plasmid. As further controls, HA-tagged ubiquitin or sentrin-1 was co-expressed with empty vector or RH-tagged NUB1. As shown in Fig. 6, when HA-NEDD8 was expressed with empty vector (lane 1), we clearly detected a 6.5-kDa band of unconjugated HA-NEDD8 and high molecular mass bands of NEDD8-conjugated proteins. This NEDD8 expression pattern was identical to our previous result (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). When HA-NEDD8 was co-expressed with RH-NUB1 (lane 2), we could not detect both the unconjugated and conjugated forms of NEDD8 except for a 80-kDa band. This result suggested that NUB1 negatively regulates the protein expression of NEDD8 monomer and its conjugates. In contrast, when RH-NUB1 was co-expressed with HA-ubiquitin (lane 4) or HA-sentrin-1 (lane 6), the overexpression of NUB1 did not lead to reduction of the expression of ubiquitin or sentrin-1. Thus, the down-regulation by NUB1 was specific to NEDD8. Although we showed the inhibitory effect of NUB1 on expression of the NEDD8 protein, the molecular mechanism was unclear. At which step did NUB1 act as an inhibitor? To address this question, we examined the effect of NUB1 on expression of the NEDD8 message. As shown in Fig.7, overexpression of RH-NUB1 did not reduce the expression level of HA-NEDD8 message (lane 2 versus lane 3,upper panel). This result suggested that NUB1 inhibits NEDD8 expression post-transcriptionally. We previously reported two down-regulators of the NEDD8-conjugation pathway. The first down-regulator is USP21, which has isopeptidase activity with dual specificity for ubiquitin- and NEDD8-conjugated proteins. The second down-regulator is a dominant-negative UBC12 mutant that sequesters NEDD8 and inhibits NEDD8 conjugation. These proteins inhibit U2OS cell growth (21Gong L. Kamitani T. Millas S. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14212-14216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17008-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We asked whether NUB1 has a similar biological property. As shown in Fig.8, overexpression of NUB1 inhibited cell growth up to 83“%” as compared with control. UBC12(C111S), a dominant-negative UBC12 mutant, also inhibited cell growth, up to 89“%”. IFNs are a group of cytokines with pleiotropic cellular effects. One prominent effect of IFNs is their potent antimitogenic action, which can be observed on both malignant and nonmalignant cells of many different origins. To explain this antimitogenic effect, multiple mechanisms have been proposed (28Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Grander D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D479-D487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found three important properties of NUB1. First, IFN induces NUB1. Second, NUB1 negatively regulates the NEDD8 expression. Third, NUB1 inhibits cell growth. These findings suggest that treatment with IFN causes NUB1 induction, resulting in inhibition of the NEDD8 expression and affecting cell growth. Thus, NUB1-mediated inhibition of cell growth may be one of the mechanisms of the antimitogenic effect of IFNs. Cullin family members are known as NEDD8 targets in mammalian cells (15Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cullin family is composed of Cul-1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, and -5 (14Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These cullins assemble multiprotein complexes, called SCF or SCF-like complexes, which have enzymatic activity of E3 ubiquitin ligase (10Yeh E.T.H. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Cul-1 assembles an SCF complex to catalyze the ubiquitination of p21 (CIP1/WAF1), cyclin D proteins, “”β“”-catenin, p27 (KIP1), and IκBα (29Yu Z.K. Gervais J.L. Zhang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cul-2 assembles an SCF-like complex and is involved in the ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) (35Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Cul-3 has been shown to target cyclin E for ubiquitination and control S phase in mammalian cells (36Singer J.D. Gurian-West M. Clurman B. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, cullin family members play important roles in many biological events. Recently, several groups reported that NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-1 is required for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the SCF complex (19Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Podust V.N. Luo R.S. Chau V. Palombella V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,20Podust V.N. Brownell J.E.

Nishida T. Honda R. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These reports imply that the ubiquitin ligase activity of all SCF and SCF-like complexes is controlled by conjugation of NEDD8 to cullins. Since the NEDD8 expression is down-regulated by NUB1, the expression level of NUB1 may control many biological events, including cell growth, NFκB signaling, and biological responses to hypoxia. With this study, we showed that overexpression of NUB1 leads to reduction of NEDD8 monomer and its conjugates. This reduction probably results from the down-regulation of NEDD8 expression by NUB1. Since NUB1 does not affect NEDD8 expression at message level, the reduction appears to be caused by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Further studies are required to define the mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W1611323378,"efore Darwin, most biologists adheredto a platonic model of nature. Thisimplied that the biological realm con-sisted of a finite set of essentially immutablenatural forms that, like inorganic formssuch as atoms or crystals, are an intrinsicpart of the eternal order of the world. Justas, today, we account for the form of atomsand crystals by a set of physical laws or‘constructional rules’, so pre-darwinianbiologists sought to account for the originof biological forms in terms of a set ofgenerative physical laws often referred to asthe ‘laws of form’.For many biologists today, platonicbiology is an anachronism irretrievably laidto rest, and the idea that biological formsmight be intrinsic features of nature generat-ed by physical laws is treated with increduli-ty. However, recent advances in proteinchemistry suggest that at least one set ofbiological forms — the basic protein folds —is determined by physical laws similar tothose giving rise to crystals and atoms. Theygive every appearance of being invariantplatonic forms of precisely the type that thepre-darwinian biologists were seeking. Protein folds, the basic constructionalunits of proteins, each consist of a foldedchain of between 80 and 200 amino acids.Some proteins consist of a single fold, butmost are a combination of two or more.During the 1970s, as the three-dimensionalstructure of an increasing number of foldswas determined, it became apparent thatthe folds could be classified into a finitenumber of distinct structural families con-taining a number of closely related forms.The fact that protein folds could be classifiedin this manner provided the first line ofevidence that the folds might be naturalforms.Further evidence that the folds doindeed represent a finite set of naturalforms is provided by detailed structuralstudies carried out over the past two decadeswhich have revealed that the structure ofthe folds can be accounted for by whatamounts to a set of ‘constructional rules’governing the way that the various sec-ondary structural motifs, such as a-helicesand b-sheets, can be combined and packedinto compact three-dimensional structures.One is inevitably reminded of the atom-building rules governing the assembly ofsubatomic particles into the 92 atoms of theperiodic table. Consideration of these ‘constructionallaws’ suggests that the total number ofpermissible folds is bound to be restrictedto a very small number — about 4,000,according to one estimate. Confirmationthat this is probably so is provided by a differ-ent type of estimate, based on the discoveryrate of new folds. Using this method,Cyrus Chothia of Britain’s Medical ResearchCouncil estimated that the total number offolds utilized by living organisms may not bemore than 1,000. Subsequent estimates havegiven figures of between 500 and 1,000.Whatever the final figure, the fact thatthe total number of folds represents a tinystable fraction of all possible polypeptideconformations, determined by the laws ofphysics, reinforces the notion that the folds,like atoms, represent a finite set of built-innatural forms.The robustness of the folds offers anoth-er clue. The fact that the folds can retaintheir native conformations in the face ofmultiple different sorts of short-term defor-mations caused by the molecular turbulenceof the cell, and in the face of extensive, long-term evolutionary changes in their amino-acid sequences, is precisely what would beexpected if they are natural forms, specifiedby physical law. Again, the fact that thesame fold can be specified by many differ-ent, apparently unrelated amino-acidsequences, suggesting multiple separate dis-coveries during the course of evolution, isfurther evidence that the folds are intrinsicfeatures of the order of nature. Finally, thefact that in many cases the same fold isadapted to very different biochemical func-tions is precisely what would be expected ifprotein functions are secondary adaptationsof a set of primary, immutable, naturalforms. If forms as complex as the protein foldsare intrinsic features of nature, might someof the higher architecture of life also be deter-mined by physical law?

Here we report on the induction and regulation of human monocyte MT1-MMP and its role in MMP-2 activation. Activation of monocytes by lipopolysaccharide resulted in the induction of MT1-MMP mRNA and protein that was suppressed by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin), adenylyl cyclase (SQ 22536), and protein kinase A (Rp-cAMPs). Suppression of MT1-MMP by indomethacin and SQ 22536 was reversed by prostaglandin E2 and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, respectively, demonstrating that induction of monocyte MT1-MMP is regulated through a prostaglandin-cAMP pathway. Functional analysis revealed that pro-MMP-2 in the supernatants from human bone marrow stromal fibroblasts, normal male-derived fibroblasts and melanoma cells (A2058) was converted to active MMP-2 when cultured with activated but not control monocytes. Antibodies against MT1-MMP blocked the activation of MMP-2. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 regulation of MMP-2 activation was shown through the addition of varying amounts of recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 with pro-MMP-2 to MT1-MMP-expressing monocytes.

Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 take part in extracellular matrix remodeling (2Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism of how these MMPs act is largely unknown (3Werb Z. Ashkenas J. MacAuley A. Wiesen J.F. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1996; 29: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Critical events in the physiologic mechanism of proteinase activation, which is regulated at several levels, include cell type, site, and timing. MMPs are produced as zymogens (pro-MMPs) that require proteolytic activation through the elimination of the N-terminal propeptide (4Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Once the enzymes are active, they are susceptible to inhibition by a family of specific tissue inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). TIMPs act to inhibit metalloproteinase activity by forming a complex with active MMPs (5Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). The activation and inhibition of MMPs is tightly regulated under normal physiological conditions; however, in a number of pathological situations the strict regulatory mechanisms are lost, leading to tumor metastasis and connective tissue diseases such as arthritis.The growing family of MMPs at present consists of more than 20 members including the recently identified membrane type (MT1)-MMP. MMPs subclassified as type IV collagenases/gelatinases include MMP-2 (72 kDa; gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (92 kDa; gelatinase B). These MMPs are capable of degrading denatured and intact type IV collagen, a major component of basement membranes, as well as other extracellular matrix substrates. MMP-2 is unique in that the propeptide of this enzyme has no apparent cleavage site for the proteinases that activate other MMPs. MT1-MMP is believed to mediate the activation of MMP-2 on the cell surface. The expression of MT1-MMP and activation of MMP-2 has been associated with tumor invasion and metastasis (6Sato H.

Thus, production of MT1-MMP is likely a major rate-limiting component of MMP-2 activation; therefore the MT1-MMP/MMP-2 system is an attractive target for the prognosis and prevention of tumor progression.Degradation of basement membranes and stromal extracellular matrix is crucial for invasion and metastasis of malignant cells (8Pyke C.

The expression of MMPs in tumors is regulated in a paracrine manner by growth factors and cytokines secreted by tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells, as well as by tumor or stromal cells. Recent studies have suggested continuous cross-talk between tumor cells, stromal cells, and inflammatory cells during the invasion process. Monocytes/macrophages found at sites of extracellular remodeling have been implicated in connective tissue destruction mediated through MMPs (11Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z.

Physiol. 1997; 173: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because of the spatial distribution of tissue monocytes, also known as tumor-associated macrophages, between invading tumors and surrounding tumors, we have analyzed (a) the effect of monocyte activation on the expression of MT1-MMP, (b) the mechanism of monocyte MT1-MMP production, (c) the functional analysis of monocyte-derived MT1-MMP in activating MMP-2 secreted from stromal cells, fibroblasts, or melanoma cells, and (d) the role of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in regulating the conversion or inhibition of MMP-2 to its active forms by MT1-MMP-expressing monocytes.DISCUSSIONThe present work demonstrates that activation of monocytes results in the expression of mRNA for MT1-MMP with the subsequent localization of the protein on the surface of the cell. It has been reported that monocytes secrete a number of MMPs in response to various stimulants (12Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilhelm S.M. Goldberg G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 30Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Shapiro S.D. Goldberg G.I. Welgus H.G. J.

Fujii K. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of these MMPs is thought to occur at the pre-translational level. Consistent with these findings, we have observed an increase in mRNA and protein levels of MT1-MMP in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Examination of MT1-MMP revealed that only stimulated monocytes expressed mRNA for MT1-MMP and had MT1-MMP on their membrane surface.MMPs have been associated with several pathological conditions such as chronic inflammatory lesions and cancer metastasis (33Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wahl L.M. Wahl S.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, regulation of signal transduction events that are associated with the production of inflammatory mediators, such as MMPs, has been of considerable interest. A PGE2-cAMP-dependent pathway leading to the production of MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-7 (matrilysin) by activated monocytes has been demonstrated previously (13Wahl L.M. Lampel L.L. Cell.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that LPS induces monocyte MT1-MMP and that the signaling pathway for MT1-MMP synthesis involves, in large part, a PGE2-dependent mechanism. This was demonstrated by the ability of exogenous PGE2 to reverse indomethacin-mediated inhibition of MT1-MMP. Additional evidence for the involvement of cAMP in this pathway is the suppression of MT1-MMP by adenylyl cyclase or protein kinase A inhibitors. Regulation of MT1-MMP through a PGE2-dependent mechanism has also been reported for the induction of MT1-MMP in fibroblasts stimulated with monensin (36Li L. Akers K. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the same study, the induction of fibroblast MT1-MMP by monensin was also inhibited by indomethacin, an effect that was reversed by PGE2.Many lines of evidence link increased MMP levels with tumor invasiveness and metastatic potential (37Matrisian L.M.

Cancer. 1994; 70: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that basement membrane degrading MMP-2 is involved in the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors and in the angiogenesis required for tumor growth (35Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar, 37Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In many instances, enhanced MMP-2 production has been traced to the malignant cells themselves (37Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 40Liotta L.A. Tryggvason K. Garbisa S. Hart I. Foltz C.M. Shafie S. Nature. 1980; 284: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that some tumors produce little MMP-2, and the major source of this enzyme is from stromal cells and fibroblasts (8Pyke C. Ralfkiaer E. Tryggvason K. Dano K. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 359-365PubMed Google Scholar,9Kuranami M. Cohen A.M. Guillem J.G. Surgical Forum. 1994; 45: 551-553Google Scholar). Regardless of the source of MMP-2, activation of this enzyme is critical for its proteolytic activity and indicates the invasive phenotype of the tumors. In the present study, we demonstrate that the MT1-MMP on activated monocytes may have an important role in the activation of MMP-2 produced by other cells. Zymogram analysis of conditioned media from control or activated monocytes failed to detect MMP-2. In contrast, the conditioned media collected from HBMF, NMDF, or A2058 cells contained substantial levels of latent MMP-2, which was converted to its intermediate and fully active forms when cultured with activated monocytes. Furthermore, the activation of MMP-2 was blocked by antibodies against MT1-MMP. These results suggest that communication between monocytes producing MT1-MMP with either tumor or tumor-associated cells expressing MMP-2 is essential for the activation of MMP-2, leading to the metastatic potential of the tumor cell. Our finding that only activated but not control monocytes were able to convert pro-MMP-2 to its active form indicates the significance of activated monocytes in this process. Although we have used LPS to stimulate monocytes in vivo it is likely that stimulatory molecules, such as cytokines, cancer cell-associated factors, or extracellular matrix components may exert the same effect.Several studies have suggested activation of MMP-2 through physical cell-cell contact (27Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6184-6191PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to these reports, we have demonstrated that soluble pro-MMP-2 secreted by HBMF, NMDF, or A2058 cells into the conditioned medium could still be activated when incubated with monocyte MT1-MMP. Pro-MMP-2, unlike other MMPs, is usually found complexed with endogenous TIMP-2 (11Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm A. He C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17374-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of inhibitor bound to the latent enzyme suggests that the inhibitor may play some additional role. Indeed, several recent reports have suggested that the formation of a complex among pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and MT1-MMP is needed for MMP-2 activation and that TIMP-2 levels are critical in MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP (27Strongin A.Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it has been hypothesized that two molecules of MT1-MMP are required for activation of MMP-2. One of these molecules binds a complex of TIMP-2·MMP-2 whereas an adjacent free MT1-MMP activates MMP-2 (for review see Ref. 22Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). This model of activation may explain the possible mechanism of activation of pro-MMP-2 in our study. Although we observed substantial amounts of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 protein on HBMF, NMDF, and A2058 cells (data not shown) these cells failed to activate the MMP-2. A possible explanation for this finding is that the excess TIMP-2 produced by these cells binds to all or most of the MT1-MMP on the surface of these cells, thus preventing activation of MMP-2 by MT1-MMP. In contrast, monocytes produce very little TIMP-2 or MMP-2. As a result, there is sufficient free MT1-MMP on the monocyte cell surface to bind the TIMP-2·MMP-2 complex derived from other cells with enough remaining free MT1-MMP to activate MMP-2. Thus, the ratio of TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP is critical for optimum activation of MMP-2. This hypothesis is supported by data shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The data in Fig. 7 demonstrate that excess TIMP-2 does indeed inhibit the activation of MMP-2 from HBMF by monocytes. In Fig. 8, the addition of human recombinant TIMP-2 with purified-recombinant pro-MMP-2 to LPS-stimulated monocytes demonstrated that TIMP-2 is required for activation of pro-MMP-2. Moreover, the optimal activation occurred when pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were in equal molar concentrations. However, when TIMP-2 was in significant excess the activation of MMP-2 was inhibited, presumably because of the saturation of the available MT1-MMP molecules by TIMP-2.In summary, we have demonstrated that activated monocytes produce functionally active MT1-MMP through a prostaglandin-cAMPdependent mechanism. The monocyte-derived MT1-MMP is involved in the activation of MMP-2 produced by other cells. These results suggest that the in vivo interaction between monocytes and MMP-2-secreting cells may play a crucial role in the regulation of normal developmental processes and disease states, such as tumor invasion. Thus, defining the mechanism and developing therapeutic interventions involved in the regulation of monocyte MT1-MMP may be important in controlling the immunopathology associated with various diseases. Extracellular tissue remodeling is critical in the reorganization of connective tissue under both normal and pathological conditions including cell migration, angiogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and invasion (1Deryugina E.I.

Because of the spatial distribution of tissue monocytes, also known as tumor-associated macrophages, between invading tumors and surrounding tumors, we have analyzed (a) the effect of monocyte activation on the expression of MT1-MMP, (b) the mechanism of monocyte MT1-MMP production, (c) the functional analysis of monocyte-derived MT1-MMP in activating MMP-2 secreted from stromal cells, fibroblasts, or melanoma cells, and (d) the role of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in regulating the conversion or inhibition of MMP-2 to its active forms by MT1-MMP-expressing monocytes. DISCUSSIONThe present work demonstrates that activation of monocytes results in the expression of mRNA for MT1-MMP with the subsequent localization of the protein on the surface of the cell. It has been reported that monocytes secrete a number of MMPs in response to various stimulants (12Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilhelm S.M. Goldberg G.I. J. Clin.

Consistent with these findings, we have observed an increase in mRNA and protein levels of MT1-MMP in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Examination of MT1-MMP revealed that only stimulated monocytes expressed mRNA for MT1-MMP and had MT1-MMP on their membrane surface.MMPs have been associated with several pathological conditions such as chronic inflammatory lesions and cancer metastasis (33Brinckerhoff C.E.

Therefore, regulation of signal transduction events that are associated with the production of inflammatory mediators, such as MMPs, has been of considerable interest. A PGE2-cAMP-dependent pathway leading to the production of MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-7 (matrilysin) by activated monocytes has been demonstrated previously (13Wahl L.M. Lampel L.L. Cell.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that LPS induces monocyte MT1-MMP and that the signaling pathway for MT1-MMP synthesis involves, in large part, a PGE2-dependent mechanism. This was demonstrated by the ability of exogenous PGE2 to reverse indomethacin-mediated inhibition of MT1-MMP. Additional evidence for the involvement of cAMP in this pathway is the suppression of MT1-MMP by adenylyl cyclase or protein kinase A inhibitors. Regulation of MT1-MMP through a PGE2-dependent mechanism has also been reported for the induction of MT1-MMP in fibroblasts stimulated with monensin (36Li L. Akers K. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the same study, the induction of fibroblast MT1-MMP by monensin was also inhibited by indomethacin, an effect that was reversed by PGE2.Many lines of evidence link increased MMP levels with tumor invasiveness and metastatic potential (37Matrisian L.M.

It is hypothesized that basement membrane degrading MMP-2 is involved in the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors and in the angiogenesis required for tumor growth (35Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S.

In many instances, enhanced MMP-2 production has been traced to the malignant cells themselves (37Matrisian L.M.

Nature. 1980; 284: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that some tumors produce little MMP-2, and the major source of this enzyme is from stromal cells and fibroblasts (8Pyke C. Ralfkiaer E. Tryggvason K. Dano K. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 359-365PubMed Google Scholar,9Kuranami M. Cohen A.M. Guillem J.G. Surgical Forum. 1994; 45: 551-553Google Scholar). Regardless of the source of MMP-2, activation of this enzyme is critical for its proteolytic activity and indicates the invasive phenotype of the tumors. In the present study, we demonstrate that the MT1-MMP on activated monocytes may have an important role in the activation of MMP-2 produced by other cells. Zymogram analysis of conditioned media from control or activated monocytes failed to detect MMP-2. In contrast, the conditioned media collected from HBMF, NMDF, or A2058 cells contained substantial levels of latent MMP-2, which was converted to its intermediate and fully active forms when cultured with activated monocytes. Furthermore, the activation of MMP-2 was blocked by antibodies against MT1-MMP. These results suggest that communication between monocytes producing MT1-MMP with either tumor or tumor-associated cells expressing MMP-2 is essential for the activation of MMP-2, leading to the metastatic potential of the tumor cell. Our finding that only activated but not control monocytes were able to convert pro-MMP-2 to its active form indicates the significance of activated monocytes in this process. Although we have used LPS to stimulate monocytes in vivo it is likely that stimulatory molecules, such as cytokines, cancer cell-associated factors, or extracellular matrix components may exert the same effect.Several studies have suggested activation of MMP-2 through physical cell-cell contact (27Strongin A.Y.

Contrary to these reports, we have demonstrated that soluble pro-MMP-2 secreted by HBMF, NMDF, or A2058 cells into the conditioned medium could still be activated when incubated with monocyte MT1-MMP. Pro-MMP-2, unlike other MMPs, is usually found complexed with endogenous TIMP-2 (11Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

Based on these studies, it has been hypothesized that two molecules of MT1-MMP are required for activation of MMP-2. One of these molecules binds a complex of TIMP-2·MMP-2 whereas an adjacent free MT1-MMP activates MMP-2 (for review see Ref. 22Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). This model of activation may explain the possible mechanism of activation of pro-MMP-2 in our study. Although we observed substantial amounts of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 protein on HBMF, NMDF, and A2058 cells (data not shown) these cells failed to activate the MMP-2. A possible explanation for this finding is that the excess TIMP-2 produced by these cells binds to all or most of the MT1-MMP on the surface of these cells, thus preventing activation of MMP-2 by MT1-MMP. In contrast, monocytes produce very little TIMP-2 or MMP-2. As a result, there is sufficient free MT1-MMP on the monocyte cell surface to bind the TIMP-2·MMP-2 complex derived from other cells with enough remaining free MT1-MMP to activate MMP-2. Thus, the ratio of TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP is critical for optimum activation of MMP-2. This hypothesis is supported by data shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The data in Fig. 7 demonstrate that excess TIMP-2 does indeed inhibit the activation of MMP-2 from HBMF by monocytes. In Fig. 8, the addition of human recombinant TIMP-2 with purified-recombinant pro-MMP-2 to LPS-stimulated monocytes demonstrated that TIMP-2 is required for activation of pro-MMP-2. Moreover, the optimal activation occurred when pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were in equal molar concentrations. However, when TIMP-2 was in significant excess the activation of MMP-2 was inhibited, presumably because of the saturation of the available MT1-MMP molecules by TIMP-2.In summary, we have demonstrated that activated monocytes produce functionally active MT1-MMP through a prostaglandin-cAMPdependent mechanism. The monocyte-derived MT1-MMP is involved in the activation of MMP-2 produced by other cells. These results suggest that the in vivo interaction between monocytes and MMP-2-secreting cells may play a crucial role in the regulation of normal developmental processes and disease states, such as tumor invasion.

Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All proteins in this family have an internal repeat in their membrane domain that presumably has arisen from a primordial gene duplication event. A strongly conserved and functionally important so-called α-motif that spans two of the predicted transmembrane helices is present in each copy of the internal repeat (1Schwarz E. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Attempts to determine the membrane topology of the mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchanger have yielded conflicting results (3Cook O. Low W. Rahamimoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y.J. Lu L.Y. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and it is not clear whether the two conserved α-motifs are located on the same or opposite sides of the membrane. Obviously, a resolution of this point will have important functional implications for this class of proteins.In general, both prediction and experimental determination of membrane protein topology is easier for bacterial than for mammalian proteins, and we have thus undertaken a study of the E. coli family member YrbG. The sequence alignment in Fig. 1 A shows clear evidence of the internal repeat, including the two α-motifs. Overall, there is ∼34% identity between the N- and C-terminal halves of YrbG, and a BLASTP (6Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-33402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) search of the Entrez protein sequence data bank using the N-terminal half (residues 1–155) finds the C-terminal half (residues 172–320) with an E-value of 2 × 10−16 (data not shown).Interestingly, topology predictions using TOPPRED II (7Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar), TMHMM (8Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8870) Google Scholar), and HMMTOP (9Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) suggest a topology with 10 transmembrane segments for YrbG, with the first and second internal repeat having opposite orientations in the inner membrane; see Fig. 1 B. This is reminiscent of a recently described case of “divergent” topology evolution where two homologous E. coli inner membrane proteins, YdgQ and ORF193, each with 6 transmembrane segments, were shown to have opposite membrane orientations (10Sääf A. Johansson M. Wallin E. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8540-8544Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The predicted topology for YrbG likewise suggests that a primordial protein with 5 transmembrane segments has evolved, after an internal gene duplication, into a protein with 10 transmembrane segments where the first and second halves insert into the membrane with opposite orientations. From this perspective, it is particularly noteworthy that the distribution of positively charged amino acids is different between the two halves of YrbG; in the N-terminal half, Arg and Lys residues are predominantly found in the loops between transmembrane segments 1/2 and 3/4, whereas in the C-terminal half they are more prevalent in the loop preceding the first transmembrane segment and between transmembrane segments 2/3 and 4/5; see Fig. 1 B. The YrbG protein may thus be a second example of divergent topology evolution, this time following an internal gene duplication event.Given the biological importance of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger family and the topology evolution issue, we decided to experimentally map the topology of YrbG using the PhoA fusion approach (11Manoil C. Beckwith J. Science. 1986; 233: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our results provide strong support for the predicted topology with 5+5 transmembrane segments, placing the two α-domains on opposite sides of the membrane and suggesting that divergent topology evolution may be more prevalent than hitherto thought.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have mapped the topology of the E. coli inner membrane protein YrbG, which belongs to a large family of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers that includes both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. Sequence alignment, topology prediction, and experimental topology mapping using PhoA fusions strongly suggest a two-domain structure, each with five transmembrane segments and with opposite orientations in the membrane. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this places the two copies of the conserved α-motif on opposite sides of the membrane, suggesting that this will also be the case for the eukaryotic family members. Some experimental support for this idea has been obtained previously (5Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In terms of three-dimensional structure, this means that proteins in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family will have a quasi-symmetric organization relative to the plane of the membrane, somewhat reminiscent of the aquaporins where two copies of the so-called NPA loop, one entering the membrane from the cytoplasmic side and one from the extra-cytoplasmic side, are thought to interact in the middle of the pore (20Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar).Equally interesting, YrbG provides a clear example of divergent topology evolution where the two homologous halves of the protein have evolved opposite orientations in the membrane. Presumably, the redistribution of positively charged Arg and Lys residues between the different loops in the protein underlies this evolutionary process, as has been suggested earlier for the two homologous E. coliinner membrane proteins YdgQ and ORF193 (10Sääf A. Johansson M. Wallin E. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8540-8544Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In fact, the bacterial homologues of YrbG found by a PSI-BLAST search of the Entrez protein sequence data base all have the same predicted Nout-Cout topology with 10 transmembrane segments, except for the Synechocystis homologue (slr0681), which has an extra predicted C-terminal transmembrane segment not present in the other proteins, and all have the same enrichment of positively charged residues in their predicted cytoplasmic loops as seen for YrbG (data not shown).Whether the postulated primordial YrbG half-protein with five transmembrane segments had a single orientation in the membrane or could insert both ways (Nin-Cout and Nout-Cin) as is the case for,e.g. ductin (21Dunlop J. Jones P.C. Finbow M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3609-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), is unknown. If it had only a single orientation, it is unlikely that a topology with 10 transmembrane segments would be adopted by anything but a very small fraction of the molecules immediately after the gene duplication. Instead, the majority would most likely adopt a so-called “leave one out” topology where one of the hydrophobic segments would not insert across the membrane, and all highly charged loops would remain on the cytoplasmic side (22Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A considerable number of mutational events would then be required before most molecules would insert into the membrane with the Nout-Cout topology seen today. In any case, our results underscore the importance of the “positive inside” rule (23von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2315-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) for determining membrane protein topology and suggest that divergent topology evolution or even topology inversion may be a more prevalent phenomenon than hitherto thought.

Similar to GFP, asFP595 apparently forms its chromophore by modifying amino acids within its polypeptide chain. Until now, the GFP-like proteins fromAnthozoa were thought to contain chromophores with the same imidazolidinone core as GFP. Mass spectral analysis of a chromophore-containing tryptic pentapeptide from asFP595 demonstrates that chromophore formation in asFP595 is stoichiometrically the same as that in GFP: one H2O and two H+ are released while a Schiff base and dehydrotyrosine are formed. However, structural studies of this asFP595 chromopeptide show that in contrast to GFP, the other peptide bond nitrogen and carbonyl carbon are required for chromophore cyclization, a reaction that yields the six-membered heterocycle 2-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-6-hydroxy-2,5-dihydropyrazine. Spectrophotometric titration reveals three pH-dependent forms of the asFP595 chromopeptide: yellow (absorption maximum = 430 nm) at pH 3.0; red (absorption maximum = 535 nm) at pH 8.0; and colorless (absorption maximum = 380 nm) at pH 14.0. The pK a values for these spectral transitions (6.8 and 10.9) are consistent with the ionization of the phenolic group of dehydrotyrosine and deprotonation of the amidinium cation in the chromophore heterocycle, respectively. The amidinium group in asFP595 accounts for the unique absorption spectrum of the protein, which is substantially red-shifted relative to that of GFP. When the asFP595 chromophore cyclizes, the Cys–Met bond adjacent to the chromophore hydrolyzes, splitting the chromoprotein into 8- and 20-kDa fragments. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of a tryptic digest of denatured asFP595 shows that a pentapeptide with the cleaved Cys–Met bond is the only fragment associated with the red-shifted absorbance.

The most outstanding feature of GFP is the creation of its chromophore, a self-catalyzed reaction consisting of two main steps: cyclization of the protein backbone at positions 65–67 (Ser-Tyr-Gly) followed by dehydrogenation of the Tyr66side chain (7Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 220-222Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 8Cody C.W. Prasher D.C. Wastler W.M. Prendergast F.G. Ward W.W.

In its final form, the GFP chromophore comprises two cyclic structures.

Recently, a number of GFP homologues were cloned from theAnthozoa species (11Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A.

As a group, these GFP-like proteins display colors spanning the visible spectrum. Sequence comparisons of all known fluorescent proteins (FPs) reveal that Tyr66 and Gly67 (numbering in accordance with GFP) are invariant. The most impressive feature of some of these proteins is a dramatic difference in their absorption maxima. Presumably, there are three plausible explanations for the structural basis of color differences. First, spectral variability could arise from different noncovalent interactions of the chromophore with its environment. Second, the GFP-like imidazolidinone structure might be extended by an additional reaction. Third, chromophore formation could occur via an alternative pathway yielding a different heterocyclic structure. Apparently, all three possibilities might be embodied among diverse FPs. Among a number of GFP mutants, for example, spectral diversity results from differences in the way a chromophore interacts with its protein environment (for review see Ref. 14Remington S.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 305: 196-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gross et al. (15Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the red emitter drFP583 (DsRed) derives its spectral quality from an additional autocatalytic dehydrogenation, which extends the chromophore's system of conjugated π-bonds. Recently, we reported the discovery of a GFP-like purple chromoprotein, asFP595, from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata (13Lukyanov K.A. Fradkov A.F. Gurskaya N.G. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Markelov M.L. Zaraisky A.G. Zhao X. Fang Y. Tan W. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25879-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This protein is naturally nonfluorescent and is responsible for the purple coloration of the anemone tentacles. In vitro, asFP595 absorbs light maximally at 572 nm and displays extremely weak red fluorescence at 595 nm (quantum yield < 0.001). We have found that the spectral and biophysical properties of both the native and denatured forms of asFP595 differ markedly from GFP and drFP583. These observations prompted us to investigate the chemical nature of the asFP595 chromophore to identify the structural basis for the outlined differences. Our studies show that the asFP595 chromophore forms via an alternative pathway, one that requires protein cleavage in addition to amino acid modification. After dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, asFP595 was denatured by acidification to pH 2.3 with dilute HCl. The solution with denatured protein was immediately adjusted to pH 7.8 with dilute NaOH. After the addition of trypsin (20% by weight) the suspension was stirred continuously at room temperature for 4 h. Finally, the clarified digest was adjusted to pH 4.0 and applied to an HPLC column (Beckman Ultrasphere ODS, 4.5 × 250 mm). The column was equilibrated with a starting buffer of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0, containing 60% acetonitrile. The eluent was monitored at 210 and 430 nm. The protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses routinely employed 15% polyacrylamide gels (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) calibrated with low molecular weight standards from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane using a semi-dry Hoefer transfer unit following the protocol provided by PerkinElmer Life Sciences (17PerkinElmer Life Sciences (1993) User Bulletin, Vol. 58, Foster City, CA.Google Scholar). Automated Edman degradation was performed with an Applied Biosystems 491 sequenator. Amino acid analyses were done with a Biotronik amino acid analyzer LC 3000. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were acquired using a Vision 2000 (Thermo Bio Analyses) mass spectrometer operating in the linear mode. Samples of peptides (10–20 pmol each) prepared by HPLC were deposited directly in the sample well of the MALDI plate using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU520 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer was used for registration of the excitation-emission spectra. The reaction was carried out in 0.2 m N-ethylmorpholine acetate buffer, pH 8.5, for 4 h at 37 °C. The blotted fragments of asFP595 (30 μg of protein) were excised from the Immobilon membrane and incubated with carboxypeptidase A. Finally, the liberated amino acids were identified as dansyl derivatives on thin-layer silica gel plates or on polyamide sheets. Based on its cDNA sequence (13Lukyanov K.A. Fradkov A.F. Gurskaya N.G. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Markelov M.L. Zaraisky A.G. Zhao X. Fang Y. Tan W. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25879-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), monomeric asFP595 should have a mass of 27.2 kDa. However, when we analyzed recombinant asFP595 (expressed by Escherichia coliand purified using metal affinity chromatography) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected very little protein at 28 kDa. Instead, most of the protein distributed between two major bands at 20 and 8 kDa (Fig. 1 A). After blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, these two bands were analyzed directly by Edman degradation and carboxypeptidase digestion. Amino acid sequencing of the 8-kDa band revealed the Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His(6)-Gly-Ser-Ala sequence, which corresponds to the N-terminal part of the expressed protein (13Lukyanov K.A. Fradkov A.F. Gurskaya N.G. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Markelov M.L. Zaraisky A.G. Zhao X. Fang Y. Tan W. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25879-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Edman degradation of the 20-kDa band provided no sequence information. The 20-kDa band was further analyzed by reaction with dansyl chloride. We reasoned that although the amino acid participating in cyclization of the chromophore may contain a free α-NH2 group, the adjoining peptide bond might be somehow modified and therefore resistant to Edman degradation. However, dansylation of the 20-kDa fragment followed by acid hydrolysis failed to reveal an accessible α-NH2group, although intrachain ε-Lys and o-Tyr dansyl derivatives were observed. Carboxypeptidase A treatment of the blotted 20-kDa band liberated Asn and His as expected for the C terminus of the protein. Similar analysis of the 8-kDa band showed the presence of Cys, Ser, and Thr. Taking into account the molecular mass of 8 kDa, we have found the characteristic Thr-Ser-Cys sequence at positions 62–64 just before the predicted chromophore motive Met-Tyr-Gly. The above results indicate that the mature asFP595 undergoes fragmentation by splitting at the Cys–Met bond, yielding two of the three bands observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The minor 28-kDa band corresponds to the full-length protein, whereas the major 8- and 20-kDa bands correspond to the N- and C-terminal fragments of the protein, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Under acidic conditions (pH 2.5), the absorption peak of asFP595 occurs at 430 nm (data not shown). Under alkaline conditions (pH 14.0), the absorption maximum of the protein shifts to an even shorter wavelength, with the peak in this case occurring at 380 nm. The pH-dependent spectral shift for asFP595 is the opposite of that observed for GFP. Under acidic conditions, GFP absorbs maximally at 380 nm; under basic conditions, it absorbs maximally at 445 nm. Prolonged incubation of asFP595 at pH 14.0 led to a decrease in the absorbance at 380 nm, implying that the asFP595 chromophore is unstable and undergoes degradation under alkaline conditions. In contrast, incubation of asFP595 at pH 3.0 at room temperature for several hours did not alter the characteristic 430-nm absorbance. The absorption spectra (Fig.2 A) of an HPLC-purified chromopeptide (a peptide produced by digesting asFP595 with trypsin) were similar to those for the denatured protein, asFP595. For example, at pH 3.0 the peptide showed an absorption maximum at 430 nm. This peak shifted to 380 nm when the pH was adjusted to 14.0. As the pH increased from 3.0 to 9.0, the peak, formerly at 430 nm, shifted to 535 nm (Fig.2 A), and the color of the peptide solution changed from yellow to red. This pH-dependent transition showed an isosbestic point at 466 nm with a pK a of 6.8 (Fig.3). The yellow to red color shift is reversible; titrating back to pH 3.0 restored the absorbance at 430 nm. For GFP, the pH-dependent shift from 380 to 445 nm is known to be caused by the ionization of a phenolic group (18Niwa M. Inouye S. Hirano T. Matsuno T. Kojima S. Kubata M. Ohashi M. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13617-13622Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), which has a pK a of 7.9–8.1 (7Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 220-222Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Ward W.W. Cody C.W. Hart R.C. Cormier M.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1980; 31: 611-615Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Presumably, the pH-dependent shift from 430 to 535 nm for the asFP595 chromopeptide also corresponds to the ionization of a phenolic group. But the relatively lower pK a of the asFP595 implies the presence of a stronger electron-withdrawing group in the asFP595 chromophore. As the chromopeptide-containing solution was titrated to pH 14.0, the 535-nm absorbance peak shifted to 380 nm, as was seen for the denatured asFP595. The pK a of this transition was 10.9 (Fig. 3), suggesting that a protonated base is crucial for the structure of the chromophore. This transition is only partially reversible, because at pH 14.0 the chromophore gradually falls apart as discussed above.Figure 3Spectrophotometric titration of the purified asFP595 chromopeptide. Purified chromopeptide in 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0, was titrated by the addition of microliter quantities of dilute NaOH solution. Absorbance of the chromopeptide was monitored at 430 (circles), 535 (squares), and 380 nm (triangles). The measured pK a of 6.8 corresponds to conversion of the chromopeptide from yellow to red, and a pK a of 10.9 corresponds to the conversion from red to colorless.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The red form of the chromopeptide exhibits emission spectra similar to those of asFP595 (Fig. 2 B) with the emission peak at 595 nm and excitation maximum at 535 nm. Because the 430-nm (yellow) and 380-nm (colorless) forms of the chromopeptide do not show an appreciable emission at 595 nm, it is reasonable to assume that the structure of the chromophore in the 535-nm-absorbing peptide represents the structure of the chromophore in mature asFP595. Acid hydrolysis of the chromopeptide yielded 1.8 mol of glycine, 1 mol of lysine, and 0.6 mol of serine. Edman degradation or reaction with dansyl chloride failed to reveal any accessible N-terminal NH2 group of the chromopeptide. Carboxypeptidase A treatment of the purified peptide liberated Ser and Lys. Collectively, these results lead us to conclude that the isolated chromopeptide corresponds to the N-terminal pentapeptide from the 20-kDa fragment Met-Tyr-Gly-Ser-Lys. (Fig.1 B). With MALDI/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the chromopeptide was detected as a molecular ion at m/z = 564.6 (the molecular mass for the precursor peptide Met-Tyr-Gly-Ser-Lys was calculated to be 584.6 Da). To confirm that the mass of 564.6 Da corresponded to the cation radical and not to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, MALDI/time-of-flight mass spectrometry experiments were carried out in both positive and negative ion detection modes and included the synthetic hexapeptide Thr-Gly-Glu-Asn-His-Lys as an internal standard (Fig.4, A and B). The masses of the peptide standard, detected by MALDI/time-of-flight mass spectrometry in positive and negative ion modes, differed by 2 atomic mass units, a value that corresponds to the difference between the [M+H]+ and [M−H]− molecular ions. In contrast, the masses of the chromopeptide differed by only 1 atomic mass unit, corresponding to the difference between the M+⋅ and [M−H]− ions. Because the chromophore contains an extended system of conjugated π electrons, it is reasonable to conclude that the molecule stabilizes the cation radical by delocalizing the charge over the entire π framework. Resonance effects such as these have also been used to explain the stability of charged radicals formed from other polyunsaturated compounds including carotenoids (20van Breemen R.B. Huang C.-R. Tan Y. Sander L.C. Schilling A.B. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 975-981Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), glucuronide metabolites of certain aromatic drug molecules such as indomethacine (21van Breemen R.B. Stogniew M. Fanselau C. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 17: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and highly conjugated textile dyes (22Freeman H.S. Hao Z. Sokolowska-Gajda J. van Breemen R.B. Le J.S. Dyes Pigments. 1991; 16: 317-323Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Comparing the mass of the molecular ion at m/z = 564.6 Da with the calculated mass of the corresponding unmodified peptide (584.6 Da), one can conclude that the cyclization reaction of the asFP595 chromophore is stoichiometrically the same as that for the GFP chromophore: one H2O and two H+ are released while a Schiff base and dehydrotyrosine are formed. Because the N-terminal methionine of the chromopeptide does not contain an accessible α-NH2group, a covalent bond to this nitrogen is probably formed during cyclization. Based on the results of the carboxypeptidase A treatment of the chromopeptide, the carbonyl carbons of Ser and Gly remain unmodified. Therefore, the tyrosine carbonyl is the only reasonable candidate for the nucleophilic attack by the methionine NH2group (Fig. 5, a andb).Figure 5A complete scheme of the asFP595 chromophore formation, pH-dependant conversions, and degradation. The first step in asFP595 chromophore formation is cyclization, which is the result of a nucleophilic reaction between the α-nitrogen of Met65 and carbonyl carbon of Tyr66 catalyzed by the protein. After cyclization, theN-acylamidine bond (the former peptide bond between Cys64 and Met65) hydrolyses resulting in the splitting of the protein into 8 and 20-kDa fragments as shown in Fig.1. The chromopeptide of asFP595 exists in the three pH-dependant forms (absorption maxima are indicated). The determined pK a values of 6.8 and 10.9 are consistent with ionization of the phenolic group of dehydrotyrosine and deprotonation of the amidinium cation, respectively. The red form of the chromopeptide exhibits the same emission maximum as the native protein (595 nm), suggesting that this form is a major structure of the chromophore in mature asFP595. The colorless form of the chromophore is unstable and undergoes degradation by hydrolysis at two C=N bonds, yielding free methionine and the shortened polypeptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results presented above can be summarized as follows (Fig. 5). After the Schiff base forms, the N-acylamidine bond undergoes hydrolysis (c), cleaving the Cys–Met peptide bond and fragmenting the protein. Cyclization is followed by oxidation of the tyrosine side chain by molecular oxygen (similar to the reaction in GFP (23Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 24Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar)), yielding dehydrotyrosine.N,N′-disubstituted amidines usually exist in the two resonance forms shown. Protonation of the imino nitrogen of formc leads to resonance form d and a C=N double bond within the heterocycle. Amidines are strong bases (25Gautier J.A. Miocque M. Farmoux C.C. Patai S. The Chemistry of Amidines and Imidates. Interscience, New York1975: 87-93Google Scholar). The amidinium cation is a strong electron-withdrawing substituent, which shifts the absorbance of asFP595 to longer wavelengths as compared with GFP. Ionization of the phenolic group of dehydrotyrosine shown ine accounts for the yellow (λmax 430 nm) to red (λmax 535 nm) transition of the chromopeptide. Deprotonation of the amidinium cation abolishes the long-wavelength (red) form of the chromophore, yielding the product shown inf , which absorbs at 380 nm. As discussed above, under alkaline conditions asFP595 and the chromopeptide each display a 380-nm absorption, which declines over time as the chromophore degrades. We realized that if we could identify the degradation products we could reconstruct the chromophore structure. To this end, the purified chromopeptide was incubated in 1n NaOH in the dark at room temperature for 24 h, conditions that normally do not hydrolyze ordinary peptide bonds. Dansylation of the hydrolysis products revealed the presence of methionine, apparently the only amino acid liberated upon decomposition of the chromopeptide (Fig. 5 g). Dansylation followed by hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for 8 h at 105 °C showed that tyrosine is the N-terminal amino acid of a newly formed tetrapeptide (Fig. 5 g), although a much lower amount of glycine was also detected. Extensive hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for 24 h followed by dansylation yielded dansyl derivatives of Gly, Ser, and Lys. It should be mentioned that extensive acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of dehydrotyrosine yields p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and glycine (7Shimomura O. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 220-222Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar,8Cody C.W. Prasher D.C. Wastler W.M. Prendergast F.G. Ward W.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The conditions we routinely employ for liberating N-terminal residues labeled with dansyl chloride (hydrolysis for 8 h) might explain why tyrosine, although predominant, is not the only hydrolysis product; the treatment also liberates a small amount of glycine. Also, it should be noted that we were unable to distinguish dehydro-Tyr from Tyr-dansyl derivatives using thin-layer chromatography. Chromophore formation in asFP595 is unlike that in GFP or any other GFP-like protein studied to date. asFP595 is unique because after the autocatalyzed cyclization of its chromogenic amino acids, the polypeptide chain splits into two fragments with molecular masses of 8 and 20 kDa. Our results suggest that this fragmentation is a critical step in the maturation of asFP595. The purple protein splits when the Cys64–Met65bond adjacent to the chromophore is cleaved in an autocatalyzed reaction, the final step in protein maturation. Because all GFP-like proteins, including asFP595, possess an extraordinarily rigid structure, harsh denaturing conditions must be applied to study this phenomenon. Therefore, it was initially unclear to us whether the splitting is an inevitable consequence of inadequate treatment of the protein or whether fragmentation of asFP595 is a necessary step in protein maturation. To resolve these uncertainties, we optimized the conditions for denaturation and analyzed the chromophore-bearing peptides after proteolytic digestion. We found that alkaline conditions, sufficient for denaturation, lead to irreversible degradation of the asFP595 chromophore. In a mildly acidic solution, the protein denatures but the chromophore is chemically stable. Therefore, acid-induced denaturation followed by a short digestion with trypsin (at a high trypsin/protein ratio) at room temperature was selected as the optimal method for isolating the chromophore-bearing peptide of asFP595. Recently, Gross et al. (15Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) showed that the long-wavelength fluorescence of drFP583 can be explained by an additional autocatalytic dehydrogenation, a reaction that extends the system of overlappingp orbitals in the GFP-like chromophore. The dehydrogenation forms an acylimine at the 2nd position of the 4-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)-5-imidazolone. The acylimine bond exists only in the undenatured protein; harsh denaturation of drFP583 leads to hydrolysis of the acylamine, which is located at the Phe64–Gln65 junction (numbering based on GFP), the same position as the Cys64–Met65 cleavage in asFP595. The hydrolysis splits drFP583 into two fragments and causes the red chromophore to revert to its nascent green form. If the red-shifted absorbance of asFP595 had been a property of the full-length protein (as in drFP583), then the characteristic 430-nm absorbance must have been fully associated with the peptide with an uncleaved Cys–Met bond. However, fractionation of a trypsin digest of asFP595 by HPLC showed that the 430-nm absorbance distributes with the pentapeptide Met-Tyr-Gly-Ser-Lys. Our structural studies show that this sequence is located at the N terminus of a 20-kDa fragment produced when the Cys64–Met65 peptide bond breaks in the full-length protein. Thus, these results favor a model in which full-length asFP595 represents an immature form of the purple protein. In this model, fragmentation of asFP595 is a critical step in protein maturation. The chromophore structure presented here illustrates why fragmentation is crucial for the development of the mature asFP595 chromophore. The pK a values of theN-acyl-N,N′-disubstituted amidines, similar to those in Fig. 5 b, are considerably decreased in comparison with unacylated amidines (26Chua S.-O. Cook M.J. Katritzky A.R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; 5: 546-552Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This means the protonated amidinium cation is much more stable in mature (fragmented) asFP595 in which the N-acylamidine bond has been cleaved (Fig.5 c), which explains the bathochromic shift upon fragmentation. It should be noted that because the amidines have resonance forms, both nitrogens of the amidinium cation should lie in the plane of the conjugated system. According to our data, the chromopeptide from asFP595 does not contain an acylimine bond. (An acylimine bond is responsible for the red-shifted fluorescence of drFP583 (15Gross L.A. Baird G.S.

A. 2001; 98: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).) Hydrolysis of the acylimine bond would yield an amide of cysteine at the C terminus of the 8-kDa fragment. Carboxypeptidase A treatment of the 8-kDa fragment liberated cysteine but not cysteine amide. Carboxypeptidase A does not display amidase activity (29Stark, G. R., Methods in Enzymology, Hirs, C. H. W., Timashaff, S. N., 25, 1972, 103, 154, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar), and the absolute requirement for this enzyme is the presence of an amino acid in the terminal position with a free α-carboxyl group (30Petra, P. H., Methods in Enzymology, Perlmann, G. E., Lorand, L., 25, 1970, 460, 504, Academic Press, London.Google Scholar). Base-catalyzed opening of the chromophore heterocycle confirms the above data, showing that methionine α-nitrogen does not exist in the form of a cysteine amide-leaving group, but it is indeed located within the chromophore heterocycle. We interpret these discrepancies to mean that drFP583 and asFP595 mature by different pathways. Indeed, even after prolonged maturation, drFP583 still contains a substantial amount of GFP-like green chromophores (15Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 31Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). asFP595, on the other hand, exhibits no green fluorescence (or GFP-like absorbance) at any time during its maturation. Thus, it is likely that the green GFP-like chromophore in drFP583 is an intermediate in the maturation of red fluorescent protein. And although this intermediate is a prerequisite for forming the red chromophore, it does not seem to be a part of the pathway that leads to formation of the purple (asFP595) chromophore. This idea is supported by the spectra of the drFP583 and asFP595 denaturation products. When drFP583 is denatured at an alkaline pH, it displays a UV-visible absorbance spectrum similar to that of denatured GFP, demonstrating that the drFP583 chromophore is a derivative of imidazolidinone (15Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Under the same denaturing conditions, asFP595 yields a product absorbing at 380 nm. Shortly before this report was published, an unusually small GFP-like chromoprotein, asCP562 from A. sulcata, was described (32Wiedenmann J. Elke C. Spindler K.-D. Funke W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14091-14096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In comparing the predicted amino acid sequence of asCP562 with the known sequence of asFP595 (13Lukyanov K.A. Fradkov A.F. Gurskaya N.G. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Markelov M.L. Zaraisky A.G. Zhao X. Fang Y. Tan W. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25879-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we find that these proteins have an identical stretch of 131 amino acids at their N termini. Their cDNAs differ by four bases and one frameshift at the position corresponding to the 132nd amino acid residue (CCCC in asFP595 cDNA versus CCCCC in asCP562 cDNA). Armed with this information, we decided to study the maturation of truncated asFP595. We generated a pQE30-based clone expressing cDNA identical to the cDNA sequence reported for asCP562 (32Wiedenmann J. Elke C. Spindler K.-D. Funke W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14091-14096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The shortened protein, however, was completely colorless. In light of this result, we believe that Wiedenmann et al. (32Wiedenmann J. Elke C. Spindler K.-D. Funke W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14091-14096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have misinterpreted the asCP562 length because of a sequencing mistake. Consequently, the observed 19.1-kDa band for asCP562 does not comprise the N-terminal sequence of asFP595 but presumably corresponds to the C-terminal 20-kDa fragment of mature asFP595 (see Fig. 1). Interpreted this way, the results reported by Wiedenmann et al. support our finding that fragmentation plays a critical role in the development of asFP595 red shift. They have shown that only the 19-kDa band exhibits red-shifted fluorescence associated with the native protein. We thank Natalya I. Khoroshilova for the perfect experiments with dansyl derivatives of amino acids, Arkady F. Fradkov for cloning of the truncated asFP595 cDNA, and Alexander S. Arseniev for fruitful discussion.

https://openalex.org/W2064884184,"To identify new effectors of IgE receptor (FcεRI) signaling, we purified proteins from FcεRI-stimulated RBL-2H3 rat mast cells on anti-phosphotyrosine beads and generated mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against these proteins. Two mAbs bound to a protein that was identified as a new isoform of phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) after screening an RBL-2H3 cDNA expression library. This isoform differed from PLSCR1 by the absence of an exon 3-encoded sequence and by an insert coding six QGPY(P/A)GP repeats. The PLSCR family of proteins is responsible for a redistribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane. Although rat PLSCR is a 37-kDa protein, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots revealed the presence of 37–49 kDa phosphoproteins in the material immunoprecipitated with either anti-PLSCR mAb but not with unrelated monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Depletion of PLSCR resulted in the absence of these phosphoproteins. Additional experiments led to the identification of these phosphoproteins as phospho-PLSCR itself. Stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells upon FcεRI engagement resulted in a dramatic increase in PLSCR tyrosine phosphorylation. A comparison of the relative amounts of phospho-PLSCR and nonphosphorylated PLSCR demonstrated that only a tiny fraction was thus modified, indicating a finely targeted involvement of PLSCR in FcεRI signaling. Thus, this study reports the cloning of a new isoform of PLSCR, as well as the first observation that a member of the PLSCR family is a target for tyrosine kinases and is involved in signaling by an immune receptor. These findings open new perspectives on the role of phospholipid scramblases and to the mechanisms involved in their regulation.AY024347 To identify new effectors of IgE receptor (FcεRI) signaling, we purified proteins from FcεRI-stimulated RBL-2H3 rat mast cells on anti-phosphotyrosine beads and generated mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against these proteins. Two mAbs bound to a protein that was identified as a new isoform of phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) after screening an RBL-2H3 cDNA expression library. This isoform differed from PLSCR1 by the absence of an exon 3-encoded sequence and by an insert coding six QGPY(P/A)GP repeats. The PLSCR family of proteins is responsible for a redistribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane. Although rat PLSCR is a 37-kDa protein, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots revealed the presence of 37–49 kDa phosphoproteins in the material immunoprecipitated with either anti-PLSCR mAb but not with unrelated monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Depletion of PLSCR resulted in the absence of these phosphoproteins. Additional experiments led to the identification of these phosphoproteins as phospho-PLSCR itself. Stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells upon FcεRI engagement resulted in a dramatic increase in PLSCR tyrosine phosphorylation. A comparison of the relative amounts of phospho-PLSCR and nonphosphorylated PLSCR demonstrated that only a tiny fraction was thus modified, indicating a finely targeted involvement of PLSCR in FcεRI signaling. Thus, this study reports the cloning of a new isoform of PLSCR, as well as the first observation that a member of the PLSCR family is a target for tyrosine kinases and is involved in signaling by an immune receptor. These findings open new perspectives on the role of phospholipid scramblases and to the mechanisms involved in their regulation.AY024347 phosphatydylserine bovine serum albumin IgE receptor type I Hanks' buffer saline solution supplemented with BSA and Tris monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline solution PBS containing octyl glucopyranoside phospholipid scramblase Src homology domain protein kinase C Tris-buffered saline solution containing Tween Plasma membranes have an asymmetric lipid distribution. Whereas both plasma membrane leaflets are composed mainly of choline-containing phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin), the inner leaflet is enriched relative to the outer leaflet in primary amine-containing phospholipids (phosphatidylserine (PS),1 and phosphatidylethanolamine). This asymmetry is actively maintained by two ATP-dependent enzymes: a phospholipid translocase that selectively transports aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet; and a floppase that moves all phospholipids in the opposite direction (1Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the maintenance of this energy-consuming unbalance in membrane composition is unveiled when this asymmetry is disrupted. When cells undergo apoptosis, translocase and floppase become inactivated, and a phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR), an enzyme that moves all phospholipids bi-directionally, becomes activated (1Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The consequence is a loss of phospholipid asymmetry with a resulting increase in PS expression in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The apoptotic cell is then recognized and engulfed by phagocytes expressing receptors for PS that confer both recognition and phagocytic capabilities to these cells (2Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Yet, the role of phospholipid scrambling is not restricted to apoptosis. In blood platelets and vascular endothelial cells, activation induces an increase in the surface expression of PS that in turn activates coagulation enzymes (3Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Harmsma M. Zwaal R.F. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 973-986PubMed Google Scholar). In at least one instance of bleeding disorder known as Scott syndrome, a defect in coagulation was related to a defect in scramblase activity in intact cells (4Weiss H.J. Vicic W.J. Lages B.A. Rogers J. Am. J. Med. 1979; 67: 206-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 5Rosing J. Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Hemker H.C. van Dieijen G. Weiss H.J. Zwaal R.F. Blood. 1985; 65: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another role for phospholipid scrambling is suggested by the increased surface expression of PS after mast cell activation (6Demo S.D. Masuda E. Rossi A.B. Throndset B.T. Gerard A.L. Chan E.H. Armstrong R.J. Fox B.P. Lorens J.B. Payan D.G. Scheller R.H. Fisher J.M.

Allergy Immunol. 2000; 123: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These cells are involved in innate immunity; they are able to phagocytose and kill pathogens, recruit leukocytes and lymphocytes through cytokine production, and present antigen to immunocompetent cells (8Mekori Y.A. Metcalfe D.D. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These cells are also involved in allergic reactions; they express receptors with high affinity for IgE (FcεRI) that, when aggregated by specific IgE and allergen, trigger mast cell degranulation with the release of vasoactive amines (such as histamine) and proteases, and production of proinflammatory mediators (such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins) and cytokines (9Siraganian R.P. Middletown Jr., E. Reed C.E. Ellis E.F. Adkinson Jr., N.F. Yunginger J.W. Busse W.W. Allergy: Principles and Practice. I. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1993: 105-134Google Scholar). So far, four PLSCR (numbered 1–4) have been cloned in humans and three (numbered 1–3) in the mouse, demonstrating the existence of a family of PLSCR (10Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequence of all the members of the PLSCR family shows that they are type II membrane proteins with strong homology for the transmembrane domain and for most of the intracellular domain. This strongly suggests that these domains represent the portion of the molecule that accounts for scramblase activity. The extracellular domain is not conserved among members and is extremely short or absent, suggesting it plays no, or little, role in scrambling activity. Interestingly, the intracellular amino terminus is extremely variable in length and composition among members of the PLSCR family. It is thus possible that it serves as a regulatory domain for the scrambling activity or that it serves additional functions unrelated to scrambling. In this regard, it should be noted that counterstructures for Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are present in this region of the molecule for most members of the family. Original studies focusing on the regulation of PLSCR activity demonstrated that it is dependent on calcium (11Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Yet most of these studies were performed with purified PLSCR reconstituted into liposomes (11Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 12Comfurius P. Williamson P. Smeets E.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), i.e. away from other potential regulatory elements. Today many data from the literature point to other regulatory mechanisms of PLSCR activation. PS exposure correlates with the level of PLSCR expressed in cells stimulated with a calcium ionophore (14Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6603-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) but not when the cells are stimulated by a more physiologic stimulus (15Fadeel B. Gleiss B. Hogstrand K. Chandra J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Henter J.I. Orrenius S. Samali A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The calcium concentration required for the onset of scramblase activity is higher when this enzyme is reconstituted into inside-out vesicles than into liposomes (13Basse F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) suggesting that elements associated with the plasma membrane might negatively regulate the enzyme. In Scott syndrome, although phospholipid scrambling is impaired, the level of PLSCR1 in blood cells is normal, the nucleotide sequence of PLSCR1 shows no mutation, and its activity after purification and reconstitution into liposomes is normal (16Stout J.G. Basse F. Luhm R.A. Weiss H.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2232-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T.

Haemost. 1999; 81: 322-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Additional data suggest that regulatory elements rather than PLSCR itself are impaired in this syndrome (19Dachary-Prigent J.

Dicker I. Weiss H.J. Zwaal R.F. Bevers E.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 2133-2138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mast cells, externalization of PS induced by FcεRI-mediated cell activation is transient (7Martin S. Pombo I. Poncet P. David B. Arock M. Blank U. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 123: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), revealing the action of down-regulatory elements. Furthermore, in these cells, the increase in free intracellular calcium after FcεRI aggregation is at most 1 μm (21Beaven M.A. Rogers J. Moore J.P. Hesketh T.R. Smith G.A. Metcalfe J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7129-7136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), far from the millimolar range required to activate purified PLSCR in vitro (13Basse F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). More direct evidences for regulations that are not limited to calcium have been recently reported. Thus, PLSCR is a target for protein kinase C (PKC) δ; when phosphorylated by the latter, the former has an increased activity (22Frasch S.C. Henson P.M. Kailey J.M. Richter D.A. Janes M.S. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that palmitoylation of PLSCR potentiates its activation by calcium (23Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we have cloned a new member of the PLSCR family expressed in rat mast cells using specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We demonstrate that, upon aggregation of FcεRI, PLSCR shows dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, PLSCR is a target for tyrosine kinase activity and is involved in signaling by an immune receptor. The significance of these observations is discussed. Fifteen 150-cm2 culture flasks containing ∼5 × 108 RBL-2H3 cells altogether were washed twice with HBT (Hanks' buffer saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2) and stimulated with 100 ng/ml anti-rat FcεRIα mAb BC4 (a generous gift from Dr. R. Siraganian, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) in HBT for 10 min. After two washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), the cells were lysed in 2 ml/flask of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 250 kallikrein-inactivating unit/ml aprotinin and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). After 10 min on ice, the cell lysate was recovered by scraping, and the post-nuclear supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 3 ml of a mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs 4G10 coupled to agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and PY20 coupled to agarose beads (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). After 4 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C, the beads were washed six times at 4 °C with 10 ml of lysis buffer, followed by two washes with 10 ml of PBS, and two washes with 10 ml of PBS containing 30 mmoctyl-glucopyranoside (PBS-O, Sigma-Aldrich). The beads were then eluted twice by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C on a rotating wheel in 3 ml of PBS-O containing 40 mm phenylphosphate. The eluates were pooled and concentrated to 50–100 μl. After each purification, the quality of the material was controlled in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots. The eluates were found to be specific because, in contrast to phenylphosphate elution, no protein was eluted by PBS-O alone as observed after silver staining. After elution, the beads were regenerated by two 30-min elutions with 1 m NaCl and conserved at 4 °C in 0.2 m borate-buffered saline solution, pH 8. A BALB/c mouse was hyperimmunized with the phosphoproteins by several injections of the eluates into the footpads. A new batch of eluate was prepared immediately before each injection. The first injection was in 200 μl of a 1:1 mixture with complete Freund's adjuvant, the second was a week later in a 1:1 mixture with incomplete Freund's adjuvant, and the next four injections were at 1-week intervals in PBS. One day after the last injection the mouse was sacrificed, the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes were excised, the cells were fused with Ag8.653 myeloma cells, and the resulting hybridomas were selected as described (24Monteiro R.C. Cooper M.D. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1764-1770PubMed Google Scholar). After selection, hybridomas were frozen and their culture supernatants conserved at 4 °C in 0.1% NaN3 for screening. Screening was completed by an immunoblotting approach. Purified phosphoproteins were resolved in 4–15% polyacrylamide two-dimensional minigels (Bio-Rad), and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in TTBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 4% BSA and inserted in the mini-Protean® II Multiscreen apparatus (Bio-Rad), and each channel was filled with 600 μl of a 1:30 dilution of hybridoma supernatant in TTBS containing 0.5% BSA (TTBS-BSA). Fifteen supernatants were screened per membrane, and each supernatant was tested with phosphoproteins resolved under reducing and nonreducing conditions. After a 1-h incubation, each channel was washed twice with 10 ml TTBS. The membranes were then incubated for 1 h with a 1:30,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in TTBS-BSA. After three washes in TTBS, proteins were visualized with the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit from Pierce, and the membranes were exposed for autoradiography with X-OMAT films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Hybridomas corresponding to selected positive supernatants were thawed and subcloned, each set of subclones being screened likewise. Immunoglobulin G in cell culture supernatants or in ascitis fluid supernatants from selected positive subclones were purified on protein G-coupled beads, and a fraction was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (both beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The mAbs used in this study (129.2, 17.3, and 9.18) were all IgG1. Total RNA was extracted from RBL-2H3 cells with TRIZOLTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). mRNA was purified with the Messenger RNA Isolation kit from which 5 μg were used to construct a cDNA library in λZAP with the ZAP-cDNA®Gigapack® III Gold Cloning kit, both kits from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All procedures were done according to the corresponding manufacturer's recommendations. Three million cDNA-independent clones were obtained. Screening with purified mAb 129.2 of 4.5 × 105cDNA clones in λZAP was performed after infection of XL1 Blue-MRF′ bacteria, spreading onto agar plates, induction of protein synthesis by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and protein transfer by adsorption onto cellulose membrane. After extensive washings in TTBS containing 0.1% NaN3, membranes were saturated by an overnight incubation in TTBS containing 4% BSA and blotted for 1 h with 10 μg/ml mAb129.2 in TTBS-BSA. After washings of the membranes, the latter were incubated for 1 h with a 1:30,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies in TTBS-BSA. After several washes, the positive clones were visualized with the SuperSignal kit from Pierce and exposed for autoradiography. Positive clones were plugged out from the agar plates and sequentially subjected to two additional rounds of screening to obtain complete isolation of the clones. The cDNA were excised in pBlueScript from the λZAP genome according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing of the two strands of the cDNA was performed by automated sequencing by Genome Express (Paris, France). Alignments were done with the Dialign 2.1 program (25Morgenstern B. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and edited with Boxshade 3.33c. RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as published (26Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Routine stimulation was as follows. 1 × 106cells/well were plated in 6-well plates overnight with or without a 1:1000 dilution of an ascitic fluid supernatant of anti-2,4-dinitrophenol monoclonal IgE, DNP-48 (a kind gift of Dr. R. Siraganian, National Institutes of Health). After two washes in HBT, the cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml 2,4-dinitrophenol-human serum albumin in HBT for 30 min at 37 °C. Peritoneal mast cells were purified to 95% purity from 250-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Janvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France) according to Ref. 27Wells E. Mann J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar. After stimulation and two washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed on ice in 200 μl of lysis buffer. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the cell lysate was recovered by scraping, and the post-nuclear supernatant was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of the indicated anti-rat PLSCR mAb-coupled beads. After six washes of the beads with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated material was eluted by boiling in 50 μl of Laemmli loading buffer. Half the eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting following procedures already described (28Benhamou M. Ryba N.J. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with mAb PY20 coupled to horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:2500; Transduction Laboratories) or with mAb 129.2, 17.3, or 9.18 at 1 μg/ml followed by goat anti-mouse Ig coupled to horseradish peroxidase. In some cases the membranes were stripped by three washes for 5 min in methanol before reprobing. Where indicated, the samples were not transferred and the gel was subjected to silver staining. For reprecipitation experiments, immunoprecipitated proteins were first eluted by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 1% SDS. The eluate was quenched by the addition of 950 μl of lysis buffer and reprecipitated for 2 h with 20 μl of mAb 129.2-coupled beads. After six washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, the final elution was in 50 μl of boiling Laemmli loading buffer. Anti-PLSCR mAb 129.2 binds the intracellular portion of rat PLSCR. Therefore, cells had to be permeabilized in immunofluorescence studies carried out with this mAb. RBL-2H3 cells grown on slides were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed by a 20-min incubation in cold 3% paraformaldehyde. After 2 washes for 10 min each in PBS, the cells were incubated for 10 min in 0.1 m glycine in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized by a 30-min incubation in 0.05% saponin in PBS containing 0.2% BSA at room temperature. Cells were labeled thereafter by the addition of 50 μg/ml anti-rat PLSCR mAb 129.2 or control IgG1. One hour later, cells were washed three times in PBS/saponin/BSA before a 45-min incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS/BSA without saponin and incubated for 5 min with 2 μg/ml Texas Red-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). This latter incubation was performed to visualize membrane labeling. After three final washes in PBS/BSA, the slides were fixed and the cells were examined in a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510 Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). As a means of identifying new protein targets for tyrosine kinases in FcεRI-stimulated mast cells, the bulk of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from FcεRI-stimulated RBL-2H3 mast cells was purified with anti-phosphotyrosine-coupled beads and specifically eluted with phenyl phosphate. MAbs were raised against these proteins and, after screening of 750 hybridoma clones, 10 groups totaling 105 positive clones were identified, each group recognizing a different phosphoprotein of defined Mr. mAbs directed against a protein that migrated at ∼40 kDa in 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels were selected first. One of these, mAb 129.2, was used to screen an RBL-2H3 cDNA expression library constructed in λZAP. Seven independent positive cDNA clones were isolated from 4.5 × 105clones. One of these positive clones, clone 312, was fully sequenced. It was 1.6 kilobase pairs in length and included the complete 3′-untranslated region, the complete coding sequence of a 335-amino acid protein, and part of the 5′-untranslated region (Fig.1 A). A rat EST sequence was found in the GenBankTM nucleotide data bank (accession number AA924029) that was identical to the stretch extending from nucleotide 1056 to 1436 in clone 312 (data not shown). Matching the translated sequence from clone 312 against the translated GenBankTM nucleotide data bank also showed that it was most homologous to human (68% identity; GenBankTM accession numbers AF098642 and AB006746) and mouse (84% identity; GenBankTM accession number AF159593) PLSCR1 (Fig.1 B). Yet, two major differences are apparent. The human gene for PLSCR1 is composed of 9 exons, the third one coding for the sequence extending from Asn-5 to Gln-31 (10Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This sequence is absent in rat PLSCR (Fig. 1 B). Rat PLSCR also contains an additional sequence made of six QGPY(P/A)GP repeats (Fig.1 B). Although this sequence is reminiscent of repeats present in the sequence of collagens, its function remains so far unknown. Thus, it appears that the rat PLSCR that we have cloned is related to, but distinct from, PLSCR1. Analysis of the six remaining positive clones by partial sequencing and/or restriction digest indicated that all were also full-length cDNA clones of the same gene (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence analyzed with the TMpred program at the ISREC server was consistent with a type II transmembrane protein with a short extracellular domain (Fig.1 B). It contains an intracellular calcium-binding domain (29Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2356-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), multiple cysteines that are potential targets for palmitoylation (23Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and three P-(X)4-P-(X)2-P domains that could associate with SH3 domains (Fig. 1 B). A PKC target consensus sequence (RXXTXR) is conserved at Thr-178. These combined features are found in the sequence of many members of the PLSCR family (10Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Kasukabe T. Kobayashi H. Kaneko Y. Okabe-Kado J. Honma Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of rat PLSCR showed a single band of Mr 37,000 (Fig.2 A) corresponding to the size expected from the deduced amino acid sequence. In some instances, a doublet was observed that could be the result of degradation by proteases. Identical results were obtained from purified rat peritoneal mast cells, further confirming that rat PLSCR indeed is expressed in rat mast cells (Fig. 2 A). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that, in contrast to control IgG1, anti-rat PLSCR mAb 129.2 labeled RBL-2H3 cells with a pattern that was consistent with a membrane location of the protein (Fig. 2 B, panel D). This was further confirmed by colocalization experiments carried out with wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin that binds extracellular domains of glycosylated membrane proteins (Fig.2 B, panels E and F). Since the anti-rat PLSCR antibodies had been generated by immunization with proteins purified with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we wished to know whether this protein is phosphorylated in RBL-2H3 cells. To that effect, immunoprecipitations were performed with mAb 129.2, and the eluted phosphoproteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20. Heterogeneous phosphoproteins of 37–49 kDa were observed that did not comigrate with PLSCR as observed in anti-rat PLSCR immunoblots of the precipitates (Fig.3). These phosphoproteins were also precipitated with another anti-rat PLSCR mAb from the same group, mAb 17.3 but not with mAb 9.18 that recognizes a 130-kDa phosphoprotein (Fig. 3) and not with numerous other mAb or polyclonal mouse IgG of irrelevant specificities (data not shown). In addition, when the cell lysate was first depleted of its PLSCR content by immunoprecipitation with mAb 129.2 followed by a second immunoprecipitation procedure with either mAb 17.3 (Fig. 3) or 129.2 (data not shown), the phosphoproteins were no longer detected. Thus, these proteins seemed to associate directly or indirectly with rat PLSCR. To determine whether FcεRI-mediated cell activation affected the phosphorylation of these phosphoproteins and of PLSCR, RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with IgE and antigen for 30 min. The material recovered from anti-rat PLSCR immunoprecipitates was analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots. A dramatic increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphoproteins was clearly observed (Fig.4). This increase was observed in mAb 17.3 (Fig. 4) as well as in mAb 129.2 (data not shown) immunoprecipitates. Yet, no clear-cut result was obtained regarding the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR because, here again, the phosphoproteins did not comigrate with the latter. Thus, up to that point, we had not been able to determine whether rat PLSCR was actually phosphorylated on tyrosine. To solve this question, we first immunoprecipitated PLSCR with its supposedly associated phosphoproteins, dissociated the complex by boiling for 5 min in 1% SDS, and reprecipitated PLSCR from the eluted material. Analysis of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins showed a pattern identical to that of the phosphoproteins recovered without prior dissociation of the complex (Fig. 5 A). It became apparent therefore that the phosphoproteins were not precipitated through their association with rat PLSCR but through direct binding of anti-rat PLSCR mAb. Thus, the phosphoproteins could be PLSCR itself. To determine definitely whether the phosphoproteins were in fact phospho-PLSCR, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were purified from a large number of stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, concentrated and analyzed in anti-rat PLSCR immunoblots. An identical band of heterogeneous proteins of 37–49 kDa was observed in these samples and in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of anti-rat PLSCR immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 B). As a control, mAb 9.18 immunoblots of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates showed the expected 130-kDa phosphoprotein but not the 37–49 kDa proteins (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the phosphoproteins are in fact phospho-PLSCR. Rat PLSCR was readily detected in silver staining of immunoprecipitates from 2 × 106 cells, whereas phospho-PLSCR was not (Fig. 5 C), demonstrating that only a very small fraction of this protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine. This explains the lack of detection of phospho-PLSCR in mAb 129.2 (or 17.3) immunoblotting of anti-rat PLSCR immunoprecipitates. This suggests that only finely targeted PLSCR are involved in FcεRI signaling. The difference between the Mr of nonphosphorylated PLSCR and the Mr of phospho-PLSCR could follow from different causes. It is well known that phosphorylation of proteins can result in retarded migration in gels. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of rat PLSCR could result in a heterogeneous and retarded apparent Mr, which could be observed all the more if rat PLSCR is additionally phosphorylated on threonine by protein kinase Cδ (22Frasch S.C. Henson P.M. Kailey J.M. Richter D.A. Janes M.S. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Of interest, PKCδ is involved in FcεRI signaling (31Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Germano P. Gomez J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another reason for the retardedMr observed could be the potential multiple palmitoylations of rat PLSCR on the numerous clusters of cysteines that are present in the molecule (Ref. 23Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B). Additional studies will be necessary to determine the degree of palmitoylation of PLSCR in rat mast cells. Thus, it is likely that combined post-transcriptional modifications account for the large and heterogeneous shift in the Mr of a fraction of PLSCR after FcεRI engagement. The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR could be related to the known ability of this family of proteins to promote a redistribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane (11Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Indeed, activation of mast cells through FcεRI leads to transient externalization of PS that correlates with degranulation (6Demo S.D. Masuda E. Rossi A.B. Throndset B.T. Gerard A.L. Chan E.H.

Blank U. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 123: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although it is known that externalization of PS is not dependent on tyrosine kinases in erythrocytes stimulated by calcium ionophores (20Dekkers D.W. Comfurius P. Vuist W.M. Billheimer J.T. Dicker I. Weiss H.J. Zwaal R.F. Bevers E.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 2133-2138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this dependence could be true in mast cells stimulated through FcεRI. Indeed, it is also well known that tyrosine kinases are important for IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation (33Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PLSCR tyrosine phosphorylation could be involved in the down-regulation of FcεRI-induced phospholipid scrambling, because the latter is transient in mast cells (7Martin S. Pombo I. Poncet P. David B. Arock M. Blank U. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 123: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Another possible role for PLSCR phosphorylation could be to make this protein serve as an adaptor for other effector molecules. It contains three proline-rich domains that could associate with SH3 domains on other proteins, and its location could be used by the FcεRI-generated signal to target SH2 domain-containing effector molecules at the plasma membrane. All of these possibilities are under active investigation with the use of mutant and chimeric proteins. In summary, this study reports the cloning of a new member of the PLSCR family and the first observation that a member of this family is a target for tyrosine kinases and is involved in signaling by an immune receptor. This opens new perspectives pertaining to the role of phospholipid scramblases and to the mechanisms involved in their regulation. We gratefully acknowledge Y. Goureau and B.

https://openalex.org/W2016882447,"DNA adducts formed by platinum-based anticancer drugs interfere with DNA replication. The carrier ligand of the platinum compound is likely to affect the conformation of the Pt-DNA adducts. In addition, the conformation of the adduct can also change upon binding of damaged DNA to the active site of DNA polymerase. From the crystal structures of pol β ternary complexes it is evident that undamaged gapped and primed single-stranded (non-gapped) DNA templates exist in very different conformations when bound to pol β. Therefore, one might expect that the constraints imposed on the damaged templates by binding to the polymerase active site should also affect the conformation of the Pt-DNA adducts and their ability to inhibit DNA replication. In support of this hypothesis we have found that the efficiency, carrier ligand specificity, site of discrimination (3′-G versus 5′-G of the Pt-GG adducts), and fidelity of translesion synthesis past Pt-DNA adducts by pol β are strongly affected by the structure of the DNA template. Previous studies have suggested that the conformation of Pt-DNA adducts may be affected by the sequence context of the adduct. In support of this hypothesis, our data show that sequence context affects the efficiency, fidelity, and pattern of misincorporation by pol β.

Therefore, one might expect that the constraints imposed on the damaged templates by binding to the polymerase active site should also affect the conformation of the Pt-DNA adducts and their ability to inhibit DNA replication. In support of this hypothesis we have found that the efficiency, carrier ligand specificity, site of discrimination (3′-G versus 5′-G of the Pt-GG adducts), and fidelity of translesion synthesis past Pt-DNA adducts by pol β are strongly affected by the structure of the DNA template. Previous studies have suggested that the conformation of Pt-DNA adducts may be affected by the sequence context of the adduct. In support of this hypothesis, our data show that sequence context affects the efficiency, fidelity, and pattern of misincorporation by pol β. cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II) (trans-R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum(II) (trans-R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexanedichloroplatinum(II) (trans-R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane polymerase human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase high mobility group Platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs exert their cytotoxic effect through binding to DNA.cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II)(cisplatin)1(Fig. 1), which has been broadly used for cancer treatment since 1978, and (trans-R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum(II) (oxaliplatin) (Fig. 1), which is currently in clinical trial in the United States and has been approved in several European countries for the treatment of tumors with intrinsic and acquired resistance to cisplatin, both form the same types adducts on the DNA (1Eastman A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 2Woynarowski J.M. Chapman W.G. Napier C. Herzig M.C.S. Juniewicz P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the most prevalent lesions created by interaction of both these agents with DNA are bifunctional intrastrand 1,2-d(GpG) cross-links, these adducts differ in the carrier ligands they retain upon binding to DNA. Pt-DNA adducts formed by oxaliplatin contain (trans-R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (dach) carrier ligands, whereas the adducts formed by cisplatin containcis-diammine carrier ligands. Structures of the DNA containing cisplatin-GG adducts determined by NMR and x-ray crystallography reveal significant distortion of base pairs in the vicinity of the adduct (3Gelasco A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9230-9239Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 4Herman F. Kozelka J. Stoven V. Guittet E. Girault J.P. Huynh-Dinh T. Igolen J. Lallemand J.Y. Chottard J.C. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12912-12920Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, both the crystallographic and NMR structures show that the cisplatin adduct causes a large positive roll in the helix resulting in compression of the major groove and widening of the minor groove. Although the conformation of oxaliplatin-GG adducts has not yet been determined experimentally, a recent molecular modeling study suggests that the overall conformation of cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-GG adducts are likely to be very similar. However, the bulky dach ring of the oxaliplatin adduct fills much of the DNA major groove, causing it to be narrower and less polar in the area of the adduct. These subtle differences in overall DNA conformation appear to influence the biological effects of the Pt-DNA adducts. Thus, both the mismatch repair complex (7Fink D. Nebel S. Aebi S. Zheng H. Cenni B. Nehme A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4881-4886PubMed Google Scholar) and high mobility group proteins (8Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) bind more strongly to cisplatin-GG adducts than to oxaliplatin-GG adducts. In addition, eukaryotic DNA polymerases β, γ, ζ, and η bypass oxaliplatin-GG adducts more readily than cisplatin-GG adducts (8Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Finally, the misincorporation frequency of DNA polymerase β (pol β) is slightly greater with oxaliplatin-GG adducts than with cisplatin-GG adducts on primed single-stranded DNA (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These data suggest that differences in the conformation of oxaliplatin- and cisplatin-GG adducts can affect both the efficiency and fidelity of translesion synthesis by DNA polymerases, which could at least partially account for differences in the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of these Pt-DNA adducts. The conformation of Pt-DNA adducts in the active site of DNA polymerases is likely to be different from that of adducted DNA in solution. The fact that DNA templates are often bent upon binding to the active site of DNA polymerases (11Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. Nat. Struct. Biology. 1998; 5: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) supports this hypothesis. Unfortunately, whereas the conformation of mutagenic DNA adducts has been determined on a variety of duplex DNAs in solution, relatively little is known about how binding of the DNA templates to a polymerase active site affects the conformation of the adduct and/or the nascent base pair. The conformation of Pt-DNA adducts is clearly not identical in all DNA polymerase active sites. Whereas pol β, γ, ζ, and η all bypass oxaliplatin adducts better than cisplatin adducts, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase does not discriminate between cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts (8Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, pol β, γ, ζ, and η differ in the site of replication termination, the site of discrimination between cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-GG adducts (the 3′-G or the 5′-G) and the pattern of misincorporation opposite the adduct (8Vaisman A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The conformation of the 6 nucleotide-gapped template bound to pol β has not been directly determined but is likely to be different from the conformation of primed single-stranded DNA bound to pol β (12Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Studies on the efficiency, specificity (cisplatinversus oxaliplatin), and fidelity of translesion synthesis by pol β on primed single-stranded and 6 nucleotide-gapped templates also suggest that the manner in which the adduct binds to the active site of the DNA polymerase could have significant biological consequences. For example, pol β catalyzes 2.5-fold more translesion synthesis past oxaliplatin adducts than past cisplatin adducts in experiments using single-stranded DNA, but does not appear to differentiate between cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts during 6 nucleotide gap filling DNA synthesis (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, the type of the DNA template used also influences the effect of platinum adducts on the nucleotide insertion fidelity of pol β (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation with 6 nucleotide-gapped templates, the conformations of both primed single-stranded and single nucleotide-gapped templates bound to the active site of pol β are known and are quite different. For the primed single-stranded template, the double-stranded region is bound to the enzyme, whereas the single-stranded region does not interact with the polymerase and thus, has considerable flexibility (13Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). With a single nucleotide-gapped template both ends of the gap are bound to enzyme, resulting in a 90° bend in the template (12Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 14Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Steady-state and presteady-state kinetic analyses (15Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have shown that the catalytic efficiency and nucleotide insertion fidelity of pol β are strongly influenced by the type of DNA substrate (gapped versus non-gapped). Even though only the structure of primed single-stranded template is likely to be relevant to translesion synthesis by pol β in vivo, usage of conformationally different DNA templates should serve as a good model system to study influence of template structure on translesion synthesis. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate how the use of single nucleotide-gapped DNA templates would affect the efficiency, carrier ligand specificity, and nucleotide insertion fidelity of DNA synthesis past Pt-DNA adducts by pol β. Primer-templates were constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (8Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, platination reactions were carried out with aquated derivatives of cisplatin (Sigma) and the active biotransformation product of oxaliplatin, Pt(dach)Cl2 (provided by Dr. S. D. Wyrick, UNC). Platination of a 12-mer oligonucleotide containing a single GG sequence within a StuI restriction site (TCTAGGCCTTCT) was performed for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark with a 2:1 drug/oligonucleotide ratio. The oligonucleotides containing single platinum adducts were separated from unplatinated oligonucleotides by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The templates used for primer extension and steady-state kinetic experiments are listed in Fig. 1. DNA templates (44-mer), with or without platinum adduct, were constructed as described previously (8Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, platinated 12-mer or undamaged 12-mer (used for assembling control DNA templates) were ligated with the 14-mer on the 5′-end and an 18-mer on the 3′-end of the template using a 35-mer scaffold. After 16 h of ligation at 16 °C by T4 DNA ligase, templates were restricted by StuI to ensure the absence of any unplatinated oligonucleotides and purified on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Control experiments were performed to ensure the purity of platinated templates as described previously (8Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The 24- or 25-mer primers were 32P 5′-end-labeled. The downstream oligonucleotides (19- and 18-mer) used to form single nucleotide-gapped templates were 5′-end phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP. DNA substrates were prepared by annealing undamaged or platinated 44-mer templates with primers and downstream oligonucleotides at a 1.2:1:2 molar ratio. Annealing efficiencies were >99%, as evidenced by the different mobility of the 32P-labeled primers before and after hybridization to the template on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Recombinant human pol β was generously provided by Dr. S. Wilson (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). The steady-state kinetic parametersK m and V max for dCTP incorporation were measured as a function of deoxynucleotide concentration (17Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Single nucleotide-gapped DNA templates (150 fmol) were incubated at 37 °C in 10 μl-reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmNaCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, 5 fmol of pol β, and variable concentrations of dCTP. To determine the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation opposite the 3′-G, dCTP concentrations ranged from 1 to 8 μm for the undamaged template and from 16 to 256 μm for the platinated templates. To determine efficiency of nucleotide incorporation opposite the 5′-G, dCTP concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 0.5 μm for the undamaged template, from 16 to 256 μm for the cisplatin-containing templates and from 0.25 to 4 μm for the oxaliplatin-containing template. Reactions were terminated by mixing with 0.7 volumes of formamide-loading dye containing 500 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue in 90% formamide and were then immediately transferred onto ice for 5 min. Products were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8 m urea, 16% acrylamide, 4 h at 2000 V) and then visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Initial time-course studies indicated that under standard conditions product formation was linear (i.e. conforms to steady-state kinetics) for up to 4 min. Therefore, reactions were performed for 1 min for control DNA templates and for 2 min for platinated DNA templates. Less than 20% of the primers were extended under these conditions. The velocity of dCTP incorporation opposite the template 3′-G and 5′-G sites was determined as described previously (17Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).V max (the maximum reaction velocity) andK m (dCTP concentration at which the reaction velocity is half-maximal) were determined from a Hanes-Woolf plot by linear least squares fit (18Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Values for the apparentkcat were calculated based on the assumption that pol β was fully active. The efficiency of nucleotide insertion by pol β was calculated askcat/K m. To facilitate comparison of values for different platinum adducts, the relative insertion efficiency frel was calculated asfrel = (kcat/K m for Pt)/(kcat/K m for control). Because the steady-state kinetic analysis utilized in these experiments produces an apparent rather than a true V max(17Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), V max and kcatvalues in the literature are reported in a variety of units. Thekcat values we report were obtained by dividingV max (in nm primer extended per min) by the enzyme concentration (0.5 nm). To compare these data with the V max andV max/Km values reported in our previous kinetic analysis of translesion synthesis by pol β with different DNA templates (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), these kcat andkcat/Km values must be divided by 30. To compare these data with V max values reported as nm min−1, thesekcat values must be multiplied by 5. To compare the pattern of misincorporation opposite Pt-GG adducts on primed single-stranded and gapped DNA templates, primer extension assays were performed using each dNTP individually as described previously (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DNA templates (200 fmol expressed as primer termini) were incubated with 5 fmol of pol β at 37 °C for 30 min in 10-μl reactions containing 5 mm of each dNTP individually. To measure nucleotide misinsertion opposite Pt-GG adducts, 150 fmol of single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrates were incubated with 5 fmol of pol β and variable concentrations of dTTP or dATP. Reactions were performed for 5 min for undamaged DNA templates and 10 min for platinated DNA templates. dTTP concentrations ranged from 5 to 100 μmfor undamaged and from 250 to 5000 μm for platinated templates. dATP concentrations ranged from 25 to 400 μmfor undamaged and from 200 to 3600 μm for platinated templates. The kinetics of nucleotide misincorporation opposite platinated and undamaged GG sites were determined as described above. The misinsertion frequency (f mis) was determined as the ratio of insertion efficiencies (kcat/K m) for incorrect and correct nucleotides. The relative misinsertion frequency was determined as fmis.rel = (f mis-Pt)/(f mis-control). In a previous study (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) we performed a kinetic analysis of nucleotide incorporation opposite Pt-GG adducts in a 5′-AGGC-3′ sequence by pol β using primed single-stranded DNA templates and 6 or 5 nucleotide-gapped DNA templates. In those studies, cisplatin-GG adducts inhibited nucleotide incorporation to a greater extent than oxaliplatin-GG adducts when primed single-stranded templates were used, but pol β did not discriminate between cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts during short gap filling. In the present study we have examined the catalytic efficiency and fidelity of pol β on DNA templates with a single nucleotide gap opposite the 3′- or 5′-G of the 5′-AGGC-3′ sequence in both undamaged templates and templates containing a single cisplatin- or oxaliplatin-GG adduct (Fig.1). These experiments are of interest because the conformation of this type of DNA template bound to pol β is very different from the templates with platinum adducts that have been analyzed previously (14Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). We performed steady-state kinetic assays for dCTP insertion opposite the template 3′- and 5′-G on undamaged templates and templates with cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts by measuring nucleotide insertion at the first template site adjacent to the primer terminus (18Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in the presence of a 30-fold excess of template over enzyme. The results are summarized in Table I. One striking observation was the 10-fold lower dCTP incorporation efficiency (kcat/K m) opposite the 3′-G relative to the 5′-G on undamaged single nucleotide-gapped DNA. This appears to be primarily an effect of sequence context on dCTP incorporation efficiency (see below). However, the influence of sequence context on the efficiency of dCTP incorporation opposite the guanines also depends on template structure, because no significant differences were observed in thekcat/K m for dCTP incorporation opposite the 3′- and 5′-G in the same sequence context with longer gapped or primed single-stranded DNA templates (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Table ISteady-state kinetic analysis of dCTP insertion opposite Pt-GG adductsTarget (template)Pt adductk catK mk cat/K mf relmin−1μm3′-Gcontrol13.2 ± 1.55.8 ± 0.72.28 ± 0.12cisplatin1.4 ± 0.123.3 ± 3.60.060 ± 0.0090.026oxaliplatin2.6 ± 0.235.0 ± 3.60.074 ± 0.0010.0325′-Gcontrol4.5 ± 0.010.20 ± 0.0423.4 ± 2.3cisplatin3.0 ± 0.0227.7 ± 6.60.11 ± 0.020.005oxaliplatin4.8 ± 0.031.5 ± 0.33.2 ± 0.30.14Kinetic assays were performed using 5 fmol of pol β and 150 fmol of the primer-templates shown in Fig. 1 B. Incubation time was 1 min for undamaged DNA substrates and 2 min for platinated DNA substrates. To determine the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation opposite the 3′-G, dCTP concentrations ranged from 1 to 8 μm for the undamaged template and from 16 to 256 μm for the platinated templates.

Kinetic parameters (K m andk cat) and insertion efficiency (k cat/K m) for dCTP incorporation by pol β were determined using Hanes-Woolf plots. The relative insertion efficiency was determined as f rel = (k cat/K m/Pt)/(k cat/K m/control).

The relative insertion efficiency was determined as f rel = (k cat/K m/Pt)/(k cat/K m/control). Data for k cat, K m, andk cat/K m are means (± S.E.) from five to six different experiments using two independent template preparations. The enzyme concentration, template concentration, and template sequence used in these experiments are identical to those used in our previous study of pol β (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the kinetic parameters obtained in this study can be directly compared with the kinetic parameters reported in our previous study (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This allows a comparison of the efficiency and fidelity of translesion synthesis past platinum-DNA adducts by pol β with single nucleotide-gapped templates (this study), 5 or 6 nucleotide-gapped templates (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and primed single-stranded templates (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such a comparison indicates that the use of single nucleotide-gapped DNA results in an increase in the efficiency of nucleotide insertion (kcat/K m) by pol β on undamaged templates. Thus, dCTP incorporation opposite the 3′- and 5′-G was 2.5–30 and 10–120 times more efficient on single nucleotide-gapped DNA than on the DNA with longer gaps and non-gapped substrates, respectively. This is similar to the results reported previously (15Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pt-GG adducts had different effects on the efficiency (kcat/K m) of dCTP insertion opposite the 3′-G and the 5′-G (Table I). There was a similar decrease in dCTP insertion efficiency across from the 3′-G of both platinum adducts (Table I). In contrast, the efficiencies of dCTP incorporation opposite the 5′-G were very different depending on carrier ligand of platinum adduct. There was a 170-fold decrease in insertion efficiency for dCTP incorporation opposite the 5′-G of cisplatin adduct. This is the most significant inhibition of pol β catalytic activity by a cisplatin adduct among all templates (gapped and non-gapped) tested (compare Table I and results in Vaisman and Chaney, Ref. 9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there was relatively little inhibition of pol β catalytic efficiency opposite the 5′-G of the oxaliplatin adduct (Table I and Ref. 9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, our data show a very interesting variation in the carrier ligand specificity for dCTP incorporation as the DNA template changes from primed single-stranded to short-gapped (5 or 6 nucleotides) and to single nucleotide-gapped. With the primed single-stranded template, the efficiency of dCTP incorporation was about 2.5-fold greater for the oxaliplatin adduct opposite the 3′-G but was about the same for the two adducts opposite the 5′-G (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With the short-gapped DNA (5 and 6 nucleotides), no significant differences were evident between templates with cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts in the insertion efficiency of dCTP opposite either the 3′-G or the 5′-G (9Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13017-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With the single nucleotide-gapped template the efficiency of dCTP incorporation was about 20-fold greater for the oxaliplatin adduct opposite the 5′-G but was about the same for both adducts opposite the 3′-G (this study). These differences could be related to the differences in the conformation of the non-gapped and gapped DNA templates bound to pol β. The x-ray crystal structure of pol β with a non-gapped primed template shows that the double-stranded region of the template is aligned in the palm subdomain of the 31-kDa domain of polymerase (13Pelletier H.

https://openalex.org/W2130784145,"TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin belong to a class of RNA polymerase II transcription factors that function similarly to activate the rate of elongation by suppressing transient pausing by polymerase at many sites along DNA templates. SII is a functionally distinct RNA polymerase II elongation factor that promotes elongation by reactivating arrested polymerase. Studies of the mechanism of SII action have shown (i) that arrest of RNA polymerase II results from irreversible displacement of the 3′-end of the nascent transcript from the polymerase catalytic site and (ii) that SII reactivates arrested polymerase by inducing endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent transcript by the polymerase catalytic site thereby creating a new transcript 3′-end that is properly aligned with the catalytic site and can be extended. SII also induces nascent transcript cleavage by paused but non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates, leading to the proposal that pausing may result from reversible displacement of the 3′-end of nascent transcripts from the polymerase catalytic site. On the basis of evidence consistent with the model that TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin suppress pausing by preventing displacement of the 3′-end of the nascent transcript from the polymerase catalytic site, we investigated the possibility of cross-talk between SII and transcription factors TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin. These studies led to the discovery that TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin are all capable of inhibiting SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates. Here we present these findings, which bring to light a novel activity associated with TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin and suggest that these transcription factors may expedite elongation not only by increasing the forward rate of nucleotide addition by RNA polymerase II, but also by inhibiting SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates.

Previous studies have shown that bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases are susceptible to pausing for varying lengths of time at each step of nucleotide addition. Because the duration of pausing is often greater than the rate of phosphodiester bond formation (kcat), it has been proposed that elongating RNA polymerases cycle between active and inactive conformations at each step of nucleotide addition (1Price D.H.

TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin are all capable of increasing the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II at extremely low ribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations when the time required for nucleotide addition can vary from seconds to minutes, suggesting that these transcription factors increase the rate of elongation not by decreasing kcat but by decreasing the fraction of time polymerase spends in an inactive conformation (7Shilatifard A.

The other class of RNA polymerase II elongation factors includes members of the SII family of transcription factors. SII promotes elongation by reactivating RNA polymerase II that has become arrested at a variety of impediments including specific DNA sequences referred to as intrinsic arrest sites (20Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang D.G. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Wind M. Reines D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Unlike paused RNA polymerase II, which resumes transcription even in the absence of elongation factors, arrested RNA polymerase II is in an inactive state and resumes transcription only with assistance from SII. Evidence from a variety of studies suggests that transcriptional arrest and pausing are mechanistically related and result from aberrant backward movement of RNA polymerase II on the DNA with concomitant displacement of the 3′-end of the nascent transcript from the polymerase catalytic site, an event that is either spontaneously reversible in the case of pausing or not in the case of arrest (24Wind M. Reines D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Current evidence is consistent with the model that SII reactivates arrested RNA polymerase II by inducing a polymerase-associated endoribonuclease activity, which cleaves the nascent transcript 7–10 nucleotides upstream of the displaced 3′-end (21Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus creating a new 3′-end that is properly aligned with the enzyme's catalytic site and can be reextended. Notably, SII also promotes nascent transcript cleavage by paused but non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation complexes; in this case, transcript cleavage typically occurs in two nucleotide increments (25Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin suppress transient pausing by transcribing RNA polymerase II are not completely understood. In a previous study, Reines and co-worker (17Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11238-11244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) observed that TFIIF can decrease the rate at which RNA polymerase II falls into arrest, raising the possibility that TFIIF can inhibit backsliding of polymerase and consequent displacement of the 3′-end of the nascent transcript from the polymerase catalytic site. In addition, we previously observed (i) that TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin can all dramatically increase the ability of RNA polymerase II to bind to and extend DNA primers in a DNA template-directed reaction and (ii) that TFIIF mutations that reduce TFIIF elongation activity also reduce this TFIIF activity, consistent with the idea that the mechanisms by which TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin promote extension of DNA 3′-ends and suppress transient pausing by RNA polymerase II may be related (27Takagi Y. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24300-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 1Y. Takagi, S. Tan, J. W. Conaway, and R. C. Conaway, unpublished results. As suggested by Salzman and co-workers, the DNA template-directed addition of ribonucleotides to the 3′-ends of DNA by RNA polymerase II may occur in a reaction that mimics formation of the RNA polymerase II ternary elongation complex (28Lavialle C. Sekura R. Madden M.J. Salzman N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12458-12466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, RNA polymerase II would bind to the 3′-hydroxyl terminus of DNA, just as the enzyme binds to the 3′-end of an elongating RNA molecule; the polymerase catalytic site would then add ribonucleotides to the DNA 3′-hydroxyl terminus as if it were the 3′-end of a nascent transcript. Accordingly, our observation that TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin can promote extension by RNA polymerase II of DNA primers is consistent with the model that these transcription factors may facilitate proper positioning of the 3′-ends of these DNA primers in the polymerase catalytic site and, by extension, that these transcription factors may suppress transient pausing by polymerase by facilitating proper positioning of the 3′-end of nascent transcripts in the enzyme's catalytic site. In light of this model and because SII-induced cleavage of nascent transcripts by paused or arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates is believed to occur when the 3′-end of nascent transcripts becomes misaligned with the polymerase catalytic site, we investigated the possibility of cross-talk between SII and transcription factors TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin. These studies led to the discovery that TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin are all capable of inhibiting SII-induced cleavage of transcripts by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates. Here we present these findings, which bring to light a novel activity associated with TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin and suggest that these transcription factors may expedite elongation by RNA polymerase II not only by increasing the forward rate of nucleotide addition by polymerase but also by inhibiting SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates.

Recombinant human SII was expressed in E. coli and purified as follows. The pT7–7Met expression vector encoding the full-length human SII open reading frame was obtained from Dr. Caroline Kane, (Berkeley, CA) and expressed in E. coli BL21 (pLysS) cells as described (37Yoo O.J. Yoon H.S. Baek K.H. Jeon C.J. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Agarwal K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SII was purified by chromatography on consecutive phosphocellulose and TSK phenyl 5-PW columns. Briefly, cell lysates were centrifuged 30 min at 31,000 ×g, and the supernatant was applied to a phosphocellulose column (Whatman P-11) preequilibrated in 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 m KCl. SII was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.33 m KCl. Active fractions were pooled and precipitated with 60% (NH4)2SO4. The pellet was dissolved in 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol, dialyzed against the same buffer containing 1.5m (NH4)2SO4 until the conductivity was equivalent to that of 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4, and applied to a TSK phenyl 5-PW high pressure liquid chromatography column (75 × 7.5 mm; Bio-Rad) preequilibrated in 100 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.5m (NH4)2SO4. SII was eluted with a 36-ml linear gradient from 1.5 m to 0m (NH4)2SO4 in the same buffer. For a single assay of promoter-specific transcription, preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter at 28 °C by a 30-min preincubation of 30 μl of reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 3% (v/v) glycerol, six units of recombinant placental ribonuclease inhibitor, ∼10 ng of theEcoRI to NdeI fragment from pDN-AdML, ∼5 ng of recombinant yeast TBP, ∼10 ng of recombinant TFIIB, ∼10 ng of recombinant TFIIF, ∼20 ng of recombinant TFIIE, ∼10 ng of TFIIH, and 0.01 unit of RNA polymerase II. Except where indicated otherwise, transcription reactions were performed at 28 °C for 30 min in the presence of 200 μm CpA, 0.5 μm[α-32P]CTP, 15 μm ATP, 15 μm UTP, and 70 μm3′-O-MeGTP. Transcription reactions were scaled up as necessary for each experiment. Paused RNA polymerase II elongation complexes were purified by applying ∼200–250 μl of each transcription reaction mixture to two consecutive 3-ml Sephadex G-50 spin columns prepacked in 4-ml empty spin columns and preequilibrated in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, and 3% (v/v) glycerol, in the presence or absence of 5 mm MgCl2. The columns were spun for 5 min at 2000 × g in a swinging bucket rotor, and 30 μl of eluant/reaction mixture was used in further experiments. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 9.0 m urea containing 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF. Transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels containing 25% acrylamide, 3% bis-acrylamide, 5 m urea, 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA. Transcripts were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To begin to explore the possibility of cross-talk between elongation factor SII and transcription factors that suppress transient pausing by RNA polymerase II, we investigated the effect of TFIIF and ELL on SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates that had synthesized 16-nucleotide-long transcripts in a basal transcription system reconstituted with recombinant general initiation factors TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF and purified RNA polymerase II and TFIIH from rat liver. In these experiments, RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter by preincubation of polymerase and the general initiation factors with a DNA fragment containing the AdML promoter. Radioactively labeled transcripts were synthesized in the presence of 200 μm of the initiating dinucleotide CpA, which directs most transcription initiation from position −1 relative to the normal AdML transcriptional start site (Fig.1 A), 15 μm ATP, 15 μm UTP, 0.5 μm[α-32P]CTP, and 70 μm3′-O-MeGTP, which prevents most transcription beyond the first G residue of the AdML transcript at position +15. RNA polymerase II elongation complexes were purified free of ribonucleoside triphosphates by two consecutive Sephadex G-50 spin columns and treated with elongation factor SII. As shown in Fig. 1 B and consistent with previous results (21Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang D.G. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), SII induced cleavage of nascent transcripts by paused RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–10). Similarly, SII induced cleavage of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that had synthesized 15-nucleotide-long transcripts and had paused after incorporating the first A residue immediately preceding the first G residue of the transcript (lane 11). SII-induced cleavage of these transcripts by RNA polymerase II elongation complexes was dependent on Mg+2 (lanes 12 and 14); in addition, these RNA polymerase II elongation complexes were transcriptionally active because they could incorporate the RNA chain-terminating nucleotide 3′-O-MeG when Mg+2 was added to reaction mixtures (compare lanes 11, 13, and 15). To test the effects of TFIIF and ELL on SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage, purified RNA polymerase II elongation complexes containing 16-nucleotide 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts were incubated with a fixed level of SII with or without increasing concentrations of TFIIF and ELL. As shown in Fig. 1 C, SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates was effectively inhibited by levels of TFIIF and ELL that potently activated the rate of elongation by polymerase under our reaction conditions (data not shown). In addition, the inhibitory effects of ELL (Fig. 2) and TFIIF (data not shown) in these reactions could be overcome by increasing the levels of SII in the presence of fixed ELL and TFIIF concentrations, suggesting that SII, TFIIF, and ELL function competitively in regulation of nascent transcript cleavage. ELL and TFIIF are both capable of stimulating the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II in the presence of extremely low levels of ribonucleoside triphosphates (Refs. 7Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25594-25603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). To address the possibility that the observed ELL- and TFIIF-dependent inhibition of SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates was due to ELL- or TFIIF-stimulated reextension of cleaved nascent transcripts in the presence of low levels of residual ribonucleoside triphosphates contaminating gel-filtered preparations of paused elongation complexes, ELL and TFIIF were added back to SII-treated elongation complexes. In these experiments, paused RNA polymerase II elongation complexes containing 16-nucleotide, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts were treated with SII for 5 min and then incubated with ELL, TFIIF, or ribonucleoside triphosphates. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of ELL (lanes 1, 3–5) or TFIIF (lanes 6–8) did not promote reextension of cleaved transcripts. In contrast, cleaved transcripts could be reextended by addition of ribonucleoside triphosphates to reaction mixtures, confirming that RNA polymerase II elongation complexes incubated with SII were transcription-competent at the time ELL and TFIIF were added to reactions (compare lanes 1 and 2). The results shown in Fig. 3 are consistent with the model that TFIIF and ELL function by blocking SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage and not by promoting reextension of cleaved transcripts. As a further test of this model, we performed the experiment shown in Fig.4. In this experiment, we took advantage of the observation that, because of its ability to promote nascent transcript cleavage, SII can reactivate elongation complexes paused following incorporation of a chain-terminating nucleotide by promoting removal of the chain-terminating nucleotide from the 3′-ends of nascent transcripts. Purified RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that had synthesized 16-nucleotide, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts were incubated with ATP, UTP, GTP, and the RNA chain-terminating nucleotide araCTP with or without SII. If SII promotes endonucleolytic cleavage and removal of 3′-O-MeG-residue from the 3′-end of the transcript, the transcript will be extended to the next C residue, resulting in the synthesis of a 20-nucleotide, araC-terminated RNA (Fig. 4, top panel). As expected, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts could not be extended in reactions performed in the absence of SII (the small amount of 20-nucleotide transcripts synthesized in these reactions appears to result from elongation of transcripts that had paused before incorporation of 3′-O-MeG prior to purification of elongation complexes (compare lanes 1 and 3 andlanes 6 and 8)) but could be extended in reactions performed in the presence of SII (lanes 4 and8). Notably, the fraction of 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts that could be extended in the presence of SII was substantially decreased when reactions also contained either TFIIF (lane 5) or ELL (lane 9), consistent with the model that TFIIF and ELL are capable of inhibiting SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation complexes. On the basis of evidence that SII induces nascent transcript cleavage by polymerases that have backtracked along the DNA template and lost proper contact with the 3′-end of transcripts, our observation that TFIIF and ELL block SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage raised the possibility that TFIIF and ELL might function by helping to maintain the 3′-end of nascent transcripts in the RNA polymerase II catalytic site. If this model is correct, TFIIF and ELL might be expected to stimulate not only the rate of nucleotide addition by RNA polymerase II but also the reverse reaction, pyrophosphorolysis. Indeed, Hawley and co-worker (22Wang D.G. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that TFIIF can stimulate the rate of pyrophosphorolysis by RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that had synthesized 185–350-nucleotide-long transcripts. Consistent with their findings, we observe that both TFIIF and ELL can stimulate the rate of pyrophosphorolysis by RNA polymerase II elongation complexes containing 16-nucleotide, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts (Fig. 5). Because the experiments presented above were all performed with RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that had initiated transcription from the AdML promoter in the presence of the general initiation factors, we wanted to confirm that TFIIF and ELL inhibit SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage through direct interactions with these elongation complexes and not indirectly through the action of one or more of the general initiation factors present in transcription reactions. To accomplish this, we took advantage of the oligo(dC)-tailed pCpGR220 DNA template (30Rice G.A. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because the first non-template strand (dT) residue is 136 base pairs downstream of the oligo(dC) tail, RNA polymerase II will initiate transcription from the oligo(dC) tail and synthesize transcripts of ∼136 nucleotides in the presence of ATP, CTP, and GTP. In these experiments, paused RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that had synthesized ∼136 nucleotide transcripts were purified by two consecutive Sephadex G-50 spin columns and treated with SII or 3 mm PPiin the presence or absence of TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin. As shown in Fig.6, TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin are all capable not only of inhibiting SII-dependent nascent transcript cleavage but also of stimulating the rate of pyrophosphorolysis by paused RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates in the absence of the general initiation factors, suggesting that these activities are intrinsic to elongation factors that suppress transient pausing by RNA polymerase II. In the experiment of Fig. 6 A, amounts of ELL and Elongin proteins corresponding to a molar ratio relative to SII of ∼0.1:1 were sufficient to inhibit SII-induced transcript cleavage, whereas an amount of TFIIF corresponding to a molar ratio relative to SII of ∼1.8:15 was needed. As shown in Fig.6 B, the same relative levels of ELL, Elongin, and TFIIF were needed to stimulate the rate of pyrophosphorolysis. At the present time, we do not know whether the apparent difference in the specific activities of ELL, Elongin, and TFIIF reflects a difference in their intrinsic abilities to modulate the activities of RNA polymerase II or whether it reflects a difference in the fraction of active molecules present in our preparations of elongation factors. In conclusion, in this report we present evidence that transcription factors TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin, which have all been shown previously to activate the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II in vitro, are also capable of potently inhibiting SII-induced cleavage of nascent transcripts by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates. In addition, we present evidence that, like TFIIF, transcription factors ELL and Elongin are capable of strongly stimulating the rate of pyrophosphorolysis by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates. Because SII-induced cleavage of nascent transcripts by RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates is believed to occur when the 3′-end of transcripts becomes misaligned with the polymerase catalytic site, our findings raise the possibility that TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin inhibit SII-induced transcript cleavage at least in part by helping to maintain the 3′-end of transcripts in the enzyme's catalytic site. If this model is correct, then inhibition of SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin could be a manifestation of their intrinsic elongation factor activity. Notably, in the experiments presented here we observe a correlation between the TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin levels required to inhibit SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage and to stimulate pyrophosphorolysis, which is the reverse reaction of nucleotide addition and RNA transcript elongation. Whether TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin inhibit SII-induced transcript cleavage by controlling the orientation of the 3′-ends of nascent transcripts or by simply interacting with the RNA polymerase II elongation complex and sterically blocking its interaction with SII, however, remains to be determined. Nevertheless, our findings bring to light a novel activity associated with TFIIF, ELL, and Elongin and suggest that these transcription factors could expedite elongation not only by increasing the forward rate of nucleotide addition by RNA polymerase II but also by inhibiting SII-induced nascent transcript cleavage by non-arrested RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates.

While CNTF induces STAT and AP-1 proteins to bind to cognate sites in the VIP CyRE, the mechanism through which TGF-β acts to induce VIP gene transcription is not known. Here we show that Smad3 and Smad4 proteins can bind to two distinct sites within the VIP CyRE. These sites are absolutely required for the induction of VIP CyRE transcription by TGF-β. TGF-β induces endogenous Smad-containing complexes to bind to these sites in human neuroblastoma cells. CNTF and TGF-β synergize to induce VIP mRNA expression and transcription through the VIP CyRE.

The TGF-β·TβR-II complex recruits and then phosphorylates TβR-I to initiate signaling. The activated TβR-I phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smad proteins, Smad2 and Smad3. Phosphorylated Smads dissociate from the receptor, complex with the co-Smad Smad4, and translocate to the nucleus. Smads bind to specific Smad sites in genomic regulatory regions. However, their DNA binding affinity is weak (24Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A.

In addition, TGF-β enhances CNTF-mediated survival of cultured ciliary neurons, suggesting that TGF-β may act together with CNTF in specific cell populations (33Krieglstein K. Farkas L. Unsicker K. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While these two cytokines sometimes share similar functions, the mechanism through which they may cooperate has not been investigated. We have previously shown that CNTF and activin, a TGF-β-related cytokine, independently induce VIP gene expression through a 180-bp element in the VIP promoter termed the cytokine response element (CyRE) (34Symes A.J. Pitts R.L. Conover J. Kos K. Coulombe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). CNTF induces VIP gene expression through the induction of STAT and AP-1 proteins to bind to distinct sites within the CyRE (20Symes A.J. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9648-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cytokine-induced proteins interact with other noninduced proteins to bring about a robust activation of VIP transcription through combinatorial interactions (36Jones E.A. Conover J. Symes A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36013-36020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). While CNTF induces VIP gene expression ∼50-fold, activin has a smaller effect on VIP mRNA, inducing it ∼2-fold (34Symes A.J. Pitts R.L. Conover J. Kos K. Coulombe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, co-treatment of CNTF and activin leads to a synergistic activation of VIP transcription mediated through the VIP CyRE. TGF-β also synergizes with CNTF to induce CyRE-directed transcription (34Symes A.J. Pitts R.L. Conover J. Kos K. Coulombe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β does not induce either STAT or AP-1 proteins to bind to the CyRE (34Symes A.J. Pitts R.L. Conover J. Kos K. Coulombe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and we do not know the molecular mechanisms through which TGF-β and related cytokines induce VIP gene expression. Understanding the TGF-β-initiated signaling pathways that regulate the VIP gene will allow us to investigate the mechanisms through which these two independent cytokine signals synergize to regulate neuropeptide gene expression. In this paper, we show that there are two Smad binding sites within the CyRE, distinct from the AP-1 and STAT sites, that are critical to the TGF-β regulation of VIP gene expression. We further show that the Smad, STAT, and AP-1 sites all contribute to the synergistic interaction between CNTF and TGF-β in the induction of VIP gene expression.

Cy1 mg17luc was constructed by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis (38Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

The fragments were gel-purified and used as template in a subsequent polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides A1 and A4 as primers to create Cy1mg17luc. This plasmid, Cy1mg17luc, was used as template with primers A1 and mS5 (36Jones E.A. Conover J. Symes A.J. J. Biol.

Cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates and transfected overnight by calcium phosphate precipitation. Each well received 1 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 0.5 μg of EF-β-galactosidase, and 2.5 μg of carrier DNA. Cytokines were added in serum-free medium, 6 h after the DNA precipitate was removed, for 40 h before cell harvesting. Samples were assayed for luciferase activity (41Brasier A.R. Tate J.E.

Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from NBFL cells after lysis with Nonidet P-40 and transferred to nylon membranes as previously described (42Symes A.J. Rajan P. Corpus L. Fink J.S. J. Biol.

Blots were digitized using a Storm PhosphorImager, with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The relative densitometric readings were normalized to cyclophilin mRNA to account for loading differences between lanes. EMSAs were performed as previously described (35Symes A.J. Lewis S.E.

Nuclear extracts were prepared, and binding reactions performed as previously described (35Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol.

Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides with GGG overhangs were annealed and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, WI). When used, competitor oligonucleotides or antibodies were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of probe. We have previously shown that TGF-β induction of VIP gene transcription is mediated through the VIP CyRE. To determine which regions within the 180-bp CyRE are important for the TGF-β-mediated transcriptional induction, we transfected NBFL neuroblastoma cells with a series of CyRE deletion constructs. These plasmids contain various regions of the CyRE upstream of a basal RSV promoter driving expression of the luciferase reporter gene (35Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S.

Deletion of 28 bp at the 3′-end of the CyRE either from the full-length construct or from two other plasmids with deleted 5′-ends reduced the transcriptional induction of CyRE luciferase reporter plasmids by over 60% (Fig. 1). However, deletion of up to 50 bp from the 5′-end of the CyRE did not significantly reduce the induction of luciferase activity driven by these plasmids in response to TGF-β. These data suggest that a region within the most 3′ 28 bp of the CyRE is important to the TGF-β-mediated induction of VIP CyRE transcription. To examine more precisely the sequences within this 3′ region that contribute to the TGF-β induction of VIP transcription, we transfected NBFL cells with CyRE-luciferase plasmids containing a sequential series of 3-bp mutations of the most 3′ 30 bp (Fig.2). TGF-β was unable to induce transcriptional activity in cells transfected with either Cy1mS4luc or Cy1mS5luc (Fig. 2). These plasmids contain sequential mutations of the sequence GTCTGA, which, read inverted on the minus strand, contains a CAGA box (TCAGAC). In other promoters, this CAGA motif can bind Smad proteins and mediate TGF-β induced transcription (39Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 45Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). The mutations present in Cy1mS7luc and Cy1mS8luc reduced but did not eliminate TGF-β-induced transcription (Fig. 2), suggesting that these mutated sequences may also contribute to the TGF-β induction of VIP CyRE transcription. Mutations in other regions within the 3′ CyRE resulted in reduced unstimulated and TGF-β-stimulated luciferase activity but no significant alteration in the overall TGF-β induction (Fig. 2). The exception to this, the large TGF-β induction of Cy1mS6luc, was not reproducible. These data suggest that the sequence TCAGAC is critical to the ability of TGF-β to induce transcription through the VIP CyRE. We then examined the rest of the CyRE sequence to look for other regions that might have similarity to the CAGA site at the 3′-end of the CyRE. Interestingly, we found one other region, toward the center of the CyRE, that also contained the core CAGA sequence. This sequence (TCCAGACAT) is located −1250 bp upstream of the transcription start site. To determine whether Smad proteins could bind to these CAGA containing sequences from the VIP CyRE, we incubated purified GST-Smad fusion with probes from these regions, P17 and P11 (Table I). EMSA analysis indicated that GST-Smad3ΔC bound to the CAGA-containing probes, P17 and P11, and to a control SBE but not to an adjacent, non-CAGA-containing probe, P18 (Fig.3 C). Binding of GST-Smad3ΔC to either P17 or P11 was specifically competed by a 100-fold molar excess of nonlabeled wild type oligonucleotide but not by the same amount of these sequences with 3-bp mutations in their CAGA boxes (Fig. 3 D). GST-Smad4 bound very weakly to either P17 or P11, despite strong binding to the control SBE (Fig. 3 E). Truncated GST-Smad4ΔC, without the C-terminal MH2 domain, did not bind more strongly than full-length GST-Smad4 (data not shown), suggesting that it was not the presence of the MH2 domain that inhibited Smad4 binding to the CyRE sequences. Taken together, these data show that two sites within the VIP CyRE are able strongly and specifically to bind Smad3 but that these same sites bind Smad4 only weakly.Table IOligonucleotide sequencesOligonucleotidesSequencesP17GATCCATTTCCAGACATTTTGAAACTTAATTCATTTA-mP17............TCG......................P21GGATTTCCAGACATTTP11GGGTGGATCAGTCTGACTTTGAACG-mP11...........TAG............PAIGGTCGAGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACSBEATTTCCAGACATTTTGAAACTTAATTCATTTAP18GATCCATTTAATTTTTCTGGTAACTGGATTAGAAAATA Open table in a new tab To assess the role of these two CyRE Smad binding sites in mediating TGF-β inducibility of CyRE-directed transcription, we examined the ability of TGF-β to induce transcription of luciferase reporter plasmids containing mutations in either or both of these Smad sites. Identical mutations to those that eliminated the ability of Smad proteins to bind to P17 or P11 were introduced into the wild type Cy1luc plasmid. Transfection of these plasmids into NBFL cells indicated that mutation of either P17 or P11 attenuated the ability of TGF-β to induce CyRE-mediated transcription (Fig.4). Mutation of both P17 and P11 completely eliminated the ability of TGF-β to induce CyRE-driven transcription. Thus, while each CyRE Smad binding site contributes, both sites are necessary to TGF-β induction of CyRE-driven transcription. To determine whether TGF-β induces endogenous proteins within NBFL cells to bind to these Smad sites, we prepared nuclear extract from untreated and TGF-β-treated NBFL cells. After 1 h of treatment, TGF-β strongly induced NBFL nuclear protein binding to probes containing the CyRE Smad binding sequences (Fig.5). The probe, P21, is a truncated version of P17. The TGF-β-induced p21-binding complex is competed specifically by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe and also by a similar molar excess of P17 and P11. It is not competed by oligonucleotides with mutations in their CAGA boxes that were unable to bind GST-Smad proteins (Fig. 5 A). These data suggest that in NBFL cells, TGF-β activates Smad proteins to translocate to the nucleus and bind to Smad binding sites within the VIP CyRE. Confirmation of the composition of these TGF-β-induced binding complexes was obtained by demonstrating that an antibody recognizing Smad2 and Smad3 was able to interfere with binding of these complexes to the P21 and P11 probes (Fig. 5). Thus, taken together, our data show that TGF-β induces Smad proteins to bind to two sites with the VIP CyRE and that this binding is critical for TGF-β induction of VIP transcription. We first demonstrated the VIP CyRE to be a response element for the gp130 cytokines (in particular for CNTF) (35Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently that CNTF synergized with activin to induce VIP mRNA (34Symes A.J. Pitts R.L. Conover J. Kos K. Coulombe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since activin and TGF-β utilize very similar pathways to regulate gene expression, we wanted to confirm that CNTF would also synergize with TGF-β to induce VIP mRNA. Analysis of VIP mRNA expression in NBFL cells by Northern blotting showed that TGF-β treatment alone induced VIP mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. 1 ng/ml TGF-β induced VIP mRNA 2.8-fold, and 10 ng/ml led to a 12.4-fold induction of VIP mRNA (Fig. 6). As we had previously observed with activin, the TGF-β induction is significantly less robust than that elicited by CNTF, which produced a 55-fold induction in VIP mRNA. When NBFL cells were treated with CNTF together with TGF-β, VIP mRNA was markedly induced: 147-fold by CNTF with 1 ng/ml TGF-β and 257-fold by CNTF together with 10 ng/ml TGF-β (Fig. 6). Thus, TGF-β acts synergistically with CNTF to induce VIP mRNA. TGF-β and CNTF both induce VIP gene transcription through inducing proteins to bind to specific sequences within the VIP CyRE, yet they activate different transcription factors. We wanted to assess the contribution of sites important to either the CNTF or TGF-β pathways to the synergistic signaling of these two independent cytokines. We therefore introduced additional mutations at the STAT and/or AP-1 sites into the Cy1luc reporter with both Smad sites mutated and compared the activity of all of these mutated luciferase reporters to the wild type Cy1luc plasmid. NBFL cells transfected with Cy1luc reproduced the synergistic effect of CNTF and TGF-β on VIP mRNA, mediating strong inducibility by CNTF, less by TGF-β, and very marked synergistic signaling by cotreatment with the two cytokines (Fig.7). In cells transfected with Cy1mg17mg11 (containing mutations of both CyRE Smad sites), TGF-β was no longer able to induce luciferase activity, as shown previously (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the CNTF-induced transcription driven by Cy1mg17mg11 was reduced by 60% in comparison with Cy1luc, and there was no significant difference in transcriptional induction after cotreatment with both cytokines from that of CNTF alone (Fig. 7). Transcriptional activity driven by a luciferase reporter with mutations in both Smad sites and the AP-1 site (Cy1mg17mg11mg2) was not induced by TGF-β but still retained CNTF induction. The synergy between TGF-β and CNTF was no longer evident. Plasmids containing mutations of the Smad and STAT sites (Cy1mg17mg11mg3) or of the Smad, STAT, and AP-1 sites (Cy1mg17mg11mg3mg2) did not respond to stimulation by either cytokine alone or together. These data suggest that CNTF and TGF-β synergistically induce CyRE transcription through stimulating a combination of Smad, STAT, and AP-1 proteins. CNTF and TGF-β stimulate very different signaling pathways to activate gene expression. However, the possibility of cross-talk between these pathways exists at many different levels. Smad proteins, while initially phosphorylated by the receptor, may also be phosphorylated by cytoplasmic kinases, such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (37de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). To investigate whether CNTF signaling may contribute to Smad activation, independent of any potential Smad-DNA binding effects, we utilized Gal4-Smad fusion proteins. Expression vectors for Gal4-Smad fusion proteins were co-transfected with a reporter containing multimerized Gal4 DNA binding sites, pG5-E1B-luc. As previously published (37de Caestecker M.P.

Probing of GenBank's expressed sequence tag data base with these three tryptase cDNAs resulted in the identification of an expressed sequence tag that encodes a portion of a novel mouse serine protease (now designated mouse tryptase 4 (mT4) because it is the fourth member of this family). 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends approaches were carried out to deduce the nucleotide sequence of the full-length mT4 transcript. This information was then used to clone its ∼5.0-kilobase pair gene. Chromosome mapping analysis of its gene, sequence analysis of its transcript, and comparative protein structure modeling of its translated product revealed that mT4 is a new member of the chromosome 17 family of mouse tryptases. mT4 is 40–44% identical to mMCP-6, mMCP-7, and mTMT, and this new serine protease has all of the structural features of a functional tryptase. Moreover, mT4 is enzymatically active when expressed in insect cells. Due to its 17-mer hydrophobic domain at its C terminus, mT4 is a membrane-anchored tryptase more analogous to mTMT than the other members of its family. As assessed by RNA blot, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and/or <i>in situ</i> hybridization analysis, mT4 is expressed in interleukin-5-dependent mouse eosinophils, as well as in ovaries and testes. The observation that recombinant mT4 is preferentially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of transiently transfected COS-7 cells suggests a convertase-like role for this integral membrane serine protease.AF176209AF226710"
https://openalex.org/W1979439574,"The ycf9 (orf62) gene of the plastid genome encodes a 6.6-kDa protein (ORF62) of thylakoid membranes. To elucidate the role of the ORF62 protein, the coding region of the gene was disrupted with an aadAcassette, yielding mutant plants that were nearly (more than 95%) homoplasmic for ycf9 inactivation. Theycf9 mutant had no altered phenotype under standard growth conditions, but its growth rate was severely reduced under suboptimal irradiances. On the other hand, it was less susceptible to photodamage than the wild type. ycf9 inactivation resulted in a clear reduction in protein amounts of CP26, the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex, and the plastid terminal oxidase. Furthermore, depletion of ORF62 led to a faster flow of electrons to photosystem I without a change in the maximum electron transfer capacity of photosystem II. Despite the reduction of CP26 in the mutant thylakoids, no differences in PSII oxygen evolution rates were evident even at low light intensities. On the other hand, the ycf9mutant presented deficiencies in the capacity for PSII-independent electron transport (ferredoxin-dependent cyclic electron transport and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-mediated plastoquinone reduction). Altogether, it is shown that depletion of ORF62 leads to anomalies in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and in the regulation of electron partitioning among the different routes of electron transport."

But we have discovered that in about one-third of the dividing cells of Entamoeba invadens contraction of the cleavage furrow1 may stop before separation is complete. We show here that the connected daughter cells overcome this problem by calling upon a neighbouring amoeba to help them achieve the final stage of division. The 'midwife' cell is chemotactically recruited for this mechanical intervention in what is a surprising example of primitive cooperation.

We previously reported that the D region of PKNα contains the autoinhibitory domain (12Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It blocks the access of the catalytic domain to the substrate. Arachidonic acid can recover the catalytic activity from this autoinhibition (12Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that arachidonic acid causes conformational change of PKNα to release the autoinhibitory domain. PKNβ and PRK2 conserve the domains corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of PKNα (6Oishi K. Mukai H. Shibata H. Takahashi M. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Therefore, PKNβ and PRK2 may need some other factors for conformational changes to release their autoinhibitory domains. PKNα is ubiquitously expressed but is enriched in the brain (14Kitagawa M. Mukai H. Shibata H. Ono Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In neurons, PKNα is concentrated in a subset of endoplasmic reticulum as well as late endosomes, multivesicular bodies, Golgi bodies, secretary vesicles, and nuclei (15Kawamata T. Taniguchi T. Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Hashimoto T. Maeda K. Ono Y. Tanaka C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7402-7410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The pTB701/HA/hPKNαN and pTB701/HA/hPKNαCA plasmids were constructed as follows: the cDNA fragment encoding hPKNα (residues 1–540) was obtained by digesting phPKNH4 withEcoRI and BamHI; the cDNA fragment encoding hPKNα (residues 561–942) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction; and each cDNA fragment was inserted into pTB701/HA. The pTB701/HA/hPKNβ plasmid was made by inserting the EcoRI fragment of pRc/CMV/hPKNβ into pTB/701/HA. The pTB701/HA/hPKNβN and pTB701/HA/hPKNβCA plasmids for the expression in mammalian cells were made by digesting pRc/CMV/hPKNβ with EcoNI, filling the ends with T4 polymerase, ligating with EcoRI linker, digesting with EcoRI, and inserting the resulting fragments encoding hPKNβ (residues 1–520 and 520–889) into theEcoRI site of pTB701/HA, respectively. The pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1 used to express FLAG-tagged human PLD1 in mammalian cells was constructed as described previously (28Yamazaki M. Zhang Y. Watanabe H. Yokozeki T. Ohno S. Kaibuchi K. Shibata H.

The pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1N plasmid was constructed by deleting the BglII fragment from pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1. The pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1I plasmid was made by digesting pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1 with NcoI, filling the ends with T4 polymerase, ligating with BglII linker, digesting withBglII, and inserting the resulting fragment encoding hPLD1 (residues 228–598) to the BglII site of pTB701/FLAG (35Kuroda S.

The pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1C was constructed by digesting pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1 with NcoI, filling the ends with T4 polymerase, ligating with BglII linker, digesting with BglII, and ligating the resulting fragment encoding hPLD1 (residues 598–1070) to the BglII site of pTB701/FLAG. The pBlueBacHis/GST/hPKNα was made as described (12Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The pAcGHLTC/hPKNβ plasmid was made by digesting pTB701/HA/hPKNβ with EcoRI and inserting the resulting fragment into the EcoRI site of pAcGHLTC. The pRSETB/hPLD1N for (His)6-tagged hPLD1N (residues 1–228) was constructed as follows: the cDNA fragment encoding the amino acid residues 1–228 of hPLD1 generated by polymerase chain reaction was ligated into the BamHI site of pRSETB. The pRSETB/hPLD1I plasmid used to express (His)6-tagged hPLD1I (residues 228–598) was made by digesting pTB701/FLAG/hPLD1I withBglII, and the resulting fragment was inserted into theBglII site of pRSETB. The recombinant baculovirus was generated as described (12Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Sf9 cells expressing recombinant protein were lysed for 15 min in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mmNaCl, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was collected. An appropriate volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm reduced glutathione). COS-7 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transfection to COS-7 cells by electroporation was performed as described (6Oishi K. Mukai H. Shibata H. Takahashi M. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C, and the resulting lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h and with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to PLD assay, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Two μg of the indicated protein was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 2 μg of either (His)6-tagged hPLD1N (residues 1–228) or hPLD1I (residues 228–598) and then precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The (His)6-tagged hPLD1 fragment that was co-precipitated with the indicated GST-fused proteins was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-(His)6 antibody. The immunoprecipitate with anti-FLAG from COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged hPLD1 was reconstituted with the purified proteins in the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate/[choline-methyl-[3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 (36Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with or without 40 μm arachidonic acid, and then the production of [3H]choline was determined (37Banno Y.

The incubation time was 30 min at 37 °C. To analyze the association of PKN family members with PLD1, we performed the immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody using the lysate of COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged PLD1 and either HA-tagged PKNα or PKNβ. The interaction was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, both PKNα and PKNβ were clearly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged PLD1. To define the association between endogenous PLD1 and PKNα or PKNβ in mammalian cells, we next carried out the immunoprecipitation experiments using the specific antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 B, endogenous PKNβ was clearly co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous PLD1 from HeLa cells. Fig. 2 A shows that PLD1 also interacted with PKNα in U937 cells, although the interaction with PKNα was weaker than that with PKNβ. These data suggest that the association of PKNα and PKNβ with PLD1 is physiological. To identify the interaction site(s) of PKNα or PKNβ with PLD1, we made the deletion mutants of PKNα and PKNβ as shown in Fig.3 A. FLAG-tagged PLD1 was co-expressed with HA-tagged PKNαN (residues 1–540), HA-tagged PKNαCA (residues 561–942), HA-tagged PKNβN (residues 1–520), or HA-tagged PKNβCA (residues 520–889) in COS-7 cells. The cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody, and the interaction was analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, right, PKNβ clearly bound to PLD1 at the N- and C-terminal regions. PKNα also associated with PLD1 at both N- and C-terminal regions (Fig.3 B, left). Next, we analyzed the interaction site(s) of PLD1 with PKNα or PKNβ. The lysate from COS-7 cells co-expressing either HA-tagged PKNα or PKNβ and three different deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged PLD1 (Fig. 4 A) was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody. Fig. 4 B shows that both PKNα and PKNβ associated with the PLD1 (residues 1–228) containing phox domain and PLD1 (residues 228–598) containing pleckstrin homology-like domain, conserved regions I and II, and a part of the loop domain of PLD1 (31Sung T.C.

To investigate whether PKNα and PKNβ directly bind to PLD1, we performed anin vitro binding analysis using the purified proteins. (His)6-PLD1N (residues 1–228) and (His)6-PLD1I (residues 228–598) were bacterially expressed and purified as described (17Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The PKNα or PKNβ fused to GST was expressed and affinity-purified from Sf9 cells. The proteins were mixed, and each GST-fusion protein was pulled down by glutathione-Sepharose beads. The bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with the anti-(His)6 antibody. Fig. 5shows that GST-PKNβ pulled down both (His)6-PLD1N and (His)6-PLD1I. On the other hand, GST-PKNα associated with (His)6-PLD1I, but not with (His)6-PLD1N. GST itself did not interact with (His)6-PLD1N or (His)6-PLD1I. In the co-immunoprecipitation study, PKNα associated with both PLD1N and PLD1I in COS-7 cells, suggesting that the interaction of PKNα with PLD1 (residues 1–228) in COS-7 cells is mediated by some other molecules. Because the activators for PLD1 such as PKC and RhoA stimulate the activity of PLD1 through direct interaction, we investigated whether PKNα and PKNβ can stimulate PLD1. FLAG-tagged PLD1 expressed in COS7 cells was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and was used for this assay. Fig. 6 shows that PKNα stimulated the activity of PLD1 in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, whereas PKNβ had a modest effect on the stimulation of PLD1 activity. The PLD1 stimulation by PKNα was slightly enhanced by the addition of arachidonic acid, which is a potential activator of PKNα. This stimulation was independent of ATP (data not shown). In the present study, we demonstrated that the members of the PKN family, PKNα and PKNβ, associated with PLD1 and that PKNα stimulated PLD1 activity in vitro. This stimulation was ATP-independent, suggesting that it is mediated by direct binding rather than phosphorylation of PLD1. The interaction of PKNα with PLD1 was weaker than PKNβ (Figs. 2 and 3). Nevertheless, PKNα stimulated PLD1 activity to a greater extent than PKNβ (Fig. 6). There may be at least two possible explanations for the lower stimulatory effect of PKNβ. First, the binding nature of PKNβ with PLD1 was somewhat different from that of PKNα. PKNβ directly interacted with the N-terminal (residues 1–228) as well as the internal (residues 228–598) region of PLD1 (Fig. 5), whereas PKNα interacted directly with the internal region (Fig. 5) and indirectly with the N-terminal region (Fig. 4). Although PKNα and PKNβ are closely related, this difference in the binding may reflect the distinct effects of these proteins on PLD1 activity. Second, insect cell-expressed PKNβ used in the PLD1 assay (Fig. 6) was relatively unstable and susceptible to proteolysis (data not shown). Because endogenous PKNβ in mammalian cells is distributed in membrane and nuclear fractions (6Oishi K. Mukai H. Shibata H. Takahashi M. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), PKNβ may need some lipids or binding proteins to form a stable structure. This instability of the enzyme may lower the effect on the PLD1 activity measured in vitro. Further, in the case of RhoA, lipid modification such as geranylgeranylation greatly enhance the stimulatory effect on PLD1 but does not affect the binding (38Bae C.D. Min D.S. Fleming I.N. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that RhoA-lipid interaction may help to induce catalytically active conformation of PLD1. Similarly, some conformational change of PKNβ by association with lipids (or other proteins) might be required to achieve effective stimulation of PLD1. We observed that endogenous PLD activity in COS-7 cells was significantly enhanced by the expression of PKNβ (data not shown), suggesting that PKNβ may work as an effective stimulator in vivo. PKCα is well known to stimulate PLD1 activity by direct interaction in a phosphorylation-independent manner. The interaction and the stimulation are enhanced by the presence of phorbol ester (25Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.S. Suh P.G.

Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of the conformational change of PKCα induced by phorbol ester binding as well as intracellular translocation of PKCα to the membrane. Proteolysis studies indicate that the N-terminal regulatory region of PKCα mediates this stimulation (25Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The mechanism of PLD1 stimulation by the PKN family presented here seems to be similar to that by PKCα. However, we observed stimulatory effects with the C-terminal catalytic region of PKNα but not with the N-terminal regulatory region (data not shown). Further analyses will be needed to clarify the difference in the mechanism of PLD stimulation between the PKN and PKC families. PKNα and PKNβ associated with PLD1 through the N- and C-terminal regions (Fig. 3). We have reported that the N-terminal region of PKNα directly interacts with the C-terminal catalytic region and that this interaction inhibits its catalytic activity (39Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the PLD1 stimulation by the C-terminal region of PKNα may be affected by the interaction between its N-terminal region and PLD1. PLD1 stimulation by PKNα was enhanced by the presence of arachidonic acid, which is a potential activator of PKNα (Fig. 6). Arachidonic acid activates PKNα probably by inducing conformational change to release the N-terminal region and the autoinhibitory region from the catalytic region (12Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This conformational change may help the associated PLD1 to form active conformation. Although PKNβ has the conserved domain corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of PKNα, arachidonic acid has little effect on the protein kinase activity (6Oishi K. Mukai H. Shibata H. Takahashi M. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and PLD1 stimulation by this enzyme (Fig. 6, right), suggesting that conformation of PKNβ is not sufficiently changed by arachidonic acid. PKN family proteins interact with the Rho family small GTPase (3Shibata H. Mukai H. Inagaki Y. Homma Y. Kimura K. Kaibuchi K. Narumiya S. Ono Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). PKNα is activated by the binding of RhoA to its leucine zipper-like domain in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting that the interaction with GTP-bound RhoA also causes the conformational change of PKNα to expose the catalytic domain to substrate. Thus, RhoA might stimulate PLD1 activity by activating the PKN family in addition to the direct interaction with PLD1. In summary, the PKN family protein kinases modulate the activity of PLD1 by direct protein-protein interaction. Further analysis including the relationship between other cofactors activating PLD1 and the PKN family will provide important insights into the physiological role of PLD1 and PKN family.

Molecular dosimetry experiments suggest, however, that it is a persistent lesion, because 2 weeks after exposure of rats to vinyl chloride, the εA level in liver DNA remains very similar to that obtained directly after treatment (9Swenberg J.A.

Treatment of mammalian cells with compounds inducing etheno-DNA adducts additionally triggers chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (1Bartsch H. Barbin A. Marion M.-J. Nair J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12793-12801Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have shown that in alkali, but also under physiological conditions, εA is rearranged into a pyrimidine ring-opened derivative, 4-amino-5-(imidazol-2-yl)imidazole, which has about 20-fold higher mutagenic potency in Escherichia coli(AB1157 lacΔU169) than the parental εA (14Basu A.K. Wood M.L. Niedernhofer L.J. Ramos L.A. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12793-12801Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because the secondary lesions arising from εA might contribute significantly to its mutagenesis, we undertook a detailed study of the chemical stability of εA in DNA, during which we found enzymes repairing a derivative formed during εA chemical rearrangement and identified excised lesion. 1,N 6-εdA was synthesized using the modified procedure of Barrio et al. (15Barrio J.R. Secrist III J.A. Leonard R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) described for the synthesis of its ribo-cogener. The material obtained (needles, melting point, 163–164 °C) was 99% pure (HPLC). Its identity was confirmed by UV, NMR, and electrospray MS. Oligodeoxynucleotide (40-mer) containing a single εA at position 20 in the sequence 5′-d(GCT ACC TAC CTA GCG ACC TεAC GAC TGT CCC ACT GCT CGA A)-3′ was purchased from Eurogentec Herstal, (Herstal, Belgium). The purity and identity of this oligomer was verified by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The oligomer was digested enzymatically to deoxynucleosides, which were separated by HPLC (for the details see below and Fig. 5). The deoxynucleoside content calculated on the basis of peak areas was for dC, 16.1, dG, 7.5, dT, 8.0, dA, 7.5, and εdA, 0.9 residues/molecule, which is in good agreement with the previewed values of dC, 16, dG, 7, dT, 8, dA, 8, and εdA, 1 residue(s)/molecule. The identity of the εA-oligomer was confirmed by mass spectrometry using an electrospray Quadrupol-time of flight instrument (Q-TOF, Micromass). The measured molecular mass of εA-oligomer was 12,145.3 ± 0.4, which is consistent with the expected mass of 12,144.9. No significant traces of the compound, the molecular weight of which would correspond to the presence in the oligomer of compound B instead of εdA (M r 12,163), were detected (less than 2%). No peak corresponding to the presence of compound C in this oligomer (M r 12,134) was recorded. Both methods confirmed the identity and purity of εA-oligomer. Four complementary oligodeoxynucleotides containing T, C, G, or A opposite εA were either purchased from Eurogentec or synthesized according to standard procedures using a Beckman Oligo 1000m synthesizer (Oligonucleotide Synthesis Laboratory, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences). E. coli Fpg and Nth proteins were purified from overproducing strains (JM105 supE endA sbcB15hsdR4rpsL thiΔ(lac-proAB) carrying the pFPG230 plasmid and BH410 (as JM105 but fpg-1:Kn harboring the pNTH10) as previously described (16Boiteux S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12105-12111Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). HumanN-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (ANPG-40) as well as bacterial strains overproducing Fpg and Nth glycosylases were a kind gift from Dr. Jacques Laval (Institut G. Roussy, Villejuif, France). T4 kinase was from TaKaRa, nuclease P1 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, snake venom phosphodiesterase from PL Biochemicals, and E. coli alkaline phosphatase from Sigma. HPLC was performed using a Waters dual pump system with a tunable UV/visible light absorbance detector managed by Millenium 2010SS (version 2.15) controller. All separations were performed on a Waters Nova-Pak® C18 reversed-phase column (60 Å, 4 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). NMR spectra were measured on a UNITY 500plus (Varian) spectrometer equipped with a gradient generator unit Performa II, Ultrashims, and a high stability temperature unit using 5 mm 1H{13C/15N} pulsed field gradient triple probe. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of nucleosides was performed on a Mariner apparatus with time of flight detection. UV spectra were recorded on a Cary 3E spectrophotometer. Silica gel 60 F254 aluminum sheets (Merck, catalog no. 1.0554) were used for analytical purposes. For preparative purposes 20 × 20 cm plates were prepared using silica gel 60 PF254(Merck, catalog no. 1.07747). The following solvent systems were used: methanol/chloroform, 15:85 (I); isopropyl alcohol/25% aqueous NH3/water, 70:10:10 (II) and 70:5:5 (III). The solutions of εdA (1–2 mm) were incubated in pH 12 (0.02 nNaOH), pH 9.2 (0.1 mNa2B4O7), or pH 7.5 (0.1m phosphate buffer) at 37 °C or at room temperature (23 °C) for various periods (15 min to 30 days) and were analyzed by HPLC. The representative separations, retention times, and chromatographic conditions are given in Fig. 2. The neutral depurination of 2′-deoxyadenosine and εdA was studied in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 60 °C by HPLC. The HPLC analysis of depurination was performed similarly to the analysis of alkaline degradation of εdA with the exception that gradient was present for 30 min (the relevant retention times under these conditions (in minutes) were: dA, 11.5; A, 9.7; εdA, 13.0; εA, 11.9; and product B, 8.4). A reaction mixture contained ∼0.1 mmol of εdA in 1 ml of 0.05n NaOH. After 3–7 days at 37 °C, TLC in solvent II showed the presence of product B(R f = 0.52) and C(R f = 0.67), some nonreacted εdA (R f = 0.60), D(R f = 0.38), and other products. The separation of products was done using preparative silica gel plates run 2–4 times in the same direction in solvent III. The appropriate bands were eluted by methanol, and the purity of products was verified by HPLC. The final purification was done by preparative TLC in solvent I. The products obtained were more than 95% pure, and they were used for studies by UV, NMR, and MS.

NMR data are gathered in supplemental Tables 1S and 2S. Samples for the NMR measurements were prepared in D2O or Me2SO-d 6 at concentrations of ∼5 mm. Spectra were measured at 25 °C using proton 1D, TOCSY (19Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 20Bax A. Freeman R. J. Magn.

Proton spectra in aqueous solution were calibrated against a water signal (27Gottlieb H.E. Kotlyar V. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 7512-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (2967) Google Scholar). In Me2SO-d 6 solution the residual solvent signal was used as a reference (28Hoffman R.E. Davies D.B. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1988; 26: 523-525Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in both proton and carbon dimensions in {1H/13C} correlation spectra. The kinetics of compounds B and C formation in oligodeoxynucleotides as well as the identification of substrates for repair glycosylases was performed by HPLC. εA-40-mer was incubated in 0.2 n NaOH for 1–4 h, neutralized by the addition of an equivalent amount of 1 n HCl and 1/10 volume of 1n Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, ethanol-precipitated, and washed. Then oligomers were digested enzymatically to nucleosides. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 1.5 nmol of oligomer, 1.5 units of nuclease P1, 0.075 units of snake venom phosphodiesterase, 0.3 units of E. coli alkaline phosphatase in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. After digestion (1 h, 37 °C), proteins were ethanol-precipitated, and the supernatant containing the nucleosides was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in water, and subjected to HPLC. The representative separations, retention times, and chromatographic conditions are given in Fig. 5. The 40-mer oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single εA or its rearrangement products obtained by oligomer incubation in 0.2 n NaOH for 1–16 h was radiolabeled with32P at the 5′-end and annealed to the complementary strand (double molar excess). The release of εA or its rearrangement products by glycosylases was assessed by measuring the cleavage of 40-mer at the site of lesion. The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 5′ 32P-labeled duplex (1 pmol), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol in 70 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6 for the Fpg protein or pH 7.8 for ANPG-40 or Nth glycosylases. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for a 10 min in the presence of excess of repair glycosylases (100–150 ng of each protein/sample) and then subjected to 20% PAGE in the presence of 7 m urea. To cleave the oligomer at the apurinic/apyrimidinic site remaining after excision of εA by ANPG-40 protein, the reaction mixture prior to PAGE was incubated in 0.2 n NaOH at 70 °C for 30 min. Gels were exposed to x-ray film, scanned in an LKB densitometer, and quantified using Microcal Origin. Kinetic constants were established in εA-oligomer incubated in 0.2 n NaOH for 4 h. The concentration range of the oligomer was 0.6–48 nm when the modified base was paired with dT, 4.8–65 nm when paired with dA, 0.3–75 nm paired with dC, and 2–160 nm paired with dG. The amounts of pure Fpg protein used in the reaction were adjusted to obtain less than 50% utilization of substrate and equaled 0.4 ng when modified base was paired with dT and dG, 2 ng when paired with dA, and 0.2 ng with dC. In each experiment two control samples were set: negative without enzyme, to quantify nonspecific breakage of oligodeoxynucleotide; and positive with excess enzyme (150 ng of Fpg), to get 100% cleavage of oligomer. The reaction was performed precisely for 10 min and stopped by adding sequencing kit stop solution, and reaction products were separated by PAGE. Autoradiograms were scanned (LKB scanner), and the peaks on resulting plots, corresponding to cleavage product and nonreacted oligomer, were quantified using multi-peak Lorentzian fitting in Microcal Origin. In calculations the average substrate concentration (i.e. ([S]0 + [S] t )/2) and average velocity (i.e.([S]0 − [S] t )/t) were used (29Lee H.-J. Wilson I.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 242: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).V max and K m values were calculated by two methods: a program using the Eisenthall-Cornish-Bowden nonparametric algorithm (30Kamiński Z.W. Domino E.F. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1987; 24: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and direct fitting of the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten equation to the data points in Microcal Origin. Values obtained by both methods differed usually by no more than 3–6%. 1,N 6-Ethenodeoxyadenosine at pH 12 was degraded sequentially into three products: εdA →B → C → D (Fig.1), which could be separated by HPLC (Fig. 2, A and B) or by TLC. The first stage, εdA → B, was the fastest (t 12 at 23 °C was 2.5 h). The B→ C and C → D reactions at pH 12 were at least 10 times slower than the conversion εdA →B (Fig. 2). The rearrangement of εdA → B is strongly pH-dependent; a half-time of this reaction at 37 °C equals 1.5 h at pH 12, 7 days at pH 9.2, while at pH 7.5 about 1 year, as estimated on the basis of 30-day measurements (not shown). A half-time for B → C and C→ D reactions at pH 7.5, 37 °C is about 12 days, as judged by the HPLC analysis of the isolated compounds B andC. Thus, at physiological pH the first step of rearrangement in nucleosides occurs very slowly, and the subsequent steps are much faster. We were searching for other than high pH factors that could stimulate εdA rearrangements under physiological conditions. The degradation of εdA was tested in the presence of several amino acids (glycine,l-proline, l-lysine, l-serine, all at 80 mm, and 80% saturateddl-tyrosine), 50 mm glutathione (reduced form), and 80 mm mercaptoethanol, as well as 100 mmNaHS, NaN3, KF, and KI, all at 37 °C in 0.1m phosphate, pH 7.5. None of these compounds accelerated εdA → B conversion (not shown). HPLC analysis of neutral εdA and dA depurination at 60 °C shows that the initial rate of εA formation is 0.08%/h, whereas that of A is 0.004%/h. Depurination of εdA is concomitant with formation of productB with a rate of 0.2%/h (not shown); this shows that the glycosyl bond in εdA is 20-fold less stable than that in dA and that the pyrimidine ring opening in εdA is 2.5 times faster than the rupture of the glycosyl bond under neutral conditions. Composition of εA-oligomer incubated for 1–16 h in NaOH at 37 °C was analyzed by HPLC. Only εdA, productsB and C, could be identified, because compoundD was masked by components of the buffer used for enzymatic digestion of oligomer (Figs. 2 B and 5 D). To reach a rate of εdA → Bconversion similar to that in nucleoside, oligomer was treated with NaOH at a concentration 10-fold higher than that used for nucleoside. Similarly, the fluorescence loss, because of decomposition of εA (the only fluorescent component of the pathway) was observed at a 10-fold higher concentration of NaOH in polymer than in monomer (not shown). CompoundsB and C were already found in εA-oligomer not treated with NaOH (Fig. 2 D), although their amount was negligible and differed from batch to batch; usually they constituted 2–6% of the expected εdA amount (not shown). After 4 h of oligomer incubation in 0.2 n NaOH, εAB and C were found in comparable amounts (Fig.2 D), whereas a 4-h incubation of monomer in 0.02n NaOH resulted in the conversion of 80% of εdA intoB (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that in polymer the reaction is shifted toward the formation of compound Cunder conditions the same as those in the monomer rate of εA →B conversion. Proton chemical shifts of εdA compounds Band C were assigned using TOCSY and ROESY; the spectra are listed in supplemental Table 1S and carbon chemical shifts in supplemental Table 2S. The NMR signals in the spectra of εdA have been assigned following the assignment for the ribo-cogener (31Kronberg L. Sjöholm R. Karlsson S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The spectra of compoundB at room temperature contain two sets of signals (Fig.3) that are temperature-dependent, with the coalescence in Me2SO-d 6 at 80 °C. Each of the signal sets probably belongs to one of the isomers of compoundB (Fig. 1). We assigned the isomer B1 to be that in which the adenine ring has the hydroxyl group at position 2 and the hydrogen atom at position 3. The isomer B2 has the opened pyrimidine ring with the carbonyl group at position 2 and the proton at position 1. The ratio of B1 and B2 isomers in Me2SO d6 solution at 25 °C is 1:1, whereas in D2O the ratio is 13:87. The spectra of product C differ from those of compoundB in the values of chemical shifts of the H1′ and H2′ protons and lack the signal at ∼8.25 ppm corresponding to the proton H2. A comparison of the signals of all other non-exchangeable protons of the sugar moiety indicates that proton and carbon chemical shifts are almost identical for both the B and Cproducts as well as the parental compound εdA. This means that the sugar conformation remains very similar in all these compounds. The only differences observed are those indicating the shielding effects originated from the changes occurring within the base moiety. However, the NMR spectra of compound D are very different. The signals of the sugar moiety are absent, and only two very broad signals in the proton spectrum at ∼3.5 and 6.9 ppm were observed. We have not assigned these signals and do not propose any structure for the compound. The structures of the B and C compounds assigned by NMR were confirmed additionally by mass spectroscopy. The most abundant peaks in the B spectrum, the protonated deoxynucleoside (m/z = 294.1) and protonated base (m/z = 178.1), differ by 18 mass units from the corresponding peaks in the εdA spectrum (276.1 and 160.1, respectively). Then, the peaks in the C spectrum (266.1 and 150.1) differ by 28 units from the corresponding peaks in the B spectrum. These data are consistent with the following reaction scheme: εdA + H2O (18Yip K.F. Tsou K.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1973; 33: 3087-3090Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) → B − CO (28Hoffman R.E. Davies D.B. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1988; 26: 523-525Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) → C. The presence in the mass spectrum ofD peaks of m/z 316.3 and 288.3, together with the NMR data showing lack of deoxyribose in this compound, would indicate that D is a dimeric form of base moiety of compoundC. The conclusion can be drawn that depurination is the final step of εdA rearrangements. Human glycosylase-ANPG-40 protein effectively excised εA from the εA:T pair in the 40-mer duplex. However, its capability to cleave εA-oligomer pretreated with NaOH decreased proportionally to the time of incubation in 0.2 n NaOH (Fig.4 A). The εA-oligomer incubated in NaOH was cleaved by E. coliformamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg protein), leaving behind the β-δ-elimination product, and by endonuclease III (Nth protein), which worked by the β-elimination mechanism (Fig. 4 B). At the same enzyme concentration 40-mer was cleaved to a greater extent by the Fpg than the Nth protein. When, however, both enzymes were used, only the Fpg cleavage product was found (Fig. 4 B), which suggests that both enzymes recognized the same lesion, but/or Nth had a lower affinity to the lesion. Prolonged incubation of εA-oligomer in NaOH resulted also in a partial breakage of DNA at the εA site (Fig.4, A and B). This could be because of alkali-triggered hydrolysis of abasic sites formed after non-enzymatic depurination of either εA or D (Fig. 1) or to other, unknown mechanism. HPLC analysis shows that the εA-oligomer incubated for 4 h in 0.2 n NaOH contains εdA and both products of its conversion, compounds B and C (Fig.5 A). The amount of productB decreased substantially when oligonucleotide was digested with both the Fpg protein (Fig. 5 B) and the Nth glycosylase (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that both enzymes recognize and excise the modified base present in compound B. However, we were unable to discriminate between both isomers of compoundB. For the Fpg protein, the K m andk cat values for excision of the εA derivative when paired with dT and dC were very similar to the kinetic constants of known Fpg substrates 8-oxoG and Fapy-7MeG. Interestingly, theK m for excision of the εdA derivative paired with dA was an order of magnitude higher (∼60 nm) and when paired with dG two orders of magnitude higher than when it was paired with dT and dC (∼6 nm, TableI). For the Nth protein, theK m for excision of B from theB:T pair was 44 nm (k cat=13 min−1).Table IKinetic constants for the removal of modified bases from oligonucleotides by the Fpg proteinSubstrateK mk catk cat/K mnmmin−1ɛA derivative paired with:dA59.9 ± 20.50.49 ± 0.10.008dC6.2 ± 1.40.42 ± 0.020.068dG832 ± 3141-aEstimated values only.47.9 ± 13.11-aEstimated values only.0.058dT5.6 ± 2.10.46 ± 0.070.082Fapy-7MeG101-bValues are given according to Ref.37.0.501-bValues are given according to Ref.37.0.058-OxoG41-bValues are given according to Ref.37.0.431-bValues are given according to Ref.37.0.111341-cValues are given according to Ref.39.1.31-cValues are given according to Ref.39.0.01141-dValues are given according to Ref.42.0.131-dValues are given according to Ref.42.0.0092,2,4-Triaminooxazolone3161-cValues are given according to Ref.39.0.731-cValues are given according to Ref.39.0.002Apurinic/apyrimidinic41-bValues are given according to Ref.37.2.51-bValues are given according to Ref.37.0.61-a Estimated values only.1-b Values are given according to Ref.37Jurado J.

The exact role of dystrophin has yet to be determined, but many studies suggest that in muscle it maintains the cytoarchitecture of the cell by bridging intracellular F-actin filaments to the extracellular matrix via contacts with the dystroglycan complex (11Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12Rybakova I.N. J. Biol.

What is known is that mutation in the gene resulting in loss of dystrophin is the major cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, whereas mutations that alter or reduce the amount of the protein generally cause the milder Becker muscular dystrophy. Although many mutations in the dystrophin gene affect coding sequences, a few of the known mutations affect non-coding sequences, and often these impact on transcription of the gene. This type of mutation is not frequently observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy or Becker muscular dystrophy but is more common in a group of X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy patients (13Berko B. Swift M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), in which promoter deletions (14Muntoni F. Cau M. Ganau A. Congiu R. Arvedi G. Matedu A. Marrosu M.G. N.

These individuals continue to express full-length dystrophin in their skeletal muscle from the brain and/or Purkinje promoters (15Milasin J. Muntoni F. Severini G.M. Bartoloni L. Vatta M.

This suggests that different regulatory elements are involved in regulation of dystrophin gene expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle. This conclusion is supported in mouse by in vivostudies showing that the muscle core promoter of the mouse dystrophin gene is capable of expressing a reporter gene only in the right ventricle of the heart (17Kimura S. Abe K. Susuki M. Ogawa M. Yoshioka K. Kaname T. Miike T. Yamamura K. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that other othercis-acting elements are required for expression in other compartments of the heart and in skeletal muscle. The intron-1 enhancer described previously in intron-1 of the human gene is a good candidate for this regulatory function. Because detailed regulatory studies of the dystrophin gene cannot be done in human, we have turned to the mouse gene and have mapped an intron-1 enhancer element located 8.5 kilobases (kb)1 downstream from the mouse dystrophin muscle promoter which shows 65% homology with its human counterpart located 6.5 kb downstream (18Klamut H.J. Bosnoyan-Collins L.O. Worton R.G. Ray P.N. Davis H.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) from the human dystrophin muscle promoter. We have characterized the mouse enhancer in G8 and H9-C2 myogenic and 3T3 non-myogenic cell lines and found that enhancer activity is specific to differentiating myoblasts. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis studies have confined the enhancer activity to a minimum of four putative binding sites. These include three E-boxes, E1–E3, and a serum response element (SRE). E1 and E3 match the consensus 5′-AACAc/g c/g TGC a/t while E2 and a sequence contained in the SRE resemble the consensus 5′-GGa/cCANGTGGc/gNa/g. Factor binding studies by mobility shift analysis suggest that ubiquitous factors bind E2 and the SRE whereas myotube-specific factors complexed with myoD bind E1 and E3. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (20Shizuya, H., Birren, B., Kim, U.-J., Mancino, V., Slepak, T., Tachiri, Y., and Simon, M. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.8794–8797.Google Scholar) insert that contains the mouse dystrophin muscle promoter was identified by screening a BAC genomic library (Genomic Systems Inc.) with a probe that extends from position −500 to −900 relative to the transcriptional start site of the mouse dystrophin muscle promoter. To map the promoter within the BAC clone, the BAC insert was digested withEcoRI, BamHI, or HindIII restriction endonuclease, and fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products). This was hybridized to the same probe in the presence of 6 × sodium citrate, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm at 65 °C for 20 h. The membranes were washed in 1 × sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min following a wash at room temperature. A positive EcoRI fragment of 7.0 kb was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (pmdp) and mapped by partial cleavage using EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII restriction endonucleases (Fig.1 A). To identify restriction fragments that include the mouse counterpart to the human enhancer, the BAC clone was incubated with restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI, andHindIII. Restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane. The latter was hybridized to a SpeI-SacI 195-base pair (bp) fragment that includes the human dystrophin intron-1 enhancer in the presence of 6 × sodium citrate, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm at 50 °C for 20 h. Subsequently the membranes were washed in 6 × sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min following a wash at room temperature. Positive fragments include aHindIII fragment of 7.0 kb and a BamHI fragment of 11 kb which were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ to generate pmdeH and pmdeB, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Both fragments were mapped by partial cleavage using EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII restriction endonucleases, and a 3.0-kbEcoRI that hybridized to the human dystrophin enhancer was subcloned from pmdeB into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK+ to generate pmdeE (Fig. 1 B). Recombinant plasmids that were used to characterize the dystrophin muscle enhancer activity are derived from the pGL3 vector series containing the firefly luciferase gene (Promega). The C3 construct (Fig. 2) was made by inserting a 3.0-kb SacI-XhoI fragment that was isolated from pmdeE between the SacI andXhoI sites of the pGL3-P vector (Promega) upstream of the SV40 early promoter and the luciferase gene. To generate the constructs C1 and C2, a 3.0-kb BamHI fragment that was isolated from pmdeE and contains the MDE was inserted in either orientation at theBamHI site of the pGL3-P vector. In constructs of the A series, a fragment of 500 bp was tested for enhancer activity. In A1 and A2, the 500-bp fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATCGTAACGCGTGTCTGACTTCTCAGTTCAGACTTTCACCTTGG and 5′-ATCGTAACGCGTATAACACTTGATGCGTGCTGAAATG, which contain the MluI restriction site (underlined). In A3 and A4, the 500-bp fragment was amplified using oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATCGTAGGATCCGTCTGACTTCTCAGTTCAGACTTTCACCTTGG and 5′-ATCGTAGGATCCATAACACTTGATGCGTGCTGAAATG, which contain a BamHI restriction site. PCR products were gel purified using QIAQUICK gel extraction cartridges (Qiagen Inc.) and subsequently cleaved with either MluI or BamHI.MluI fragments were inserted at the MluI site of pGL3-P uspstream of the of the SV40 promoter to generate A1 and A2.BamHI fragments were inserted at the BamHI site of pGL3-P downstream from the luciferase gene to generate A3 and A4. The constructs B1 and B2 were made by deleting 220 bp from the MDE contained in constructs A1 and A2. Thus oligonucleotide primers that define the deletion end points 5′-ATCGTAGAATTCCTTTCCAAGGTGAAAGTCTGAACTGAG and 5′-ATCGTAGAATTCAAGTGAACGAAGACAAAATGTGACC and contain anEcoRI restriction site (underlined) were used to amplify a DNA fragment of 5.2 kb which is missing 220 bp of the 500 enhancer sequencer. Subsequently the fragment was cleaved with EcoRI, self-ligated, and transformed into Max Efficiency Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies Inc.). Deletions of the enhancer sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis with an automatic Applied Biosystems 373 sequencer. Binding determinants within the putative protein binding sites of the MDE were replaced with restriction sites by PCR. The oligonucleotide primers that were used to introduce base changes in the MDE binding sites E1–E4, mef-2, and SRE are listed in TableI. As a result, the bindings sites E1–E4 were replaced by a BamHI restriction site, whereas the mef-2 binding site and the SRE were replaced by MluI andPstI restriction sites, respectively. The template used was the B1 construct in which the BamHI site was destroyed by filling in the cohesive ends with Klenow DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). The PCR products that encode mutations in E-boxes E1–E4 were cleaved with BamHI, and products encoding mutations of the putative mef-2 and SRE binding sites were cleaved withMluI and PstI. Cleaved DNA products were gel purified using QIAQUICK cartridges, self-ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs Inc.), and transformed into E. coliDH5α. All mutations that were introduced in the MDE were confirmed by sequence analysis.Table IOligonucleotide primers used to mutagenize putative binding sites of mouse dystrophin enhancermef-2 mutant forward5′-ATCGTAACGCGTAGAGCAACAAATAGATAACGTAAACTTGmef-2 mutant reverse5′-ATCGTAACGCGTTCAGGGTGTGAACTGTTTGAAGGGTGGE1 mutant forward5′-ATCGTAGGATCCAAGAGGAACTCCTGATTAAGGAGAGGCTGAAGGE1 mutant reverse5′-ATCGTAGGATTCCAGCTTCCCATAAACTCTTTCAGTTAACCACGTACATGCCAGCE2 mutant forward5′-ATCGTAGGATCCAACAGCTGCTAAAGGGCTAGAAGATTTCCTCTGE2 mutant reverse5′-ATCGTAGGATCCGCTTCTGTTCTGCCCTTCAGCCTCTCCE3 mutant forward5′-ATCGTAGGATCCCTAAAGGGCTAGAAGATTTCCTCTGGATTAGGE3 mutant reverse5′-ATCGTAGGATCCTTCACATGGCTTCTGTTCTGCCCTTCASRE mutant forward5′-ATCGTACTGCAGACCTAATCCAGAGGAAATCTTGTAGCCSRE mutant reverse5′-ATCGTACTGCAGTTCAGCACGCATCAAGTGTTATACTACGCGE4 mutant forward5′-ATCGTAGGATCCTTATCAAGGGGTTCACTTTACACGCGTE4 mutant reverse5′-ATCGTAGGATCCATGACGTGCTGAAATGGCCCATTAGGGAThe putative binding sites E1–E4 were disrupted by the insertion of aBamHI site (bold), and the mef-2 and SRE were disrupted by the insertion of an MluI site (bold).

For liposome-mediated transfections, 5 μg of recombinant plasmid and 2 μg of pGK β-galactosidase were incubated with .0014 m DODAC:DOPE liposomes (Inex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) in 0.9% NaCl at room temperature for 10 min in a final volume of 50 μl. 750 μl of α-minimal Eagle's medium and 25% fetal bovine serum was added, and the mix was added to ∼2 × 105 cells on the surface of a well (six-well dish). Cells were incubated with the transfection mix for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The mix was removed, and α-minimal Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 h. Luciferase activity was measured in both myoblasts and myotubes. Myoblasts were harvested after 24 h with a cell scraper in luciferase lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm CDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Alternatively, cells were induced to differentiate into mature myotubes in α-minimal Eagle's medium containing 1% horse serum over 4 days and were harvested as above. Fibroblasts were harvested 1 day after transfection and harvested as above. Cellular extracts were prepared as described by the manufacturer (Roche). Luciferase activity was measured in a 5-μl aliquot of cellular extract mixed with 100 μl of luciferin reagent (20 mmTricine, 1 mm (MgCO2)4Mg(OH)2.5H2O, 2.7 mmMgSO4.7H2O, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm DTT, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP) using a ECG Berthold Lumat 9700 luminometer. The protein concentration of the cellular extracts was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by diluting 10–30 μl of the extract in luciferase lysis buffer in a final volume of 150 μl. The diluted extract was then mixed with 150 μl of 2 × β-galactosidase buffer (200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside). The luciferase activity of each extract was normalized for protein concentration and β-galactosidase. The luciferase activity obtained from constructs that contain the SV40 promoter/dystrophin enhancer was expressed relative to the activity obtained from constructs that express the luciferase gene from the SV40 promoter. Nuclear extracts from all cell lines were prepared as follows. Cells from a 10-cm dish were washed twice with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping in 500 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 min, resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgC12, 10 mm KCI, and l mm DTT). Cytoplasmic membranes were disrupted by passing cells through a 28-gauge needle on a 1-ml insulin syringe ∼10 times. Nuclei were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 s at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclei pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 25% glycerol, 420 mm KCI, 1.5 mm MgC12, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing protease inhibitors (50 ng/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The nuclei were incubated on ice for a minimum of 20 min and then passed four to eight times through a 28-gauge needle on a 1-ml insulin syringe. The debris was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 s. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and the supernatant was stored into aliquots at −80 °C. To generate a binding substrate, 10 pmol of a single stranded oligonucleotide was end labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and γ-ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in kinase buffer (70 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT) in a final volume of 10 μl. 10 pmol of the complement strand was prepared in 10 μl of 1 × annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, l mm EDTA) and added to the labeled oligonucleotide. Both strands were heat denatured by boiling for 5 min and allowed to cool slowly at room temperature. Competitor duplexes were generated by heat boiling 500 pmol of complementary strands for 5 min and allowing the strands to cool slowly to room temperature at a final concentration of 1 pmol/μl in 1 × annealing buffer. Binding reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min by incubating 0.05 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide with 1 pmol or 20-fold molar excess of competitor DNA and 3 μg of extract in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm MgC12, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol). Supershift reactions were carried out by preincubating myoD, E12, or serum response factor (SRF) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc.) with the extract for 60 min at 4 °C. The remainder of the binding reaction mix was subsequently added, and binding reactions were carried out as described earlier. Reaction products were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide 0.5 × TBE gel and run at 4 °C at 150 V. Because of the high degree of conservation between mouse and human (19Hoffman E.P. Monaco A.P. Feener C.C. Kunkel L.M. Science. 1987; 238: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a mouse counterpart to the human dystrophin intron-1 enhancer would lie at a similar distance downstream from the mouse promoter. To identify a large mouse clone that might contain the mouse promoter plus exon-1 and intron-1, we screened a mouse BAC genomic library (20Shizuya, H., Birren, B., Kim, U.-J., Mancino, V., Slepak, T., Tachiri, Y., and Simon, M. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.8794–8797.Google Scholar) using as probe a DNA fragment containing sequences that extend from −500 to −900 of the mouse dystrophin muscle promoter. A positive clone of ∼120 kb was cleaved withEcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI and hybridized to the mouse muscle promoter or the human enhancer (see “Experimental Procedures”). A 7-kb EcoRI fragment that hybridizes with the promoter sequence was subcloned into Bluescript SK+ (Fig. 1 A). Two fragments hybridized with the human dystrophin enhancer and therefore contain the putative MDE. A 7-kbHindIII fragment and an 11-kb BamHI fragment that hybridize with the human enhancer were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ to yield pmdeH and pmdeB, respectively (Fig. 1 A). All three clones were restriction mapped by partial digestion withEcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII, and the alignment of restriction sites from the three fragments allowed the fine mapping of a contig of ∼20 kb (Fig. 1 A). According to this restriction map, the putative MDE resides in the region of overlap of clones pmdeH and pmdeB. Digestion of pmdeB with EcoRI resulted in the subclone pmdeE containing this region (Fig.1 B). To determine whether the mouse counterpart to the human enhancer could enhance transcription, a 3.0-kb EcoRI fragment (Fig.1 B) that was isolated from pmdeE and contains the putative mouse enhancer was inserted in reverse orientation upstream of the SV40 early promoter and in both orientations downstream from the firefly luciferase reporter gene of the pGL3-P vector series (Promega) to generate recombinant constructs C1, C2, and C3 (Fig. 2). The latter were transfected into mouse skeletal muscle-derived G8 myoblasts (21Christian C.N. Nelson P.G. Peacock J. Nirenberg M. Science. 1977; 196: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as into rat heart-derived H9-C2 myoblasts (22Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell. Res. 1976; 98: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and mouse NIH 3T3 (23Jainchill J.L. Aaranson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Virol. 1969; 4: 549-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) embryonic fibroblasts using DODAC:DOPE liposomes. Myoblasts were harvested after 24 h or induced to differentiate into mature myotubes over 4 days. Fibroblasts were harvested 24 h after transfection. Our results show that in construct C2 and C3 transcription increases by ∼11 fold in differentiated G8 myotubes but not in myoblasts (Fig. 2). Interestingly in the C1 construct, transcription from the SV40 promoter increases more than 25- fold. In lines H9-C2 and NIH 3T3 cells, the enhancer has no effect on transcription of the luciferase gene (Fig. 2). Smaller fragments of 500 and 280 bp (Fig. 1 B) which contain the putative MDE were used to generate the constructs of the A and B series, respectively. These were all tested for enhancer activity. Our results show that both the 500- and 280-bp fragment increase transcription by a factor of 5–10-fold in differentiated G8 myotubes and 2–3-fold in differentiated H9-C2 myotubes (Fig. 2). No enhancer activity was observed in G8 or H9-C2 myoblasts or 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig.2). Our results suggest that sequence elements contained in the 3-kb fragment are required for full enhancer activity and restrict enhancer activity to G8 myotubes. Our results also show quite clearly that sequence elements contained in a shorter fragment of 280 bp contain the minimal elements for enhancer activity. Sequence analysis of the MDE revealed a putative mef-2 binding site (24Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), four E-boxes (25Braun T. Bober E. Winter B. Rosenthal N. Arnold H.H.

E-boxes 1 and 3 match the consensus 5′-AACAc/gc/gTGCa/t, whereas E-box 2 matches the consensus 5′-GGa/cCANGTGGc/gNa/g (33Apone S. Hauschka S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21420-21427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). E4 does not appear to match either of these two consensus sequences. Comparison of mouse and human enhancer sequences reveals a 65% homology. The analysis also reveals that the mef-1/mef-2 box (21Christian C.N. Nelson P.G. Peacock J. Nirenberg M. Science. 1977; 196: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) of the human enhancer is replaced by a single mef-2 site in the mouse enhancer. To determine which of the putative binding sites is required for enhancer activity we replaced the binding sites E1–E4 by aBamHI restriction site and replaced the A-T-rich sequences of the mef-2 site with a MluI restriction site by performing site-directed mutagenesis on the 280-bp enhancer (34Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). A 27-bp region that contains the SRE was deleted and replaced with a PstI site. The resulting constructs were transfected into G8 myoblasts, and enhancer activity was monitored in differentiated myotubes. Our results show that disruption of E1, E2, E3, and SRE abolishes enhancer activity, whereas disruption of the mef-2 or E4 binding site had no effect on transcription (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the MDE requires a minimum of four binding sites to activate transcription in G8 myotubes. The binding activities at the four putative binding sites were investigated further by gel shift assays (35Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar) using three labeled oligonucleotides that contain E-box 1, E-boxes 2 and 3, or the SRE (Table II). The oligonucleotides that contain each of these sequences were incubated in the presence of nuclear extracts (36Dignam D.J. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) that were prepared from non-myogenic NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, undifferentiated myoblasts, or differentiated myotubes of the G8 myogenic line. The specificity of binding was determined by performing binding reactions in the presence of a series of competitors that were added in 20-fold molar excess relative to the substrate.Table IIOligonucleotides used as top strands of binding substrates E1, 2+3 (E-boxes 2 and 3), and SREE1:5′-GAAGCTCAGACAGCTGGGAACTCCTGATT2+3:5′-GGCAGAACAGAAGCCATGTGAACAGCTGCTAAAGGGCTASRE:5′-CCAGCCCATCCCTAATGGGCCATTTCABinding sites E1, E2, E3, and SRE are in bold. Open table in a new tab Binding sites E1, E2, E3, and SRE are in bold. Binding reactions were carried out by incubating a labeled oligonucleotide that contains the E1 site in the presence of G8 myotube, G8 myoblast, or fibroblast extracts. In the presence of myotube extracts three protein-DNA complexes A1, A2, and A3 are apparent (Fig. 4 A), whereas in the presence of myoblast and fibroblast extracts only A1 and A3 can be detected (Fig. 4 B). A protein-DNA complex that migrates slightly faster than A3 is detected in all of the extracts in the presence every competitor. This suggests that this particular complex is not specific for any of the competitor duplexes used. The lower amounts of A1 in myotubes may come from myoblasts that have not differentiated. Thus, factors in the A1 and A3 complexes are likely to be ubiquitous, whereas certain factors in the A2 protein-DNA complex are likely to be specific to myogenic cells. Because the E1 binding site features an E-box of the mef-1 type, the factors that bind at this site are likely to be part of a mef-1 complex (37Horlick R.A. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell.

To confirm further that the A2 protein-DNA complex included factors that were specific to an E-box of the mef-1 type, we performed binding reactions in the presence of oligonucleotide competitors that feature E2, E3, mef-2, and the SRE. We notice that A2 is competed out by excess amounts of E3 and E1 competitors. Because both E1 and E3 feature an E-box of the mef-1 type, our results suggest that a mef-1 complex binds to E1. Because mef-1 complexes are known to include myogenic diffe"
https://openalex.org/W2017730912,"Heterodimeric transcription regulatory proteins can bind to palindromic recognition elements in two opposite orientations. We have developed a gel-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay for quantifying heterodimer orientation preferences. Fos-Jun heterodimers bind in opposite orientations to AP-1 sites with different flanking sequences. The effects of individual amino acid and base pair substitutions on heterodimer binding orientation were quantified. Base pairs at positions ±6 and ±10 relative to the center of the AP-1 site were the principal determinants of Fos-Jun binding orientation. Amino acid residues of opposite charge adjacent to the basic regions of Fos and Jun had independent effects on heterodimer orientation. Exchange of these amino acid residues between the basic region-leucine zipper domains of Fos and Jun reversed the binding orientation. Heterodimers formed by full-length Fos and Jun exhibited the same changes in binding orientation in response to amino acid and base pair substitutions. The preferred orientation of heterodimer binding affected the stability of Fos-Jun-NFAT1 complexes at composite regulatory elements. Changes in heterodimer orientation preference altered the transcriptional activity and the promoter selectivity of Fos-Jun-NFAT1 complexes. Consequently, the orientation of Fos-Jun binding can influence transcriptional activity by altering cooperative interactions with other transcription regulatory proteins."

Among the 19 collagen types hitherto identified, five of them, types I-III, V, and XI, constitute the fibrillar collagens (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Each procollagen molecule is made of three α chains, each of which can be identical or not. Each α chain contains a triple helical region of 1014 amino acids constructed of an uninterrupted series of GXY triplets. Two non-collagenous regions, the amino- and the carboxyl-propeptide flank this domain. During extracellular maturation of procollagen into collagen molecules, the N- and the C-propeptides are generally removed by the action of specific proteases. The resulting collagen molecule consists of a central triple helix flanked by two short non-collagenous segments, the N- and the C-telopeptides (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 2Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Although the size of the central triple helical region is conserved, with one glycine residue for every three amino acids, the sequence of the C-propeptide domain is the most conserved among the α chains. In contrast, the N-propeptide domain is the most variable region among procollagen molecules. Three different N-propeptide configurations have been characterized in vertebrates (3Lee B. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 172-187Google Scholar), and a fourth structure has been defined in sea urchin (4Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17404-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of them contain a short triple helical region at the carboxyl terminus. In sea urchin, the N- propeptide consists, from the amino to the carboxyl terminus, of a cysteine-rich region or tsp-2 module, 12 repeats of a four-cysteine domain, and a short triple helical region connected to the N-telopeptide. The four-cysteine module or SURF,1 for Sea URchin Fibrillar, domain has been described for the first time in the 2α fibrillar collagen chain, but the sea urchin genome possesses at least one other region that could potentially encode several SURF modules (4Exposito J.Y.

In situ hybridization reveals that 2α transcripts are detected in mesenchymal cells at the late gastrula stage and in spicule- and gut-associated cells in plutei (6D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Suzuki H.R. Solursh M. Gambino R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7050-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining indicates the presence of this protein around the skeleton spicules and as a thin meshwork in the extracellular matrix surrounding mesenchymal cells (7Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In adults, collagen fibrils have been detected in the soft connective tissues of the test, the dermal outer appendages or spines, the Aristotle's lantern or echinoid jaw, the tube feet, and the peristomial membrane that bridges the gap between the jaw and the skeleton (8Bailey A.J.

In this study, we sought to obtain new information concerning SURF modules in sea urchin. We characterized a new gene coding for a multidomain protein of the extracellular matrix consisting of a series of EGF-like and SURF modules. Its general structure is reminiscent of sea urchin fibropellins. This new protein is present in several soft tissues of the mineralized part of the adult. Its co-localization with the 2α fibrillar collagen chain, its biochemical properties, the presence of EGF-like motifs that might bind calcium, and its interfibrillar localization suggest a function for this protein in the so-called mutable collagenous ligaments of sea urchin. Paracentrotus lividuswere purchased from the Arago laboratory (Banyuls-sur-mer, France). Gamete collection, fertilization, and embryo culture were done as previously described. Total RNA from embryonic or adult tissues was purified according to a published protocol (13Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA ( N Y ). 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). For adult RNA, a supplementary purification step was performed prior to RACE experiments consisting of pelleting the RNA by ultracentrifugation through a 5.7 m cesium chloride cushion (14Morlé F. Starck J. Godet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3279-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by two passages through an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Northern blot, Southern blot, and screening procedures were done according to conventional techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The genomic DNA library was kindly provided by Dr. Christian Gache, marine station, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. Hybridization and washing of filters with moderate stringencies were performed as described (16Su M.W. Suzuki H.R. Bieker J.J. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For all RT-PCR experiments, 200 ng of plutei poly(A)+ RNA were reverse transcribed using random primers and the reverse Expand kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For PCR, several sets of primers were used and 35 cycles of amplification of the target single strand cDNA were done using the TaqExpand polymerase kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The conditions were: 94 °C for 3′, then 10 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 15 s, 55–65 °C (depending on the primers) for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1–2 min. For the last 25 cycles, 15 s were added for each cycle during the elongation step. After PCR, fragments were purified from the gel and cloned using the TA-Topo 2-1 cloning kit from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RACE experiments, we used the 5′ and 3′ RACE kits from Life Technologies, Inc., and total RNA from the test was used instead of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from plutei. All the oligonucleotides used are listed in Fig. 1 and were synthesized by Isoprim (Toulouse, France). Both DNA strands were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (Sequenase kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and universal primer or synthetic oligonucleotides. DNA sequences were analyzed by the DNAid computer program (17Dardel F. Bensoussan P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 483-486PubMed Google Scholar). Blast (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A.

To prepare anti-fibrosurfin monoclonal antibodies, the DNA insert encoding the SURF module R8 was generated by PCR using the RT-PCR fragment RT3 (see Fig. 1) as template with Goldstar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The 5′ primer (5′-TATGGATCCGCCGTTGAGGTCACAAGCAC-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-TATCTGCAGACCTGTGCACGTGACAGCTTC-3′) included a BamHI and a PstI site, respectively. We used a derivative of pT7/7 (U S Biochemical Corp.) as an overproducing plasmid in which six His codons had been included between the PstI andHindIII sites with a stop codon following the last His codon (20Cortay J.C. Nègre D. Scarabel M. Ramseier T.M. Vartak N.B. Reizer J.H. Saier M. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14885-14891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Production and purification were done as previously described (7Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody production, titration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and characterization by immunoblotting was performed using established protocols (21Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Garrone R. van der Rest M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 92-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tissues were dissected from adultP. lividus. Test, Aristotle's lantern, digestive tract, spines, base of spines, and peristomial membrane were collected. Sequential 24 h extractions at 4 °C in 2 m urea and then in 8 m urea with protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) were performed on embryos or crushed tissues with ∼5 ml of extraction buffer/g of wet material. Supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. Crude extracts were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, St. Quentin en Yvelines, France) overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm CAPS pH 11, 5% methanol Blots were exposed to 23-2D4- (anti-SURF module R8, fibrosurfin) and 11-4E11- (anti-SURF module R2, 2α chain; Ref. 7Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) purified antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibody and developed using the substrate kit from Bio-Rad (Ivry-sur-Seine, France). Protein extracts (2 m urea) from test were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and chromatographed on a DE52 anionic exchanger. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1m NaCl. Test and spine bases were dissected from individual P. lividus. Samples were rinsed with artificial sea water (ASW, 480 mm NaCl, 10 mmKCl, 26 mm MgCl2, 29 mmMgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, pH 8) and fixed for 4 h at 4 °C in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in ASW. After rinsing with ASW, calcified tissues were demineralized with 0.5 m EDTA at 4 °C. Finally, all samples were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thin sections (5–10 μm) of frozen tissue were cut on a Cryostat (Leitz), picked up on slides, or maintained floating in solution and handled with Pasteur pipettes for electron microscopy. Sections were immunolabeled with 23-2D4 and 11-4E11 (undiluted hybridoma supernatants) as primary antibodies. Negative controls were performed by omitting the primary antibody. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies: fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1/400; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated to 5 nm gold particles (diluted 1/20, British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK) for electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence observations were performed on a Zeiss Universal microscope. For electron microscopy, immunolabeled sections were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1m, pH 7.4). Samples were rinsed in the same buffer and post-fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 1% osmium tetroxide in 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4). After rapid washing in water, sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut ultramicrotome and contrasted with methanolic uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples were observed with a CM120 Philips electron microscope at the ”Center de Microscopie Electronique Appliquée à la Biologie et à la Géologie“ (CMEABG, Université Claude Bernard, Lyon I). From previous work we have shown that SURF modules are present in the N-propeptide of the sea urchin 2α fibrillar collagen chain and that another part of the sea urchin genome could encode several SURF modules (4Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17404-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Exposito J.Y. Boute N. Deléage G. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Until now, however, we have had no evidence that this region is part of an active gene or pseudogene. Moreover, a Southern blot of P. lividus genomic DNA under moderate stringency revealed that several parts of the sea urchin genome could encode SURF modules (data not shown). From these results, we used the same hybridization conditions to screen a P. lividus genomic DNA library. Among 60,000 clones, 54 positive clones exhibiting variable intensities of labeling were detected. Shotgun sequencing analyses were done for several weakly positive clones, two of which overlap, that possess sequences coding for SURF modules. Blast search analyses revealed that these SURF modules shared 20–30% identity with comparable domains of the 2α chain and the putative 5α protein. RT-PCR experiments were done using poly(A)+ RNA extracted from plutei embryos. As presented in Fig. 1, six overlapping RT-PCR fragments (RT1-RT6) lead to the characterization of 11 SURF modules and three EGF repeats. Northern blots performed using poly(A)+ from plutei with the RT-PCR fragment RT4 as probe failed to give any detectable signals (Fig. 2 A). Moreover (as described below in more detail) no positive bands were obtained during embryogenesis when monoclonal antibodies against the SURF modules R8 were used in Western blotting, though a positive reaction was obtained with adult test. By Northern blotting using the RT4 DNA fragment, a 13-kilobase mRNA was detected with total test RNA (Fig. 2 A). As a control, multiple 2α transcripts were detected either with plutei or test RNA (Fig. 2 B). To obtain the complete coding sequence, 5′ and 3′ RACE were performed using total test RNA (Fig. 1). Two new overlapping RT-PCR fragments (RT7 and RT8) covering the complete reading frame were prepared and analyzed to confirm the primary structure. Analysis of RACE and RT-PCR cDNA clones revealed that the composite sequence presented an open reading frame, which could encode a protein of 2656 amino acids (Fig.3). From the amino to the carboxyl termini, the conceptual open reading frame contained a putative signal peptide of 16 or 24 amino acids, one EGF repeat, a 122-amino acid domain with two cysteine residues, two EGF motifs, 13 SURF modules, 14 EGF repeats, and a short 29-amino acid region with two cysteines. Two possible translation start sites were present, of which the sequence flanking the Met codon, numbered 1 in Fig. 3, better matched the consensus motif for the translation initiation (22Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Blast searches indicated that the 17 EGF motifs gave the best scores with the comparable domains of fibropellin (23Bisgrove B.W. Andrews M.E. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Bisgrove B.W. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 526-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Notch (25Sherwood D.R. McClay D.R. Development. 1997; 124: 3363-3374PubMed Google Scholar) proteins. Like these proteins, 11 of the 17 EGF repeats presented the consensus signature of calcium-binding EGF modules (cbEGF), i.e., (DEQN)X(DEQN)2CXnCXnCX(DN)X4 (FY)XC (PROSITE, PDOC00913). The 122-amino acid domain gave the best scores with the CUB domain of fibropellins (23Bisgrove B.W. Andrews M.E. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Bisgrove B.W. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 526-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In comparison, highest percentage identities were at least 75% for the EGF modules and 23% for the CUB domains. Blast searches were also performed using the carboxyl-terminal domain, but no significant scores were obtained with any data bank analyzed. A schematic representation of the new protein resembles the general structure of sea urchin fibropellins (24Bisgrove B.W. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 526-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with the exception of 13 SURF modules between EGF repeats 3 and 4 and the replacement of the avidin-like domain of fibropellins with a 29-amino acid domain (Fig. 1). From the common modular organization with fibropellin and the presence of SURF modules, we called this protein fibrosurfin. From its primary structure, fibrosurfin is an acidic protein with an estimated isoelectric point of 4.12 and a calculated molecular mass of 276 kDa. The net charge is −211 (10.7% of Asp + Glu), but EGF domains are the most anionic part of fibrosurfin (13.15–21.05% of Asp + Glu). From its amino acid composition, fibrosurfin is rich in serine and threonine residues (20.5%), especially the SURF domains (up to 28.3%). Finally, five consensus N-linked glycosylation sites are present, two in the CUB domain, one between EGF-repeats 2 and 3, and the remainder within SURF modules 5 and 13 (Fig. 3). As indicated above, monoclonal antibodies against a recombinant protein sharing SURF module 8 of fibrosurfin were prepared. Unlike EGF repeats, most of the SURF modules present a low level of identity between them. Hence, the SURF module 8 of fibrosurfin shows the highest identity with SURF modules 5 of fibrosurfin (39%) and 12 of the 2α chain (33%). Moreover, the monoclonal antibody used in this study did not cross-react with several previously produced recombinant proteins harboring SURF modules of the 2α chain (data not shown and Ref. 7Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These antibodies were used to examine the expression of fibrosurfin in sea urchin tissues. Because the gene coding for this protein was expressed in test, Western blotting was performed using different protein extracts from demineralized tests (Fig.4). After urea treatment, several immunoreactive bands were detected between 80–160 kDa. Positive bands with a molecular mass higher than 120 kDa disappeared rapidly upon short term storage at 4 °C or −20 °C (results not shown). Using the chemical properties of fibrosurfin, urea protein extracts from test were submitted to anionic exchange chromatography, and eluted fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A). The major bands present in the 0.36 m NaCl fraction were recognized by the anti-fibrosurfin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 5 B), whereas 2α immunoreactive bands were detected in the 0.04 and 0.2 mNaCl fractions (Fig. 5 C). Edman degradation sequencing of the 0.36 m NaCl bands specific from fibrosurfin was performed, but their amino termini were blocked. Nevertheless, in some experiments, a highest molecular mass band (280–300 kDa) was recognized by the anti-fibrosurfin monoclonal antibody (Fig.5 D, 0.25 and 0.3 m NaCl fractions). As a next step, Western blots were performed using protein extracts from embryos using the anti-fibrosurfin monoclonal antibody (Fig.6). In these blots, no immunoreactive bands were detected except for the positive control consisting of proteins extracted from test. Finally, several tissues from adult animals were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-fibrosurfin (Fig.7 A) or anti 2α (Fig.7 B) monoclonal antibodies. From these blots, the 2α N-propeptide and fibrosurfin were present in the same tissues,i.e. test, spine ligament, and peristomial membrane. Traces of the proteins were detected in the tube feet, whereas no detectable signals were obtained in extracts of the digestive tract or of spine tips. The 2α chain is also detected in the Aristotle's lantern. As for fibrosurfin, several immunoreactive bands were exposed using anti-2α N-propeptide monoclonal antibodies. For both proteins, the patterns of positive bands were slightly different in the different tissues analyzed, especially for fibrosurfin. High molecular mass immunoreactive bands were obtained for both proteins in extracts from the peristomial membrane.Figure 5Anion-exchange chromatographic analysis of fibrosurfin. Urea protein extracts from test were separated by anionic exchange chromatography (DE52) under a linear gradient of NaCl, and fractions were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (A) and analyzed using the monoclonal antibody (23-2D4) against fibrosurfin (B) or analyzed using the monoclonal antibody (11-4E11) against the 2α chain (C). In an other experiment, a stepwise NaCl elution was performed, and Western blot was carried out using the monoclonal antibody (23-2D4) against fibrosurfin (D).

In Fig. 8 A, a section of the catch apparatus consists of three regions: the mineralized tissues of the spine, the collagenous ligaments, and the external region, which is not depicted and contains mainly muscle cells and the epidermis. The sutural ligaments that link the calcite plates are composed of collagen fibrils (Fig. 8 A). We can distinguish the meridional or zigzag sutures from the circumferential sutures between the test plates. Using monoclonal antibodies against fibrosurfin or the 2α N-propeptide, immunofluorescence studies indicated that 2α and fibrosurfin were co-localized in the collagenous ligaments of the catch apparatus (Fig. 8, B and C) and in the sutural ligaments (Fig. 8, D and E). Zigzag sutures were more intensively stained than circumferential sutures. As shown in Fig.8 F, a strong autofluorescence was detected within the mineralized plates. To better localize fibrosurfin and the 2α N-propeptide in the spine ligament, preembedding immunoelectron microscopy was performed to preserve antigenicity. For fibrosurfin, gold particles were observed between or in close proximity to collagen fibrils, indicating that fibrosurfin is an interfibrillar component (Fig. 9, A and C). For the 2α N-propeptide, gold particles accumulated at the periphery of the bundles made of collagenous fibrils aligned in parallel. These gold particles were generally in the vicinity of cells (Fig.9 D) and rarely observed at the surface of collagen fibrils (Fig. 9 E). No signal was observed for the negative control (data not shown).Figure 9Ultrastructural analysis of the spine ligament using anti-fibrosurfin (A–C) and anti-2α chainD–F) antibodies.

In addition to the previously described 2α fibrillar collagen chain (4Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17404-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Exposito J.Y. Boute N. Deléage G. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we have obtained the primary structure of a new protein, which we call fibrosurfin and contains a series of 13 SURF modules. Immunolocalization and biochemical studies indicate that fibrosurfin, like the 2α chain, is one of the components of the collagenous ligaments that link together the calcite ossicles of the sea urchin skeleton. In addition, preliminary data concerning the previously describedCOLP5α gene (5Exposito J.Y. Boute N. Deléage G. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), indicate a similar localization of this related protein in adult tissues. 3C. Cluzel, C. Lethias, R. Garrone, and J. Y. Exposito, unpublished data. Taken together, these results suggest that proteins, including SURF modules, seem to be located around the mineralized region of the sea urchin and in so-called adult mutable collagenous tissues. From Fig. 1, a common origin for genes encoding fibropellins and fibrosurfin is strongly suggested. Firstly, highest identity scores were obtained between these two proteins for two types of modules, the CUB and EGF domains. Secondly, their general structures are closely related with the exception of the carboxyl-terminal domain and the insertion of a series of SURF modules between two EGF motifs (24Bisgrove B.W. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 526-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both these features greatly support the notion of exon shuffling (28Patthy L. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which accounts for considerable variety among multimodular proteins. Even though the general structures of these proteins are similar, it is difficult to obtain any co-linearity between their EGF modules as has been observed between sea urchin fibropellins. This suggests that these genes had diverged early during evolution or that they have evolved rapidly. Although the 2α chain and 5α protein are similar, we could not detect any similarities between their SURF motifs and those of fibrosurfin. However, like 2α and 5α, fibrosurfin SURF modules are acidic. One of the particularities of fibrosurfin SURF modules is their high serine and threonine residue content. Several clusters of these amino acids provide potential sites for O-linked glycosylation (29Wilson I.B.H. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the course of this study, we have compared the results obtained using anti-2α N-propeptide and anti-fibrosurfin antibodies. It is worth noting that in plutei, we have previously shown the retention of the N-propeptide of the 2α chain at the surface of thin fibrils (7Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), indicating that this domain is not fully processed during embryogenesis. Here, we could detect several immunoreactive bands by Western blotting of adult tissue extracts, although immunoelectron microscopic labeling indicated that the 2α N-propeptide is located around bundles made of fibrils aligned in parallel with fibrosurfin located between fibrils. These results suggest that the N-propeptide is processed in the adult. This is consistent with the observation that adult fibrils are thicker (124 nm on average) (30Trotter J.A. Koob T.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, the distinct 2α bands could also represent the different 2α N-propeptide isoforms of the 2α chain previously identified (4Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17404-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For fibrosurfin, it is apparent that, in most cases, we could not obtain intact molecules in our extracts. Either this protein is already cleaved in these tissues or proteolytic events occurred during the solubilization procedures. It is worth indicating that a similar complex pattern of bands has been reported for the Notch receptor in sea urchin (25Sherwood D.R. McClay D.R. Development. 1997; 124: 3363-3374PubMed Google Scholar), a protein containing cbEGF. Moreover, some of the faster migrating bands probably also represent isoforms of fibrosurfin despite no alternatively spliced mRNA having been detected during the RT-PCR procedures and only one hybridizing band revealed by Northern blotting (pluteus and test RNA). We have yet to investigate possible alternative splicing events in other adult tissues. In fibrosurfin, 11 of the 17 EGF domains could potentially bind calcium. Proteins that contain EGF domains are often developmentally important (31Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Hence, roles in protein-protein or protein-cell interactions have been demonstrated or inferred for these proteins. Stretches of cbEGF are observed in fibrosurfin, and it has been demonstrated that tandemly repeated cbEGF modules display higher affinities than isolated cbEGF for calcium (33Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the same way, CUB-cbEGF pairs of two complement components, C1s and C1r, show high affinity for calcium (34Thielens N.M. Enrie K. Lacroix M. Jaquinod M. Hernandez J.F. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9149-9159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These two proteins form a tetrameric sub-unit C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s, and their assembly is calcium-dependent. Thus, the presence of a CUB-cbEGF region in fibrosurfin reinforces the idea that these domains might promote a homotypic association, whereas stretches of cbEGF might be involved in homotypic and heterotypic protein-protein interactions. EGF modules are located at the two extremities of fibrosurfin and correspond to the most anionic part of this protein. The interfibrillar matrix of these collagenous ligaments contains several polyanionic glycosaminoglycans (8Bailey A.J. Bairati A. Garrone R. Biology of Invertebrate and Lower Vertebrate Collagens. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 369-388Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, several acidic glycoproteins that have a strong negative charge seem to be important in the aggregation properties of the collagen fibrils (35Trotter J.A. Lyons-Levy G. Luna D. Koob T.J. Keene D.R. Atkinson M.A.L. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Trotter J.A. Lyons-Levy G. Chino K. Koob T.J. Keene D.R. Atkinson M.A.L. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both fibrosurfin and the 2α N-propeptide (pI 4.55) are also acidic and have a strong negative charge. From this potential capacity to bind calcium and its localization in collagenous ligaments as an interfibrillar component, fibrosurfin could be one of the factors responsible for the unusual properties of these collagenous tissues. In fact, echinoderm ligaments are quite unique and have been called mutable collagenous tissues or catch connective tissues (8Bailey A.J. Bairati A. Garrone R. Biology of Invertebrate and Lower Vertebrate Collagens. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 369-388Crossref Google Scholar, 37Wilkie I.C. Jangoux M. Lawrence J. Echinoderm Studies. A. A. Balkema, Rotterdam, Netherlands1996: 61-102Google Scholar). These animals possess a mechanism to alter the transfer properties of the interfibrillar matrix of their ligaments (35Trotter J.A. Lyons-Levy G. Luna D. Koob T.J. Keene D.R. Atkinson M.A.L. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37Wilkie I.C. Jangoux M. Lawrence J. Echinoderm Studies. A. A. Balkema, Rotterdam, Netherlands1996: 61-102Google Scholar), which permits modulation of both the shape and stiffness of collagenous tissues. A recent report indicates than one or more secreted molecules induce the aggregation of fibrils in the presence of calcium. For the sea cucumber dermis, stiparin is one of these stiffening factors (35Trotter J.A. Lyons-Levy G. Luna D. Koob T.J. Keene D.R. Atkinson M.A.L. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Modulation of these properties by anti-stiparin molecules has also been described (36Trotter J.A. Lyons-Levy G. Chino K. Koob T.J. Keene D.R. Atkinson M.A.L. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A more recent study indicates that stiffening and plasticizing factors seem to be located inside the cells of the holothurian dermis rather than in compartments of the extracellular matrix (38Koob T.J. Koob-Emunds M.M. Trotter J.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 2291-2301PubMed Google Scholar). One of their hypotheses is that the effect of these reagents could be amplified by matrix macromolecules like stiparin. From its extracellular matrix location and its biochemical characteristics, fibrosurfin might play a similar function. From the uniqueness of mutable collagenous tissues in echinoderms, an evolutionary origin for these functions has been proposed (39Ellers O. Telford M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 39-44Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). SURF modules have been characterized only in sea urchin despite the numerous international genome and expressed sequence tag programs. InCaenorhabditis elegans, more than 20 modules seem unique to this phylum (40Hutter H. Vogel B.E. Plenefisch J.D. Norris C.R. Proenca R.B. Spieth J. Guo C. Mastwal S. Zhu X. Scheel J. Hedgecock E.M. Science. 2000; 287: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because the three proteins harboring SURF modules appear to be specific to the mutable collagenous tissues, it is tempting to speculate that this module is one of the evolutionary elements responsible for this echinoderm feature. A search of SURF modules in other echinoderms and further analysis of SURF-containing proteins will permit us, in the future, to define more precisely the relationship between SURF modules and the so-called mutable collagenous tissues."

The single mutants at α16/α23 sites were also engineered as controls. The Csat values of the HbS point mutants involving sites α16 or α23 were higher than HbS but markedly lower as compared with HbS Twin Peaks. In contrast,Csat values of both double mutants were comparable with or higher than that of HbS Twin Peaks. The demonstration of the inhibitory effect of α113 mutation alone or in combination with other sites, in quantitative terms, unequivocally establishes a role for this site in HbS gelation.

Nature. 1956; 178: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The replacement of a charged residue with a hydrophobic one on the surface of the protein drastically reduces the solubility of the deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS)1, leading to its polymerization into long helical fibers that are responsible for the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. Electron microscopy and crystallographic studies have suggested that both the deoxy HbS crystal and fiber are constructed from the same “Wishner-Love” double strands (2Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8272-8279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8280-8291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dykes G.W.

Biol. 1979; 130: 451-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The model of the fiber structure derived from these analyses consists of seven Wishner-Love double strands (6Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol.

Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The polymerization process is triggered by lateral interactions of the donor Val-6β of a tetramer of one strand of the double strand with the acceptor pocket at the EF corner (elicited mainly by βPhe-85 and βLeu-88) of the β-chain of an adjacent molecule present in the second strand of the double strand. Subsequent intra-double strand and inter-double strand interactions involving several amino acid residues from both α- and β-chains contribute to the stabilization of the fiber structure. The polymerization-impairing or -enhancing propensity of mutant hemoglobins, in a binary mixture of mutant hemoglobins and HbS, has facilitated the mapping of several contact residues of the HbS polymer (10Nagel R.L. Johnson J. Bookchin R.M. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Schiliro G. Wajcman H. Labie D. Moo-Penn W. Castro O. Nature. 1980; 283: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Benesch R.E. Kwong S.

Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Manning J.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identities of all the fiber contacts that are predicted by model studies have not yet been tested in solution experiments. The fiber models themselves are not perfect, because they include several polymerization-insensitive sites, exclude polymerization-sensitive sites, and possibly underestimate or overestimate the number of contact residues (6Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol.

Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Thus, it is prudent to identify and authenticate all of the participating residues by solution polymerization studies. More importantly, knowledge of the inhibitory strength of each contact site and the combinatorial effects of two or more contact sites (interaction linkage) is imperative for designing effective antisickling agents or vectors for gene therapy that could bring about optimum inhibition of fiber formation needed for clinical amelioration of sickling. The relative strength of contact sites, as well as their “interaction linkage” relationships in terms of synergy and/or additivity, is largely unknown and is beginning to be addressed only now by solution polymerization studies (20Manning J.M. Dumoulin A. Li X. Manning L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19359-19362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have chosen three sites, namely α16, α23, and α113, for further delineation of their contributions to the polymerization of HbS. Whereas sites αLys-16 and αGlu-23, located in the AB region, are established contact points in the HbS polymer, the participation of αLeu-113 (GH1) in the polymerization process is unknown. The α113 site is of interest because of its unique structural location. First, α113 is in sequence contiguity with a cluster of GH corner residues, α114, α115, and α116, which are established or implicated intra-double strand contact sites of the HbS fiber (7Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Benesch R. Edalji R.

Biol. 1996; 263: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, the three-dimensional structure of the hemoglobin brings the AB region of the α-chain in close proximity to the GH corner. The involvement of several residues of the AB corner (α16, α20, α23) in HbS polymerization has been deduced from crystal structures and also been validated in solution experiments (21Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Benesch R. Nature. 1982; 299: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Rhoda M.D. Blouquit Y. Caburi-Martin J. Monplasir N. Galacteros F. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 786: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Kraus L.M. Miyaji T. Iuchi I. Kraus A.P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Caughey W.S. Biological and Clinical Aspects of Hemoglobin Abnormalities. Academic Press, New York1978: 195-201Google Scholar). However, αLeu-113, which is located in the periphery of several physiologically relevant axial contacts in the AB-GH region, is not implicated in any contacts by crystal or model studies. Interestingly, a natural Hb variant at this site, Hb Twin Peaks (αLeu-113→His), is reported (25Guis M. Mentzer W.C. Jue D.L. Johnson M.H. McGuffey J.E. Moo-Penn W.F. Hemoglobin. 1985; 9: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but the functional properties of Hb Twin Peaks or its participation in deoxy HbS polymerization has not been examined. Here, we constructed HbS Twin Peaks (αLeu-113→His, βGlu-6→Val) to establish the role of the α113 site in HbS fiber generation. Furthermore, we have combined the α113 mutation at the GH corner with mutations of contact sites involving residues α16 and α23 of the AB region to see whether the inhibitory sites in the “contact-rich” AB-GH domain have additive or synergistic influence on the Val-6β-dependent polymerization of HbS. We have adopted a chemo-enzymatic strategy for the construction of α-globin mutants. The propensity of V8 protease to catalyze the ligation of complementary fragments, α1–30 and α31–141, to generate a full-length α-globin (α1–141) has been utilized for this purpose (26Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Appropriate synthetic α1–30 segments were employed to incorporate desired mutations at sites α16 and α23. The Hb Twin Peaks mutation was introduced through the α31–141 segment of the marmoset (Callithrix argentata) α-chain, which contains a single amino acid substitution, αLeu-113→His, with respect to the human α31–141 segment (27Maita T. Hayashida M. Matsuda G. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). HbS tetramers were assembled from βs-chain and respective single and double mutant α-chains. The structural/conformational, functional, and polymerization behavior of mutants was studied with a view to examining the hitherto unknown role of the α113 (GH1) site in the HbS gelation process as well as to quantifying its inhibitory strength relative to selected AB region α-chain contact residues. CM-52 and DE-52 were purchased from Whatman. V8 protease was obtained from Pierce. The chemicals used in peptide synthesis were from Novabiochem. All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical purity and procured from standard commercial sources. The hemoglobins from sickle cell patients and marmosets were purified form respective red cell hemolysates by established procedures employing successive anion (DE-52) and cation (CM-52) exchange chromatography. The hydroxymercuribenzoate α- and β-chains were prepared as described previously (28Bucci E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The chains were freed from heme by acid-acetone precipitation. The complementary segments of α-globin needed for the semisynthesis of mutant chains were prepared by V8 protease digestion (26Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The respective globins were dissolved in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and digested at 37 °C with V8 protease (1:200, w/w) for 3 h. The completion of digestion was ascertained by RPHPLC. The complementary segments, α1–30 and α31–141, from the respective digestion mixtures were isolated in pure form by gel permeation chromatography on a Sephadex G50 column. The column was equilibrated and run in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The lyophilized sample of the digest was dissolved in the above solvent and loaded on to the column. The column was run at a flow rate of 45 ml/h, and the elution profile was monitored at 280 nm. The individual chromatographic profile of the α-globin digest (human or marmoset) showed only two peaks, α31–141 and α1–30, as expected from a single cleavage at the 30–31 peptide bond. The peak fractions from each digest were pooled separately and lyophilized. Peptides were synthesized by a standard solid phase N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy on a peptide synthesizer (model 90, Advanced Chemtech). For this, Wang resin pre-loaded with N-α-Fmoc-Glu was used as the starting material. The stepwise coupling of Fmoc amino acids was performed with theN,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole activation procedure. The coupling of each step was monitored by a Kaiser test (29Kaiser E. Colescott R.L. Bossinger C.D. Cook P.I. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 84: 595-598Crossref Scopus (3501) Google Scholar), and wherever necessary, a double coupling was used to increase the yield. On completion of the synthesis, the N-terminal Fmoc group was removed using piperidine. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected with an appropriate volume of a mixture containing trifluoroacetic acid, ethanedithiol, phenol, thioanisole, and water (80:5:5:5:5, v/v). The resin was removed by filtration, and the crude cleaved peptides were precipitated using cold diethyl ether. The peptides were purified by RPHPLC, and their chemical identity was checked by electrospray mass spectrometry. The experimental masses of the peptides were in agreement with their theoretical masses: α(Lys-16→Gln), observed mass of 3040.73 Da (theoretical mass, 3040.73); α(Glu-23→Gln), observed mass of 3040.50 (theoretical mass, 3039.39). V8 protease-mediated semisynthesis of α-globin was carried out at 4 °C in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6) containing 30% 1-propanol. For this, the lyophilized samples of natural or synthetic analogs of α1–30 and human or marmoset α31–141 were individually prepared in water. Suitable volumes of the complementary fragments were mixed to obtain a 1:1 molar ratio and lyophilized. The lyophilized material (150 mg) was dissolved in 6 ml of 84 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6). To this solution, 3 ml of 1-propanol was added. The mixture was cooled on ice, subsequent to which 1 ml of V8 protease solution (1.5 mg/ml prepared in water) was added. The ligation reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of 5% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. The semisynthetic α-globin was isolated from the mixture by CM52-urea chromatography, extensively dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and lyophilized (26Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The semisynthetic yield of the protein varied between 35 and 45%. The identity of the α-globin constructs were checked by mass spectrometry and tryptic peptide mapping. The semisynthetic α-globin was reconstituted with heme and the βs-chain into tetrameric hemoglobin through the “Alloplex pathway” as described previously (26Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reconstituted tetramers were purified by CM-52 chromatography. The heme stoichiometry in purified tetramers was ascertained by 280:540 nm absorbance ratios. TheA280:A540 ratio for native HbS was 2.54. For reconstituted tetramers, this ratio varied between 2.49 and 2.55. The tetramers were checked for the correct stoichiometry of chains by RPHPLC. The α- and β-chains from each Hb were isolated and subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry and tryptic peptide mapping to ensure that the reconstitution procedure did not alter the chemical integrity of the chains. The spectra were recorded on a Lambda Bio20 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The UV region-derivative spectra were recorded in the first derivative mode of the spectrophotometer. The hemoglobin concentration used for the spectral measurements was ∼50 μm on heme basis. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a J710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) fitted with a Peltier-type constant temperature cell holder (PTC-348W). The calibration of the equipment was done with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. The synthetic peptides were purified by RPHPLC on an aquapore RP300 column (250 × 7 mm) using a 4–72% linear gradient of solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 130 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Globin chains from respective hemoglobins were separated on a similar column of a smaller dimension (250 × 4.6 mm) under identical conditions but at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Analytical anion-exchange chromatography of HbS constructs was performed by FPLC (AKTA, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a Mono Q HR5/5 column. The respective protein samples were prepared in Tris acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 8.5) and loaded on the column that was pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The samples were chromatographed using a linear pH gradient of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.5 to 7.0 over 20 min with a 1 ml/min flow rate. The elution profile was monitored at 540 nm. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis was carried out on a VG Platform (Fisons) mass spectrometer. The instrument was usually calibrated with standard myoglobin solution. Appropriate amounts of globin chains isolated from each HbS sample by RPHPLC were taken in 50% acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid and analyzed under the positive ion mode. The spectra of globins produced a series of protonated species typically ranging from 13 to 22 positive charges. The average molecular mass of each globin from the respective spectra was obtained by using the software provided by the manufacturer. The oxygen affinity of hemoglobins was measured by a Hemox-Analyzer (TCS Medical Products, New Hope, PA) at 29 °C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The hemoglobin concentration was ∼0.1 mmbased on heme. The P50 value (partial oxygen pressure at 50% saturation) and the Hill coefficients (nmax), a measure of cooperativity, were determined from each dissociation curve. The gelation concentration of HbS constructs was determined by the dextran-Csat method of Bookchin et al. (30Bookchin R.M. Balazs T. Wang Z. Josephs R. Lew V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This method allows measurement of Csat under near-physiological conditions and at a much lower concentration of HbS (about 5-fold or less) than that required in standard Csat assays but essentially provides the same information. Briefly, a suitable aliquot of a concentrated solution of hemoglobin in potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 m, pH 7.5) was taken in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. A concentrated dextran (70 KDa) solution prepared in the same buffer was added to the aliqout and mixed well. This mixture was overlaid with 0.5 ml of mineral oil, chilled on an ice bath, and deoxygenated with an anaerobically prepared dithionite solution through an airtight Hamilton syringe. The final concentrations of dextran and dithionite in the mixture were 120 mg/ml and 0.05m, respectively. The above deoxygenated sample was allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 30 min, after which the gel under the oil layer was disrupted with the plunger of a Hamilton syringe. The tube was centrifuged at room temperature at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The above process of gel disruption and centrifugation was repeated twice, subsequent to which the oil layer was aspirated, and suitable aliquots from the supernatant were taken for estimation ofCsat by Drabkin's reagent. The delay time kinetics of deoxyhemoglobin were studied in 1.8 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.25) as described by Adachi and Asakura (31Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4079-4084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Cary 400 spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin samples was initiated by a temperature jump from 4 to 30 °C within 10 s, and the progress of the reaction was followed by monitoring turbidity changes at 700 nm. The delay time was calculated from the kinetic traces. The construction of the α-chain of Hb Twin Peaks (αLeu-113→His) through the α-globin semisynthetic strategy involves the stitching of human α1–30 with an α31–141 segment containing the Twin Peaks mutation. The two peaks isolated from G-50 chromatography of the V8 protease digest of the marmoset α-globin were subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry. The reported sequence of marmoset α-globin (27Maita T. Hayashida M. Matsuda G. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) contains amino acid substitutions at four sites compared with the human (T8S, A19S, E23D, and L113H). The experimental masses obtained for the two peaks, 3029.23 and 12126.05 Da, respectively, were in agreement with the calculated masses of the complementary fragments of marmoset α-globin (α1–30, 3028.32 Da; α31–141, 12127.99 Da). The semisynthetic Twin Peaks α-globin was obtained by ligation of human α1–30 and marmoset α31–141 fragments through the V8 protease-catalyzed reaction as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purified material was reconstituted with the βs-chain and heme to obtain the tetramer. HbS Twin Peaks was isolated in pure form CM-52 chromatography. The purity of the protein was further established by FPLC. Under identical chromatographic conditions, HbS Twin Peaks eluted slightly earlier than the native HbS from the Mono Q anion-exchange column (Fig.1). This elution behavior of HbS Twin Peaks is consistent with the replacement of Leu by His at the α113 site in HbS. The purified HbS Twin Peaks was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC to establish the stoichiometry and chemical integrity of the globin chains. The α- and β-chains of HbS Twin Peaks were separated on a C8 column (RP300) using an acetonitrile- trifluoroacetic acid-water solvent system and compared with native HbS. The chromatographic profile showed identical retention times for βs-chains from both samples and indicated correct stoichiometry of the α- and β-chains in HbS Twin Peaks (Fig. 1, inset). Interestingly, the order of elution of chains of HbS Twin Peaks was reversed as compared with natural HbS. The α-chain of HbS Twin Peaks eluted earlier than the βs-chain, suggesting that Leu to His substitution exerted considerable influence on the chromatographic behavior of the α-chain. To rule out the possibility that the above elution behavior was a consequence of chemical modifications during semisynthesis or tetramer assembly, α- and βs-chains of HbS Twin Peaks were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of the isolated α-chain (15150.03 Da) obtained by electrospray mass spectrometry agreed very well with the calculated value of 15150.36 Da for the α-chain of Hb Twin Peaks. Likewise, the experimental mass of the β-chain (15837.99 Da) was in accord with the calculated mass of the βs-chain (15837.25 Da). Taken together, the results unambiguously established the chemical integrity of HbS Twin Peaks. The CD spectrum (Fig. 2) in the soret region for HbS Twin Peaks was similar to that of the HbS, suggesting that interactions of heme with the relevant aromatic residues in the mutant protein are maintained and that the Leu-113→His mutation does not have a deleterious effect on the folding of the heme pocket. UV spectroscopy was employed to further probe the quaternary structural status of HbS Twin Peaks. The ligand-dependent fine spectral changes around 290 nm are considered as diagnostic of the quaternary structure of the Hb molecule (33Briehl R.W. Hobbs J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 544-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Imai K. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Imai K. Tsuneshige A. Harano T. Harano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11174-11180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first derivative UV spectra of oxy (liganded) and deoxy (unliganded) forms of HbS Twin peaks and native HbS were compared to assess the presence of gross quaternary structural changes, if any, in HbS Twin Peaks (Fig.3). Both HbS and HbS Twin Peaks displayed fine structural characteristics with a peak at 289 nm and a double minimum at 285 and 293 nm, respectively. In both Hbs, the magnitude of the double minimum was reduced to about half upon deoxygenation. These results suggest that quaternary structural features of native HbS are preserved in HbS Twin Peaks. The functional aspect of HbS Twin Peaks was assessed by measuring the oxygen affinity at pH 7.4 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at 29 °C using a Hemox Analyzer. P50 of HbS Twin Peaks was found to be 8, against 8.5 for a control sample of native HbS. The Hill coefficient (nmax) value for HbS Twin Peaks (2.4) was comparable with that of native HbS (2.5). Thus the mutant Hb exhibited normal oxygen binding and cooperativity, suggesting that the αLeu-113→His substitution did not cause any significant perturbation of the quaternary structure of the protein. This interpretation is consistent with the above spectroscopic studies of HbS Twin Peaks. The gelation concentration (Csat) of HbS Twin Peaks was measured in the presence of high concentrations of dextran developed by Bookchin et al. (30Bookchin R.M. Balazs T. Wang Z. Josephs R. Lew V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and as described under “Materials and Methods.” We carried out the polymerization of deoxygenated tetramers, HbS Twin peaks and native HbS, under identical conditions and subsequently measured the concentration of the respective hemoglobins in the supernatants to obtain their polymer solubility (Fig. 4). The native HbS yielded aCsat of 29–31 mg/ml in the initial concentration range of 50–80 mg/ml HbS. In contrast, theCsat values for HbS Twin Peaks at the initial concentrations of 70 and 80 mg/ml were 53 and 55 mg/ml, respectively. Thus the polymer solubility of HbS Twin Peaks was considerably higher (about 1.8-fold) as compared with that of HbS. To further confirm that the observed Csat was specific to HbS Twin Peaks, we constructed an HbA counterpart of Twin Peaks. This Hb was assembled from the Twin Peaks α-chain and βA-chain (Glu-6β) through the same procedure as that employed for the assembly of HbS Twin Peaks. Under similar assay conditions, HbA or HbA Twin Peaks did not polymerize when tested at an initial concentration of 70 mg/ml, suggesting that the Csat values of HbS Twin Peaks reflect the true potential of the α113 site to inhibit βs-dependent polymerization of HbS. To further authenticate the participation of the α113 site in the HbS gelation process, kinetics of polymerization of HbS Twin Peaks, HbS, HbA Twin Peaks, and HbA were studied in 1.8 m phosphate buffer (Fig.5). Two concentrations (0.5 and 0.78 mg/ml) of HbS Twin Peaks were tested. HbS Twin Peaks polymerized with a longer delay time as compared with HbS at both concentrations. Th"
