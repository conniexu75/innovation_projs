https://openalex.org/W1994847090,"Levi Garraway and colleagues report exome sequencing of 112 prostate adenocarcinomas and matched normal tissues. They identify novel recurrent mutations in several genes, including MED12, FOXA1 and SPOP. They find that tumors harboring SPOP mutations lack the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion or other ETS rearrangements, supporting the hypothesis that SPOP mutation is an early driver event in prostate tumorigenesis. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and causes over 250,000 deaths each year1. Overtreatment of indolent disease also results in significant morbidity2. Common genetic alterations in prostate cancer include losses of NKX3.1 (8p21)3,4 and PTEN (10q23)5,6, gains of AR (the androgen receptor gene)7,8 and fusion of ETS family transcription factor genes with androgen-responsive promoters9,10,11. Recurrent somatic base-pair substitutions are believed to be less contributory in prostate tumorigenesis12,13 but have not been systematically analyzed in large cohorts. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 112 prostate tumor and normal tissue pairs. New recurrent mutations were identified in multiple genes, including MED12 and FOXA1. SPOP was the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations involving the SPOP substrate-binding cleft in 6–15% of tumors across multiple independent cohorts. Prostate cancers with mutant SPOP lacked ETS family gene rearrangements and showed a distinct pattern of genomic alterations. Thus, SPOP mutations may define a new molecular subtype of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2127744901,"HOTAIR is a long intervening non-coding RNA (lincRNA) that associates with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and overexpression is correlated with poor survival for breast, colon and liver cancer patients. In this study, we show that HOTAIR expression is increased in pancreatic tumors compared with non-tumor tissue and is associated with more aggressive tumors. Knockdown of HOTAIR (siHOTAIR) by RNA interference shows that HOTAIR has an important role in pancreatic cancer cell invasion, as reported in other cancer cell lines. In contrast, HOTAIR knockdown in Panc1 and L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cells that overexpress this lincRNA decreased cell proliferation, altered cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis, demonstrating an expanded function of HOTAIR in pancreatic cancer cells compared with other cancer cell lines. Results of gene array studies showed that there was minimal overlap between HOTAIR-regulated genes in pancreatic cells and breast cancer cells, and HOTAIR uniquely suppressed several interferon-related genes and gene sets related to cell cycle progression in pancreatic cancer cells and tumors. Analysis of selected genes suppressed by HOTAIR in Panc1 and L3.6pL cells showed by knockdown of EZH2 and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that HOTAIR-mediated gene repression was both PRC2-dependent and -independent. HOTAIR knockdown in L3.6pL cells inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft model, further demonstrating the pro-oncogenic function of HOTAIR in pancreatic cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2101096891,"The crosstalk between the transcriptional activity of β-catenin and FOXO3a reveals unexpected pro-metastatic cooperative effects of these pathways through concurrent modulation of cell adhesion and motility programs. In tumors with high FOXO3a and β-catenin activity, the proapoptotic effect of FOXO3a is subverted and the pro-proliferative effect of β-catenin is also dampened, but pro-metastatic pathways are activated. These findings suggest that caution should be exerted when using targeted inhibitors that activate FOXO3a in tumors with high β-catenin activity, as coactivation of both pathways also correlates with more aggressive disease in humans. The Wnt–β-catenin and PI3K-AKT-FOXO3a pathways have a central role in cancer. AKT phosporylates FOXO3a, relocating it from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, an effect that is reversed by PI3K and AKT inhibitors. Simultaneous hyperactivation of the Wnt–β-catenin pathway and inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling promote nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and FOXO3a, respectively, promoting cell scattering and metastasis by regulating a defined set of target genes. Indeed, the anti-tumoral AKT inhibitor API-2 promotes nuclear FOXO3a accumulation and metastasis of cells with high nuclear β-catenin content. Nuclear β-catenin confers resistance to the FOXO3a-mediated apoptosis induced by PI3K and AKT inhibitors in patient-derived primary cultures and in corresponding xenograft tumors in mice. This resistance is reversed by XAV-939, an inhibitor of Wnt–β-catenin signaling. In the presence of high nuclear β-catenin content, activation of FOXO3a by PI3K or AKT inhibitors makes it behave as a metastasis inductor rather than a proapoptotic tumor suppressor. We show that it is possible to evaluate the β-catenin status of patients' carcinomas and the response of patient-derived cells to target-directed drugs that accumulate FOXO3a in the nucleus before deciding on a course of treatment. We propose that this evaluation could be essential to the provision of a safer and more effective personalized treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2116106523,"Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan intestinal parasite, is the causative agent of human amebiasis. Amebiasis is the fourth leading cause of death and the third leading cause of morbidity due to protozoan infections worldwide(1), resulting in ~70,000 deaths annually. E. histolytica has been listed by the National Institutes of Health as a category B priority biodefense pathogen in the United States. Treatment relies on metronidazole(2), which has adverse effects(3), and potential resistance of E. histolytica to the drug is an increasing concern(4,5). To facilitate drug screening for this anaerobic protozoan, we developed and validated an automated, high-throughput screen (HTS). This screen identified auranofin, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used therapeutically for rheumatoid arthritis, as active against E. histolytica in culture. Auranofin was ten times more potent against E. histolytica than metronidazole. Transcriptional profiling and thioredoxin reductase assays suggested that auranofin targets the E. histolytica thioredoxin reductase, preventing the reduction of thioredoxin and enhancing sensitivity of trophozoites to reactive oxygen-mediated killing. In a mouse model of amebic colitis and a hamster model of amebic liver abscess, oral auranofin markedly decreased the number of parasites, the detrimental host inflammatory response and hepatic damage. This new use of auranofin represents a promising therapy for amebiasis, and the drug has been granted orphan-drug status from the FDA."
https://openalex.org/W2044406386,"Metastasis is a major clinical obstacle in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC) and it accounts for the majority of cancer-related mortality. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as regulators of metastasis by acting on multiple signaling pathways. In this study, we found that miR-7 is significantly downregulated in highly metastatic GC cell lines and metastatic tissues. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that increased miR-7 expression significantly reduced GC cell migration and invasion, whereas decreased miR-7 expression dramatically enhanced cell migration and invasion. In vivo metastasis assays also demonstrated that overexpression of miR-7 markedly inhibited GC metastasis. Moreover, the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) oncogene, which is often mutated or amplified in human cancers and functions as an important regulator of cell growth and tumor invasion, was identified as a direct target of miR-7. Silencing of IGF1R using small interefering RNA (siRNA) recapitulated the anti-metastatic function of miR-7, whereas restoring the IGF1R expression attenuated the function of miR-7 in GC cells. Furthermore, we found that suppression of Snail by miR-7, through targeting IGF1R, increased E-cadherin expression and partially reversed the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Finally, analyses of miR-7 and IGF1R levels in human primary GC with matched lymph node metastasis tissue arrays revealed that miR-7 is inversely correlated with IGF1R expression. The present study provides insight into the specific biological behavior of miR-7 in EMT and tumor metastasis. Targeting this novel miR-7/IGF1R/Snail axis would be helpful as a therapeutic approach to block GC metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2026252608,"Most solid tumors are characterized by a metabolic shift from glucose oxidation to glycolysis, in part due to actively suppressed mitochondrial function, a state that favors resistance to apoptosis. Suppressed mitochondrial function may also contribute to the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and angiogenesis. We have previously shown that the inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) dichloroacetate (DCA) activates glucose oxidation and induces apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that DCA will also reverse the ‘pseudohypoxic’ mitochondrial signals that lead to HIF1α activation in cancer, even in the absence of hypoxia and inhibit cancer angiogenesis. We show that inhibition of PDKII inhibits HIF1α in cancer cells using several techniques, including HIF1α luciferase reporter assays. Using pharmacologic and molecular approaches that suppress the prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD)-mediated inhibition of HIF1α, we show that DCA inhibits HIF1α by both a PHD-dependent mechanism (that involves a DCA-induced increase in the production of mitochondria-derived α-ketoglutarate) and a PHD-independent mechanism, involving activation of p53 via mitochondrial-derived H2O2, as well as activation of GSK3β. Effective inhibition of HIF1α is shown by a decrease in the expression of several HIF1α regulated gene products as well as inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro in matrigel assays. More importantly, in rat xenotransplant models of non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, we show effective inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor perfusion in vivo, assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, nuclear imaging techniques and histology. This work suggests that mitochondria-targeting metabolic modulators that increase pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, in addition to the recently described pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects, suppress angiogenesis as well, normalizing the pseudo-hypoxic signals that lead to normoxic HIF1α activation in solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2138624008,"Characterizing genetic diversity within and between populations has broad applications in studies of human disease and evolution. We propose a new approach, spatial ancestry analysis, for the modeling of genotypes in two- or three-dimensional space. In spatial ancestry analysis (SPA), we explicitly model the spatial distribution of each SNP by assigning an allele frequency as a continuous function in geographic space. We show that the explicit modeling of the allele frequency allows individuals to be localized on the map on the basis of their genetic information alone. We apply our SPA method to a European and a worldwide population genetic variation data set and identify SNPs showing large gradients in allele frequency, and we suggest these as candidate regions under selection. These regions include SNPs in the well-characterized LCT region, as well as at loci including FOXP2, OCA2 and LRP1B."
https://openalex.org/W2148400940,"Circadian clocks in adipose tissue are known to regulate adipocyte biology. Although circadian dysregulation is associated with development of obesity, the underlying mechanism has not been established. Here we report that disruption of the clock gene, brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1), in mice led to increased adipogenesis, adipocyte hypertrophy, and obesity, compared to wild-type (WT) mice. This is due to its cell-autonomous effect, as Bmal1 deficiency in embryonic fibroblasts, as well as stable shRNA knockdown (KD) in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells, promoted adipogenic differentiation. We demonstrate that attenuation of Bmal1 function resulted in down-regulation of genes in the canonical Wnt pathway, known to suppress adipogenesis. Promoters of these genes (Wnt10a, β-catenin, Dishevelled2, TCF3) displayed Bmal1 occupancy, indicating direct circadian regulation by Bmal1. As a result, Wnt signaling activity was attenuated by Bmal1 KD and augmented by its overexpression. Furthermore, stabilizing β-catenin through Wnt ligand or GSK-3β inhibition achieved partial restoration of blunted Wnt activity and suppression of increased adipogenesis induced by Bmal1 KD. Taken together, our study demonstrates that Bmal1 is a critical negative regulator of adipocyte development through transcriptional control of components of the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, and provides a mechanistic link between circadian disruption and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2087685591,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been involved in the pathogenesis of different types of cancer; however, their function in pituitary tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase-defective pituitaries occasionally form aggressive growth-hormone (GH)-producing pituitary tumors in the background of hyperplasia caused by haploinsufficiency of the protein kinase’s main regulatory subunit, PRKAR1A. The molecular basis for this development remains unknown. We have identified a 17-miRNA signature of pituitary tumors formed in the background of hyperplasia (caused in half of the cases by PRKAR1A-mutations). We selected two miRNAs on the basis of their functional screen analysis: inhibition of miR-26b expression and upregulation of miR-128 suppressed the colony formation ability and invasiveness of pituitary tumor cells. Furthermore, we identified that miR-26b and miR-128 affected pituitary tumor cell behavior through regulation of their direct targets, PTEN and BMI1, respectively. In addition, we found that miR-128 through BMI1 direct binding on the PTEN promoter affected PTEN expression levels and AKT activity in the pituitary tumor cells. Our in vivo data revealed that inhibition of miR-26b and overexpression of miR-128 could suppress pituitary GH3 tumor growth in xenografts. Taken together, we have identified a miRNA signature for GH-producing pituitary tumors and found that miR-26b and miR-128 regulate the activity of the PTEN–AKT pathway in these tumors. This is the first suggestion of the possible involvement of miRNAs regulating the PTEN–AKT pathway in GH-producing pituitary tumor formation in the context of hyperplasia or due to germline PRKAR1A defects. MiR-26b suppression and miR-128 upregulation could have therapeutic potential in GH-producing pituitary tumor patients."
https://openalex.org/W2153423687,"The Salvador/Warts/Hippo (Hippo) signaling pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell contact inhibition, organ size control, cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and cancer development in mammals. The upstream regulation of this pathway has been less well defined than the core kinase cassette. KIBRA has been shown to function as an upstream member of the Hippo pathway by influencing the phosphorylation of LATS and YAP, but functional consequences of these biochemical changes have not been previously addressed. We show that in MCF10A cells, loss of KIBRA expression displays epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, which are concomitant with decreased LATS and YAP phosphorylation, but not MST1/2. In addition, ectopic KIBRA expression antagonizes YAP via the serine 127 phosphorylation site and we show that KIBRA, Willin and Merlin differentially regulate genes controlled by YAP. Finally, reduced KIBRA expression in primary breast cancer specimens correlates with the recently described claudin-low subtype, an aggressive sub-group with EMT features and a poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035127570,"Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Despite significant advances in prostate cancer diagnosis and management, the molecular events involved in the transformation of normal prostate cells into cancer cells have not been fully understood. It is generally accepted that prostate cancer derives from the basal compartment while expressing luminal markers. We investigated whether downregulation of the basal protein B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) is implicated in prostate cancer transformation and progression. Here we show that BTG2 loss can shift normal prostate basal cells towards luminal markers expression, a phenotype also accompanied by the appearance of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits. We also show that the overexpression of microRNA (miR)-21 suppresses BTG2 levels and promotes the acquisition of luminal markers and EMT in prostate cells. Furthermore, by using an innovative lentiviral vector able to compete with endogenous mRNA through the overexpression of the 3′-untranslated region of BTG2, we demonstrate that in prostate tumor cells, the levels of luminal and EMT markers can be reduced by derepression of BTG2 from microRNA-mediated control. Finally, we show that the loss of BTG2 expression confers to non-tumorigenic prostate cells ability to grow in an orthotopic murine model, thus demonstrating the central role of BTG2 downregulaton in prostate cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W2000692947,"The small GTPase Rac1 is a key regulator of cell motility. Multiple mechanisms regulate Rac1 activity including its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Here, we identify the tumour suppressor HACE1 (HECT domain and Ankyrin repeat Containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for Rac1 degradation following activation by a migration stimulus. We show that HACE1 and Rac1 interaction is enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signalling, a Rac activator and potent stimulus of cell migration. Furthermore, HACE1 catalyses the poly-ubiquitylation of Rac1 at lysine 147 following its activation by HGF, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. This negative feedback mechanism likely restricts cell motility. Consistent with this, HACE1 depletion is accompanied by increased total Rac1 levels and accumulation of Rac1 in membrane ruffles. Moreover, HACE1-depletion enhances cell migration independently of growth factor stimulation, which may have significance for malignant conversion. A non-ubiquitylatable Rac1 rescues the migration defect of Rac1-null cells to a greater extent than wild-type Rac1. These findings identify HACE1 as an antagonist of cell migration through its ability to degrade active Rac1."
https://openalex.org/W2017058268,"Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) share common progenitors with osteoclasts and are critical components of bone-tumor microenvironment; however, their function in prostate tumor growth in the skeleton has not been explored. BMMs are the major source of inflammatory factors and proteases, including cysteine protease cathepsin K (CTSK). In this study, utilizing mice deficient in CTSK, we demonstrate the critical involvement of this potent collagenase in tumor progression in bone. We present the evidence that tumor growth and progression in the bone are impaired in the absence of CTSK. Most importantly, we show for the first time that BMM-supplied CTSK may be involved in CCL2- and COX-2-driven pathways that contribute to tumor progression in bone. Together, our data unravel novel roles for CTSK in macrophage-regulated processes, and provide evidence for close interplay between inflammatory, osteolytic and tumor cell-driven events in the bone-tumor microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2000240522,"The mechanisms responsible for activation of the MtrAB two-component regulatory signal transduction system, which includes sensor kinase MtrB and response regulator MtrA, are unknown. Here, we show that an MtrB-GFP fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, the septa, and the poles in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. This localization was independent of MtrB phosphorylation status but dependent upon the assembly of FtsZ, the initiator of cell division. The M. smegmatis mtrB mutant was filamentous, defective for cell division, and contained lysozyme-sensitive cell walls. The mtrB phenotype was complemented by either production of MtrB protein competent for phosphorylation or overproduction of MtrA(Y102C) and MtrA(D13A) mutant proteins exhibiting altered phosphorylation potential, indicating that either MtrB phosphorylation or MtrB independent expression of MtrA regulon genes, including those involved in cell wall processing, are necessary for regulated cell division. In partial support of this observation, we found that the essential cell wall hydrolase ripA is an MtrA target and that the expression of bona fide MtrA targets ripA, fbpB, and dnaA were compromised in the mtrB mutant and partially rescued upon MtrA(Y102C) and MtrA(D13A) overproduction. MtrB septal assembly was compromised upon FtsZ depletion and exposure of cells to mitomycin C, a DNA damaging agent, which interferes with FtsZ ring assembly. Expression of MtrA targets was also compromised under the above conditions, indicating that MtrB septal localization and MtrA regulon expression are linked. We propose that MtrB septal association is a necessary feature of MtrB activation that promotes MtrA phosphorylation and MtrA regulon expression."
https://openalex.org/W1975071693,"The tubular epithelium of the kidney is susceptible to injury from a number of different causes, including inflammatory and immune disorders, oxidative stress, and nephrotoxins, among others. Primary renal epithelial cells remain one of the few tools for studying the biochemical and physiological characteristics of the renal tubular system. Nevertheless, differentiated primary cells are not suitable for recapitulation of disease properties that might arise during embryonic kidney formation and further maturation. Thus, cellular systems resembling kidney characteristics are in urgent need to model disease as well as to establish reliable drug-testing platforms. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) bear the capacity to differentiate into every cell lineage comprising the adult organism. Thus, iPSCs bring the possibility for recapitulating embryonic development by directed differentiation into specific lineages. iPSC differentiation ultimately allows for both disease modeling in vitro and the production of cellular products with potential for regenerative medicine. Here, we describe the rapid, reproducible, and highly efficient generation of iPSCs derived from endogenous kidney tubular renal epithelial cells with only two transcriptional factors, OCT4 and SOX2. Kidney-derived iPSCs may provide a reliable cellular platform for the development of kidney differentiation protocols allowing drug discovery studies and the study of kidney pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2013613444,"Azemiopsin, a novel polypeptide, was isolated from the Azemiops feae viper venom by combination of gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. Its amino acid sequence (DNWWPKPPHQGPRPPRPRPKP) was determined by means of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. It consists of 21 residues and, unlike similar venom isolates, does not contain cysteine residues. According to circular dichroism measurements, this peptide adopts a β-structure. Peptide synthesis was used to verify the determined sequence and to prepare peptide in sufficient amounts to study its biological activity. Azemiopsin efficiently competed with α-bungarotoxin for binding to Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) (IC(50) 0.18 ± 0.03 μm) and with lower efficiency to human α7 nAChR (IC(50) 22 ± 2 μm). It dose-dependently blocked acetylcholine-induced currents in Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing human muscle-type nAChR and was more potent against the adult form (α1β1εδ) than the fetal form (α1β1γδ), EC(50) being 0.44 ± 0.1 μm and 1.56 ± 0.37 μm, respectively. The peptide had no effect on GABA(A) (α1β3γ2 or α2β3γ2) receptors at a concentration up to 100 μm or on 5-HT(3) receptors at a concentration up to 10 μm. Ala scanning showed that amino acid residues at positions 3-6, 8-11, and 13-14 are essential for binding to Torpedo nAChR. In biological activity azemiopsin resembles waglerin, a disulfide-containing peptide from the Tropidechis wagleri venom, shares with it a homologous C-terminal hexapeptide, but is the first natural toxin that blocks nAChRs and does not possess disulfide bridges."
https://openalex.org/W2097133388,"Contraction stimulates Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in skeletal muscle. Whether AMPK activation affects Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in skeletal muscle remains to be determined. Short term stimulation of rat L6 myotubes with the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), activates AMPK and promotes translocation of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase α(1)-subunit to the plasma membrane and increases Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity as assessed by ouabain-sensitive (86)Rb(+) uptake. Cyanide-induced artificial anoxia, as well as a direct AMPK activator (A-769662) also increase AMPK phosphorylation and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. Thus, different stimuli that target AMPK concomitantly increase Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. The effect of AICAR on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase in L6 myotubes was attenuated by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, as well as siRNA-mediated AMPK silencing. The effects of AICAR on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase were completely abolished in cultured primary mouse muscle cells lacking AMPK α-subunits. AMPK stimulation leads to Na(+),K(+)-ATPase α(1)-subunit dephosphorylation at Ser(18), which may prevent endocytosis of the sodium pump. AICAR stimulation leads to methylation and dephosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase (PP) 2A in L6 myotubes. Moreover, AICAR-triggered dephosphorylation of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase was prevented in L6 myotubes deficient in PP2A-specific protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), indicating a role for the PP2A·PME-1 complex in AMPK-mediated regulation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. Thus contrary to the common paradigm, we report AMPK-dependent activation of an energy-consuming ion pumping process. This activation may be a potential mechanism by which exercise and metabolic stress activate the sodium pump in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2152056749,"Blood vessels are formed during development and tissue repair through a plethora of modifiers that coordinate efficient vessel assembly in various cellular settings. Here we used the yeast 2-hybrid approach and demonstrated a broad affinity of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) to C-terminal cystine knot motifs present in key angiogenic regulators Slit3, von Willebrand factor, platelet-derived growth factor-B, and VEGF-A. Biochemical characterization and histological analysis showed close association of CCN2/CTGF with these regulators in murine angiogenesis models: normal retinal development, oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), and Lewis lung carcinomas. CCN2/CTGF and Slit3 proteins worked in concert to promote in vitro angiogenesis and downstream Cdc42 activation. A fragment corresponding to the first three modules of CCN2/CTGF retained this broad binding ability and gained a dominant-negative function. Intravitreal injection of this mutant caused a significant reduction in vascular obliteration and retinal neovascularization vs. saline injection in the OIR model. Knocking down CCN2/CTGF expression by short-hairpin RNA or ectopic expression of this mutant greatly decreased tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. These results provided mechanistic insight into the angiogenic action of CCN2/CTGF and demonstrated the therapeutic potential of dominant-negative CCN2/CTGF mutants for antiangiogenesis.—Pi, L., Shenoy, A.

https://openalex.org/W2048205527,"α-Conotoxins Vc1.1 and RgIA are small peptides isolated from the venom of marine cone snails. They have effective anti-nociceptive actions in rat models of neuropathic pain. Pharmacological studies in rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) show their analgesic effect is mediated by inhibition of N-type (Ca(v)2.2) calcium channels via a pathway involving γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor. However, there is no direct demonstration that functional GABA(B) receptors are needed for inhibition of the Ca(v)2.2 channel by analgesic α-conotoxins. This study examined the effect of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen and α-conotoxins Vc1.1 and RgIA on calcium channel currents after transient knockdown of the GABA(B) receptor using RNA interference. Isolated rat DRG neurons were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting GABA(B) subunits R1 and R2. Efficient knockdown of GABA(B) receptor expression at mRNA and protein levels was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunocytochemical analysis, respectively. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings conducted 2-4 days after transfection showed that inhibition of N-type calcium channels in response to baclofen, Vc1.1 and RgIA was significantly reduced in GABA(B) receptor knockdown DRG neurons. In contrast, neurons transfected with a scrambled nontargeting siRNA were indistinguishable from untransfected neurons. In the HEK 293 cell heterologous expression system, Vc1.1 and RgIA inhibition of Ca(v)2.2 channels needed functional expression of both human GABA(B) receptor subunits. Together, these results confirm that GABA(B) receptors must be activated for the modulation of N-type (Ca(v)2.2) calcium channels by analgesic α-conotoxins Vc1.1 and RgIA."
https://openalex.org/W2058851219,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating disease with high mortality and poor prognosis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have recently been defined as a fraction of tumor cells highly resistant to therapy and subsequently considered to be responsible for tumor recurrence. These cells have been characterized in GBM and suggested to reside in and be supported by the tumor microvascular niche. Here we evaluated the response of tumor microvascular endothelial cells (tMVECs) to radio- and chemotherapy, and analyzed how this affects their interaction with CSCs. Our data demonstrate that tMVECs exhibit extreme resistance to both therapies, with the main response to irradiation being senescence. Importantly, senescent tMVECs can be detected in human GBM samples as well as in mice upon irradiation. Even though permanently arrested, they are still viable and able to support CSC growth with the same efficacy as non-senescent tMVECs. Intriguingly, GBM CSCs themselves are capable of differentiating into cells with similar features as tMVECs that subsequently undergo senescence when exposed to radiation. This indicates that endothelial-like cells are therapy resistant and, more importantly, support expansion of GBM cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998662277,"Multiple neurodegenerative disorders are linked to aberrant phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is the major MAP phosphatase; however, little is known about its regulation at microtubules. α4 binds the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and the microtubule-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase MID1, and through unknown mechanisms can both reduce and enhance PP2Ac stability. We show MID1-dependent monoubiquitination of α4 triggers calpain-mediated cleavage and switches α4's activity from protective to destructive, resulting in increased Tau phosphorylation. This regulatory mechanism appears important in MAP-dependent pathologies as levels of cleaved α4 are decreased in Opitz syndrome and increased in Alzheimer disease, disorders characterized by MAP hypophosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation, respectively. These findings indicate that regulated inter-domain cleavage controls the dual functions of α4, and dysregulation of α4 cleavage may contribute to Opitz syndrome and Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W1964238639,"Insulin resistance is a prominent feature in heart failure, while hyperglycemia impairs cardiac contraction. We propose that decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake by the heart preserves cardiac function in response to metabolic and hemodynamic stress. To test this hypothesis, we fed rats a high-sucrose diet (HSD). Energy substrate metabolism and cardiac work were determined ex vivo in a sequential protocol simulating metabolic and hemodynamic stress. Compared to chow-fed, control rats, HSD impaired myocardial insulin responsiveness and induced profound metabolic changes in the heart, characterized by reduced rates of glucose uptake (7.91 ±0.30 vs. 10.73±0.67 μmol/min/g dry weight; P<0.001) but increased rates of glucose oxidation (2.38±0.17 vs. 1.50±0.15 μmol/min/g dry weight; P<0.001) and oleate oxidation (2.29±0.11 vs. 1.96±0.12 μmol/ min/g dry weight; P<0.05). Tight coupling of glucose uptake and oxidation and improved cardiac efficiency were associated with a reduction in glucose 6-phosphate and oleoyl-CoA levels, as well as a reduction in the content of uncoupling protein 3. Our results suggest that insulin resistance lessens fuel toxicity in the stressed heart.

Melittin stimulated the proteolysis of ADAM10 and ADAM17 substrates in human neutrophil granulocytes, endothelial cells and murine fibroblasts. In human HaCaT keratinocytes, melittin induced shedding of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin and release of TGF-α, which was accompanied by transactivation of the EGF receptor and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. This was followed by functional consequences such as increased keratinocyte proliferation and enhanced cell migration. Evidence is provided that ATP release and activation of purinergic P2 receptors are involved in melittin-induced ADAM activation. E-cadherin shedding and EGFR phosphorylation were dose-dependently reduced in the presence of ATPases or P2 receptor antagonists. The involvement of P2 receptors was underscored in experiments with HEK cells, which lack the P2X7 receptor and showed strikingly increased response to melittin stimulation after transfection with this receptor. Our study provides new insight into the mechanism of melittin function which should be of interest particularly in the context of its potential use as an anti-inflammatory or anti-cancer agent.Background: Melittin is an antimicrobial peptide that is also being considered as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent.Results: Melittin provokes P2 receptor activation, which leads to ADAM-dependent transactivation of the EGFR and augments keratinocyte proliferation and migration.Conclusion: Melittin modulates cellular functions through activation of ADAM-mediated shedding.Significance: The use of melittin may elicit unexpected and unwanted effects via ADAM activation. Melittin, the major component of the bee venom, is an amphipathic, cationic peptide with a wide spectrum of biological properties that is being considered as an anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent. It modulates multiple cellular functions but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood.

Bee venom produced by the honey bee (Apis mellifera) contains a large number of bioactive peptides including melittin, apamin, adolapin, and mast cell-degranulating peptide. Melittin is the most abundant component, constituting 50% of whole bee venom (1Raghuraman H. Chattopadhyay A. Melittin: a membrane-active peptide with diverse functions.Biosci. Rep. 2007; 27: 189-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This amphipathic peptide of 26 residues contains a hydrophobic stretch of 19 amino acids followed by a cluster of 4 positively charged residues at the C terminus. Melittin is able to intercalate into cell membranes, causing changes in biophysical membrane properties (2Sessa G. Freer J.H. Colacicco G. Weissmann G.

Antimicrobial peptides and peptaibols, substitutes for conventional antibiotics.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2010; 16: 3212-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several cancer cells including renal, lung, breast, and bladder cells can be selectively destroyed by melittin in vitro (8Son D.J. Lee J.W. Lee Y.H. Song H.S. Lee C.K. Hong J.T. Therapeutic application of anti-arthritis, pain-releasing, and anti-cancer effects of bee venom and its constituent compounds.Pharmacol.

Its potential use as an agent to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer has been tested in animal models, with positive outcome (9Liu S. Yu M. He Y. Xiao L. Wang F.

Moreover, melittin has been described to exert anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatoid, anti-arthritic, and pain-relieving effects (8Son D.J. Lee J.W. Lee Y.H. Song H.S. Lee C.K. Hong J.T. Therapeutic application of anti-arthritis, pain-releasing, and anti-cancer effects of bee venom and its constituent compounds.Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 115: 246-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), but the mode of action is still largely unknown (12Stuhlmeier K.M. Apis mellifera venom and melittin block neither NF-κB-p50-DNA interactions nor the activation of NF-κB, instead they activate the transcription of proinflammatory genes and the release of reactive oxygen intermediates.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Besides biophysical membrane interaction, melittin might directly influence cellular function by activating downstream signaling. It is discussed as a potent activator of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) thereby also promoting arachidonic acid synthesis (13Vernon L.P. Bell J.D. Membrane structure, toxins and phospholipase A2 activity.Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PLA2-dependent cytotoxic effects and activation of caspase-3 are reported to contribute to anti-cancer cytotoxicity (14Moon D.O. Park S.Y. Heo M.S. Kim K.C. Park C. Ko W.S. Choi Y.H. Kim G.Y. Key regulators in bee venom-induced apoptosis are Bcl-2 and caspase-3 in human leukemic U937 cells through downregulation of ERK and Akt.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2006; 6: 1796-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Melittin has also been suggested to reduce inflammatory responses by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of NF-κB (15Park H.J. Son D.J. Lee C.W. Choi M.S. Lee U.S. Song H.S. Lee J.M. Hong J.T. Melittin inhibits inflammatory target gene expression and mediator generation via interaction with IκB kinase.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but this concept remains controversial (12Stuhlmeier K.M. Apis mellifera venom and melittin block neither NF-κB-p50-DNA interactions nor the activation of NF-κB, instead they activate the transcription of proinflammatory genes and the release of reactive oxygen intermediates.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Metalloproteases play important roles in inflammatory diseases and cancer progression. It has been proposed that melittin could contribute to anti-rheumatoid effects by inhibiting matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-3 production (16Nah S.S. Ha E. Mun S.H. Won H.J. Chung J.H. Effects of melittin on the production of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -3 in rheumatoid arthritic fibroblast-like synoviocytes.J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 106: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In another study, MMP-9 expression in MCF-7 cells was abolished by melittin treatment (17Cho H.J. Jeong Y.J. Park K.K. Park Y.Y. Chung I.K. Lee K.G. Yeo J.H. Han S.M. Bae Y.S. Chang Y.C. Bee venom suppresses PMA-mediated MMP-9 gene activation via JNK/p38 and NF-κB-dependent mechanisms.J. Ethnopharmacol. 2010; 127: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Besides MMPs, disintegrin like metalloproteases (ADAMs) play important roles in health and disease (18Saftig P. Reiss K. The “A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases” ADAM10 and ADAM17: novel drug targets with therapeutic potential?.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). They control diverse cellular functions through the release of transmembrane molecules from the cell surface (19Reiss K. Saftig P. The “a disintegrin and metalloprotease” (ADAM) family of sheddases: physiological and cellular functions.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). ADAM10 and ADAM17 are the best characterized members of this family. ADAM10 is critically involved in Notch receptor signaling and ADAM17 activity is essential for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Deletion of both genes leads to embryonic death in knock-out mouse models (20Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P. The disintegrin/metalloprotease ADAM 10 is essential for Notch signaling but not for α-secretase activity in fibroblasts.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. An essential role for ectodomain shedding in mammalian development.Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Several substrates have been identified for both proteases. ADAM10 is the major protease involved in the cleavage of cell adhesion molecules such as neuronal (N)-cadherin (22Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. ADAM10 cleavage of N-cadherin and regulation of cell-cell adhesion and β-catenin nuclear signaling.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), epithelial (E)-cadherin (23Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. ADAM10 mediates E-cadherin shedding and regulates epithelial cell-cell adhesion, migration, and β-catenin translocation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), or vascular-endothelial (VE)-cadherin (24Schulz B. Pruessmeyer J. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Blobel C.P. Saftig P. Reiss K. ADAM10 regulates endothelial permeability and T-cell transmigration by proteolysis of vascular endothelial cadherin.Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1192-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but also releases the EGFR ligands betacellulin and EGF (25Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. Distinct roles for ADAM10 and ADAM17 in ectodomain shedding of six EGFR ligands.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). ADAM17, also known as TACE (TNF-α converting enzyme), was identified as the enzyme releasing soluble TNF-α from its transmembrane precursor form. Because of the release of this pro-inflammatory cytokine and other cell surface molecules that modulate inflammation, ADAM17 is being discussed as a potential drug target for several inflammatory pathologies. Up to now a large number of ADAM17 substrates have been identified. Inter alia, the protease controls the function of cell adhesion molecules such as L-selectin on neutrophil granulocytes (21Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. An essential role for ectodomain shedding in mammalian development.Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) and the release of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin, epiregulin, TGF-α, or heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) (26Sahin U. Blobel C.P. Ectodomain shedding of the EGF-receptor ligand epigen is mediated by ADAM17.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ADAM10 as well as ADAM17 appear to promote cancer progression by EGFR activation and release of cell adhesion molecules (18Saftig P. Reiss K. The “A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases” ADAM10 and ADAM17: novel drug targets with therapeutic potential?.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that biophysical alterations of cell membrane properties modulate ADAM10 and ADAM17-mediated substrate cleavage (27Reiss K. Cornelsen I. Husmann M. Gimpl G. Bhakdi S. Unsaturated fatty acids drive disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)-dependent cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration by modulating membrane fluidity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26931-26942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Application of free unsaturated fatty acids induced ADAM-mediated shedding by increasing cell membrane fluidity and augmenting the mobility of enzyme and substrate in the membrane. From these findings, the suspicion arose that other membrane active agents such as melittin might also augment the function of ADAMs. In this communication, we report that melittin indeed provokes rapid substrate cleavage by ADAMs in diverse cell types. We found, however, that the increase in ADAM-mediated shedding was not due to changes in membrane fluidity. Instead, evidence is presented that exposure of cells to sublethal concentrations of melittin results in P2 receptor activation. This in turn is responsible for augmentation of ADAM activity and downstream EGFR transactivation in HaCaT keratinocytes. Melittin was synthesized with an amidated C terminus by the Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis technique on an automatic peptide synthesizer (model 433 A; Applied Biosystems) as described (28Andrä J. Koch M.H. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Biophysical characterization of endotoxin inactivation by NK-2, an antimicrobial peptide derived from mammalian NK-lysin.Antimicrob.

Monoclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (C36) and N-cadherin were purchased from BD Bioscience. ADAM10 was detected using a polyclonal antiserum described previously (20Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K.

Monoclonal antibody against VE-cadherin and peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulins to mouse or rabbit IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The EGFR-function blocking antibody Cetuximab (C225) was from Merck. CD62L antibodies were from eBioscience. Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′,-disulfonic acid (PPADS), suramin, hexokinase, apyrase, BAPTA-AM (1,2- bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, sodium), EGTA, TAPI-0, and MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium-bromide) were obtained from Sigma.

Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines from ADAM10−/− mice and respective wild-type animals were generated and characterized as described elsewhere (20Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P.

MEFs, HaCaT keratinocytes and HEK-293T cells (ATCC) were grown in high glucose DMEM (PAA, Linz, Austria) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HEK cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected on the next day with 1 μg/well plasmid DNA encoding for P2X7. Transfection was performed using TurboFectTM in vitro Transfection Reagent (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown for 48 h prior to stimulation and protein extraction for Western blot analysis. Metabolic activity was determined in 96-well plates in triplicates by quantifying the reduction of MTT to formazan. Briefly, cells were incubated with the indicated amounts of melittin in 100 μl serum-free medium for 30 min. Untreated and 2.5% Triton-X treated cells served as controls. Afterward medium was replaced by 100 μl of 0.5 mg/ml MTT in 10% standard cell culture medium and 90% PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Formed formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 μl of 10% Triton-X in isopropanol. Extinction was measured at 590 nm and absorbance values were normalized to untreated and Triton-X treated controls. CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) was used to determine the release of soluble ATP. The assay was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. HaCaT keratinocytes (1 ml, 5 × 108 cells) were incubated for 30 min at 32 °C with diphenyl hexatriene (DPH, 4 μm). To remove unbound DPH, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g, were washed twice with PBS and were resuspended in 10 ml PBS. The cells were then transferred to a thermostated cuvette under continuous stirring. Anisotropy was measured in a Quantamaster (PTI, Canada) fluorimeter using Glan-Thompson polarizers at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 ± 4 nm and 430 ± 4 nm, respectively, including a GG390 cut-off filter at the emission site. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r) was determined according to r = (IVV-IVHG)/(IVV+2 IVHG), where IVV and IVH are the fluorescence intensities observed with the excitation polarizer in the vertical position, and the analyzing emission polarizer in both the vertical (IVV) and horizontal (IVH) configuration. Factor G corrects for the unequal transmission of differently polarized light. Peptide-mediated calcium influx in HaCaT keratinocytes was monitored over time by fluorescence spectroscopy using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Indo-1. The assay and all washing steps were performed either in PBS, pH 7.4 containing 1% FCS (buffer A) or in the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (buffer B). Cells were washed in buffer A or B and adjusted to 106 cells/ml, preloaded with 1 μm Indo-1-AM (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C, washed again, and adjusted to 105 cells/ml in the respective buffer. The assay was performed at room temperature in 2 ml glass cuvettes using a spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog-3, Horiba) with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm as well as emission wavelengths of 405 and 485 nm to detect the Ca2+-bound and the Ca2+-free form of the dye. Fluorescence of the cell suspension was monitored for 1 min before the addition of peptide without any measurable change in fluorescence. Then, melittin was added in indicated concentrations and the fluorescence was monitored for additional 4 min. Data are represented as the quotient (F405/F485) of the normalized emission intensities (Ft/F0) of the two wavelengths, i.e. the fluorescence intensity at a certain time point (Ft) divided by the mean fluorescence intensity before addition of peptide (F0). At least two independent experiments were performed and one representative experiment is shown. PMN were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood of healthy donors using Biocoll Separating Solution (Biochrom AG) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Residual erythrocytes were removed using lysis buffer containing NH4Cl. PMN purity was >90% as determined by flow cytometric analysis and by counting in a hemocytometer. Stock suspensions of the cells (20–30 × 106 per ml) were kept in PBS on ice and used within 2 h. Experiments were conducted in HBSS using 3 × 106 cells/ml. Immunoblots for the analysis of VE-cadherin, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin were performed as described elsewhere (22Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P.

Signals were recorded by a luminescent image analyzer (Fuji image reader LAS1000) and analyzed with image analyzer software (GEL-PROANALYSER, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). To generate the control blots for expression of ERK1/2 and EGFR, Western blots were incubated in stripping reagent (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.7) at 55 °C for 30 min and then re-probed with anti ERK1/2 or EGFR antibody, respectively. HaCaT keratinocytes were seeded in 12-well plates (Sarstedt) and grown until they reached confluence (48 h). A cell-free area was introduced by scraping the monolayer with a pipette tip (10 μl, Sarstedt). To avoid a proliferative effect, cells were treated with 2 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. For stimulation experiments, FCS-free medium containing metalloprotease inhibitors or DMSO was added. After 15 min pre-incubation, the cells were treated with melittin (0.5 μm). Cells were photographed before stimulation and 24 h after stimulation by using an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Zeiss). The cell free area was quantified using AxioVision (Zeiss) before and after stimulation, respectively. HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured overnight in medium containing FCS before starvation for 48 h.

The PI3K-Akt pathway promotes cell metabolism, survival, and proliferation (9Luo J. Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Targeting the PI3K-Akt pathway in human cancer. Rationale and promise.Cancer cell. 2003; 4: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). One of the downstream effectors of the pathway, the mTOR-Raptor kinase complex, is the master regulator of cellular metabolism (10Kim D.H. Sabatini D.M. Raptor and mTOR. Subunits of a nutrient-sensitive complex.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 259-270PubMed Google Scholar). As such, genetic mutation of PTEN and other components of this pathway have significant impact on pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases. The PI3K-Akt pathway has also been implicated in infectious diseases and innate immunity. Mounting evidence supports the involvement of Akt in phagocytosis, intracellular bacterial infections, LPS tolerance, production of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, and migration during macrophage-mediated innate immunity, thus establishing a pivotal role for this enzyme in the functional activation of macrophages (11Lee Y.G. Lee J. Byeon S.E. Yoo D.S. Kim M.H. Lee S.Y. Cho J.Y. Functional role of Akt in macrophage-mediated innate immunity.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was found that intracellular survival and growth of certain phagocytosed bacteria in macrophages are controlled by a kinase network, of which Akt acts as a master regulator by controlling multiple host pathways (12Kuijl C. Savage N.D. Marsman M. Tuin A.W. Janssen L. Egan D.A. Ketema M. van den Nieuwendijk R. van den Eeden S.J. Geluk A. Poot A. van der Marel G. Beijersbergen R.L. Overkleeft H. Ottenhoff T.H. Neefjes J. Intracellular bacterial growth is controlled by a kinase network around PKB/AKT1.Nature. 2007; 450: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because the Akt pathway plays a role in both cancer development and interactions of pathogens with host cells, it is possible that these two events influence each other, especially during attempts to treat cancer with infectious biotherapies. One successful use of a bacterial pathogen to treat cancer is the use of an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, BCG, 2The abbreviations used are: BCGBacillus Calmette-GuérinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblasts. to treat superficial bladder cancer. Despite more than 30 years of clinical experience with intravesical BCG for bladder cancer, no markers exist to predict which patients will respond to therapy. This is due in part to the fact that its mechanism of action is not well understood. Direct and indirect immune mechanisms have been hypothesized to play a role (13Loskog A. Ninalga C. Paul-Wetterberg G. de la Torre M. Malmström P.U. Tötterman T.H. Human bladder carcinoma is dominated by T-regulatory cells and Th1 inhibitory cytokines.J.

Whatever the mechanism of action, it does seem clear that BCG interaction with tumor cells, leading to internalization and processing of the mycobacterium, plays a crucial role in activation of BCG-mediated anti-tumor activity (16Hudson M.A. Ritchey J.K.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In this study we demonstrate that the activity of the PI3K-PTEN-Akt pathway determines the susceptibility of cells to infection by mycobacteria, including BCG, suggesting that tumor cell genetic characteristics may be important determinants of the BCG-tumor cell interaction. Antibodies against S6 (5G10, #2217), S6K (49D7, #2708), p-S6K (Thr389) (108D2, #9234), Akt (#9272), p-Akt (Ser473) (#9271), and p-Akt (Thr308) (#2965) were from Cell Signaling Technology. PTEN antibody (clone 6H2.1) was from Cascade BioScience. Antibodies against PCAF (E-8), actin (C-2), and GFP (B-2) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Tubulin antibody (DM1A) was from Calbiochem. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with DAPI at 1 μg/ml. On adding DAPI to tissue culture cells, it is rapidly taken up into cellular DNA yielding highly fluorescent nuclei and no detectable cytoplasmic fluorescence. If the cells are contaminated with Mycoplasma, characteristic discrete fluorescent foci are readily detected over the cytoplasm and sometimes in intercellular spaces. Infection by mycoplasmas was further confirmed by detecting the presence of conserved mycoplasmal enzymes with a MycoAlertTM kit (Lonzabioscience). A detailed analysis from the institutional facility indicates that the source of Mycoplasma that used in our experiments is a mixture mainly containing the following two species, Mycoplasma orale and Mycoplasma fermentans. M. orale was detected by PCR with primers of 5′-ACACCATGGGAGCTGGTAAT-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTCGACTTTCAGACCCAAGGCAT-3′, which gives a product of 423 bp in size. GAPDH was used as internal control with primers of 5′-ATTTGGCCGTATTGGGCGCCTG-3′ and 5′-CCCGGCCTTCTCCATGGTGG-3′ producing a 298-bp band. PC3, HeLa, MCF-7, UM-UC-3, and MGHU4 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured according to ATCC instructions. All cell lines were tested for their authenticity by cytogenetic analysis. Mouse epithelial fibroblasts (MEFs) of both pten+/+ and pten−/− were kindly provided by Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi and cultured and tested as previously described (2Di Cristofano A. Pesce B. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Pten is essential for embryonic development and tumor suppression.Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Cell culture transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen. The shRNA constructs against human PTEN generated using pLKO.1 vector were bought from Sigma. The PTEN DNA sequences used in the RNAi construct were 5′-AGGCGCTATGTGTATTATTAT-3′, 5′-CCACAGCTAGAACTTATCAAA-3′, 5′-CTAGAACTTATCAAACCCTTT-3′, 5′-CGTGCAGATAATGACAAGGAA-3′, and 5′-CCACAAATGAAGGGATATAAA-3′. Stable cell lines were established by infection of cells with pLKO.1 lentivirus. Puromycin selection at 0.6 μg/ml was carried out 24 h after removal of virus. GFP-expressing BCG was created by transforming M. bovis Calmette-Guérin Pasteur strain with pYUB921 (expresses GFP and kanamycin resistance) (20Teitelbaum R. Cammer M. Maitland M.L. Freitag N.E. Condeelis J. Bloom B.R. Mycobacterial infection of macrophages results in membrane-permeable phagosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 15190-15195Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). BCG-GFP was grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 media supplemented with 10% albumin, dextrose, saline, 0.5% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80 and in the presence of 20 mg/ml kanamycin. To create a stock for infection, BCG-GFP was grown to mid-log phase (A600 0.4–0.6), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween 80, resuspended in PBS with 25% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. To measure final bacterial concentration, an aliquot was thawed, and serial dilutions were plated on 7H10 plates in the presence of 20 microgram/ml kanamycin. Cells were plated a day before infection in antibiotic-free media so as to reach 90% confluence on the day of infection. BCG-GFP was thawed and diluted in antibiotic-free media to achieve a multiplicity of infection of 10:1. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for the specified time period and then washed 3 times with PBS and 3 times with antibiotic-containing media (100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were further incubated for indicated time before being imaged or detached using trypsin and resuspended in PBS for analysis by flow-cytometry. All inhibitors were used at concentrations reported to inhibit their kinase target. Wortmannin and rapamycin (Sigma) were used at a concentration of 100 nm to inhibit PI3K and mTOR, respectively. Akt was inhibited with Akti-1 (Calbiochem) at 10 μm or Akti-2 (Merck) at 2 μm. Inhibitors were added after infection and removal of extracellular BCG. To test if PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in BCG entry, cells were also pretreated with inhibitors 2 h before infection. To detect mitochondria, cells grown on glass coverslips in culture medium were first treated with 500 nm of MitoTracker Red CMXRos for 45 min before being fixed, permeabilized, and stained with DAPI. Polyribosome was stained with an antibody against S6 ribosomal protein. Samples were acquired on an LSR II flow cytometric device (BD Biosciences) using the FACS DiVa software (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data analysis was performed with the FlowJo software package (Tree Star). Cells were fixed in methanol for 2 min at −20 °C, rinsed in PBS and incubated in either DNase I (100 μg/ml in PBS and 5 mm MgCl2, RNase-free) or RNase A (100 μg/ml in PBS, DNase-free) for 2 h at 25 °C. After several washes in PBS, cells were stained with DAPI as described above. This work originated from a serendipitous observation in the course of our investigation of the PTEN pathway. With fluorescent microscopy, we observed that MEFs deficient in PTEN had unusually high levels of DAPI-stained structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). These cytosolic DAPI-positive particles did not co-localize with mitochondrial or ribosomal stains, indicating that they are not clusters of mitochondria or polyribosomes, the two major cytosolic nucleic acid-containing structures (Fig. 1, B and C). The DAPI stained structures are sensitive to DNase but not RNase digestion, indicating that the DAPI signal is from cytosolic DNA (Fig. 1D). We subsequently found that these cytosolic DAPI-positive structures were infected Mycoplasma (the laboratory had just suffered a Mycoplasma infection then). The tight correlation of the Mycoplasma with the PTEN status of cells prompted us to further investigate the potential relationship between PTEN function and Mycoplasma infection. First, we infected a battery of cell lines with culture medium containing Mycoplasma. These cell lines include wild-type MEFs and HeLa cells (both PTEN-positive) as well as PTEN-null MEFs and human prostate cancer cells PC3 (both PTEN-negative). Indeed, compared with PTEN-positive cells, PTEN-negative cells were hypersusceptible to infection with Mycoplasma (Fig. 2A). Second, in a time-course experiment, we subjected both wild-type MEFs and PTEN-null MEFs to Mycoplasma infection and monitored intracellular Mycoplasma using DAPI-staining at different time points. PTEN-null MEFs showed detectable intracellular Mycoplasma after 8 h, whereas wild-type MEFs showed similar levels of infection only after more than 24 h (Fig. 2B). This was confirmed by PCR with primers specific to M. orale (Fig. 2C). To further validate that PTEN status influences susceptibility to Mycoplasma infection, we knocked down PTEN by shRNA in HeLa cells and measured Mycoplasma infection (Fig. 2, D and E). As expected, HeLa cells with PTEN knockdown showed hypersusceptibility to Mycoplasma infection compared with cells that had received a LacZ shRNA control. Taken together, these results indicate that defective PTEN function results in higher susceptibility of host cells to Mycoplasma infection. Next, we tested whether overexpression of PTEN can reduce intracellular Mycoplasma levels and whether the enzymatic activity of PTEN is required. Mycoplasma-infected PTEN-deficient PC3 cells were transfected with either GFP-tagged wild-type PTEN or lipid phosphatase inactive mutants (C124S or G129E mutant). As expected, in the PTEN-negative PC3 cells, Akt is constitutively activated, shown by high levels of phosphorylation at serine 473 (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of wild-type PTEN, but not C124S or G129E PTEN, suppressed Akt activation (Fig. 3A). Importantly, we found that restoration of PTEN expression eliminated intracellular Mycoplasma and that this role was dependent on PTEN lipid phosphatase activity, as both the C124S and G129E mutants failed to do so (Fig. 3B). Recent evidence suggests that PTEN can also regulate various cellular processes with its protein phosphatase activity, although it is not clear what its physiological protein substrates are (3Tamura M.

PTEN induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest through phosphoinositol-3-kinase/Akt-dependent and -independent pathways.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because the G129E mutant is still functional as a protein phosphatase (3Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Inhibition of cell migration, spreading, and focal adhesions by tumor suppressor PTEN.Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), failure of the G129E mutant to suppress intracellular Mycoplasma indicates that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is not sufficient for this function. Mycoplasmas are cell wall deficient bacteria that can exist either extracellularly or within the cytoplasm of host cells (24Razin S. Yogev D. Naot Y. Molecular biology and pathogenicity of mycoplasmas.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1094-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to understand whether PTEN deficiency confers susceptibility to other intracellular bacterial pathogens. For this purpose, we used M. bovis BCG, an attenuated strain of M. bovis that was derived by prolonged in vitro passage. Pathogenic mycobacteria are intracellular pathogens that replicate and survive within host cells, usually professional phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells. We first infected MCF-7 mammary epithelial cancer cells with BCG carrying an episomal plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). This fluorescent marker allowed easy quantitation of intracellular BCG by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. We found that shRNA knockdown of PTEN (Fig. 4A) enhanced BCG infection in MCF-7 cells, as reflected by the number and intensity of GFP foci inside MCF-7 cells determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (Fig. 4, B and C). PTEN is a predominant negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway. To test whether the effect of PTEN knockdown on intracellular growth is mediated by activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, we examined the effect of mycobacterial infection on host cell Akt activation in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, both BCG and Mycoplasma activated Akt as early as 1 h after infection (Fig. 5A). To test whether Akt activation is required for mycobacterial infection, we treated infected cells with small molecule inhibitors of Akt, PI3K, and mTOR. The efficacy of these inhibitors was verified by measuring their effect on inhibition of Akt and S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Indeed, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and PI3K (wortmannin) reduced BCG infection in infected cells, as manifested by reduced number and size of intracellular GFP-BCG foci (Fig. 5, C and D). Surprisingly, we found that inhibition of mTOR (rapamycin), one of the downstream components of the Akt signaling and a promising cancer therapeutic target, also conferred resistance to BCG infection (Fig. 5, C and D). This function of mTOR is apparently distinct from the proposed role of the Akt in pathogenic infection, because 1) the endocytic and phagocytic function of Akt does not require mTOR, and 2) inhibition of mTOR did not ablate Akt activation in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5B) and in many cell types even leads to a strong feedback activation of Akt, as demonstrated previously (25O'Reilly K.E. Rojo F. She Q.B. Solit D. Mills G.B. Smith D. Lane H. Hofmann F. Hicklin D.J. Ludwig D.L. Baselga J. Rosen N. mTOR inhibition induces upstream receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling and activates Akt.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). To address whether the PI3K-Akt pathway also promotes BCG entry, we compared the degree of BCG infection by treating MCF-7 cells with the inhibitors either before or after BCG infection. We did not observe any obvious change in percentages of infected cells (Fig. 5D), indicating phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate signal is not involved in pathogen entry under this condition. To extend our findings to a tumor cell type that may encounter BCG during the course of cancer therapy, we also determined the susceptibility of bladder cancer cells with altered PTEN levels to infection with BCG. We infected bladder cancer cell lines UM-UC-3 and MGHU4 with GFP-expressing BCG and measured the proportion of infected (GFP-positive) cells by flow cytometry. Western blots revealed that UM-UC-3 cells lack PTEN expression, whereas MGHU4 cells possess readily detectable PTEN expression (Fig. 6A). After 22 h of infection there was a dramatic difference between the two cell lines in their susceptibility to BCG infection. MGHU4 was highly resistant to infection, with less than 2% of the population being GFP-positive, whereas UM-UC-3 was susceptible to infection with more than 50% of the cells being GFP-positive (Fig. 6B). To assess whether loss of PTEN is sufficient to render MGHU4 cells susceptible to BCG infection, we knocked down PTEN in MGHU4 by shRNA (Fig. 6C). PTEN knockdown increased the fraction of infected cells by ∼2-fold compared with control shRNA (Fig. 6D). It should be noted that the absolute level of infection in MGHU4 cells upon PTEN knockdown did not approach that observed in UM-UC-3 cells. This might be due to incomplete PTEN knockdown (Fig. 6C), and it is also likely that other factors might contribute to the difference of these two cell lines in susceptibility to BCG infection. Taken together, our results indicate a causal relationship between the PTEN status of epithelial cells and their permissiveness for intracellular pathogens. This study indicates that a competent PTEN protein is not only critical for tumor suppression but also for resisting infection of mammalian cells by BCG and Mycoplasma, two pathogens with distinct pathogenic strategies. Our data also indicate that infection with BCG or Mycoplasma activates Akt, indicating that loss of PTEN may promote infection by mimicking the natural pathogenic strategy used by these organisms. The mechanisms that mediate the effect of PTEN loss on bacterial infection remain to be defined and could be the consequence of enhanced bacterial intracellular proliferation, intracellular survival, or a combination. Previous reports suggested a role of Akt in mediating infection of epithelial cells and macrophages by mycobacteria and Salmonella (12Kuijl C. Savage N.D. Marsman M. Tuin A.W. Janssen L. Egan D.A.

Although the mechanisms by which Akt functions to promote bacterial entry, intracellular proliferation, or survival has not been defined, hypotheses have been raised to explain this phenomenon. By activating p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and downstream small G protein RAC1, Akt modulates actin cytoskeleton and phagocytosis, thus possibly affecting bacterial entry (28Scott C.C. Dobson W.

All these functions of Akt do not involve mTOR, making our finding that rapamycin can suppress BCG infection in MCF-7 cells highly intriguing. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin can promote autophagy. To test if autophagy contributes to the effect of rapamycin on BCG infection, we knocked down the autophagy-essential gene ATG7 in MCF-7 to abrogate autophagy. However, ATG7 deficiency does not affect BCG infection in MCF-7 (data not shown), suggesting autophagy is not responsible for our observation at least under this context. The fact that PTEN-deficient cells are broadly sensitive to bacterial infection has potential implications for clinical oncology. This study suggests that certain tumor cells, especially those with PTEN mutation or PI3K/Akt activation, might be more susceptible to infection by certain intracellular bacteria. To date, whether cancer cells are in general more vulnerable to pathogenic infection and whether pathogenic infection could affect cancer development are underexplored areas that have potential clinical significance. The PTEN-PI3K pathway is a commonly mutated pathway in human cancer. Consequently, the kinases in this and related pathways are being aggressively pursued as targets for therapeutic intervention. Our finding that loss of PTEN with consequent activation of the PI3K pathway confers intrinsic susceptibility to infection suggests that these inhibitors may have complex effects on infectious risk in patients. Inhibitors of mTOR such as rapamycin and sirolimus are potent immunosuppressants due to their effects on T cell proliferation. However, our results indicate that small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K pathway may actually promote resistance to infection in epithelial cells and possibly macrophages. Our results also have potential implications for BCG therapy of Carcinoma in situ of the bladder. Our results demonstrate that the genetic background of a bladder cancer cell may affect its susceptibility to BCG infection, a variable that could determine response to BCG therapy. Further elucidation of the molecular determinants of bladder cancer cell susceptibility to BCG infection has the potential to reveal predictors of BCG response, none of which are presently available for clinical use."

The phosphopeptides from epidermal growth factor receptor are reported to bind to the PH domain of Brag2 to regulate its activity. These observations have been used to explain the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor on cancer cell invasion. Stimulation of Brag2 increases Arf6·GTP levels, which drive the cellular changes responsible for movement of the cancer cells into the normal tissue. Brag2 activity is also regulated by phosphoinositides that presumably bind the PH domain (9Sakurai A. Jian X. Lee C.J. Manavski Y. Chavakis E. Donaldson J. Randazzo P.A. Gutkind J.S. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase and GEP100/Brag2 protein mediate antiangiogenic signaling by semaphorin 3E-plexin-D1 through Arf6 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34335-34345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that the PH domain may represent a regulatory motif. PH domain-mediated regulation of one subtype of ArfGEFs, cytohesin/Grp/ARNO, has been characterized. ARNO GEF activity is autoinhibited by the linker region between the Sec7 and PH domains and a C-terminal amphipathic helix containing a polybasic motif, which physically block the Arf binding site. Binding of Arf6·GTP and phosphoinositides to the PH domain has two functions. One is to recruit ARNO to the membrane surface on which it is active, and the second is to induce a conformational change in the PH domain that relieves autoinhibition. Phosphorylation of serines and threonine within a polybasic motif of cytohesin-1 by protein kinase C (PKC) also relieves autoinhibition (11DiNitto J.P. Delprato A. Gabe Lee M.T. Cronin T.C. Huang S. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Structural basis and mechanism of autoregulation in 3-phosphoinositide-dependent Grp1 family Arf GTPase exchange factors.Mol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Brag2 does not have a sequence similar to that in ARNO responsible for autoinhibition; therefore, the findings from ARNO may not extrapolate to Brag2. Thus, we aimed to dissect the molecular mechanism controlling Brag2 activity with the ultimate goal of using it as a therapeutic target for anticancer cell invasion therapy. Here we first determined the effect of PIP2 on the fundamental enzymatic parameters kcat and Km for Brag2. PIP2 increased the ratio kcat/Km from 2.6 × 105 to 8.8 × 106 m−1 s−1. We then analyzed structural requirements for GEF activity. Unique to Brag2, the linker between the Sec7 and PH domains had a positive effect on activity, and the effect of PIP2 required the N terminus of Arf. These unique features of Brag2 can be used to selectively inhibit Brag2 activity. A mammalian expression vector for Brag2-myc-His and a bacterial expression vector for GST-Brag2-His were kindly provided by Joel Moss (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute). Bacterial expression vectors for His-Brag2Sec7-PH (amino acids 499–863), His-Brag2Sec7-linker (amino acids 499–740), and His-Brag2Sec7 (amino acids 499–700) were generated by standard PCR methods using pET19 as an expression vector (EMD Biosciences). Mutants in the PH domain of His-Brag2Sec7-PH (K753S,K756S and R762S) were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Brag2-myc-His expressed in HEK293T cells was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column.

The amount of phosphatidylinositol was changed accordingly from 10, 9.9, 9.75, 9.5, to 9%. The purified recombinant protein His-Brag2Sec7-PH (800 nm) alone or with 1 μm myrArf1, (Δ17)Arf1, or (L8K)Arf1 was incubated with sucrose-loaded LUVs containing 500 μm total phospholipids at 30 °C for 5 min.

The reactions also contained 0.5 mm LUVs and 0.5 μm Arf·GDP with different concentrations of Brag2. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 min and terminated with 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein-bound nucleotide was trapped on nitrocellulose, and the bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Brag2 GEF activity was determined under conditions satisfying the steady state assumption using a FluorMax3 spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Edison, NJ). The conversion of Arf1·GDP to Arf1·GTP was monitored by fluorescence (excitation, 297 nm; emission, 340 nm). Arf1·GTP has a greater emission than Arf1·GDP; therefore, the conversion results in an increase in fluorescent signal. The reaction contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm LUV with or without 1% PIP2. When GTPγS was the substrate being varied, 0.1 nm His-Brag2Sec7-PH, 5 μm myrArf1 (saturating concentration), and 0.5–100 μm GTPγS were included. When Arf1·GDP or Arf6·GDP was the substrate being varied, 0.1 (for LUVs containing 1% PIP2) or 0.5 nm (for LUVs lacking PIP2) His-Brag2Sec7-PH, 100 μm GTPγS, and different concentrations of myrArf1 or myrArf6 were included. Single turnover analyses were performed using an SF-2004 stopped flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). MyrArf1 or myrArf6 preloaded with mantGDP was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of His-Brag2Sec7-PH. To load myrArf1 (or myrArf6) with mantGDP, 0.2 μm myrArf1 (or 0.4 μm myrArf6) was incubated at 30 °C for 1–2 h in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μm mantGDP, and 0.5 mm LUV with or without 1% (5 μm) PIP2. At the end of the incubation, MgCl2 was added to reach a final concentration of 2 mm. His-Brag2Sec7-PH was in the same buffer as for loading except 2 mm MgCl2 and 200 μm GTP were present and mantGDP was not. The conversion of Arf·mantGDP to Arf·GTP was monitored by a FRET signal resulting from resonance energy transfer from tryptophan in Arf to the methylanthronoyl group on GDP. The excitation wavelength was set at 297 nm, and the photomultiplier tube filter cutoff was 400 nm. Arf·mantGDP has a FRET signal, whereas Arf·GTP does not; therefore, the conversion results in a decrease in fluorescent signal.

The myrArf was created by superposing the NMR structure of myrArf (Protein Data Bank code 2K5U (25Liu Y. Kahn R.A. Prestegard J.H.

Homology modeling was done using Prime (Schrödinger Inc., New York, NY) to replace the ARNO1 sequence with that of Brag2. The random coil portion of the Brag2 linker was docked interactively using MacroModel (Schrödinger Inc.), and the Sec7 domain, putative linker helix, and random coil region were linked using Prime. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad dye binding assay. Arf concentration was determined by GTPγS binding as described (27Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G.

Nucleotide exchange on myrArf requires that nucleotide evacuates the binding site on myrArf followed by nucleotide binding to the empty site. MyrArf is not stable without nucleotide and precipitates from solution. The function of the exchange factor is to accelerate nucleotide dissociation and stabilize the empty form of Arf. We consider the reaction a simplified Ping Pong Bi Bi (30Chang C.H. Cha S. Brockman R.W. Bennett L.L.

Bi Bi refers to two substrates and two products. Ping Pong refers to a mechanism in which the enzyme cannot bind two substrates simultaneously. One substrate binds to the enzyme; the enzyme releases the first product and is then able to bind to the second substrate. In this scheme, the first substrate, Arf·GDP, binds to the GEF, releasing the product, GDP, and leaving the complex of GEF-empty Arf. We consider this a second form of the enzyme to which the second substrate, GTP, binds. The product, Arf·GTP, is released, generating the initial form of the enzyme. The role of a membrane surface was considered in examining Brag2 activity. Neither of the Brag2 substrates, myrArf·GDP and GTP, is membrane-restricted. Therefore, surface dilution does not have to be considered when examining initial rates. However, the enzyme·substrate complex (i.e. Brag2·myrArf) and the product myrArf·GTP are tightly associated with membranes, and myrArf·GTP cannot accumulate without a hydrophobic surface. We provided LUVs as the surface. The experiments presented here used myrArf1·GDP and mutants of Arf1 as substrates for Brag2. MyrArf6 was also used for substrate saturation and single turnover experiments with results that were very similar to those obtained with myrArf1. Because Brag2 has been reported to be an Arf6 exchange factor, we provide the data for myrArf6 in supplemental Results and Discussion, Figs. S1–S3, and Tables S1–S3 to provide a documented comparison with Arf1. The data do not add significantly to the test of the hypothesis that PIP2 binding to the PH domain regulates GEF activity and, therefore, are not included in the main text. We sought a recombinant form of Brag2 to examine phosphoinositide dependence. Although we have prepared full-length recombinant Brag2 suitable for some biochemical analyses, at this time, we are not able to obtain a sufficiently pure, homogeneous, stable full-length Brag2 of adequate concentration for the planned kinetic experiments. We were able to prepare a protein comprising the Sec7 and PH domains with a His10 tag fused to the N terminus (His-Brag2Sec7-PH). We first determined whether His-Brag2Sec7-PH was activated by PIP2 to a similar extent as full-length Brag2. Two preparations of full-length Brag2 were used for the comparison: (i) Brag2 expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein that also contained a His6 tag (GST-Brag2-His) and (ii) Brag2 with myc and His6 tags on the C terminus (Brag2-myc-His) expressed in and purified from mammalian cells (see Fig. 1B for schematic of recombinant Brag2 proteins used in these experiments). The concentration of the full-length Brag2 was estimated by comparing the intensity of staining with standards run on the same polyacrylamide gel. To determine the relative effect of PIP2 on exchange factor activity, the Brag2 recombinant proteins were titrated into reactions containing myrArf1·GDP (0.5 μm), GTPγS (5 μm), and LUVs with or without PIP2 (Fig. 1C and Table 1). The concentration of Brag2 that resulted in 50% exchange of nucleotide on Arf (we call this concentration the C50), which is roughly proportional to the inverse of enzymatic power (28Randazzo P.A. Miura K. Jackson T.R. Assay and purification of phosphoinositide-dependent ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPase activating proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was determined. All preparations of Brag2, including His-Brag2Sec7-PH, had 15–20-fold more specific activity in the presence of PIP2 than in its absence. His-Brag2Sec7-PH was 6–10-fold more active than either full-length Brag2. Given the similar effects of PIP2 on the activity of full-length Brag2 and His-Brag2Sec7-PH, His-Brag2Sec7-PH was used for our subsequent work aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which PIP2 binding to Brag2 stimulates GEF activity.TABLE 1Comparison of effect of PIP2 on full-length Brag2 to His-Brag2Sec7-PHC50His-Brag2Sec7-PHGST-Brag2-HisBrag2-myc-Hisnm+PIP20.44 ± 0.031.72 ± 0.173.56 ± 0.36−PIP26.45 ± 0.7438.8 ± 7.780.4 ± 33.7 Open table in a new tab We determined the effect of PIP2 on kinetic parameters for His-Brag2Sec7-PH using myrArf1·GDP as the substrate. The analysis for myrArf1·GDP is simplified if analyzed with saturating concentrations of the second substrate, GTP (we used GTPγS, an analog of GTP that is slowly hydrolyzed) (see supplemental Appendix for equations used for analysis). To establish the necessary concentration of GTPγS, we determined the enzymatic parameters with GTPγS as the varied substrate (Fig. 2). Arf1·GDP was fixed at a saturating concentration (>20 Km; see next paragraph). The reaction was followed continuous"

Here we examined this process for the GABA(B) receptors that assemble into oligomers of heterodimers through the association of their GABA(B1) subunit. We report a method to study oligomer dynamics based on a drug-controlled cell surface targeting of intracellularly retained receptors and a parallel measurement of two FRET signals in HEK293 cells. GABA(B1) subunits at the cell surface (4.0 ± 0.6 a.u.) are labeled with a pair of fluorophores (donor and red acceptor). New receptors are then targeted to the cell surface during 3h treatment with AP21967 such that the number of receptors is doubled (9.1 ± 0.7 a.u.). After labeling these new receptors with a second acceptor (green), the red FRET remained unchanged (5189 ± 36 vs. 4783 ± 32 cps), supporting the stability of the preformed oligomers. However, new oligomers are detected by the green FRET signal indicating both receptor populations are in the same microdomains. As a control, we confirmed the strict stability of the GABA(B) heterodimer itself. Herein, using a novel method to monitor the dynamics of cell surface complexes, we provide evidence for the stability of GABA(B) oligomers."

Also, loss- and gain-of-function studies have revealed pleiotropic roles of β-catenin in proliferation and hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cell differentiation, but precise mechanisms remain unknown. Here we utilize livers from different stages of murine development to determine β-catenin signaling and downstream targets. Although during early liver development full-length β-catenin is the predominant form, at late stages, where full-length β-catenin localizes to developing biliary epithelial cells only, a 75-kDa truncated β-catenin species is the principal form localizing at the membrane and in the nucleus of differentiating hepatocytes. The truncated species lacks 95 N-terminal amino acids and is transcriptionally active. Our evidence points to proteolytic cleavage of β-catenin by calpain as the mechanism of truncation in cell-free and cell-based assays. Intraperitoneal injection of a short term calpain inhibitor to timed pregnant female mice abrogated β-catenin truncation in the embryonic livers. RNA-seq revealed a unique set of targets transcribed in cells expressing truncated versus full-length β-catenin, consistent with different functionalities.

https://openalex.org/W2010914916,"Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is caused by the excess production of extracellular matrix (ECM) by Fb in response to TGF-β1. Here, we show that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 modulates the production of many pro- and antifibrogenic cytokines and ECM. After acute, bleomycin injury, Pin1(-/-) mice showed reduced, pulmonary expression of collagens, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, and fibrogenic cytokines but increased matrix metalloproteinases, compared with WT mice, despite similar levels of inflammation. In primary fibroblasts, Pin1 was required for TGF-β-induced phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of Smad3. In Pin1(-/-) cells, inhibitory Smad6 was found in the cytoplasm rather than nucleus. Smad6 knockdown in Pin1(-/-) fibroblasts restored TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation, translocation, and target gene expression. Therefore, Pin1 is essential for normal Smad6 function and ECM production in response to injury or TGF-β and thus may be an attractive therapeutic target to prevent excess scarring in diverse lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2005019444,"ER71, also known as ETV2, is an ETS transcription factor that is expressed during embryogenesis and in adult testes. We show that Er71 transcription can be up-regulated by SRY, the key determinant of male differentiation. Accordingly, SRY bound to and activated the Er71 promoter, and mutation of a putative SRY binding site abolished this promoter activation. In turn, ER71 was able to bind to the promoter of Sox9, the primary target of SRY and a critical transcription factor for maintenance of the Sertoli cell phenotype. Mutation of the ER71 binding site in the Sox9 promoter suppressed ER71-dependent up-regulation of Sox9 transcription, and a dominant-negative ER71 molecule severely reduced Sox9 transcription in a Sertoli cell line. Conversely, SOX9 bound the Er71 promoter in vivo and Sox9 down-regulation reduced Er71 transcript levels. Together, these data suggest a mechanism by which SRY induces Sox9 and Er71 transcription early in testis differentiation, whereas ER71 and SOX9 participate in an autoregulatory loop to sustain each other's expression after Sry expression has subsided in mice. Thereby, ER71 and SOX9 may affect late testis development as well as the function of the adult male gonad."
https://openalex.org/W2077706785,"Inflammation characterized by the expression and release of cytokines and chemokines is implicated in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins, central to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, have been reported to signal through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR4 and TLR2, in concert with scavenger receptors to regulate the inflammatory microenvironment in atherosclerosis. This study evaluates the role of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and oxidatively modified LDL (oxmLDL) in the expression and release of proinflammatory mediators IκBζ, IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-8 in human monocytes and macrophages. Although standard LDL preparations induced IκBζ along with IL-6 and IL-8 production, this inflammatory effect was eliminated when LDL was isolated under endotoxin-restricted conditions. However, when added with TLR4 and TLR2 ligands, this low endotoxin preparation of oxmLDL suppressed the expression and release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα but surprisingly spared IL-8 production. The suppressive effect of oxmLDL was specific to monocytes as it did not inhibit LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in human macrophages. Thus, TLR ligand contamination of LDL/oxmLDL preparations can complicate interpretations of inflammatory responses to these modified lipoproteins. In contrast to providing a proinflammatory function, oxmLDL suppresses the expression and release of selected proinflammatory mediators."

This cell line, named BRITER (BMP Responsive Immortalized Reporter cell line), responds robustly, promptly and specifically to exogenously added BMP2 protein. The sensitivity to added BMP may be further increased by depleting the endogenous BMP2 and BMP4 proteins.As the dynamic range of the assay (for BMP responsiveness) is very high for BRITER and as it responds specifically and promptly to exogenously added BMP2 protein, BRITER may be used effectively for chemical or molecular genetic screening for BMP signaling modifiers.

https://openalex.org/W1657172089,"Accumulating evidence points to cross-talk between FcεRI and CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-mediated signaling pathways in mast cells. Here, we propose that vimentin, a protein comprising type III intermediate filament, participates in such cross-talk for CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) production in mast cells, which is a mechanism for allergic inflammation. Co-stimulation via FcεRI, using IgE/antigen, and CCR1, using recombinant CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), increased expression of phosphorylated, disassembled, and soluble vimentin in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing human CCR1 (RBL-CCR1 cells) and bone marrow-derived murine mast cells, both models of mucosal type mast cells. Furthermore, co-stimulation enhanced production of CCL2 as well as phosphorylation of MAPK. Treating the cells with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, but not with MEK inhibitor PD98058, reduced CCL2 production, suggesting that p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/2, plays a critical role in the chemokine production. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that vimentin interacts with phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs in the co-simulated cells. Preventing disassembly of the vimentin by aggregating vimentin filaments using β,β'-iminodipropionitrile reduced the interaction of vimentin with phosphorylated MAPKs as well as CCL2 production in the cells. Taken together, disassembled vimentin interacting with phosphorylated p38 MAPK could mediate CCL2 production in mast cells upon FcεRI and CCR1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1998510944,"Complement C3 plays an essential role in the opsonization of pathogens in the mammalian complement system, whereas the molecular mechanism underlying C3 activation in invertebrates remains unknown. To understand the molecular mechanism of C3b deposition on microbes, we characterized two types of C2/factor B homologs (designated TtC2/Bf-1 and TtC2/Bf-2) identified from the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus. Although the domain architectures of TtC2/Bf-1 and TtC2/Bf-2 were identical to those of mammalian homologs, they contained five-repeated and seven-repeated complement control protein domains at their N-terminal regions, respectively. TtC2/Bf-1 and TtC2/Bf-2 were synthesized and glycosylated in hemocytes and secreted to hemolymph plasma, which existed in a complex with C3 (TtC3), and their activation by microbes was absolutely Mg(2+)-dependent. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that TtC3b deposition was Mg(2+)-dependent on Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, but not on Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, this analysis demonstrated that Ca(2+)-dependent lectins (C-reactive protein-1 and tachylectin-5A) were required for TtC3b deposition on Gram-positive bacteria, and that a Ca(2+)-independent lectin (Tachypleus plasma lectin-1) was definitely indispensable for TtC3b deposition on fungi. In contrast, a horseshoe crab lipopolysaccharide-sensitive protease factor C was necessary and sufficient to deposit TtC3b on Gram-negative bacteria. We conclude that plasma lectins and factor C play key roles in microbe-specific TtC3b deposition in a C2/factor B-dependent or -independent manner."

The functional effect of every possible substitution at each amino acid position within a portion of P2Y(12) (1254 mutants) was individually determined. Sequence analysis of >70 P2Y(12) vertebrate orthologs revealed that this amino acid variability ensuring proper receptor function in vivo highly correlates (>90%) with the in vitro experimental data. Therefore, ortholog sequence data are helpful to predict the functional relevance of individual positions and mutations for P2Y(12).

https://openalex.org/W2116444908,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) trans-differentiation, or their switch from a contractile/quiescent to a secretory/inflammatory/migratory state, is known to play an important role in pathological vascular remodeling including atherosclerosis and postangioplasty restenosis. Several reports have established the Notch pathway as tightly regulating VSMC response to various stress factors through growth, migration, apoptosis, and de-differentiation. More recently, we showed that alterations of the Notch pathway also govern VSMC acquisition of the inflammatory state, one of the major events accelerating atherosclerosis. We also evidenced that the inflammatory context of atherosclerosis triggers a de novo expression of adenylyl cyclase isoform 8 (AC8), associated with the properties developed by trans-differentiated VSMCs. As an initial approach to understanding the regulation of AC8 expression, we examined the role of the Notch pathway. Here we show that inhibiting the Notch pathway enhances the effect of IL1β on AC8 expression, amplifies its deleterious effects on the VSMC trans-differentiated phenotype, and decreases Notch target genes Hrt1 and Hrt3. Conversely, Notch activation resulted in blocking AC8 expression and up-regulated Hrt1 and Hrt3 expression. Furthermore, overexpressing Hrt1 and Hrt3 significantly decreased IL1β-induced AC8 expression. In agreement with these in vitro findings, the in vivo rat carotid balloon-injury model of restenosis evidenced that AC8 de novo expression coincided with down-regulation of the Notch3 pathway. These results, demonstrating that the Notch pathway attenuates IL1β-mediated AC8 up-regulation in trans-differentiated VSMCs, suggest that AC8 expression, besides being induced by the proinflammatory cytokine IL1β, is also dependent on down-regulation of the Notch pathway occurring in an inflammatory context."

In the intestine, LCN2 is overexpressed in colitis patients and its overexpression is a negative prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer. Functionally, LCN2 has a number of different activities that may contribute to its oncogenic potential, including increasing matrix metalloproteinase activity, control of iron availability and stimulating inflammation. In this report, we examined APCmin intestinal tumorigenesis in an LCN2-deficient background. We found that the loss of LCN2 increased tumor multiplicity specifically in the duodenum, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive activity. Concurrently, however, LCN2 increased the average small intestinal tumor size particularly in the distal small intestine. We found that this increase was correlated to tumor iron(II) content, suggesting that an iron-scavenging role is important for LCN2 oncogenic activity in the intestine."

Here, we demonstrate that β(2)ARs form protein complexes with the pacemaker HCN4 channel, as well as with other subtypes of HCN channels. The adrenergic receptor-binding site was identified at a proximal region of the N-terminal tail of the HCN4 channel. A synthetic peptide derived from the β(2)AR-binding domain of the HCN4 channel disrupted interaction between HCN4 and β(2)AR. In addition, treatment with this peptide prevented adrenergic augmentation of pacemaker currents and spontaneous contraction rates but did not affect adrenergic regulation of voltage-gated calcium currents. These results suggest that the ion channel-receptor complex is a critical mechanism in ion channel regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2020714594,"The plasminogen (Plg) activation cascade on the cell surface plays a central role in cell migration and is involved in a plethora of physiological and pathological processes. Its regulation is coordinated by many receptors, in particular the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR, CD87), receptors that physically interact and functionally cooperate with uPAR, and Plg binding molecules. Here we studied the impact of one of the Plg binding molecules, the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P-IGF2R, CD222), on cellular Plg activation. By developing both in vitro and in vivo Plg activation assays on size-fractionated lysates of M6P-IGF2R-silenced cells, we identified Plg-associated complexes with M6P-IGF2R as the regulatory factor. Using lipid raft preserving versus dissolving detergents, we found lipid dependence of the Plg regulatory function of these complexes. Furthermore, M6P-IGF2R-silencing in uPAR-positive human cell lines reduced internalization of Plg, resulting in elevated Plg activation. In contrast, the expression of human M6P-IGF2R in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from M6P-IGF2R knock-out mice enhanced Plg internalization. Finally, peptide 18-36 derived from the Plg-binding site within M6P-IGF2R enhanced Plg uptake. Thus, by targeting Plg to endocytic pathways, M6P-IGF2R appears to control Plg activation within cells that might be important to restrict plasmin activity to specific sites and substrates."

We examined the aqueous accessibility of 75 substituted cysteines comprising the C terminus of both αIIb and β3 TMs, the intracellular membrane-proximal regions, and the whole cytoplasmic tails, to the labeling of a membrane-permeable, cysteine-specific chemical biotin maleimide (BM). The active state of integrin αIIbβ3 heterodimer was generated by co-expression of activating partners with the cysteine-substituted constructs. Our data revealed that, in the inactive state, the intracellular lipid/aqueous border of αIIb TM was at Lys994 and β3 TM was at Phe727 respectively; in the active state, the border of αIIb TM shifted to Pro998, whereas the border of β3 TM remained unchanged, suggesting that complex conformational changes occurred in the TMs upon αIIbβ3 inside-out activation. On the basis of the results, we propose a new inside-out activation mechanism for integrin αIIbβ3 and by inference, all of the integrins in their native cellular environment.Background: The transmembrane domain of integrins plays a critical role in mediating receptor inside-out activation.Results: Inside-out activation triggers the repartitioning of the intracellular border of αIIb but not the β3 transmembrane domain into the lipid bilayer in living cells.Conclusion: Complex conformational changes occur in the transmembrane domain upon integrin αIIbβ3 inside-out activation.Significance: Our findings represent a new mechanism for integrin inside-out activation.

Integrins exist in a default low affinity state on the cell surfaces. Upon stimulation by intracellular signals, integrins convert to the active state that permits extracellular ligands binding (inside-out activation), which in turn promotes interactions of intracellular proteins with the cytoplasmic tails (outside-in signaling) (3Shattil S.J.

Intracellular signals interact with the β3 cytoplasmic tail that breaks the constraint to initiate a conformational change that traverses the TMs, which ultimately triggers activation of the extracellular domain.

Cell. 2009; 34: 234-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have yielded three different views on the intracellular clasp of αIIbβ3: the first proposed that the clasp is formed by the interaction between residues αIIb Phe992/Phe993 and β3 Tyr715, the second proposed that the clasp is formed by an inhibitory ligand binding in the MP region, and the third proposed that the clasp is formed between β3 Lys716 side chain and the peptide backbone of αIIb 991GFFKR995 motif. All of the aforementioned studies have greatly improved our knowledge on the conformation of the TMs and the intracellular clasp in the MP region of integrin αIIbβ3; however, questions remain. It is known that the regulated association of αIIbβ3 TMs is driven by domains outside of the plasma membranes, whether the NMR structures of fragmented αIIbβ3 TM peptides correspond to any physiological states of the receptor is obscure. Questions such as how the TMs of integrin αIIbβ3 undergo spatial and conformational changes upon activation and how intracellular proteins interact with the cytoplasmic tails of αIIbβ3 to initiate inside-out activation can only be genuinely answered by the analyses of intact integrin protein in the cellular environment. Here, we present a successful analysis of the cellular location of integrin αIIbβ3 TM intracellular borders in the receptor inactive and active states in the living cells by using the substituted cysteine scanning accessibility method (SCSAM). Our data revealed a new mechanism for integrin αIIbβ3 inside-out activation in cell membranes. Site-directed mutagenesis kits were from Strategene. Biotin maleimide, DMEM, and all cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Anti-integrin αIIb or β3 rabbit or mouse antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein A- and G-Sepharose, streptavidin/biotinylated-horseradish peroxidase complex (streptavidin-HRP), and goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were from GE Healthcare. Igepal was from Sigma. PVDF membrane was from Millipore. A wild-type human αIIb and a β3 cDNA were used as the templates for site-directed mutagenesis. Amino acids at the position of Leu985 to Glu1008 in αIIb and Leu712 to Thr762 in β3 were individually replaced with cysteines. Mutagenesis was performed using the Strategene site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The complete cDNA sequence of each mutant was verified by DNA sequencing. Cysteine-substituted αIIbβ3 was transiently expressed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (from Invitrogen) transfection following the manufacturer's instructions. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were also used in some experiments. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and harvested 48 h after transfection. Flow cytometry assays for assessing the effects of cysteine substitutions on αIIbβ3 activation were performed as described previously (23Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Structural basis of integrin activation by talin.Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In brief, cysteine-substituted αIIb or β3 constructs were co-expressed with the wild-type partners in the CHO cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were stained with antibody D57, which measures receptor surface expression, and PAC1, which detects the active state of αIIbβ3, in the presence and absence of Ro43-5054 or anti-LIBS6, and then subjected to FACS scan. Ro43-5054 is a competitive antagonist of αIIbβ3, which was used to estimate nonspecific PAC1 binding (F0), and anti-LIBS6 is an αIIbβ3-activating antibody that was used to estimate maximal PAC1 binding (Fmax). The activation index was calculated as 100 × (F − F0)/(Fmax − F0), where F = mean fluorescence intensity of PAC1 staining under the test condition. For detailed methods, see Ref. 23Wegener K.L.

Whole cell labeling with BM was performed as described previously (24Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. Novel topology in C-terminal region of the human plasma membrane anion exchanger, AE1.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK 293 cells were collected and resuspended in PBSCM (PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) solution and subsequently labeled with BM (0.2 mm final) at room temperature for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 5-fold glutathione in molar ratio. Cells were then washed with PBSCM and lysed in IPB buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Igepal, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA and protease inhibitors (from Roche Applied Science) on ice for 10 min. αIIbβ3 proteins were immunoprecipitated by a mouse anti-human αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody (sc-21783 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein samples were resolved on 7.5% (for β3 subunit) and 10% (for αIIb light chain) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, respectively, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Biotinylated proteins were detected by incubation of blots with 1:10,000 diluted streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) in TBSTB buffer (TBST buffer (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5), containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA). Protein expression levels were determined by probing the blot with rabbit anti-αIIb or β3 polyclonal antibodies at 1:3,000 dilutions in TBSTM buffer (TBST buffer containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk). Membrane treatment with Na2CO3 was performed as described previously (25Zhu Q. Kao L. Azimov R. Newman D. Liu W. Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Kurtz I.

Chem. 2010; 285: 13416-13426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells (10-cm plate) were collected, washed (TBS buffer: 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and incubated with the homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with Roche protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then lysed by Dounce homogenization. Cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation (4,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the membrane fractions were collected by high speed centrifugation (35,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Membrane pellets were first resuspended in 100 μl of 0.3 m sucrose and then mixed with 2 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m or 3 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and incubated for 30 min on a rotating shaker at 4 °C. Membranes were then collected by centrifugation, washed with PBSCM, and resuspended in 1.0 ml of PBSCM followed by BM labeling. In some experiments, the protein levels of the stripped and unstripped membranes were determined by the BCA method (from Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Films from immunoblots and biotinylation blots were scanned with a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet 5590. Scanned images were quantified with UN-SCAN-IT gelTM version 6.1 software. Biotinylation levels were calculated according to Ref. 24Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R.

Means ± S.E. were calculated with SigmaPlot 10 software. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot 10 software. SCSAM uses sulfhydryl reactive chemical probes to determine the location of the introduced cysteines in a target membrane protein that is free of endogenous reactive cysteines (26Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Substituted-cysteine accessibility method.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 27Zhu Q. Casey J.R. Topology of transmembrane proteins by scanning cysteine accessibility mutagenesis methodology.Methods. 2007; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). BM, a membrane-permeable sulfhydryl-specific reagent, has been used successfully for the topological analysis of transmembrane proteins (24Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. Novel topology in C-terminal region of the human plasma membrane anion exchanger, AE1.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Zhu Q.

Chem. 2010; 285: 37178-37187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SCSAM is based on the observation that the chemical reaction only occurs in the aqueous environment. Cysteines residing in the aqueous medium can react with BM, whereas cysteines residing in the lipid bilayer, the protein interior, or forming disulfide bonds cannot. BM minimally labels the endoplasmic reticulum-retained membrane proteins (24Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. Novel topology in C-terminal region of the human plasma membrane anion exchanger, AE1.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which is probably due to the high content of glutathione in the cytosol. Integrin αIIbβ3 is a cysteine-rich membrane receptor that contains 20 endogenous cysteines in αIIb and 56 in the β3 subunit. The recent crystal structure of the extracellular domain of αIIbβ3 showed that all of the cysteines in αIIbβ3 form disulfide bonds (13Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Structure of a complete integrin ectodomain in a physiologic resting state and activation and deactivation by applied forces.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar); however, conflicting reports also suggested that the receptor may have endogenous thiol isomerase activity that exposes free cysteines (29Yan B. Smith J.W. A redox site involved in integrin activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39964-39972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine whether free reactive cysteines are present in the wild-type αIIbβ3, we tested wild-type integrin αIIbβ3 for labeling with BM. Wild-type αIIbβ3 and mutant constructs αIIb-E1008C/β3-T762C were expressed in the HEK 293 cells and subjected to the whole cell labeling. Fig. 1B shows that the wild-type αIIb or β3 has no detectable BM labeling, whereas the light chain of αIIb with a single cysteine substitution (E1008C) at the C terminus or β3 with a cysteine substitution at Thr762 (residue at the C terminus of β3) was strongly labeled, suggesting that no free endogenous cysteines are present in wild-type αIIb or β3 that are available for BM labeling. Western blots verified that αIIb (sc-6602, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and β3 (sc-6627, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) are both well expressed. Based on the results, we individually substituted single amino acids (between Leu985 and Glu1008) with cysteines in the C-terminal region of αIIb that covers the proposed C terminus of the TM, the intracellular MP region, and the whole intracellular tail, and the positions between Leu712 and Phe730 in β3 covering the proposed MP region of β3 TM (Fig. 1A). Integrin αIIb carrying substituted cysteines was co-expressed with the wild-type β3 in the HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection. 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and subjected to BM labeling. Fig. 2 shows that the positive control, αIIb E1008C was strongly labeled, whereas the negative control, wild-type αIIb, had no labeling. Amino acids between Leu985 and Phe993 were not labeled, suggesting that they are embedded in the lipid bilayer; amino acids between Asn996 and Glu1008 were increasingly labeled, indicating the C-terminal tail is free of any cytosolic protein interactions. Interestingly, K994C was weakly labeled, whereas the adjacent residue, R995C was unlabeled compared with the controls. These data suggest that in the intact αIIbβ3 complex in living cells, the intracellular border of αIIb TM is at Lys994, which leaves the proposed salt bridge αIIb Arg995/β3 Asp723 outside of the plasma membrane at the lipid/aqueous interface in the cytosol. We then performed whole cell labeling on the cysteine-substituted integrin β3 constructs co-expressed with wild-type αIIb in HEK 293 cells. Fig. 3, A and C, shows that none of the substituted cysteines in the region between Leu712 and Glu726 was labeled with BM, and the first BM labeled residue was at Phe727 marking the intracellular border of β3 TM. The intensity of BM labeling on the cysteine substitutions from F727C to F730C was similar suggesting the peptide after Phe727 enters the aqueous medium abruptly. Functional effects of cysteine substitutions in the TM and the MP regions of integrin αIIbβ3 have recently been reported (16Zhu J. Luo B.H. Barth P. Schonbrun J. Baker D. Springer T.A. The structure of a receptor with two associating transmembrane domains on the cell surface: integrin αIIbβ3.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 234-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), in that cysteine substitution of any of the residues in the 991GFFKRN996 region of αIIb activated the receptor to various degrees, whereas substitution in the remaining portion of the αIIb intracellular tail had no functional effect. Surprisingly, in the MP region of β3, only one cysteine substitution at amino acid Lys716 substantially activated integrin αIIbβ3. Because most of the functional studies of integrin αIIbβ3 were performed in the CHO cells, we expressed the cysteine-substituted constructs in the CHO cells and subjected them to FACS analysis with PAC1 antibody that recognizes the active state of integrin αIIbβ3. Fig. 4 shows that, indeed, our findings were in agreement with the previous report. Functional results indicated that the intracellular border of integrin αIIb TM represented mixed states of active/inactive receptors. Substitution of β3 Lys716 with Cys or Pro was shown to activate integrin αIIbβ3 close to the full activation level (16Zhu J. Luo B.H. Barth P. Schonbrun J. Baker D. Springer T.A.

To obtain the intracellular border of αIIb TM in the active state, we co-expressed αIIb cysteine-substituted constructs with β3 K716P and subjected them to whole cell labeling with BM. Fig. 5 shows that activation of integrin αIIbβ3 had no effect on the labeling in the region of Pro998 to Glu1008; however, the region of Lys994-Arg997 was no longer labeled with BM, and the first labeled residues started with Pro998, which differs significantly from the previous results obtained in the mixed active/inactive states of the receptor. We further tested BM labeling on the αIIb cysteine-substituted constructs co-expressed with a truncated form of β3 at Lys716, which also produces a highly active state of αIIbβ3 (14Hughes P.E.

https://openalex.org/W2163974868,"Using a previously developed Bacillus cereus in vivo expression technology (IVET) promoter trap system, we showed that spsA, a gene of unknown function, was specifically expressed in the larval gut during infection. Search for gut-related compounds inducing spsA transcription identified glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) as an activation signal. Analysis of the spsA-related 5-gene cluster indicated that SpsA is part of a new sugar phosphate sensor system composed of a 2-component system (TCS) encoded by spsR and spsK, and 2 additional downstream genes, spsB and spsC. In B. cereus, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 14579, spsRK, and spsABC are separate transcriptional units, of which only spsABC was activated by extracellular G6P. lacZ transcriptional fusions tested in mutant and complemented strains showed that SpsRK, SpsA, and SpsB are essential for the transcription of spsABC. Deletion mutant analysis showed that SpsC is essential for the G6P uptake. gfp-transcriptional fusions showed that these genes are required for host-activated expression, as well. This sugar phosphate sensor and transport system is found in pathogenic Bacillus group and Clostridia bacteria and may be important for host adaptation. Our findings provide new insights into the function of 2-component sensor systems in host-pathogen interactions, specifically in the gut.—Song, F., Peng, Q., Brillard, J., Buisson, C., de Been, M., Abee, T., Broussolle, V., Huang, D., Zhang, J., Lereclus, D., Nielsen-LeRoux, C.

https://openalex.org/W2058728729,"The actin cytoskeleton promotes clustering of proteins associated with cholesterol-dependent rafts, but its effect on lipid interactions that form and maintain rafts is not understood. We addressed this question by determining the effect of disrupting the cytoskeleton on co-clustering of dihexadecyl-(C(16))-anchored DiO and DiI, which co-enrich in ordered lipid environments such as rafts. Co-clustering was assayed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in labeled T cells, where rafts function in the phosphoregulation of the Src family kinase Lck. Our results show that probe co-clustering was sensitive to depolymerization of actin filaments with latrunculin B (Lat B), inhibition of myosin II with blebbistatin, and treatment with neomycin to sequester phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Cytoskeletal effects on lipid interactions were not restricted to order-preferring label because co-clustering of C(16)-anchored DiO with didodecyl (C(12))-anchored DiI, which favors disordered lipids, was also reduced by Lat B and blebbistatin. Furthermore, conditions that disrupted probe co-clustering resulted in activation of Lck. These data show that the cytoskeleton globally modulates lipid interactions in the plasma membrane, and this property maintains rafts that function in Lck regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1968765546,"α-Glucosidase is in the glycoside hydrolase family 13 (13AG) and 31 (31AG). Only 31AGs can hydrate the D-glucal double bond to form α-2-deoxyglucose. Because 1,5-anhydrofructose (AF), having a 2-OH group, mimics the oxocarbenium ion transition state, AF may be a substrate for α-glucosidases. α-Glucosidase-catalyzed hydration produced α-glucose from AF, which plateaued with time. Combined reaction with α-1,4-glucan lyase and 13AG eliminated the plateau. Aspergillus niger α-glucosidase (31AG), which is stable in organic solvent, produced ethyl α-glucoside from AF in 80% ethanol. The findings indicate that α-glucosidases catalyze trans-addition. This is the first report of α-glucosidase-associated glucose formation from AF, possibly contributing to the salvage pathway of unutilized AF."
https://openalex.org/W2146748536,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) are employed by the innate immune system to detect microbial pathogens based on conserved microbial pathogen molecules. For example, TLR9 is a receptor for CpG-containing microbial DNA, and its activation results in the production of cytokines and type I interferons from human B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, respectively. Both are required for mounting an efficient antibacterial or antiviral immune response. These effects are mimicked by synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Although several hyporesponsive TLR9 variants have been reported, their functional relevance in human primary cells has not been addressed. Here we report a novel TLR9 allele, R892W, which is hyporesponsive to CpG ODN and acts as a dominant-negative in a cellular model system. The R892W variant is characterized by increased MyD88 binding and defective co-localization with CpG ODN. Whereas primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells isolated from a heterozygous R892W carrier responded normally to CpG by interferon-α production, carrier B cells showed impaired IL-6 and IL-10 production. This suggests that heterozygous carriage of a hyporesponsive TLR9 allele is not associated with complete loss of TLR9 function but that TLR9 signals elicited in different cell types are regulated differently in human primary cells."
