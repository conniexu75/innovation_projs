https://openalex.org/W1496968467,"A hepatic microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system is described both in men and rats. It is distinguished from alcohol dehydrogenase by its subcellular localization (cytosol for alcohol dehydrogenase, microsomes for this system), its pH optimum (physiological pH versus pH 10 to 11 for alcohol dehydrogenase), and its cofactor requirements (NADPH versus NAD+ for alcohol dehydrogenase). It also requires oxygen and is inhibited by CO, properties commonly found among microsomal drug-detoxifying enzymes. That catalase is probably not involved was revealed by the partial or complete failure of cyanide, pyrazole, azide, or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to inhibit the NADPH-dependent microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system under conditions which diminished catalase activity. Moreover, a combination of administration in vivo of pyrazole and addition in vitro of azide virtually blocked catalase activity and abolished 95% of a H2O2-dependent microsomal ethanol oxidation, whereas two-thirds of the activity of the NADPH-dependent ethanol oxidation persisted. Ethanol feeding resulted in a striking rise of hepatic NADPH-dependent microsomal ethanol-oxidizing activity, whereas under the same conditions, activities of alcohol dehydrogenase in the cytosol and of microsomal as well as of total hepatic catalase did not increase. Furthermore, blood ethanol clearance was accelerated, which suggests that microsomal ethanol oxidation may play a role in vivo. Pyrazole, which inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase strongly (affecting also other hepatic functions, including microsomal enzymes) markedly reduced but did not block ethanol metabolism in vivo or in liver slices. Even after pyrazole, ethanol clearance rates remained significantly higher in ethanol-pretreated rats. The existence of a microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system, especially its capacity to increase in activity adaptively after ethanol feeding, may explain various effects of ethanol, including proliferation of hepatic smooth endoplasmic reticulum, induction of other hepatic microsomal drug-detoxifying enzymes, and the metabolic tolerance to ethanol which develops in alcoholics."
https://openalex.org/W1597428765,"Abstract The preceding paper in this series presented evidence implicating an unusual phosphorylated compound (MS I) as a possible inhibitor of RNA accumulation during amino acid starvation of stringent strains of Escherichia coli. Here a method is described for isolating MS I from batch cultures of a stringent valyl transfer RNA synthetase mutant. Chemical analyses indicate that MS I is a tetraphosphate of guanosine. However, in contrast to previously described isomers of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppppG and pppGp), MS I is labile in alkali. Charge considerations, enzyme degradation studies, and labilities in acid and alkali lead to a structural assignment for MS I of guanosine 5'-diphosphate or 3'- or 2'-diphosphate (ppGpp)."

https://openalex.org/W2013680238,"Treatment of cultured rat pineal glands with norepinephrine or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate causes a six- to tenfold stimulation of N-acetyltransferase. This enzyme converts serotonin to N-acetylserotonin, the immediate precursor of melatonin. The increased synthesis of melatonin caused by norepinephrine treatment appears to be the result of stimulation of N-acetyltransferase by an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1562613004,"Abstract An improved estimate from Scatchard plots of the number of specific binding sites of the electron transport particle for 14C-piericidin A gives a value of 2 moles of inhibitor bound per mole of calculated NADH dehydrogenase content. The affinity of these two specific binding sites for piericidin A is very similar, since the binding curve is a smooth hyperbola and the Scatchard plot is linear. The two sites may be distinguished, however, by their unequal contribution to the inhibition of NADH oxidation. This is shown by the sigmoidicity of the curves relating inhibition of NADH oxidase, NADH-coenzyme Q reductase, and energy-linked NAD reductase activities to piericidin concentration. The inhibition of NADH oxidase and energy-linked NAD reductase activities but not of NADH-coenzyme Q reductase activity are partially reversed by washing of inhibited particles with bovine serum albumin. Hence both specifically and unspecifically bound piericidin contribute to the inhibition of the first two activities while only specifically bound inhibitor is involved in the block of external coenzyme Q reduction. The titration curve for inhibition of NADH oxidase by rotenone is more complex, apparently because of the contribution of inhibition at unspecific sites. The number of specific binding sites for piericidin may be reduced to near 1 per mole of NADH dehydrogenase by treatment of the electron transport particle with mercurials and by dissociation into the component complexes with bile salts. The results are discussed in terms of the location of the binding and inhibition sites of rotenone and piericidin in the respiratory chain and of the possible participation of NADH dehydrogenase itself and other membrane components in the binding of these inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2037178121,"Rats were given disulfiram, an inhibitor of norepinephrine biosynthesis, to see if norepinephrine is a transmitter for motivation in electrical stimulation of the brain. Animals given the drug paused in bar pressing, appearing asleep or sedated; if replaced on the bar, they always resumed pressing at normal rates. The decrease in bar pressing may result from a direct or indirect effect of the drug on wakefulness rather than on reward."
https://openalex.org/W1675653394,"Abstract Experiments presented here suggest that control of gene expression mediated by juvenile hormone is at the translational level and involves the appearance of a new transfer RNA and its activating enzyme. The evidence is as follows. Topical application of juvenile hormone to 1st day pupae of Tenebrio molitor caused a second pupal molt after 7 days, instead of an adult molt. Ribosomes isolated from pupae on the 1st or 7th (last) day after the larval pupal molt contained messenger RNA for cuticular protein. tRNA and enzyme from hormone-treated animals caused a 10-fold decrease in the ratio of tyrosine to leucine incorporation on ribosomes from both hormone-treated and control animals. Co-chromatography of the tryptic digest of 14C-labeled product synthesized on ribosomes in the presence of tRNA from hormone-treated animals with 3H digest of product synthesized with tRNA from normal 7th day pupae showed different elution profiles for the two isotopes. On purified ribosomes neither chain initiation nor chain termination were observed. The translation of cuticular protein in vitro is affected by the relative amount of tRNA provided from either normal or hormone-treated animals."
https://openalex.org/W1607751721,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate reverses the glucose repression of β-galactosidase synthesis in Escherichia coli induced for enzyme synthesis. In this report, we describe hybridization assays for the measurement of synthesis rates of lac messenger RNA and demonstrate that cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and glucose alter rates of mRNA production in proportion to their effects on β-galactosidase synthesis. Thus we confirm earlier indirect measurements which indicate that control of β-galactosidase synthesis by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and glucose occurs at the level of transcription. In addition, we show that these effects on lac mRNA synthesis are observed in cultures incapable of enzyme synthesis and that glucose does not affect the rate of degradation of lac mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1566190619,"Abstract Relatively stable, highly purified preparations of the anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase aggregate have been obtained from Salmonella tryphimurium. A molecular weight of approximately 285,000 was estimated for the enzyme aggregate by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Anthranilate synthetase activity was completely inhibited by 10 µm tryptophan under appropriate conditions. Inhibition by tryptophan was competitive with chorismate and noncompetitive with glutamine and showed positive cooperativity. Anthranilate synthetase activity was almost completely insensitive to inhibition by tryptophan in the presence of 5.0 mm Mg2+, suggesting distinct substrate and inhibitor sites. Mg2+ was required for enzymatic activity. Inhibition of enzyme activity was obtained by low concentrations of anthranilate, indicating possible regulatory significance. This inhibition was partially overcome by excess Mg2+, suggesting that inhibition was due, at least in part, to interaction of anthranilate with the tryptophan regulatory site. Positive cooperativity obtained for anthranilate was similar to that obtained for tryptophan. In the presence of anthranilate or tryptophan positive cooperativity for chorismate was observed. For the NH3-dependent anthranilate synthetase activity of the anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase aggregate, negative cooperativity for NH3 was indicated by the shapes of plots of initial velocity against (NH4)2SO4 concentration and Lineweaver-Burk plots and the values for related kinetic constants. Initial velocity experiments were consistent with a sequential mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1604557203,"Abstract We have previously reported (Kowal, J., Biochemistry 8, 1821 (1969)) that stimulation of monolayer cultures of mouse adrenal cortex tumors with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for periods of 24 to 72 hours results in increased levels of mitochondrial 11β-hydroxylase activity. This report describes some additional observations on the nature of this effect. Concomitant with the increases in enzyme activity, the levels of cytochrome P-450 and adrenal nonheme iron protein (adrenodoxin) are also increased. On the other hand, ACTH has no effect on the levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain cytochromes. The content of these latter pigments was found to be the same as those reported in bovine adrenal tissue. Long term culture, for periods up to 2 years, did not produce any alteration in the levels of these cytochromes. Cytochrome P-450 is diminished by long term culture, but its content can be restored by passage of the cells into recipient mice. The concentration of cytochrome P-450 in all culture preparations is markedly lower than that reported for normal bovine adrenals. The effect of ACTH on 11β-hydroxylase occurs in the absence of any stimulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Similarly, there is little or no effect of ACTH on the activities of such mitochondrial enzymes as succinic dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, DPN-dependent malate dehydrogenase, adenosine 5'-triphosphatase, and 5'-nucleotidase. Small (l50%) but consistent increases in TPNH- and DPNH-cytochrome c reductases were seen in cultures which responded to ACTH with increases in 11β-hydroxylase which averaged 500%. The data suggest that ACTH can induce the synthesis of specific enzymes in the absence of a generalized effect on growth of the adrenal cell."
https://openalex.org/W1593184996,"Abstract The kinetics and mechanism of action of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase (ATP:d-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) were investigated by several techniques. The initial velocity, product inhibition, isotope exchange patterns, and the result of a pulse labeling experiment are consistent with a mechanism in which ADP (or inosine diphosphate) dissociates from the enzyme before the addition of fructose 6-phosphate, and suggest the formation of phosphoryl enzyme as an intermediate. The enzyme preparation shows ATPase and fructose diphosphatase activities. The ATPase activity is catalyzed by the same protein that catalyzes the phosphofructokinase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2016628530,Lactate dehydrogenases at physiological concentrations are inhibited by high concentrations of pyruvate when the enzyme and the pyruvate are incubated in the presence of oxidized nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide before assay. The inhibition is much more pronounced with the H-type than with the M-type lactate dehydrogenase. These results suggest that substrate inhibition may be operative in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1566566470,"Abstract Anthranilate 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (PR transferase) catalyzes the second specific reaction in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. This protein is aggregated to anthranilate synthetase Component I, which functions in the catalysis of the preceding reaction in Salmonella tryphimurium. Catalytically active preparations of unaggregated PR transferase had a molecular weight of approximately 87,000. The denatured polypeptide chain had a molecular weight of approximately 63,000, suggesting that the unaggregated enzyme is a single polypeptide chain. Aggregated and unaggregated forms of PR transferase activity were inhibited by tryptophan and required saturating concentrations of substrates for maximal inhibition. Chorismate, a substrate for anthranilate synthetase Component I, antagonized the inhibition of aggregated PR transferase activity by tryptophan but not the tryptophan inhibition of the unaggregated form of the enzyme. Indications of negative cooperativity for anthranilate were observed for aggregated PR transferase in the presence of tryptophan. A partial requirement for Mg2+ was shown for the enzymatic activity and tryptophan inhibition of aggregated PR transferase but not for the unaggregated enzyme. The pH profiles for inhibition by tryptophan differed for the two forms of the enzyme although the pH optima for enzyme activity were similar. The Km values for 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate and anthranilate were 6.7 µm and 8.3 µm, respectively, for the aggregated enzyme and they deviated less than 2-fold for the unaggregated PR transferase. Initial velocity patterns for saturation by substrates of aggregated PR transferase activity appeared parallel but a ping-pong mechanism was excluded by the pattern of PPi product inhibition and lack of exchange of 32PPi into 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate. The patterns of product inhibition by PPi differed for the two forms of PR transferase. It was concluded from presently available evidence that the native anthranilate synthetase-PR transferase aggregate has the composition (anthranilate synthetase)2 (PR transferase)2 and that the PR transferase polypeptide chains, similar to the anthranilate synthetase polypeptide chains, contain sites for substrates and end product inhibitor."

Increased surface deformability may be related to the increased permeability to water which also occurs in the apex of the cells in response to the hormone.

https://openalex.org/W2090202957,"Pyrazole (4 millimoles per kilogram or 272 milligrams per kilogram of body weight), given to fasted rats 10 minutes before gavage with ethanol (4 grams per kilogram), completely prevented both the disappearance of ethanol from the blood over a 16-hour period and the ethanol-induced reduction in the ratio of oxidized to reduced hepatic nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide. However, it did not affect the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver after the administration of ethanol. These results indicate that metabolism of ethanol is not required for production of fatty liver by a single, large dose of ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1500619067,"Abstract UDP-d-glucuronic acid labeled with tritium at either C-3, C-4, or C-5 was converted to UDP-d-xylose by UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase (EC 4.1.1.35) from wheat germ and Cryptococcus laurentii. A kinetic isotope effect (Vt/Vh) of 0.32 and 0.42 for the C. laurentii and wheat germ enzymes, respectively, was observed with the C-4-labeled substrate but not with the C-3- or C-5-labeled substrate. Labeled UDP-d-xylose obtained from UDP-d-glucuronic acid-5T was converted with phosphodiesterase to labeled α-d-xylosyl phosphate. The latter was oxidized with periodic acid to yield d-phosphodiglycolic aldehyde from C-1 and C-2 and from C-4 and C-5; hypobromite oxidation of the dialdehyde yielded d-phosphodiglycolic acid. Acid hydrolysis of this compound released unlabeled glyoxalic acid (which originated from C-1 and C-2) and labeled glycolic acid (from C-4 and C-5). The latter was converted to unlabeled glyoxalic acid upon oxidation with glycolic oxidase from spinach, which is specific for that hydrogen atom in glycolic acid sterically equivalent to the α-hydrogen of l-lactic acid. These results show that the configuration at C-5 changed from S to R during the decarboxylation of UDP-d-glucuronic acid. Since UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase requires NAD for activity, these data suggest that the reaction involves oxidation at C-4 to yield UDP-4-keto-d-glucuronic acid, followed by decarboxylation and formation of UDP-4-keto-d-xylose, which is then stereospecifically protonated at C-5 and reduced at C-4 to yield product. The presence of an isotope effect with UDP-d-glucuronic acid-4T means that either the initial oxidation or the final reduction is the rate-limiting step of the reaction; it is not possible to differentiate between these two possibilities on the basis of the available data."
https://openalex.org/W1592420527,"Abstract Previous studies by us have shown that respiring guinea pig liver mitochondria can synthesize P-enolpyruvate from a variety of ordinarily available carbon intermediates. In this study, dinitrophenol was found to reduce substantially P-enolpyruvate formation owing to a deficiency of intramitochondrial ATP, and this reduction could not be relieved by stimultaneous substrate level phosphorylation of GDP. Ketone bodies were utilized to alter the oxidation-reduction state of the intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides. These variations produced large changes in the rates of P-enolpyruvate formation, citrate synthesis, and malate formation. It is concluded that the ultimate source of high energy phosphate for P-enolpyruvate synthesis is the intramitochondrial pool of ATP rather than the substrate level phosphorylation of GDP. In addition, the ratio of ATP to ADP and the kinetic behavior of nucleoside diphosphokinase are found to control the rate and direction of P-enolpyruvate metabolism. A second control factor for P-enolpyruvate synthesis is the oxidation-reduction state of the pyridine nucleotides acting upon the equilibrium between malate and oxalacetate."
https://openalex.org/W1533192414,"Abstract Isolated rat liver mitochondria can incorporate tritiated thymidine into DNA. The addition of deoxyribonucleotides and ATP are necessary. The process of incorporation was found to be inhibited to the extent of 92% by actinomycin D and only 14% by pancreatic deoxyribonuclease. The identification of the labeled product as mitochondrial DNA is supported by its insolubility in acid, resistance to alkali, stability in the presence of RNase, hydrolysis when exposed to DNase, and buoyant density which was coincident with that of unlabeled mitochondrial DNA when determined in a density gradient of cesium chloride. Evidence that the 3H-thymidine was incorporated inside the DNA chain is provided by the parallel increase in acid-solubility of 3H and absorbance at 260 mµ when the acid-insoluble, labeled material was exposed to the action of DNase, phosphodiesterase, and 5'-nucleotidase. The specific activity of the resulting 3H-thymidine was similar at three times during the hydrolysis. Tritiated, phosphorylated derivatives of thymidine were isolated from the acid-soluble fraction of the mitochondria after incubation with 3H-thymidine. Thymidine is apparently converted to TTP via formation of TMP and probably TDP. It was estimated that only 0.4 to 0.5% of the total incorporation of 3H-thymidine could be accounted for by the level of bacterial contamination present in the mitochondrial preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1564498971,"Abstract Several major protein components of the inner membrane were isolated from rat liver mitochondria after an incubation with (14C)leucine. No significant radioactivity was present in either the fraction containing the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase or that containing cytochromes b and c1. A variable amount of radioactive label was associated with a membranous preparation of cytochrome oxidase. After purification of this preparation to yield a highly purified and soluble cytochrome oxidase, however, a loss of radioactivity was observed. No counts were present in the two major bands observed after disc electrophoresis of the purified cytochrome oxidase. Three different methods were used to prepare a protein fraction which, in all three cases, appeared identical on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The two structural protein fractions prepared with the use of dilute acid were not labeled, while the structural protein fraction prepared with bile salts and ammonium sulfate fractionation contained 40% of the total counts of the intact mitochondria. The radioactivity present in the latter structural protein fraction was not, however, present in any of the major bands visualized after disc electrophoresis but was retained with the small amount of material at the origin of the gel. It would thus appear that rat liver mitochondria in vitro do not incorporate amino acids into the major proteins of the structural protein fraction, cytochromes b and c1, cytochrome oxidase, or oligomycin-sensitive ATPase. Radioactive amino acids are incorporated in vitro into a heterogeneous insoluble membranous fraction which contains less than 10% of the total mitochondrial protein. The radioactivity in this fraction is associated to a significant degree only with the two slowest moving bands observed on disc electrophoresis plus the material retained at the origin of the gel. These results suggest that the proteins labeled by rat liver mitochondria in vitro are among the largest and least soluble of those in the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1500913982,"Abstract A regulatory relationship in Bacillus subtilis between histidine and the synthesis of tryptophan exemplifies metabolic interlock, a phenomenon of regulatory interactions exerted between biochemical pathways. The enzymatic basis for the histidine-tryptophan relationship was examined. Histidine activates anthranilate synthetase by increasing the apparent value of Vmax. Hence, histidine antagonizes growth inhibition caused by 5-methyltryptophan, a false feedback inhibitor of anthranilate synthetase, by increasing the velocity of the reaction. Mutant strain F-2, which synthesizes the tryptophan enzymes constitutively, excretes 4 times more tryptophan in minimal medium containing histidine than in unsupplemented minimal medium. This reflects the stimulation of anthranilate synthetase by histidine. In contrast to the situation in F-2, growth of wild type in the presence of histidine does not affect tryptophan excretion. Histidine supplementation indirectly leads to repression of the specific activity of at least one tryptophan enzyme, anthranilate synthetase, presumably as a consequence of the stimulation of tryptophan production. A histidine-excreting mutant, NP 187, exhibits the repressed level of anthranilate synthetase that is characteristic of wild type grown in the presence of histidine. This compensatory mechanism in which histidine plays a dual role, activating anthranilate synthetase activity but also indirectly repressing its biosynthesis, does not operate in F-2. The tryptophan enzymes of F-2 are not repressible and therefore lack the compensatory adjusting mechanism of wild type. Another mutant strain, NP 100, which is derepressed in the synthesis of tryptophan enzymes and which accumulates chorismate because of a block in chorismate mutase, excretes significantly more tryptophan than does F-2. This results from an increased level of chorismate available to anthranilate synthetase. Tryptophan excretion is not further elevated in this strain by histidine. To explain this, we propose that anthranilate-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (PR transferase), not anthranilate synthetase, is the rate-limiting reaction in the tryptophan pathway in B. subtilis. Although tryptophan and histidine do not allosterically influence PR transferase, both amino acids could effectively regulate PR transferase activity by controlling the availability of one of its substrates, anthranilate."

https://openalex.org/W1517832441,"Abstract A method was developed for isolation and purification of radioactive poly ADP-ribose formed by a nuclear enzyme from rat liver. The procedure involved: (a) Pronase digestion and phenol extraction, (b) pancreatic RNase and pancreatic DNase digestion, (c) a first gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column, (d) micrococcal nuclease and spleen phosphodiesterase digestion, and (e) a second gel filtration. The over-all recovery of acid-insoluble radioactivity in the procedure was more than 50% and one-third of the acid-insoluble radioactivity was eluted just after the void volume from the Sephadex G-50 column. Increase of the specific radioactivity (counts per min per OD260) and decrease of the ratio of absorption at 280 mµ to that at 260 mµ were used as criteria of purity of poly ADP-ribose. At the final step of purification, the specific radioactivity of poly ADP-ribose was 80-fold that of the crude extract after Pronase digestion and phenol extraction. The specific activity of purified poly ADP-ribose and that of α-32P-ATP used as a precursor were 1.26 x 105 cpm per OD260 and 0.99 x 105 cpm per OD260, respectively. The A280:A260 ratio of absorption of purified poly ADP-ribose at the final step was 0.26. Purified poly ADP-ribose was completely hydrolyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase and did not yield any nucleotide other than 5'-AMP and PR-AMP on Dowex 1 column chromatography. Experiments with 14C-ATP and NMN with a 32P-labeled whole nuclear preparation showed that poly ADP-ribose after the second gel filtration was devoid of 32P radioactivity. This indicates that poly ADP-ribose at this step was already free from contaminating RNA and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1518427218,"Abstract The effect of phenazine methosulfate (PMS) on lipogenesis of rat epididymal fat pad tissue was studied. PMS at concentrations of 10-6 to 10-5 m stimulates l-lactate oxidation and, most markedly, fatty acid synthesis, without affecting glycerol synthesis. Maximal stimulation of lipogenesis occurs at about 10-5 m. With tissue of rats fed ad libitum, increase in fatty acid ranged from 300 to 1800%. There was no stimulation of synthesis from pyruvate or glucose. Similar effects of PMS on lipogenesis were also seen with mammary gland slices of lactating rats. It is concluded that there is limited capability for the transfer of cytoplasmic reducing equivalents into mitochondria. The effect of PMS is the result of oxidation of excess cytoplasmic reducing equivalents and regeneration of DPN."

https://openalex.org/W1591936417,"Abstract Treatment of yeast RNA with Kethoxal (β-ethoxy-α-keto-butyraldehyde), followed by periodate cleavage, led to the specific introduction of α-ethoxypropionyl groups onto the guanine amino groups of the RNA. The extent of nitrous acid deamination of the guanines of the acylated RNA was reduced by two-thirds when compared to unmodified RNA. The presence of the acyl groups in the nucleic acid was shown by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The acyl nucleotide, N2-α-ethoxypropionylguanosine 5'-phosphate (V) was isolated from a venom phosphodiesterase hydrolysate of the RNA. The use of glyoxal in place of Kethoxal in the above procedure led to a nonspecific formylation of the RNA. A reduction in the extent of deamination by nitrous acid of adenine, cytosine, and guanine was noted. This contrasts with the results obtained with the same conditions at the base or deoxynucleoside level, at which specificity for guanine was observed. Treatment of adenine with glyoxal and periodate in the presence of acid, however, afforded N6-formyladenine (IVa)."

https://openalex.org/W1524225011,"Abstract The common tetranucleotide T-Ψ-C-G was isolated from various Escherichia coli tRNA fractions and examined for the presence of uridine in the first (ribothymidine) or second (pseudouridine) positions. Approximately 13% uridine was found in the first position, and 30% uridine in the second position, of tetranucleotide from unfractionated tRNA, the aminoacylatable and nonaminoacylatable fractions, and from purified valine tRNA. Formylmethionine tRNA1, which possesses the sequence T-Ψ-C-A, was found to contain little if any uridine in these positions. E. coli was grown in the presence of 2-14C-uracil and 5-3H-uracil. Uridine was isolated from the ribothymidine and pseudouridine positions of the tetranucleotide, and the 3H:14C ratios compared with that of uridine from the bulk of the tRNA. No decrease in ratio was observed in either case, which indicates that modifications in the first and second positions are not reversible under our conditions of growth. We conclude that uridine is present in the first and second positions of T-Ψ-C-G because of incomplete modification at these sites. Tritium in the C-5 position of dihydrouridine and 4-thiouridine was also stable."
https://openalex.org/W1960787952,"A study was made of the biosynthesis of brain protein and ribonucleic acid in mice neonatally infected with an enterovirus or malnourished during early life. These two kinds of stresses caused (a) lasting depression of body weight, (b) decreased biosynthesis of protein and ribonucleic acid in various tissues and subcellular fractions of brain. The depression of body weight in neonatally infected or malnourished mice was partially but not completely corrected by combined administration of growth hormone and insulin. Hormone treatment restored to normal (or beyond) the incorporation of 14C-amino acids into total brain and into subcellular fractions of brain (nuclei, mitochondria, and ribosomes) of infected mice. It also restored the incorporation of 3H-orotic acid into mitochondria of infected and malnourished mice. Remarkable qualitative differences in the patterns of DEAE-cellulose chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were observed among brain-soluble proteins of infected, malnourished, and control groups. These results reveal that early disturbances caused by neonatal infection or undernutrition bring about changes in the metabolism and structure of brain protein."
https://openalex.org/W1552106849,"Abstract An investigation was made of the thermal inactivation of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (l-lysine:tRNA ligase (AMP), EC 6.1.1.6) 400-fold purified from bakers' yeast. During heat inactivation at pH 7.2, 45°, the enzyme was stabilized by the presence of l-lysine or by ATP and MgCl2. The concentration of l-lysine giving half-maximal protection of the enzyme was decreased by the presence of ATP and MgCl2, or tRNA and MgCl2. Similarly, polyuridylate and polycytidylate enhanded the protection of the synthetase by l-lysine. No stabilization was given by any polynucleotide in the absence of l-lysine. Adenosine 5'-phosphate, adenosine 2'(3')-monophosphate, adenosine, 5-hydroxy-dl-lysine, and ethylene glycol each gave some stabilization of the enzyme in certain conditions. In a comparative study it was found that partially purified preparations of arginyl-tRNA synthetase (l-arginine:tRNA ligase (AMP), EC 6.1.1) from bakers' yeast showed a different pattern of susceptibility to heat from that shown by the lysine enzyme. Low concentrations of l-arginine were less effective than tRNA and MgCl2 in stabilization of arginyl-tRNA synthetase from thermal inactivation at 50°. The greatest protection was observed in the presence of l-arginine, tRNA, and MgCl2, whereas l-arginine, ATP, and MgCl2 gave lower protection. The characteristics of heat inactivation of the yeast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for lysine and arginine could be interpreted in terms of substrate-induced conformational changes in the enzyme proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1582996684,"Abstract Mitochondria isolated from rat kidney inactivated the soluble gluconeogenic enzyme, d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, when they were incubated with the purified enzyme in the presence of ATP, magnesium, and cysteine. The addition of malate, α-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, succinate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, arachidate, or oleate to the reaction mixture decreased the rate of inactivation of d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, whereas the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol or pentachlorophenol increased the amount of enzyme inactivated. The highest rates of inactivation were obtained when ADP was added in place of ATP. The rate of conversion of the enzyme to an inactive form increased with increasing concentrations of adenine nucleotide and mitochondria. The oxidation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and fatty acids increases the ratio of ATP to ADP inside the mitochondria, and this high ratio appears to inhibit the activity of the regulatory system. The 2,4-dinitrophenol, on the other hand, lowers the ratio of ATP to ADP in the mitochondria by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and thereby increases the activity of the inactivating system. The administration of fatty acids and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates stimulate gluconeogenesis in vivo, and the results of the present study indicate that this effect may be due, in part, to the inhibition of a regulatory enzyme system present in mitochondria which inactivates d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase when an oxidizable substrate is present to maintain a high ratio of ATP to ADP in the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2070887115,"RECENT epidemiological studies reveal a highly significant correlation between infectious mononucleosis and the development of serum antibodies to EB virus (EBV)1,2. It has been suggested that these findings indicate that EBV is probably the causative agent in infectious mononucleosis. An alternative hypothesis is that EBV may merely be a poorly immunogenic, non-aetiological “passenger” virus that is activated non-specifically during the proliferation of lymphoreticular cells in infectious mononucleosis with subsequent appearance of detectable EBV antibodies3–8. The second hypothesis may be tested in part by studying EBV antibody responses that occur in infectious lymphocytosis, a mild communicable paediatric illness of unknown aetiology in which elevated absolute and relative lymphocyte counts develop, usually without specific signs or symptoms9."
https://openalex.org/W1579407598,"Abstract The ability of altered transfer ribonucleic acid to compete with binding of [14C]aminoacyl- and [14C]tRNA was used as an estimate of its capacity to bind to ribosomes. Transfer ribonucleic acid with the terminal 3'-hydroxyl pA, pCpA, and pCpCpA enzymatically removed could bind to 70 S ribosomes with progressively lower efficiency; in contrast, binding to 30 S subunits was unimpaired. Transfer ribonucleic acid with the entire CCA terminus removed could bind to 70 S ribosomes about half as well as intact tRNA. Periodate oxidation reduced the binding of tRNA to 70 S ribosomes by 80%. Periodate, therefore, not only oxidizes the terminal vicinal hydroxyl groups of tRNA, but also 1 internal residue or more of certain tRNA species."
