https://openalex.org/W1995841839,"The application of transition-state theory to enzymatic catalysis provides an approach to understanding enzymatic catalysis in terms of the factors that determine the strength of binding of ligands to proteins. The prediction that the transition state should bind to the enzyme much more tightly than the substrate is supported by the experimental results with stable analogs of transition states. Transition-state analogs have great potential for use in understanding enzymatic catalysis and in inhibiting enzymes. Because of their potency and specificity as enzyme inhibitors, some of them may become very useful chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2164735661,"Glutathione epoxide transferase has been isolated in homogeneous form from the livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The enzyme is active in the conjugation of glutathione with a large number of compounds bearing an ethylene oxide ring in the terminal portion of an alkyl chain. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 40,000 and is composed of 2 subunits. Several proteins which catalyze the same reaction are demonstrated. Some of these forms, present in the purified enzyme, are interconvertible by freezing and by treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate."
https://openalex.org/W2022104366,"Chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were successfully encapsulated within lipid spherules (that is, liposomes). Encapsutlated [(14)C]EDTA, given intravenously to mice, was retained longer in tissues that nonencapsulated [(14)C]EDTA. Encapsulated DTPA, given to mice 3 days after pluttonium injection, removed an additional fraction of plutonium in the liver, presumably intracellular, not available to nonencapslulated DTPA. It also further increased urinary excretion of plutonium. Introduction of chelating agents into cells by liposomal encapsulation is a promising new approach to the treatment of metal poisoning"
https://openalex.org/W1966900368,Concentrations of polychlorobiphenyls (PCB's) have been measured at the surface and at various depths in the water of the North Atlantic Ocean between 26 degrees N and 63 degrees N. The concentrations average about 20 parts per trillion and amount to an estimated 2 x 10(4) metric tons of PCB's in the upper 200 meters of water. The average concentrations of PCB's in the surface water of the Sargasso Sea are lower than those in the northern North Atlantic.
https://openalex.org/W1601499209,"Abstract Immunochemical techniques have been utilized to study the content, synthesis, and degradation of the fatty acid synthetase in liver and brain during development and in various nutritional states. The distinctive changes in synthetase activity during development of both tissues are related entirely to changes in content of enzyme. During fasting and fat-free feeding, in contrast to the lack of change in synthetase activity of brain, there are dramatic alterations in hepatic activity. These changes are related entirely to changes in content of enzyme in liver. During development of brain the rate of synthesis of the enzyme decreases. In developing liver, when synthetase activity rises at the time of weaning, there is a marked acceleration of synthesis of enzyme. During fasting, when hepatic synthetase concentration falls drastically, there is a considerable reduction in synthesis of enzyme, and when animals are refed a fat-free diet, a remarkable increase in enzyme synthesis occurs, confirming earlier reports. The rate of fatty acid synthetase degradation in brain of adult animals differs considerably from that in liver; the half-lives are 6.4 and 2.8 days, respectively. In young suckling animals the rate of degradation of the enzyme in brain is markedly accelerated (t1/2 = 1.9 days), whereas in liver there is little change (t1/2 = 2.3 days). The most profound change in degradation of synthetase in liver occurs during fasting when the t1/2 decreases to 18 hours. No changes were observed in degradation in brain during fasting or fat-free feeding. Rate constants for synthesis and degradation of fatty acid synthetase in liver and brain during development and in the various nutritional states were derived; these quantitatively accounted for the differences in content of the enzyme in these tissues. In developing liver the dramatic elevation in synthetase content apparent after weaning is associated with an acceleration of enzyme synthesis but no change in rate of enzyme degradation. The changes in enzyme content during development of brain are accompanied by alterations in the rates of synthesis and degradation of fatty acid synthetase. Both processes are more rapid in the brain of the young suckling animal than in the mature animal. These observations represent the first direct measurements of rates of synthesis and degradation of an enzyme in mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1499651267,"Abstract The cell wall peptidoglycan of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 63 AM Gasser has been shown to turn over rapidly during balanced exponential growth and recovery from amino acid deprivation. In contrast, turnover of either pulse-labeled or extensively labeled peptidoglycan of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 was not detected by the same method and experimental conditions. In S. faecalis, peptidoglycan turnover could not be induced either by brief exposure of the cells to a low concentration of lysozyme or by growth in the presence of a low concentration of penicillin. The peptidoglycan turnover rate of rapidly growing cultures of L. acidophilus was equivalent to a loss of about one third of their peptidoglycan per generation. This was not due to cellular lysis since turnover of protein was below detectable levels. Comparably rapid peptidoglycan turnover rates per generation were observed in slowly growing cultures (30% lost per generation) and in a mutant which autolyzed at about one fifth the rate of the wild type (25% lost per generation). In cultures labeled for 6 or more generations, turnover was preceded by a lag equivalent to 0.8 to 2 generation times. Turnover of pulses of less than 0.2 generations was not observed for periods exceeding 2 generations. These last two results cannot be interpreted as indicating that newly made wall is immune to turnover since in both cases nonsynchronized cultures were used, and the short pulses would eventually age as the culture grew. The addition of chloramphenicol or deprivation of valine completely prevented peptidoglycan turnover. The absence of detectable peptidoglycan turnover in S. faecalis (and other species) suggests that turnover is not an essential feature of cell wall growth. On the other hand, in L. acidophilus, peptidoglycan turnover appears to be closely associated with that portion of wall synthesis related to wall (and surface) enlargement and not to the portion related to wall thickening."

The enzyme was present in the supernatant solution obtained after homogenization of rabbit bone marrow in the presence of 0.6% Triton X-100 and centrifugation at 100,000 x g. The enzyme was precipitated from the supernatant solution at 0 to 45% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The 14C product of the reaction was isolated, purified, and analyzed for its constituents. It inhibited the hemagglutination reaction of human B-type cells and rabbit erythrocytes against human anti-B serum. The terminal [14C]galactose was cleaved 85% by the action of fig α-galactosidase. The Km values were 1.67 x 10-3 m and 1.43 x 10-4 m for the tetraglycosylceramide (LacTet-cer) and UDP-galactose, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1511810439,"Abstract A β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity has been detected in 11-day-old embryonic chicken brain which catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine from UDP-N-acetyl[14C]galactosamine to a triglycosylceramide (or, GloboTri-cer; O-α-galactosyl(1→4)-O-β-galactosyl(1→4)-O- β-glucosyl(1→1)-ceramide) to form the globoside-type tetraglycosylceramide, GalNAc → Gal → Gal → Glc → ceramide. The enzyme is membrane bound and requires sodium taurocholate and Mn2+ for optimal activity. The optimum pH value for the incorporation of N-acetylgalactosamine was 6.5 in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer. The Km values were 1.7 x 10-3 m and 2.0 x 10-4 m for GloboTri-cer and UDP-GalNAc, respectively. The radioactive product of the reaction was isolated, purified, and characterized as globoside-type tetraglycosylceramide. The terminal [14C]GalNAc was cleaved 78% by the action of jack bean β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The 14C product formed a precipitin line with anti-globoside serum, and the line fused with that of globoside derived from porcine heart or erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1547434179,"Abstract Rat liver glycogen synthetase D is strongly inactivated by a variety of natural disulfides but not by the corresponding sulfhydryl compounds. Oxidized glutathione was used as a model compound in studies on the mechanism of inactivation. Inactivation by oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a time- and concentration-dependent process and results in the formation of an inactive, stable enzyme species. Inactivated enzyme can be reactivated by incubation in the presence of various sulfhydryl compounds including glutathione (GSH). The extent of inactivation and reactivation depends upon the presence of glucose-6-P during the two processes. Binding studies with [35S]GSSG revealed simultaneous incorporation of 35S into glycogen synthetase D and loss of enzyme activity. Reactivation with GSH was accompanied by the release of 35S label from the enzyme. Inactivation of glycogen synthetase is the result of the formation of mixed disulfides between GSSG and the sulfhydryl group(s) of glycogen synthetase D."
https://openalex.org/W1562424624,"Abstract The methylated bases and nucleosides of transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA isolated from a number of eukaryote and prokaryote organisms were compared. Of the many different types of methylated bases and nucleosides found, only certain ones ever appeared in each type of methylated RNA; thus, the methylation of tRNA and both types of rRNA was a highly specific process. In addition, in all cells tested the pattern of methylation for tRNA and each rRNA differed markedly from each other. Eukaryote tRNA, whether isolated from yeast, amoeba, chicken, mouse, monkey, or human cells, always exhibited a strikingly similar pattern of methylation. In addition, a second and third pattern of methylation were found to be common to the lower and higher molecular weight species of ribosomal RNA, respectively, in the eukaryote cells tested. Each of these three eukaryote RNA species contained at least one characteristic methylated base not found (or found only in trace amounts) in any of the others. These were N2-dimethylguanine and 1-methylhypoxanthine in tRNA, N2-dimethyladenine in 18 S RNA (16 S in yeast), and 3-methyl-uracil in 28 S RNA (25 S in yeast). The patterns of methylation of prokaryote tRNA and rRNA were different from those of their eukaryote RNA counterparts. Two gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli B and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, had identical methylation patterns for tRNA, 16 S RNA, and 23 S RNA, respectively. In addition, each of the ribosomal RNA species had a characteristic methylated base not found in the other. These were N6-dimethyladenine in 16 S RNA, and N6-methyladenine in 23 S RNA. The pattern of methylation of tRNA from gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and mycoplasma differed only slightly from each other. It was concluded that great differences exist in the methylation patterns of the various RNA species in a given cell while great similarities exist in the methylation patterns of each RNA species throughout a wide range of eukaryote or prokaryote cells."

https://openalex.org/W1503959962,"The effects of acyl-CoA derivatives (C8 to C20) on the activity of the fatty acid synthetases from yeast and Corynebacterium diphtheriae have been examined. Both enzyme systems are inhibited by the longer chain acyl thioesters (C16 to C20) and protected against this inhibition by bovine serum albumin (BSA). Identical relief from acyl-CoA inhibition is provided by the 6-O-methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharide (MGLP), from Mycobacterium phlei. It is shown that MGLP forms a stable complex with palmityl-CoA. This interaction accounts for the BSA-like effects of the polysaccharide. BSA and MGLP have two further effects on the fatty acid synthetases under study, also attributable to complex formation with palmityl-CoA. They stimulate the rate of over-all synthesis from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, and they cause a shift of the fatty acid pattern towards products of shorter chain length. The observed effects are discussed in terms of the regulation of fatty acid synthesis both with respect to rate and product composition. It is concluded that in the two microbial enzyme systems negative feedback inhibition and its relief are important control mechanisms."

A series of relatively small peptides soluble in aqueous solutions obtained by chymotryptic and tryptic digestion of the enzyme, large peptides containing only COOH-terminal lysine or arginine as well as those resulting from more limited cleavage of the enzyme, and cyanogen bromide cleavage products served as the materials for deriving the primary structure."

https://openalex.org/W1487137179,"Abstract d-(-)-β-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, an enzyme which is bound to the inner membrane of mitochondria has been purified approximately 80-fold from beef heart mitochondria. The enzyme is released by treatment with phospholipase A and then the addition of 0.4m LiBr. The stability of the enzyme is strongly enhanced by lowering the pH to 6.5 and by the addition of dithiothreitol and EDTA. The purification is achieved without the use of added detergents and the product is a water-soluble apodehydrogenase which contains neither detergent nor significant amounts of phospholipid. The purified enzyme preparation at each stage after release from the membrane has an absolute and specific requirement for phospholipid containing lecithin. Mitochondrial phospholipids, which contain approximately 40% lecithin, are more effective than purified lecithin in reactivating the soluble enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1984192103,"NODAMURA virus, which was originally isolated from mosquitoes from Nodamura, near Tokyo, multiplies in several insect and tick species, apparently without causing symptoms. It is transmissible to suckling mice by infected Aedes aegypti, and is fatal1. In Japan young pigs have been found with antibodies to the Nodamura virus, which has been classified as an unusual kind of arbovirus because it is resistant to ether2. This property, together wjth other features of the virus particles3 are reminiscent of acute bee-paralysis virus4 and we therefore examined its effect on the honey-bee, Apis mellifera. We also tested its pathogenicity for the wax moth, Galleria mellonella."
https://openalex.org/W1481325541,"Abstract A procedure, without prior fractionation of the subcellular components, has been developed for the simultaneous isolation of supernatant and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) from chicken heart or liver tissue homogenates. The procedure includes initial heat and ammonium sulfate fractionation. The two enzymes can then be separated by chromatography in hydroxylapatite. The supernatant enzyme elutes with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, and the mitochondrial enzyme with 0.3 m of the same buffer. The separated fractions can be further purified by ion exchange chromatography in carboxymethyl-Sephadex. The purified enzymes (isoenzymes) differ in amino acid composition and electrophoretic mobility. At pH 9.3 the supernatant enzyme is anionic and the mitochondrial is cationic. Antibodies against one isoenzyme fail to cross-react with the other protein in either Ouchterlony-type diffusion experiments or in the highly sensitive complement fixation test. Both enzymes contain pyridoxal phosphate as their prosthetic group at the active site which can be utilized to determine the substrate interactions with this site. The values for the substrate dissociation constants are: supernatant isoenzyme aspartate, 2 mm; oxalacetate, 35 µm; glutamate, 5 mm; α-ketoglutarate, 0.3 mm; mitochondrial isoenzyme aspartate, 0.6 mm; oxalacetate, 15 µm; glutamate, 11 mm; α-ketoglutarate, 1.2 mm. In addition, the values for the abortive complexes pyridoxal enzyme-keto acid are: oxalacetate, 62 µm, and α-ketoglutarate, 25 µm, for the supernatant enzyme, and oxalacetate, 50 µm, and α-ketoglutarate, 162 µm, for the mitochondrial transaminase. The absorption spectra of active site-bound pyridoxal phosphate at pH 8 differ in both isozymes, 355 nm maximal in the mitochondrial and 365 nm in the supernatant enzyme. The isozymes are present in chicken liver and heart. Amino acid composition, spectral properties, electrophoretic migration, and immunological reactivity, established identity among any given isozyme of the same cytological localization independent of tissue origin. Both the supernatant and mitochondrial aspartate transaminases contain multiple forms which are electrophoretically detectable. All the subforms possess catalytic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1544442578,"Abstract A study was carried out on some of the properties of the two smallest serine endopeptidases from Pronase which had previously been purified to homogeneity. Each enzyme is homologous with bovine chymotrypsin and has isoleucine as the NH2-terminal residue. The smaller enzyme is free of lysine, whereas the larger enzyme contains only 1 lysine residue. Reaction of the larger enzyme with acetic anhydride yielded a homogeneous, active, and stable derivative as indicated by ion exchange chromatography and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reaction of the smaller enzyme with acetic anhydride yielded two chromatographic components, of which only the larger demonstrated activity against Nα-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester. This active component autolyzes during acrylamide gel electrophoresis but appears as a single band by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The excellent yields of these protein derivatives were only achieved by modifying the past standard techniques of acetylation. In each reaction mixture glycerol was included at a concentration of 20% by volume. As a result only small amounts of native proteins were required to prepare the derivatives. Analysis of each enzyme revealed complete acetylation of the NH2-terminal isoleucine residue. Acetylation resulted in only modest changes in the Michaelis constant and maximal velocity of each enzyme with Nα-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester as substrate. Despite the earlier observation that only the larger enzyme demonstrated marked stability in 6 m guanidinium chloride there was no difference in the heat stabilities of the two enzymes. Neither showed an effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) on activity at 37° even after several hours; however, at temperatures above 45° each enzyme underwent marked loss of activity in the presence of EDTA, whereas activity was conserved up to 60° in the absence of chelating agent. Metal-free enzyme was prepared in each case by gel filtration at a low pH in the absence of metals. These metal-free proteins demonstrated the same temperature stabilities as the EDTA-treated native enzymes. Of the many cations tested, Ca2+ was specific in each case in restoring the stability at higher temperatures to the metal-free enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1533221771,"Abstract Rabbit antisera were produced against purified human and baboon lysozymes and tested by quantitative microcomplement fixation for cross-reactivity with the lysozymes present in the milks of 19 primate species. No antigenic difference was found between the lysozymes of man and chimpanzee and almost none between those of man and orangutan. Major antigenic differences were detected between human lysozyme and all other lysozymes tested, including gorilla, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and prosimians. Small or no antigenic differences were found between baboon lysozyme and other Old World monkey lysozymes, whereas significant differences were found between the baboon enzyme and those of the remaining primate species. Electrophoretic experiments revealed that most primate lysozymes are less positively charged than human lysozyme. The calibration established earlier between degree of immunological difference and degree of amino acid sequence difference among bird lysozymes allows estimation of the approximate number of sequence differences between human and baboon lysozymes and the lysozymes of the other species tested. Although the results do not permit construction of an accurate phylogenetic tree for primates, they do permit approximate estimation of the average rate of lysozyme evolution in primates. The average time required for a 1% sequence difference to accumulate between the lysozymes of two primate lineages may be roughly 2 million years. Primate lysozymes, therefore, appear to have evolved faster than most other primate proteins studied and about 3 times as fast as bird lysozymes."

https://openalex.org/W1516894118,"Abstract The pentapeptide moiety of uridine diphosphate acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide, a precursor of the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls, is synthesized in a reaction sequence involving five enzymes. The amount and specificity of these enzymes have been studied in 10 microorganisms, five of which contain l-lysine as the third amino acid in the peptide sequence, and five of which contain instead mesodiaminopimelic acid. The former five contain an l-lysine-adding enzyme specific for that amino acid, and the latter five contain a similarly specific meso-diaminopimelic acid-adding enzyme. The fifth enzyme which catalyzes the addition of d-alanyl-d-alanine to UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide is less specific for the occurrence of l-lysine or meso-diaminopimelic acid in the tripeptide moiety. The rate-limiting catalyst in the sequence may be the first enzyme, the l-alanine-adding enzyme. In addition, the analyses of some uridine nucleotides obtained from several diaminopimelic acid-containing organisms are presented."

Clinical signs were remarkably similar to those observed in patients naturally affected with kuru and in sub-human primates in which the disease has been experimentally induced by inoculation of the kuru virus. Histopathological examination of the brain of this rhesus monkey has confirmed this first successful transmission of kuru to an old-world monkey.

https://openalex.org/W1545601358,"Abstract A second protein, the stimulator, has been identified as a necessary component for the in vitro incorporation of d-alanine into membrane teichoic acid of Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469). The incorporation activity is dependent on membrane fragments, ATP, d-alanine:membrane acceptor ligase (Reusch, V. M., Jr., and Neuhaus, F. C. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6136), and the stimulator. The stimulator and the d-alanine:membrane acceptor ligase differ significantly with respect to exclusion volume on Sephadex G-100, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, heat lability, and sensitivity to p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. It is proposed that the stimulator is the d-alanine-activating enzyme previously described by Baddiley and Neuhaus ((1960) Biochem. J. 75, 579). The stimulator and the d-alanine-activating enzyme co-elute on Sephadex G-100 and on DEAE-cellulose at pH 6.0 and pH 7.8. They are inactivated to the same extent by incubation at 45° and by incubation in the presence of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Under assay conditions in which the stimulator concentration is limiting with respect to ligase, the d-alanine incorporation system has a high specificity for ATP, shows product inhibition by pyrophosphate, and has a high Km for d-alanine. Each of these properties is also characteristic of the d-alanine-activation enzyme. A two-stage reaction sequence utilizing the activating enzyme and the ligase for the incorporation of d-alanine into membrane teichoic acid is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1556937069,"Abstract A monocarboxamidomethyl derivative of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase B was purified by affinity chromatography. The modified enzyme possesses 3% of the CO2-hydrating activity and 30% of the esterase activity of the native enzyme. The esterase activity is inhibited by the usual carbonic anhydrase inhibitors although the Ki values are, in general, higher than for native enzyme. The pH dependence of esterase activity for modified enzyme has a pK of 8.3 compared to 7.3 for native enzyme. Zinc dissociates so slowly from modified enzyme that it would take about 3 months to remove 90% of the metal. After half of the metal was removed from the enzyme, pure apoenzyme was separated by affinity chromatography. Carboxamidomethyl Co2+-enzyme was prepared from apoenzyme and its visible spectrum was determined at several pH values. The general shapes of the spectra were similar to those for native Co2+-enzyme. However, the major pH-dependent transition has a pK of 8.3 compared to 7.3 for native enzyme. In addition, a secondary pH-dependent transition which occurs in native enzyme below pH 7 is absent in the modified enzyme, and a transition with a pK of 10.8 occurs in modified enzyme but is absent in native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1587632362,"Abstract The tryptophan synthetase β2 component of Bacillus subtilis has been purified to homogeneity using conventional techniques carried out in the presence of buffers containing 15% glycerol (v/v). Ultracentrifugal analysis of holo-β2 component indicates that it has a molecular weight of 82,000. The β chain molecular weight was estimated to be 41,000 by ultracentrifugal analysis in the presence of 5 m guanidine hydrochloride plus thiols and by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The β chain molecular weight was also determined by Sephadex G-100 chromatography to be 41,800 using relatively mild conditions to dissociate the β2 subunit, namely 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 30% glycerol (v/v) and 0.01 m glutamine. The purified β2 subunit retains a requirement for glycerol to maintain full activity. Furthermore, contrary to earlier reports using partially purified enzyme, the β2 subunit requires the tryptophan synthetase α subunit to attain maximal activity. The B. subtilis β2 subunit appears unique among the bacterial enzymes purified thus far for its low specific activity in the reaction involving the conversion of indole plus l-serine to l-tryptophan. It is however possible for the α subunits from Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida to complement the β2 subunit of B. subtilis in this latter reaction and produce a level of activity equal to 30% of the homologous complementation. The B. subtilis β2 component also shares antigenic determinants with the E. coli and P. putida β2 components as well as with the tryptophan synthetase of the eucaryote, Neurospora crassa."
https://openalex.org/W2010789121,"ALTHOUGH the parasitology of malaria has been extensively studied1, biochemical aspects of the relationships between the intra-erythrocytic parasite and its host erythrocyte are poorly understood. The main source of metabolic energy for the erythrocytic stages of the parasite is the breakdown of glucose with formation of lactic acid2–6, which it may carry out independently of the red cell2. Catabolism of glucose by metabolic pathways other than glycolysis may occur, although the overall pattern of glucose breakdown appears to vary with the species of malaria parasite7. The ability of the parasite, as distinct from the erythrocyte, to carry out the reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway is unresolved8–11,19."
https://openalex.org/W1580003729,"Abstract Rat liver glycogen synthetase is strongly stimulated by cellular carboxylic acids which are intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Activation of glycogen synthetase by the carboxylic acids may coordinate hepatic glycogen deposition with the functional status of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. At physiological concentrations of the carboxylic acids, the I form is preferentially stimulated. Whereas citrate, isocitrate, succinate, etc., stimulate total glycogen synthetase activity about 25 to 50%, these compounds stimulate the I activity 6- to 8-fold. Citrate was used as a model compound in studies of the mechanism of glycogen synthetase activation. Stimulation of the enzyme is the result of modification of the glucose-6-P binding site which accompanies a conformational change mediated by citrate."
https://openalex.org/W2010688761,"SEVERAL syngens or breeding groups of Paramecium aurelia contain endosymbionts which may result in the development of the killer trait1. The symbionts are of different morphological types and it has been suggested that these are non-randomly distributed between syngens2. Experiments involving crosses between paramecia with and without symbionts showed that each endosymbiont required a specific nuclear gene for its maintenance. A single gene controlled the presence or absence of endosymbionts as shown by segregation in the F2 generation. The pattern of loss of symbionts in some of those F2 clones varies, generally extending over a number of asexual fissions which for different endosymbionts can be from two to over sixty. Infection experiments also demonstrate the requirement for a specific gene. Infection of endosymbionts from homogenates or purified preparations occurs via the medium but only into particular cells possessing a specific gene1,3. Finally, some endosymbionts growing in vitro retain their infectivity into certain paramecia (author's laboratory)."
https://openalex.org/W1487985192,"Abstract An enzyme from Bacillus subtilis which catalyzes the hydrolysis of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide to UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide and dalanyl-d-alanine has been purified. Heat-stable cofactors required for the hydrolysis were identified as Co++, ADP, and inorganic phosphate. The purified enzyme also catalyzes the ATP- and Mg++-dependent addition of d-alanyl-d-alanine to UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide, and the two activities were purified together. No synthesis of ATP was observed during hydrolysis in the presence of Co++, ADP, and Pi. The hydrolysis does not appear to be a simple reversal of synthesis. Studies on the mechanism of the hydrolysis are reported. Two other enzymes involved in the synthesis of peptide bonds in UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide catalyzed hydrolytic reactions under similar conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1517210480,"Abstract Native lysine monooxygenase catalyzes the oxygenative decarboxylation of lysine or arginine and produces the corresponding acid amide. When the enzyme was pretreated with various sulfhydryl blocking reagents, the oxygenation of lysine or arginine was greatly reduced. Instead, the modified enzyme catalyzed the oxidative deamination of these amino acids producing α-keto acids and hydrogen peroxide in almost stoichiometric amounts. For example, when the enzyme was preincubated with 8 moles of p-chloromercuribenzoate per mole of enzyme protein, approximately 60% of the reaction products from lysine were α-keto-e-aminocaproate and the remainder was δ-amino-n-valeramide. With arginine approximately 75% of the reaction products were identified as α-keto-δ-guanidinovalerate. Upon the addition of dithiothreitol to the p-chloromercuribenzoate-treated enzyme, the oxidase activity disappeared and 81 to 96% of the original oxygenase activity was restored. These results indicate the reversible conversion of an oxygenase to an oxidase by the modification of sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme protein."
https://openalex.org/W1573956362,"Abstract In vitro activation of adipose tissue glycogen synthetase caused a change in kinetic properties of the enzyme. The nonactivated enzyme had a Km for UDP-glucose of 2 mm when measured without glucose-6-P. The Km decreased to 0.7 mm in the presence of 2 mm glucose-6-P. The Km for UDP-glucose of the activated enzyme was 0.8 mm. Glucose-6-P affected both the Km for UDP-glucose and the Vmax of the nonactivated enzyme, but had no effect after activation. In the absence of glucose-6-P the nonactivated enzyme was inhibited by F-, SO42-, Pi, and EDTA, whereas it was activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+. These effects were attenuated in the presence of glucose-6-P or following activation of the enzyme. ATP inhibited the activity of both forms of the enzyme. In the presence of glucose-6-P or after activation the inhibition was competitive with UDP-glucose. Enzyme activity measured with physiological concentrations of UDP-glucose, glucose-6-P, ATP, and Pi increased upon activation from 1 to 10 nmoles per min x mg of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1619794196,"Human carbonic anhydrase C and bovine carbonic anhydrase B were modified with the affinity label, bromoacetazolamide, and human carbonic anhydrase B with N-bromoacetylacetazolamide. Tryptic peptides from the modified enzymes, containing alkylated histidines, have been isolated by ion exchange and two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis-paper chromatography. The partial amino acid sequence of the peptide from alkylated bovine enzyme B has been found to be Met-Val-Asn-Asn-Gly-His-Ser-Phe-Asn-Val-Glu-Tyr-Asx-Asx(Glx,Asx,Ser)Lys-. In all probability the histidine in this sequence that reacted is His-64. Comparison of the amino acid composition of the tryptic peptides from the two human isoenzymes with the proposed sequences of these enzymes has made it possible to identify histidine-64 in human enzyme C as that reacting with bromoacetazolamide and histidine-67 in human enzyme B as that reacting with N-bromoacetylacetazolamide."
