https://openalex.org/W2135955237,"Since the 1940s it has been proposed that landscape dissection into distinct valleys is limited by a threshold of channelization that sets a finite scale to the landscape. This threshold is equal to the hillslope length that is just shorter than that necessary to support a channel head. A field study supports this hypothesis by showing that an empirically defined topographic threshold associated with channel head locations also defines the border between essentially smooth, undissected hillslopes and the valley bottoms to which they drain. This finding contradicts assertions that landscapes are scale-independent and suggests that landscape response to changes in climate or land use depends on the corresponding changes in the threshold of channelization."

The parent C60 framework is recognizable in C60Br24, but sp3 carbons at sites of bromination distort the surface, affecting conformations of all of the hexagonal and pentagonal rings. Twenty-four bromine atoms envelop the carbon core, shielding the 18 remaining double bonds from addition. At 150° to 200°C there is effectively quantitative reversion of C60Br24 to C60 and Br2."
https://openalex.org/W1980180503,"X-ray diffraction and diamond anvil techniques were used to measure the isothermal compressibility of K(3)C(60) and Rb(3)C(60), the superconducting, binary alkali-metal intercalation compounds of solid buckminsterfullerene. These results, combined with the pressure dependence of the superconducting onset temperature T(c) measured by other groups, establish a universal first-order relation between T(c) and the lattice parameter a over a broad range, between 13.9 and 14.5 angstroms. A small secondorder intercalate-specific effect was observed that appears to rule out the participation of intercalate-fullerene optic modes in the pairing interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2033495350,"Computer simulations of hydrocarbon and related molecules using empirical force fields have become important tools for studying a number of biological and related processes at the atomic scale. Traditional force fields, however, cannot be used to simulate dynamic chemical reactivity that involves changes in atomic hybridization. Application of a many-body potential function allows such reactivity to occur in a computer simulation. Simulations of the reaction of small hydrocarbon molecules adsorbed on a reconstructed diamond {001}(2x1) surface suggest that these hydrocarbons are highly reactive species and that initial stages of diamond growth proceed through a dimer-opening mechanism. Rates estimated from transition state theory of two interconversions between states where the dimer is open and closed are given."
https://openalex.org/W2095317708,"Fossil bird skeletons discovered in Lower Cretaceous lake deposits in China shed new light on the early evolution of avian flight and perching. The 135 million-year-old sparrow-sized skeletons represent a new avian, Sinornis santensis, n. gen. n. sp., that preserves striking primitive features such as a flexible manus with unguals, a footed pubis, and stomach ribs (gastralia). In contrast to Archaeoperyx, however, Sinornis exhibits advanced features such as a broad sternum, wing-folding mechanism, pygostyle, and large fully reversed hallux. Modern avian flight function and perching capability, therefore, must have evolved in small-bodied birds in inland habitats not long after Archaeopteryx."
https://openalex.org/W2050528590,"Replication and mutation are necessary elements of evolution, and some properties of self-replicating molecules (replicators) can be explored with synthetic structures. Selection and evolution at the molecular level require systems capable of competition and inheritable change. These phenomena have now been observed with synthetic molecules. Two such molecules were prepared having sufficient structural similarity that they catalyzed each other's formation as well as their own. One of the replicators bears a photochemically active function that is cleaved on irradiation. The resulting species is more effective at replication than the original and rapidly takes over the system's resources."
https://openalex.org/W2089201633,"Polycrystalline diamond films synthesized by microwave-assisted chemical vapor deposition (MACVD) were examined with transient photoconductivity, and two fundamental electrical transport properties, the carrier mobility and lifetime, were measured. The highest mobility measured is 50 centimeters squared per volt per second at low initial carrier densities (<10(15) per cubic centimeter). Electron-hole scattering causes the carrier mobility to decrease at higher carrier densities. Although not measured directly, the carrier lifetime was inferred to be 40 picoseconds. The average drift length of the carriers is smaller than the average grain size and appears to be limited by defects within the grains. The carrier mobility in the MACVD films is higher than values measured in lower quality dc-plasma films but is much smaller than that of single-crystal natural diamond."

This finding helps in solving several problems of long standing in the fields of soil chemistry, soil formation, and geochemical weathering."
https://openalex.org/W2022296933,"Although no PCBs have been manufactured in the US and other industrialized countries for years, the chemicals are still very much with us; they are extremely long-lived. And only about 1% of the total PCBs produced have reached the oceans so far. PCBs and related organohalogens that have entered the oceans are making their way through the food chain into marine animals. As a result the animals are becoming more prone to a variety of ailments, including reproductive abnormalities and immune suppression that makes them more susceptible to disease. Unless something is done to prevent further contamination by organohalogens such as PCB, many species of ocean mammals might become extinct and some species of fish inedible. Several scientists officially launched a campaign to solicit funds for a 3-year research project aimed at determining just how serious PCB and other organohalogen problems are in the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2062144854,"Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other manmade chemicals have already caused a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. CFCs have also been clearly implicated in limited ozone losses - but as yet no hole - over the Arctic. And ozone has been disappearing over the latitudes of the US for more than a decade. Researchers speculate that a full-blown ozone hole will appear over the Arctic, perhaps within the next month that might well slide south to affect densely populated areas of Europe. And expect ozone losses in other parts of the world to be more rapid than had been predicted, though researchers can't say just where. These grim forecasts reflect a newly proven systemic vulnerability in the upper atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2023830538,"Specially processed Voyager 2 images of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, reveal three large quasi-circular features ranging in diameter from 280 to 935 kilometers within Triton's equatorial region. The largest of these features contains a central, irregularly shaped area of comparatively low albedo about 380 kilometers in diameter, surrounded by crudely concentric annuli of higher albedo materials. None of the features exhibit significant topographic expression, and all appear to be primarily albedo markings. The features are located within a broad equatorial band of anomalously transparent frost that renders them nearly invisible at the large phase angles (alpha > 90 degrees ) at which Voyager obtained its highest resolution coverage of Triton. The features can be discerned at smaller phase angles (alpha = 66 degrees ) at which the frost only partially masks underlying albedo contrasts. The origin of the features is uncertain but may have involved regional cryovolcanic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2064014722,"Although measurement of the solar neutrino flux via the 7Li(ve,e–)7Be reaction was proposed many years ago, no experiment has been implemented since it has been difficult to identify a sensitive 7Be detection technique. Here it is proposed that the 7Be atom be incorporated into a volatile molecule, placed in a buffer-gas-filled cell, and then extracted by photodissociation; after excitation by a tunable laser, bursts of photons would be detected. The absorption spectrum of the molecular candidate diethylberyllium has been measured between 186 and 270 nanometers in a spectrophotometer to determine the required photodissociation laser wavelength and intensity."

The effect resembles that for intermittent irradiation and makes it possible to estimate the mean lifetime of the free radical chain."
