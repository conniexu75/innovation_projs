https://openalex.org/W2000467039,"Diffusion coefficients (D) of a lipid probe and labeled proteins on L-6 myoblast membranes have been measured giving D(protein) ∼ 2 × 10-10 square centimeter per second and D(lipid probe) ∼ 9 × 10-9 square centimeter per second. Some of the membrane proteins are immobile, but the lipid probe diffuses freely over macroscopic distances. Cytochalasin B slows protein but not lipid probe diffusion."

https://openalex.org/W1646536031,"The synthesis of biospecific adsorbents for the purification of the cytosol estrogen receptor from calf uterus is described. The characteristic of several estradiol derivatives, spacer chains, and insoluble matrix were systematically studied. Estradiol derivatives substituted at positions C2, 3, 4 7 alpha, 17 alpha, and 17 beta were tested for their affinities for the receptor; positions 7 alpha and 17 alpha were the most suibable. Acidic compounds had lower affinities than their methylester analogues. Long chain derivatives bound the receptor less firmly than corresponding shorter chains. However, when these ligands were attached to an insoluble matrix, the long spacer chain derivatives (greater than or equal to 14 atoms) were more efficient than the shorter ones. There was a satisfactory parallelism between affinities of free ligands and receptor binding to the respective biospecific adsorbents. On the basis of their stability in the presence of cytosol (no release of ligand), due to the absence of ester bonds, long chains were selected as spacers. Both acrylamide and agarose biospecific adsorbents displayed some ionic exchange capacity and consequently nonspecifically bound proteins; the influence of this nonspecific binding on the purification of the receptor was studied. On the basis of their stability, of their binding specificity, and of their selectivity for the receptor, the estradiol-7 alpha derivative adsorbents were selected for the purification of the receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1574886977,"The binding of the tripeptide Lys-Trp-Lys to native, denatured, and ultraviolet-irradiated DNAs has been investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Two types of complexes are formed which both involve electrostatic interactions. Only one of them involves a stacking of the tryptophyl ring with nucleic acid bases. Quantitative analysis of fluorescence data shows that this stacking interaction is strongly favored in denatured as compared to native DNA. In ultraviolet-irradiated DNA, the peptide Lys-Trp-Lys binds selectively to unpaired regions around thymine dimers. Due to the stacking interaction of the aromatic amino acid with nucleic acid bases, this simple tripeptide is therefore able to discriminate between single-stranded and double-stranded regions in a nucleic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1512594715,"Inorganic cobalt was found to induce heme oxygenase activity in primary cultures of embryonic chick liver cells and to inhibit the induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase by the porphyrinogenic compounds allylisopropylacetamide, dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydrocollidine, etiocholanolone, phenobarbital, Aroclor (R)1254, and secobarbital. Much smaller concentrations of Co2+ (5 muM) were required to inhibit delta-aminolevulinate synthetase than to induce heme oxygenase activity (50 muM). These effects of Co2+ on heme synthesis and heme degradation were potentiated by depletion of cellular glutathione content as a result of treatment with diethyl maleate. Cobalt inhibition of the induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase was of the same magnitude and probably involved the same mechanism as that produced by cobalt heme dimethyl ester and iron heme. The induction of heme oxygenase by cobalt could be blocked by cycloheximide. Plasma protein synthesis was not inhibited in the presence of concentrations of Co2+ which produced inhibition of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase or induction of heme oxygenase. Other metals such as Cd2+ and Cu2+ also inhibited the induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase by allylisopropylacetamide. These findings indicate that Co2+ can regulate heme metabolism directly in liver cells without intermediate actions on extrahepatic tissues. It is suggested that regulation of production of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase and heme oxygenase is mediated through the action of the metal ion rather than the metal in the form of a tetrapyrrole chelate."

https://openalex.org/W2089632965,"There is much interest in the ionophore-mediated and channel transmembrane transport of alkali metal ions. Valinomycin and gramicidin A, which is a linear pentadecapeptide with alternating L-D-residues, are classic representatives of carrier and channel-type ionophores, respectively, and their structure–function relationships are being intensively studied1–4. Helical structures for alternating D,L peptides have been proposed from conformational energy calculations5–7, and from experimental spectroscopic data single-helical structures have been postulated for gramicidin A (ref. 8). Stereochemical and energy considerations7,9 have suggested that polypeptides with alternating L- and D-amino acid residues may take up coaxial double-helical β-structures, both parallel and antiparallel, which are stabilised by systematic interchain NH….OC hydrogen bonds. Experimental results supporting the occurrence of structures of this kind have been obtained by Veatch, Fossei and Blout2 for gramicidin A in nonpolar solvents, and by Lotz, Colonna-Cesari, Heitz and Spach10 for poly-(γ-benzyl-D,L-glutamate) in the solid state. However, there has previously been no experimental determination of the detailed structural and conformational parameters characterising these structures. We now provide detailed conformational parameters of a double-stranded β- helix with antiparallel chains obtained by single crystal X-ray analysis of the model L-D peptide Boc-(L-Val-D-Val)4-OMe (ref. 11)."

https://openalex.org/W2759543010,"Insulin from the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, a primitive vertebrate, was studied with respect to degradation, receptor binding, and stimulation of glucose transport and metabolism in isolated rat adipocytes. The degradation was studied in a concentrated suspension with about 100mul of cells/ml of suspension. 125I-labeled hagfish insulin and 125I-labeled pig insulin were degraded at the same rate when present in concentrations of 0.3nM. Native hagfish insulin inhibited the rate of degradation of 125I-labeled pig insulin half-maximally at a concentration of 12+/-2 nM (S.D., n=6) as compared to 130+/-32 nM (S.D.,n=6) for pig insulin. Native hagfish insulin in a concentration of 130 nM was biologically inactivated at a rate several times slower than pig insulin in the same concentration. The results indicate that the maximal velocity (Vmax) of degradation of hagfish insulin as well as the concentration causing half-maximal velocity (Km) are about 10 times lower for hagfish insulin than for pig insulin. The receptor binding and the biological effects of hagfish insulin were studied in dilute cell suspensions where the degradation of hormone in the medium was negligible. The receptor binding affinity of hagfish insulin was 23+/-7 per cent (S.D., n=10) of that of pig insulin. Hagfish insulin was able to elicit the same maximal stimulation of both 3-o-methylglucose exchange and lipogenesis from glucose as pig insulin. However, the potency of hagfish insulin with respect to activation of lipogenesis was only 4.6+/-0.6 per cent (S.D., n=15) of that of pig insulin. Hagfish insulin thus constitutes the first described insulin which exhibits a discrepancy between relative binding affinity and relative potency. This discrepancy was not due to the methionine residue (B31) at the COOH-terminal end of the B chain of hagfish insulin, since removal of this residue caused no marked change in the binding affinity or the potency. The results indicate that the receptor occupancy must be 5 times higher with hagfish insulin than with pig insulin to cause a particular degree of activation of lipogenesis. Hagfish insulin might therefore be characterized as a partial antagonist on the receptors. However, it was not possible to demonstrate antagonistic properties of hagfish insulin on the cells. The effect of hagfish insulin plus pig insulin in submaximally stimulating concentrations was additive. Furthermore, the decay of activation of adipocytes after incubation with hagfish insulin followed the same time course as the decay of activation after incubation with pig insulin in a concentration of equal potency. These phenomena are in agreement with the concept that adipocytes possess a large excess of receptors which can mediate the effect of insulin on lipogenesis from glucose."

Using the homologous synthetases, the tRANs were compared for their levels of acceptance of 17 amino acids. These levels were found to be the same. The tRANs were further compared by double label chromatography on reversed phase columns. Some major quantitative differences in individual peaks were observed. In addition, for a number of aminoacyl-tRNAs, small but reproducible displacements of individual peaks were apparent. In many cases the displacement was in the major peak, and in all but one case the developmental peak eluted ahead of the vegetative peak. Taken together, these results suggest that there is no change from growth to development in the transcription of tRNA genes, but that there are important changes in post-transcriptional modification."

https://openalex.org/W2070022138,Individual hypothalamic nuclei were microdissected from brain tissue of ten human subjects who had died suddenly while in apparent good health. Appreciable amounts of vasopressin and oxytocin immunoreactivity were found by specific radioimmunoassay in six hypothalamic nuclei including supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Vasopressin and oxytocin are presumed to be synthesized in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei for axonal transport to the posterior pituitary for storage and release. Vasopressin and oxytocin in other hypothalamic nuclei may be a part of this system of neurosecretion or may serve some other function.
https://openalex.org/W2100004656,"An intracellular subgenomic RNA species from MSV-transformed G8-124 cells was characterized by electron microscopy of RNA:cDNA heteroduplexes using long cDNAs both MSV and MuLV. This subgenomic RNA, 3.1 kb long, consisted of 5'-derived sequences of about 0.4 kb joined to 2.7 kb of RNA derived from the 3' end of the RNA genome. The 3'-derived sequences included the residual sequences from the MuLV pol region and the acquired cellular sequences of MSV. The genome of MSV was shown to retain approximately 0.13 kb from the 5' end of the MuLV env region, including sequences which span the point in the MuLV env mRNA. No subgenomic MSV RNA could be detected, however, which consisted of a 5'-derived leader sequence spliced to the retained env region sequences. Nor could a subgenomic MSV RNA be detected in which a 5'-derived leader sequence was joined directly to the acquired cellular sequences. Although its translation products are unknown, the subgenomic MSV RNA was present in preparations of poly(A)+ polysomal RNA, consistent with this RNA functioning as a messenger. The structure of this 3.1 kb MSV subgenomic RNA suggests a possible role in the expression of 3'-encoded MSV information, possibly including transformation-specific sequences."
