https://openalex.org/W1575000195,"A pronounced Ca2+-dependent protease in lysed platelets was detected by the hydrolysis of an added substrate, azocasein. This protease also catalyzed the cleavage of endogenous polypeptides which was demonstrated by the disappearance of four high molecular weight polypeptides (greater than 200,000) either by adding Ca2+ to lysed platelets or by increasing the cytoplasmic Ca2+ within intact platelets with the ionophore A 23187. In both cases, lower molecular weight cleavage products were clearly identified. The caseinolytic activity as well as the cleavage of the high molecular weight polypeptides was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, but not by reagents reacting with trypsin-like proteases. Because of the similarity between this Ca2+-dependent protease and myofibrillar Ca2+-dependent protease (CAF), we have termed the former platelet CAF."

https://openalex.org/W1568336032,"The thromboxane synthetase system of the microsomes of bovine blood platelets was solubilized by the treatment with Triton X-100. The solubilized preparation was separated into two enzyme fractions by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. One catalyzed the formation of prostaglandin H2 from arachidonic acid in the presence of heme and tryptophan. The other fraction converted prostaglandin H2 to thromboxane B2 and 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid. However, incubation of the latter fraction with prostaglandin H2 at lower temperature produced an unstable compound with platelet-aggregating activity, which was presumably thromboxane A2 and which decomposed readily to thromboxane B2 and 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1486318341,"NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase readily binds to preformed phospholipid vesicles either below or above the phase transition temperature of the lipid and in the absence of detergents. The isolated vesicles are free of unbound reductase, and the lipid is present as small, closed bilayers (250 to 400 A in diameter) as indicated by gel filtration, density gradient centrifugation, and internal volume measurements with [3H]glucose. The order of substrate specificity of the bound reductase is: ferricyanide = cytochrome b5 bound to reductase vesicles (100%) greater than cytochrome b5 heme peptide (13%) greater than unbound cytochrome b5 (4.5%) greater than cytochrome b5 vesicles (0.1%). This indicates that a specific orientation of cytochrome b5 and reductase in the bilayer is required for optimal interaction. Protein transfer occurs between reductase vesicles and cytochrome b5 vesicles. The transfer is time-dependent (40 to 70% complete in 2 h), does not involve vesicle fusion, is most rapid at the phase transition temperature of the phospholipid, and appears to require a fluid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1672063958,"The action of phosphorylase kinase on synthetic peptides is reported. These peptides are variants of the amino acid sequence. Ser-Asp-Gln-Glu-Lys-Arg-Lys-Gln-Ile-Ser-Val-Arg-Gly-Leu, found in the natural substrate, phosphorylase b. The effects of size, the cluster of basic groups at the NH2-terminal side, the phosphorylatable seryl residue, the hydrophobic groups surrounding serine, and the arginyl function at the COOH-terminal side were tested and analyzed by evaluation of the kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax. The first 6 residues were found to be nonessential, but substitution of residues in the sequence. Lys-Gln-Ile-Ser-Val-Arg, had a large effect on phosphorylation. A comparison was made between the action of nonactivated and activated phosphorylase kinase on selected peptides and phosphorylase b. Various forms of phosphorylase b were tested as substrates for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of effectors and salts. Although phosphorylase would not serve as a substrate for protein kinase, the aforementioned synthetic peptide of the phosphorylase b sequence would do so, indicating that the primary sequence surrounding the phosphorylatable serine did not block phosphorylation, which suggests that higher order structural features prohibit the phosphorylation."

Structural studies by sequential enzymic degradation and by quantitative methylation analysis revealed that their structures were as follows: Galbeta1 leads to 3 (Fucalpha1 leads to 4) GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4 (Fucalpha1 leads to 3) GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4Glc, Galbeta1 leads to 4 (Fucalpha1 leads to 3) GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4 (Fucalpha1 leads to 3) GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4Glc. The core portions of these sugars, which are newly found linear hexasaccharides, are named para-lacto-N-hexaose and para-lacto-N-neohexaose, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2142001732,"RNA prepared from dog pancreas polysomes or microsomes directs the synthesis of pancreas-specific proteins in heterologous cell-free translation systems. A translation product, approximately 1500 daltons larger than authentic amylase, corresponding to pancreatic amylase was identified by immunoprecipitation with anti-amylase gamma-globulin and tryptic peptide analysis. We suggest that this larger form of amylase is an amylase precursor. Using amylase immunoprecipitation of reticulocyte translation reactions as an assay, we have shown that greater than 99% of the mRNA for amylase is associated with polysomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. Electrophoresis of pancreatic mRNA preparations in formamide-containing polyacrylamide gels and subsequent translation of the fractions have shown that amylase mRNA is of a discrete size with a mobility equivalent to that of 18 S ribosomal RNA, and therefore significantly larger than required to code solely for the amino acid sequence of the amylase precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1595958190,"Long chain transacylase activity, acyl-CoA + enzyme in equilibrium acyl-enzyme + CoA, catalyzed by the multienzyme complex fatty acid synthetase from Mycobacterium smegmatis was measured by exchange of radioactive coenzyme A into even numbered fatty acyl-CoA substrates 14 to 24 carbon atoms long. This transacylase activity decreases sharply with increasing chain length. It is suggested that C24 transacylation may be rate-limiting in de novo fatty acid synthesis catalyzed by the myocobacterial system. Mycobacterial polysaccharides stimulate the rate of transacylation, and this enhancement becomes more marked as the chain length of the substrate increases. The magnitude of the effect is similar to polysaccharide stimulation of overall synthetase activity. It is therefore proposed that terminal transacylation is the specific and perhaps only partial reaction catalyzed by the M. smegmatis fatty acid synthetase which is facilitated by polysaccharide. The product distribution of the synthetase is distinctly bimodal, with peaks for acyl chains 16 and 24 carbon atoms long. A scheme based on nonoverlapping unimodal chain length specificities for the rates of two activities, elongation and terminal transacylation, is offered to explain this bimodal distribution."

https://openalex.org/W1524739229,"Labeled C18-phytosphingosine was detected in a glyco-lipid-rich fraction from rat intestine 4 and 24 h after injection of D-erythro[4,5-3H]C18-dihydrosphingosine. The criteria for identification were: (a) co-migration on gas-liquid chromatography of the trimethylsilyl ethers of the free and N-acetylated base with authentic standard, (b) co-migration on thin layer chromatography of the dinitrophenyl derivative with authentic standard, (c) labeled pentadecanol detection by gas-liquid radiochromatography after subjecting intact sphingolipids or a mixture of free long chain bases to periodate oxidation followed by sodium borohydride reduction, and (d) obtainment of the same fragmentation pattern as with authentic standard when the trimethylsilyl ethers of the N-acetylated base were subjected to gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Smaller amounts of labeled C18-phytosphingosine were also detected in ceramide- and sphingomyelin-rich fractions of intestine and in liver and kidney. Experiments with germ-free rats strongly suggest that the intestinal flora is not the (sole) site for the biosynthesis of C18-phytosphingosine."

https://openalex.org/W207023659,"Cibacron blue F3GA is a potent inhibitor of the Azotobacter vinelandii DNA-directed RNA polymerase. Addition of 8 micrometer Cibacron blue F3GA prior to initiation results in a greater than 90% inhibition of the poly[d(A-T]-directed synthesis of poly[r(A-U)] while addition of the dye during the course of the reaction is without effect on chain elongation. Binding of RNA polymerase to [3H]poly[d(A-T)] is inhibited by only 15% in the presence of 8 micrometer Cibacron blue F3GA. Inhibition by Cibacron blue F3GA is noncompetitive with regard to ATP, UTP, or template. The poly[d(A-T)]-directed pyrophosphate exchange reaction is relatively resistant to inhibition by Cibacron blue F3GA. Rifampicin added to a similar reaction (in the presence of absence of Cibacron blue F3GA) results in 95% inhibition of the exchange reaction. The interaction of the RNA polymerase core enzyme with Cibacron blue F3GA is shown by the formation of a difference spectrum with a positive maximum at 675 nm which is not affected by the presence of a high concentration (4 micrometer) of rafampicin. The data indicate that Cibacron blue F3GA acts by binding to RNA polymerase and inhibits a step between the synthesis of the initial phosphodiester bond and formation of a stable ternary elongation complex."

https://openalex.org/W1587622790,"The initial steady state rate and product distribution of fatty acid synthesis catalyzed by Mycobacterium smegmatis fatty acid synthetase has been investigated as a function of various concentrations of acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, mycobacterial polysaccharide, and bovine serum albumin. Polysaccharide has a large effect on both rate and chain length. The steady state rate stimulation by polysaccharide is not duplicated by other acyl-CoA-binding molecules such as bovine serum albumin. It is concluded that relief of product inhibition does not adequately explain the specific effects of the mycobacterial polysaccharide. A general mechanism is presented which accounts for variations in reaction rate and produce pattern over a wide range of experimental conditions. We propose that the diffusion of long chain acyl-CoA (C14 to C24) from the enzyme is the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis catalyzed by the M. smegmatis synthetase. Polysaccharide facilitates this rate-limiting step by forming a ternary complex with enzyme-bound acyl-CoA causing rapid release of product."

https://openalex.org/W1510214908,"myo-Inositol-1-P synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) purified from rat testis and from bovine testis was allowed to react with D-[5-18O]glucose-6-P. myo-Inositol, obtained in these reactions, retained all of the 18O originally in the glucose-6-P. When these enzyme preparations were incubated with unlabeled glucose-6-P in a medium enriched in H2 18O no uptake of the oxygen isotope occurred that could be ascribed to the myo-inositol-1-P synthase reaction. By these criteria this enzyme, which is considered to use an aldolase mechanism in the cyclization step, cannot form a Schiff base during the reaction. In addition, these enzymes are not inhibited by 10 mM EDTA. One interpretation of this evidence is that the myo-inositol-1-P synthases we have studied are neither Class I nor Class II aldolases, and simply use base catalysis in the cyclization step."
https://openalex.org/W1550421008,"An initial activity burst lasting 5 to 10 s is observed for both de novo synthesis with acetyl-CoA as primer and for elongation of palmitoyl-CoA catalyzed by the multienzyme complex fatty acid synthetase from Mycobacterium smegmatis. After the initial burst, synthetase activity slows at least 6-fold to the steady state rate. The size of the initial burst is proportional to the amount of synthetase protein and corresponds to the synthesis of a small number C three to five) of C24 or C26 acyl chains per mol of enzyme. During the initial burst, C24, C26 acyl enzyme is formed and can be isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. On incubation with CoA, enzyme-bound acyl chains undergo transacylation to form the corresponding CoA derivatives. Diffusion of C24-CoA and C26-CoA from the enzyme is slow and rate-limiting for overall fatty acid synthesis. Mycobacterial polysaccharides markedly accelerate this rate-determining step but bovine serum albumin does not. This facilitation of product diffusion accounts for the large stimulation of de novo synthesis and of elongation of mycobacterial polysaccharide. It is also shown that the high apparent Km for acetyl-CoA (approximately 400 micrometer) in the steady state reflects the substrate concentration required to shift the product pattern in favor of shorter chain fatty acids (C16,C18). These conditions circumvent the slow, rate-limiting diffusion of C24-CoA and C26-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1532326210,"1. Bicarbonate increased citrate and 2-oxoglutarate accumulation when rat kidney cortex mitochondria were incubated with pyruvate or L(-)-palmitoyl carnitine in the presence of L-malate. 2. Bicarbonate stimulated the exit of citrate from mitochondria. The Km for bicarbonate was 13.5 mM and the Vmax was 0.59 nmol/min/mg of protein at 10 degrees. 3. The bicarbonate-stimulated exit of citrate from the mitochondria was prevented by inhibitors of the tricarboxylate, dicarboxylate, and phosphate transport systems. 4. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase was significantly increased by preincubation of rat kidney mitochondria with bicarbonate. This bicarbonate-induced activation was not observed in presence of inhibitors of citrate transport. Bicarbonate did not activate pyruvate dehydrogenase in rat heart mitochondria. Bicarbonate had no effect on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in either broken mitochondria or whole tissue preparations. 5. The mechanism of this activation is discussed in the light of the known regulatory properties of pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, and citrate synthase."

https://openalex.org/W1564984724,"The rates of degradation of liver cell plasma membranes from control and partially hepatectomized rats were investigated by a single isotope administration procedure utilizing L-[3H]fucose as a precursor. The label was incorporated maximally into normal plasma membranes at 2 to 4 h after intravenous injection. At 4 h, L-[3H]fucose activity was 8-fold more abundant in membrane protein than in total liver protein. Paper chromatography of neutral sugars liberated by acid hydrolysis of the plasma membranes indicated that greater than 90% of the recovered radioactivity was in the form of fucose. After partial hepatectomy, the wet weight of the right lateral liver lobe increased linearly during a 4-day postoperation interval. In addition, the specific activity of plasma membrane alkaline phosphatase was elevated to a level that remained 3 to 4 times higher than that of the control membranes. However, there was not much difference between the mean rates of degradation of the labeled plasma membrane components from the control and regenerating livers. The apparent half-lives were 33 and 40.8 h, respectively. This suggests that the dissociation of fucose-containing components from the plasma membrane is not markedly altered during the process of rapid compensatory liver growth."
https://openalex.org/W1578517358,"A DNA probe specific for sequences complementary to globin RNA has been prepared in vitro from globin complementary DNA (cDNA). Globin cDNA was used as the template for the synthesis of a complementary strand (ccDNA) by avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase. After treatment with single strand-specific S1 nuclease, double-stranded globin DNA was denatured in the presence of a vast excess of globin RNA. After hybridization of the cDNA with globin RNA, the ccDNA was isolated by hydroxyapatite chromatography. The ccDNA probe hybridized efficiently to globin cDNA, but not at all to globin RNA. This probe should prove useful in assessing the asymmetry of gene expression in cell-free transcriptional systems."
