https://openalex.org/W2152664025,"Haplotype-based methods offer a powerful approach to disease gene mapping, based on the association between causal mutations and the ancestral haplotypes on which they arose. As part of The SNP Consortium Allele Frequency Projects, we characterized haplotype patterns across 51 autosomal regions (spanning 13 megabases of the human genome) in samples from Africa, Europe, and Asia. We show that the human genome can be parsed objectively into haplotype blocks: sizable regions over which there is little evidence for historical recombination and within which only a few common haplotypes are observed. The boundaries of blocks and specific haplotypes they contain are highly correlated across populations. We demonstrate that such haplotype frameworks provide substantial statistical power in association studies of common genetic variation across each region. Our results provide a foundation for the construction of a haplotype map of the human genome, facilitating comprehensive genetic association studies of human disease."

https://openalex.org/W1990403227,"GroEL, a heat-shock protein that acts as a molecular chaperone1, is overproduced in endosymbiotic but not in free-living bacteria2,3,4, presumably to assist in the folding of conformationally damaged proteins. Here we show that the overproduction of GroEL in Escherichia coli masks the effects of harmful mutations that have accumulated during a simulated process of vertical transmission. This molecular mechanism, which may be an adaptation to the bacterium's intracellular lifestyle, is able to rescue lineages from a progressive fitness decline resulting from the fixation of deleterious mutations under strong genetic drift5,6."
https://openalex.org/W2032559209,"Although deoxythymidylate cannot be provided directly by ribonucleotide reductase, the gene encoding thymidylate synthase ThyA is absent from the genomes of a large number of nonsymbiotic microbes. We show that ThyX (Thy1) proteins of previously unknown function form a large and distinct class of thymidylate synthases. ThyX has a wide but sporadic phylogenetic distribution, almost exclusively limited to microbial genomes lacking thyA. ThyX and ThyA use different reductive mechanisms, because ThyX activity is dependent on reduced flavin nucleotides. Our findings reveal complexity in the evolution of thymidine in present-day DNA. Because ThyX proteins are found in many pathogenic microbes, they present a previously uncharacterized target for antimicrobial compounds."

The thickness of the outer ice shell is poorly constrained, however, with model-dependent estimates ranging from a few kilometres to ten or more kilometres. Here I present measurements of depths of impact craters on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto that reveal two anomalous transitions in crater shape with diameter. The first transition is probably related to temperature-dependent ductility of the crust at shallow depths (7 8 km on Europa). The second transition is attributed to the influence of subsurface oceans on all three satellites, which constrains Europa's icy shell to be at least 19 km thick. The icy lithospheres of Ganymede and Callisto are equally ice-rich, but Europa's icy shell has a thermal structure about 0.25 0.5 times the thicknesses of Ganymede's or Callisto's shells, depending on epoch. The appearances of the craters on Europa are inconsistent with thin-ice-shell models and indicate that exchange of oceanic and surface material could be difficult."

In ovarian carcinoma cells, endothelin-1 (ET-1) stimulates the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major mediator of tumor angiogenesis. In OVCA 433 and HEY ovarian carcinoma cell lines, ET-1 treatment increases VEGF mRNA expression and induces VEGF protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and do so to a greater extent under hypoxic conditions. ET-1 also increases hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) accumulation and activates the HIF-1 transcription complex under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, suggesting a role for HIF-1 in the induction of VEGF expression. These effects are inhibited by the selective ETA receptor (ETAR) antagonist, BQ123. The ET-1-induced increase in HIF-1α protein levels is due to the enhanced HIF-1α stabilization. These results implicate HIF-1α in the induction of VEGF expression in ET-1-stimulated ovarian carcinoma cells, and provide a mechanism whereby ET-1 acting selectively through ETAR can interact with the HIF-1α-dependent machinery of angiogenesis.

Aberrant ET-1-induced cell proliferation and/or survival is implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma (6Egidy G. Juillerat-Jeanneret L. Jeannin J.F.

Nanbu K. Sakahara H. Mori T. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) that elevated expression of ET-1 and its receptors was significantly associated with microvessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, known to be correlated with poor survival in ovarian cancer patients. High levels of ET-1 were detected in the majority of ascitic fluids of these patients and significantly correlated with VEGF ascitic concentrations (12Salani D., Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Rosanò L.

Whereas growth factors like VEGF and their cognate tyrosine kinase receptors are the best characterized mediators of angiogenesis, a number of GPCR have also been shown to play a role in angiogenesis (14Richard D.E. Vouret-Craviari V. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, ET-1 modulates different stages of neovascularization including proliferation, migration, invasion, protease production, and morphogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and stimulates neovascularization in vivo (11Salani D.

Furthermore, it has been shown that GPCR agonists can also indirectly modulate angiogenesis through the induction of VEGF (16Hu Y.L. Tee M.K. Goetzl E.J. Auersperg N. Mills G. Ferrara N. Jaffe R.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II, thrombin, and ET-1 have been shown to induce VEGF expression (17Williams B. Baker A.Q. Gallacher B. Lodwick D.

In the ovarian carcinoma cell line, OVCA 433, we demonstrated that ET-1 stimulated VEGF production through ETAR by an extent comparable with hypoxia, indicating that ET-1 could modulate tumor angiogenesis through direct angiogenic effects on endothelial cells and through the VEGF stimulation (12Salani D., Di Castro V.

Transcriptional up-regulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has been shown to play a major role in VEGF gene induction (19Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β that bind as dimers to the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) (20Brahimi C. Berra E. Pouysségur J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S32-S36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). HIF-1 controls the expression of a number of pro-angiogenic genes such as VEGF, erythropoietin, and ET-1 in response to hypoxia in different tumor cell lines (1Semenza G.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 71-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 2Kourembahas S. Maraden P.A. Mequillanm L.P. Faller D.V. J. Clin.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is up-regulated in a broad range of malignancies, where it correlates with tumor grade and vascularity (21Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Although the HIF-1β protein is readily found in all cells, HIF-1α, which is virtually undetectable under normal oxygen conditions, is strongly and rapidly induced by hypoxia. Oxygen-dependent proline hydroxylation regulates the binding of von Hippel-Lindau suppressor protein, the recognition component of a ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets HIF-1α for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (22Ivan M. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23Darren E.R. Edurne B. Pouysségur J. J. Biol.

Although hypoxia has been shown to be the major inducer of HIF-1α in all cells tested, other stimuli, such as growth factors, hormones, nitric oxide, transition metals, and iron chelators, are able to induce VEGF expression in an HIF-1-dependent manner in normoxic cells (25Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J.

We hypothesized that ET-1 promotes VEGF production through HIF-1α and that this mechanism may be responsible for the increasing angiogenesis resulting in ovarian tumor growth. Therefore, we used HEY and OVCA 433 ovarian carcinoma cell lines as a model to investigate the stimulation of VEGF expression by ET-1 and the mechanisms involved in ET-1 induction of VEGF. Because ET-1 stimulates ovarian tumor cell proliferation and survival selectively through ETAR, which is the receptor subtype predominantly expressed in these tumor cells, we also explored which receptor is involved in the ET-1-induced VEGF expression. Here we report that ET-1 induces VEGF expression in ovarian cancer cells grown under normal oxygen conditions. ET-1-increased VEGF expression was mediated by ETAR and was associated with the induction of HIF-1α protein, suggesting a role for HIF-1 in this effect. Furthermore, we found that ET-1 enhanced HIF-1α stability leading to HIF-1α protein accumulation, and these effects were amplified under hypoxic conditions. Our results clearly demonstrated that ET-1 mimics cellular hypoxia inducing HIF-1α protein that can form the HIF-1 transcription complex inducing higher levels of HIF-1 DNA binding activity in ovarian carcinoma cells. These findings suggest that this ETAR-activated pathway should play a major role in vascular VEGF production and neovascularization in ovarian carcinoma. OVCA 433 and HEY human ovarian carcinoma cell lines were the generous gifts from Prof. Giovanni Scambia (Catholic University School of Medicine, Rome, Italy) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely cultured in 5% CO2, 95% air (normoxic conditions) at 37 °C. To expose cells to hypoxia, cells were placed into an air-tight chamber (Modular Incubator Chamber, Billups-Rothenberg, CA) with inflow and outflow valves and were infused with a mixture of 5% CO2, 95% N2 for 20 min. In all experiments cells were grown to 70–80% confluence on 100-mm glass dishes. Cells were then serum-deprived by incubation for 24 h in serum-free medium and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia in the presence or in the absence of ET-1 or BQ123, a specific ETAR antagonist (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA). All culture reagents were from Invitrogen. When the effects of ETAR antagonist were studied, BQ123 was added 15 min before the agonist. Pretreatment with cycloheximide (100 μm, Sigma) was performed 2 h prior to the addition of ET-1 for de novo protein synthesis of VEGF. For the HIF-1α stability study, cycloheximide was added after 24 h of ET-1 or hypoxic treatment, and the cells were further incubated under normoxia for varying times. Total RNA from HEY and OVCA 433 cells was extracted using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using a Superscript One-step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer sets were as follows: VEGF, 5′-GGCTCTAGATCGGGCCTCCGAAACCAT-3′ and 5′- GGCTCTAGAGCGCAGAGTCTCCTCTTC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTCAACGGA-3′and 5′-GATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCAT-3′. Thirty five cycles of amplification with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9700 thermocycler were performed under the following conditions: melting at 95 °C for 30 s; annealing at 60 °C for 45 s; extension at 72 °C for 30s for VEGF amplification, and for GAPDH amplification a 55 °C annealing temperature was used. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized and photographed under UV light. In all experiments, two control reactions, one containing no mRNA and another containing mRNA but no reverse transcriptase, were included. OVCA 433 and HEY cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/dish in complete medium and serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. After varying times conditioned media were collected, centrifuged, and frozen for subsequent use. The VEGF protein levels in the media were determined in duplicate by ELISA using the reagents and the protocol supplied with the Quantikine Human VEGF immunoassay kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping with a rubber policeman in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mmNaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mm orthovanadate, 0.06 units of aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA Protein assay (Pierce). Protein cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween) and incubated with VEGF polyclonal (Sigma) or HIF-1α monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 3 h. After washing with TBST, blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG or anti-mouse IgG for VEGF or HIF-1α, respectively, washed again, and subjected to the ECL (Amersham Biosciences) procedure. The presence of VEGF was also assayed in HEY cell-conditioned medium and analyzed by Western blotting. Total RNA from HEY cells was extracted using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's instructions, separated by electrophoresis on 2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membranes were UV cross-linked and hybridized in the QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA probe used for analysis of the VEGF and GAPDH mRNA was prepared using RT-PCR products. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer Oligolabeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometric scanning was performed with a Mustek MFS-6000 CX apparatus, and the data were analyzed with Phoretix 1D software and normalized to those of GAPDH. HEY cells were grown as before and lysed in buffer A (50 mm HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm dithiothreitol). The lysates were pelleted and resuspended in buffer B (500 mm HCl, 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation, and aliquots of the supernatant were stored at −80 °C. Oligonucleotide (130 ng) corresponding to the HRE sequence of the VEGF gene (5′-TCGACCACAGTGCATACGTGGGCTCCAACAGGTCCTCTTC-3′) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (30Aragonès J. Jones D.R.

Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were preincubated (15 min at room temperature) together with poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) in 20 μl of buffer consisting of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 10 mm), 100 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The labeled probe (3 × 104 cpm) was then added and incubation continued for an additional 15 min. For competition assay, the labeled probe was mixed with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide and then added to the nuclear extract. For supershift assays HIF-1α antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was added to the nuclear extract at a final dilution of 1:3 immediately after addition of the probe, and the mixture was kept on ice for 20 min. Reaction mixtures were then loaded onto 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5× TBE (40 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mmboric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA). Gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C. All statistical analyses were assessed using a two-tailed Student's t test and performed by the Inplot software system (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). We first performed RT-PCR analysis to determine whether ET-1 affects the levels of VEGF mRNA in HEY and OVCA 433 cells, which produce elevated amount of ET-1 and express high affinity ETA receptors (31Bagnato A. Tecce R. Moretti C., Di Castro V. Spergel D. Catt K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar, 32Salani, D., Rosanò, L., Di Castro, V., Spinella, F., Venuti, A., Padley, R. J., Nicotra, M. R., Natali, P. G., and Bagnato, A. (2002) Clin. Sci. (Lond.)102,Google Scholar). Ovarian carcinoma cells were incubated with different concentrations of ET-1 ranging from 0.01 to 100 nm. ET-1 increased the three VEGF transcript levels corresponding to VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). VEGF transcript levels were markedly enhanced by 1 nm ET-1, with a further increase induced by 10 nm reaching maximal stimulation by 100 nm. We next assessed whether induction of VEGF mRNA levels by ET-1 resulted in a parallel increase of VEGF protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Conditioned medium from OVCA 433 and HEY cells incubated in the presence of various concentrations of ET-1 and for different times was assayed for secreted VEGF by ELISA analysis. After ET-1 stimulation, secreted VEGF levels increased progressively with detectable production as early as 1 h and maximum stimulation (2.5-fold above control levels) at 24 h (p ≤ 0.005, Fig.2 A). VEGF production increased progressively when HEY and OVCA 433 cells were treated with different concentrations of ET-1, reaching maximal stimulation at a concentration of 100 nm (p ≤ 0.005, Fig. 2 B). After 24 h of incubation with 100 nm ET-1, VEGF production was stimulated to an extent comparable with that induced by hypoxia (Fig. 2 B), a recognized potent stimulus of VEGF. We next investigated whether ET-1 cooperated with hypoxia, increasing the induction of VEGF production. After 12 and 24 h of hypoxic stimulus in HEY cells, ET-1-induced VEGF production increased progressively up to 1.5- and 2.0-fold above control levels, respectively (Fig. 2 C). These results indicated that ET-1 induced VEGF production in a manner comparable with hypoxia and that under hypoxic conditions ET-1 cooperated to hypoxia amplifying the VEGF production. To analyze whether ET-1-induced expression of VEGF was dependent onde novo protein synthesis, we determined the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) alone or in combination with ET-1. As shown in Fig. 2 D, induction of VEGF protein upon ET-1 treatment in OVCA 433 cells was strongly inhibited by CHX, suggesting that induction of VEGF expression by ET-1 was dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. To characterize the ET-1 receptor subtype involved in the up-regulation of VEGF mRNA, we performed Northern blotting. Densitometric analysis of Northern blot autoradiographic bands and comparison with the intensity of the bands of the GAPDH expression indicated that VEGF expression after 6 h of stimulation with ET-1 (100 nm), under normoxic conditions, was increased up to 2.6-fold above control levels to an extent comparable with that induced by hypoxia. In addition, under hypoxic conditions ET-1 increased VEGF mRNA expression 1.7-fold above the control levels (Fig.3 A). Pretreatment of cells with the ETAR antagonist BQ123 (1 μm) completely blocked the ET-1-stimulated VEGF mRNA expression under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3 A). To define the receptor-mediated action of ET-1 on VEGF protein production, we also analyzed conditioned media collected from HEY cells cultured for 24 h with ET-1 (100 nm) by Western blotting and by ELISA (Fig. 3, B and C). As evaluated by ELISA, ET-1-induced VEGF secretion increased up to 1.7- and 1.9-fold above control levels under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, respectively. After 24 h of incubation, the VEGF stimulation by ET-1 was completely blocked by BQ123 under both conditions (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicated that ET-1-induced VEGF expression and secretion were mediated by the ETAR. To investigate whether ET-1-induced VEGF expression may be mediated by HIF-1α, we analyzed the HIF-1α protein levels upon ET-1 treatment in HEY cells cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions by Western blotting. The HIF-1α protein expression under normal oxygen conditions was undetectable, while exposure of HEY cells to hypoxia rapidly increased HIF-1α protein levels. At the end of 24 h stimulation with ET-1 (100 nm) in normoxic HEY cells, the HIF-1α protein expression was strongly induced to a level that was more elevated than the hypoxic treatment (Fig. 4 A). When HEY cells were stimulated with 100 nm ET-1 under hypoxic conditions, the level of HIF-1α induction was increased to an even greater extent than that induced by hypoxia. We then evaluated whether HIF-1α accumulation induced by ET-1 was associated with the VEGF protein expression. Both in normoxic or hypoxic HEY cells, ET-1-induced accumulation of HIF-1α protein paralleled the ET-1-induced VEGF production (Fig. 4 B). The undetectable expression of HIF-1α in non-stimulated HEY cells suggested that the HIF-1α protein was unstable under normoxic conditions in this cell line. To assess whether ET-1 regulated the expression of HIF-1α protein by inhibiting its degradation, we monitored the levels of ET-1-induced HIF-1α protein after blocking protein synthesis by cycloheximide. To this end, we investigated the decay of hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1α after transfer of cells from hypoxia to normoxia. A rapid decay of HIF-1α protein was observed within 15 min and was completely undetectable by the end of 60 min under normoxia (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, ET-1-induced HIF-1α protein levels under normoxia remained constant for 60 min after cycloheximide addition and decreased relatively slowly to ∼40% within 120 min thereafter (Fig.5 B). Moreover, the decay of hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1α after transfer of cells from hypoxia to normoxia in the presence of ET-1 was found to occur at a greater extent than hypoxia alone and with kinetics in which the levels of HIF-1α protein were still detectable and clearly above basal levels after 3 h of cycloheximide exposure. These results clearly indicated that ET-1 induced HIF-1α protein in normoxic and hypoxic HEY cells by slowing down its degradation. The finding that increased levels of VEGF expression were associated with the stabilization of HIF-1α protein in ET-1-treated HEY cells may be indicative of a role for HIF-1α in the induction of VEGF expression by ET-1. To be active, HIF-1α must form the HIF-1 transcription complex with HIF-1β and bind to the specific HRE DNA sequence (20Brahimi C. Berra E. Pouysségur J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S32-S36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated HIF-1 DNA binding activity with electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments. When a 40-bp 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the HIF-1-binding site was incubated with nuclear extracts from ET-1-treated HEY cells, under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, a number of protein-DNA complexes were increased (Fig.6). The identity of HIF-1 in these complexes was confirmed by competition experiments and the use of a specific antibody. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competed with the probe for the binding of HIF-1α. A specific monoclonal antibody against HIF-1α was able to supershift the hypoxia-inducible complexes without affecting constitutive DNA-protein complexes. This induction was mediated through ETAR binding, as demonstrated by the inhibitory effect on the induction of HIF-1 DNA complex by BQ123 under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. These results indicated that ET-1 mimics hypoxia to induce HIF-1α protein that can form the HIF-1 complex with HIF-1β and bind the HRE sequence and that this mechanism is mediated through ETAR. In addition to the classical hypoxia-mediated induction of VEGF, a number of angiogenic stimuli including several tyrosine kinase receptors and GPCR agonists have also been shown to induce VEGF expression through HIF-1α (25Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J.

Among the latter we have reported (11Salani D. Taraboletti G. Rosanò L., Di Castro V. Borsotti P. Giavazzi R. Bagnato A. Am. J.

In this study we demonstrated that ET-1 enhanced VEGF mRNA and protein levels in ovarian carcinoma cell lines via ETAR. This modulation is associated in HEY cells with the accumulation of HIF-1α protein indicating a role for HIF-1 in the induction of VEGF expression. ET-1 induced HIF-1α stability and potentiated the hypoxia-mediated induction of HIF-1α and VEGF expression. Furthermore, ET-1 shares with hypoxia the ability to induce a complex that binds HRE as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Steady-state levels of HIF-1α protein were regulated at the level of synthesis and stability. Many activators of HIF-1α, including hypoxia, have been shown to induce HIF-1α protein expression by inhibiting ubiquitination and degradation (24Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ET-1 induced HIF-1α protein accumulation through a similar mechanism in HEY cells, we examined the kinetics of the decay of ET-1-induced HIF-1α protein in the absence of protein synthesis. As a reference for the stability of HIF-1α under normoxia in non-treated HEY cells, we investigated the decay of hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1α protein upon reoxygenation in the same manner. Analysis of HIF-1α protein stability in cycloheximide-treated cells showed that the degradation of HIF-1α was decreased in ET-1-treated cells compared with control under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions, supporting the notion that the induction of HIF-1α protein level by ET-1 was due to enhanced HIF-1α stability. Our results confirmed findings reporting that HIF-1α protein was unstable in normoxic OVCAR-3 and HI34 ovarian carcinoma cell lines and demonstrated the induction of VEGF expression and HIF-1α protein by the oxidative stressor arsenite (35Duyndam M.C.A.

In this study we have shown that after stimulation with ET-1 increased HIF-1α protein levels accumulated in the cells, and the HIF-1 transcription complex was formed and could bind to the HRE-binding site. Therefore, ET-1-induced HIF-1 accumulation in ovarian carcinoma cell lines activated all the signals necessary for a full HIF-1 response. These findings indicate that under normoxic conditions ET-1 was able to activate the hypoxia response pathway, which is the strongest physiological regulator of VEGF expression implying a direct involvement of ET-1 in the elicitation of the angiogenic phenotype. The HIF-1α-mediated transcription of VEGF by ET-1 under normoxic conditions pointed to a general mechanism through which oncogenes and growth factors may up-regulate VEGF and could synergize with hypoxia during tumor growth. In human cancers, HIF-1α was overexpressed as a result of intratumoral hypoxia and genetic alterations affecting key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. HIF-1α overexpression in biopsies of brain, breast, cervical, esophageal, oropharyngeal, and ovarian cancer was correlated with treatment failure and mortality (36Semenza G.L. Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S62-S67Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HIF-1α protein, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, was observed in 68.6% of epithelial ovarian cancer specimens (37Birner P. Schindl M. Obermaier A. Breitenecker G. Obermaier G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1661-1668PubMed Google Scholar). Necrotic areas, most likely induced by hypoxia, were more frequently observed in poorly differentiated ovarian tumor as compared with well differentiated carcinomas. Stronger expression of HIF-1α in well differentiated ovarian tumors than poorly differentiated tumors suggested that overexpression of HIF-1α in these tumors cannot be attributed to hypoxia alone. Birner et al. (37Birner P. Schindl M. Obermaier A. Breitenecker G. Obermaier G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1661-1668PubMed Google Scholar) further demonstrated a correlation between HIF-1α overexpression and increased vascularization in human ovarian cancer. In this regard, we previously reported (12Salani D., Di Castro V. Nicotra M.R. Rosanò L. Tecce R. Venuti A. Natali P.G. Bagnato A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1537-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) that ET-1 was expressed in 84% of the ovarian carcinomas and demonstrated for the first time a strong correlation between ET-1 and neovascularization and VEGF expression. These findings suggest that ETAR activation by ET-1 participates in ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis, driving tumor cells growth and angiogenesis in a paracrine fashion by inducing the expression and secretion of VEGF acting on HIF-1α. Because increased HIF-1 activity may also influence tumor progression independently from its regulation of VEGF expression (38Ryan H.E. Poloni M. MeVulty W. Elson D. Garsmann M. Arbeit J. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of HIF-1α could represent a novel approach to cancer therapy especially for those cancer types, such as ovarian tumors, in which a high level of HIF-1 overexpression is correlated with mortality. Our findings, besides giving further insights into the role of the ET-1 receptor in cancer, may be clinically relevant. Addition of a specific ETAR antagonist, BQ 123, blocked the ET-1-induced up-regulation of VEGF expression and secretion as well as the ET-1-induced activation of HIF-1 transcription complex, indicating a direct involvement of ETAR in the control of tumor angiogenesis. Because the regulation of VEGF production is a critical event in tumor angiogenesis, one can envision that under pathological conditions such as cancer, ET-1 may be up-regulated by hypoxia (3Yamashita K. Discher D.J., Hu, J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and that ET-1, in turn, might exert an angiogenic effect increasing VEGF production through the HIF-1α-dependent mechanism. Thus, under hypoxic conditions ET-1 cooperates with hypoxia-amplifying HIF-1α stability and VEGF production. The present studies indicating ET-1 as a novel regulator of HIF-1α stability added further information on the overall importance of ET-1/ETAR in regulating tumor angiogenesis. Thus ETAR blockade in ovarian tumor cells prevents the growth-promoting activity of ET-1 by inhibiting cell proliferation (8Bagnato A. Tecce R., Di Castro V. Catt K.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1306-1311PubMed Google Scholar) and survival (9Del Bufalo D., Di Castro V. Biroccio A. Varmi M. Salani D. Rosanò L. Trisciuoglio D. Spinella F. Bagnato A. Mol.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8340-8346PubMed Google Scholar) but also the VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. In conclusion, these results defined a novel mechanism that could act with a hypoxic independent pathway and/or could enhance the hypoxic dependent molecular machinery resulting in tumor angiogenesis and identified ETAR as novel target for the development of anti-angiogenic therapies.

While the human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Ape1 can remove PGs, albeit inefficiently, from blunt and recessed 3′ ends of DSBs (6Suh D. Wilson III D.M. Povirk L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), PGs on 3′ overhangs are highly resistant to this enzyme (6Suh D. Wilson III D.M. Povirk L.F.

Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in mammalian cell extracts, PGs on 3′ overhangs of DSBs are removed by an as yet unidentified activity, and a fraction of such DSBs are accurately rejoined by Ku-mediated end alignment, gap-filling, and ligation (8Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F., Yu, Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol.

The yeast tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase scTdp1 was isolated fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae as an activity that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond linking tyrosine to a 3′ DNA end (9Yang S.W. Burgin A.B., Jr. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Such linkages are formed as intermediates in DNA relaxation by topoisomerase I and in DNA cleavage and reunion by various recombinases. These intermediates can become trapped if the process is interrupted, for example, by a topoisomerase inhibitor or by collision with a replication fork. The hypersensitivity of tdp1Δ yeast to topoisomerase I-mediated DNA damage (10Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Science. 1999; 286: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) suggests a critical role for scTdp1 in repair of such lesions. A human homologue with similar 3′-phosphotyrosyl-processing activity, hTdp1, was cloned by homology to scTdp1 and was eventually shown to have some homology to the phospholipase D superfamily of phosphodiesterases (11Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Yeast and human Tdp1 differ from other activities for processing blocked 3′ ends in that they leave a 3′-phosphate rather than a 3′-hydroxyl. A 3′-phosphate could then be removed by polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (human PNKP (12Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell.

As reported below, comparison of the properties of hTdp1 with those of 3′-PG-processing activities in human cell extracts suggests that a major portion, if not all, of the processing of 3′-PGs on DSBs with 3′ overhangs is attributable to hTdp1.

Plasmid pHN1910, encoding an amino histidine-tagged version of the hTdp1 protein sequence as defined by human data base entry FLJ11090, was transformed into Rosettagami (DE3)Escherichia coli (Novagen, Madison, WI). hTdp1 expression and purification, including controls with parental plasmid pET15b (Novagen), were performed essentially as described previously (11Interthal H.

Gel filtration was performed on a prepacked 1.6 × 60-cm (190 ml of bed volume) Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was loaded with 1 ml of undiluted cell extract (∼10 mg), and elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m potassium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol) was applied with a peristaltic pump at 0.14 ml/min at 9 °C. A280 was recorded, and 2-ml fractions were collected and stored at 4 °C. Fractions showed no loss of PG-processing activity for at least 2 weeks. Phosphocellulose ion exchange chromatography was performed on a column of 1 cm diameter and 1 ml of bed volume. The column was loaded with 1 ml of undiluted cell extract and eluted with three 1-ml aliquots of the elution buffer, and ∼1-ml fractions collected by gravity flow. This procedure was repeated using the same buffer supplemented with 0.15 and 0.5 m KCl. End-joining assays in crude extracts were carried out in 20 μl of human end-joining buffer (50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (19Baumann P.

Following incubation at 37 °C, the samples were deproteinized, cut withXhoI and BstXI, and analyzed on denaturing 20% polyacrylamide sequencing gels as described previously (8Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F., Yu, Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). End-processing assays (5, 10, or 20 μl as indicated) with recombinant hTdp1 or scTdp1 and with extract fractions were carried out in the same buffer lacking dNTPs and containing 20 fmol oligomeric or 3 fmol plasmid substrate. The extraction and chromatography buffers all contained 0.5 mm EDTA, and therefore the magnesium acetate concentration in the reactions was adjusted so that the final free Mg2+ concentration would be 0.5 mm. In some cases magnesium acetate was omitted and various concentrations of EDTA was added as indicated. Following incubation at 37 °C, the oligomeric substrate was diluted with one volume of formamide containing 40 mm EDTA and electrophoresed on 20% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. The plasmid substrate was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 2 μg of tRNA, cut withXhoI, again precipitated and subjected to gel electrophoresis. Phosphorimages were analyzed with ImageQuant 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics). Closely spaced bands were quantified using the Gaussian deconvolution algorithm of PeakFit 4.1 (SYSTAT Software, Richmond, CA). Assays to assess the effect of human PNKP on 3′-PG termini were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (13Karimi-Busheri F. Daly G. Robins P. Canas B. Pappin D.J.

An anti-hTdp1 antibody was prepared by ResGen (Carlsbad, CA) using full-length hTdp1 that had been bacterially overexpressed and purified as described (11Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc.

Samples (0.1 mg) were injected into rabbits according to the ResGen standard protocol, and bleeds were taken every 4 weeks. Experiments described here were performed with the week 16 bleed. Samples containing 95 μl of undiluted fractionated extract and 5 μl of undiluted or diluted hTdp1 antiserum were rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein-A-Sepharose beads were prewashed with end-joining buffer, and then 20 μl of beads were added to each sample. The samples were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. To assess PG-processing activity, 20 fmol of 3′-PG 14-mer were added to 5 μl of undiluted supernatant and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) of fractions from Sephacryl S-300 chromatography were heat-denatured and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with polyclonal rabbit antisera to hTdp1 (1:1000 dilution) or Ku70 and Ku80 (1:2000, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, no. 1358 and no. 1357, respectively) and then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000, Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). Blots were developed with an SuperSignal Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and autoradiographed. To ensure that proteins recognized by hTdp1 antiserum were in fact hTdp1, antiserum at a 200:1 dilution was incubated for 4 h in the presence of 0.3 μg/ml recombinant hTdp1 for 1 h; this pretreatment completely eliminated detection of the putative hTdp1 bands. Previous work showed that human,Xenopus, and hamster cell extracts are capable of processing DSBs bearing PG termini on 3′-overhangs (8Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F., Yu, Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In a typical end-joining experiment in human whole-cell extracts (Fig.2A) ∼5% of a substrate with partially cohesive 3′ overhangs (Fig. 1D) was converted to accurately joined products (indicated by the 43- and 24-bp fragments) by a mechanism involving PG removal, alignment of partially cohesive 3′ overhangs, fill-in of the one-base gap in each strand, and ligation. The intermediate step of PG removal could be clearly seen as a band of slightly slower mobility than the initial substrate (15-mer band in Fig. 2). A kinetic study showed that PG removal proceeded rapidly at first, with ∼30% removal in the first 10 min, but then slowed dramatically (Fig.2C). The failure of the reaction to go to completion was not due to instability of PG-removing enzyme(s) because new substrate added 1 h after the start of the incubation also showed rapid initial PG removal (not shown). Moreover, as described below, the same extracts were able to effect rapid, quantitative removal of PG from a single-stranded oligomer. Thus, the kinetics of PG processing with the plasmid substrate suggest that the 3′ overhangs gradually became resistant to PG-processing activities. Footprinting studies 2K. V. Inamdar and L. F. Povik, unpublished data. suggest that this resistance may be attributable to sequestration of DNA ends by repair complexes containing DNA-PK, which are formed within 20 min of substrate addition. When extracts were treated with the DNA-PK inhibitor wortmannin prior to addition of substrate, end joining was blocked entirely but PG removal was reduced only slightly. These results, as well as the complete removal of PG termini from the same substrate in Ku-deficient xrs6 cells (8Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F., Yu, Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggest that PG processing on 3′ overhangs does not require prior formation of the DNA-PK repair complex on DNA ends and may be attributable to a diffusible enzyme in the extracts. Surprisingly, substantial PG removal, but very little end joining, occurred even in the absence of added Mg2+ (Fig. 2B). In an attempt to identify candidate enzymes for processing of protruding 3′-PG termini, the same substrate was treated with purified recombinant Ape1, the only specific mammalian enzyme known to remove 3′-PG termini (24Demple B. Harrison L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). However, just as reported previously for analogous oligomeric substrates (6Suh D. Wilson III D.M. Povirk L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), Ape1 had no detectable effect on the PG-terminated 3′ overhang (Fig. 3A). Studies of Ku structure and function suggest that in cells and cell extracts, Ku stabilizes alignment of the overhangs of two DSB ends to form what is essentially a duplex substrate with closely opposed 3′-PG-terminated single strand breaks (8Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F., Yu, Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), a structure that might then be susceptible to PG removal by Ape1. However, neither Ku nor DNA-PK holoenzyme (Ku plus DNA-PKcs) rendered the overhanging 3′-PG termini susceptible to Ape1 (Fig. 3A). Another possible candidate for catalyzing PG removal on a 3′ overhang was the human polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase PNKP, which removes 3′-phosphates from both single- and double-stranded DNA substrates (12Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,13Karimi-Busheri F. Daly G. Robins P. Canas B. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Miller G.G. Fakhrai H. Davis E.M., Le Beau M.M. Weinfeld M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24187-24194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Indeed, a plant phosphodiesterase with homology to PNKP has been reported to have weak PG-removing activity (26Betti M. Petrucco S. Bolchi A. Dieci G. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18038-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3B, PNKP alone had no effect on the plasmid substrate with a PG-terminated 3′ overhang, but in the presence of purified human Ku, PNKP appeared to catalyze substantial conversion of 3′-PG to 3′-hydroxyl termini. However, Ku alone converted an approximately equal fraction of the 3′-PG to a product of very slightly reduced mobility. The mobility of this band and its apparent conversion to a 3′-hydroxyl by PNKP is consistent with a 3′-phosphate, presumably formed by removal of glycolate from the 3′-PG terminus (the same band can be seen, though less clearly, in the Ku-treated samples in Fig. 3A). These results suggested that PNKP itself did not process 3′-PG termini but that either Ku or a contaminant in the placental Ku was capable of converting 3′-PG to 3′-phosphate termini. In an initial attempt to purify the protein(s) responsible for 3′-PG processing on 3′ overhangs, human whole-cell extracts were fractionated on phosphocellulose, and fractions were tested for effects on two substrates: a 3′-PG 14-mer (Fig. 1B; used as a surrogate for a 3′ overhang) and an oligomeric duplex with a central one-base gap bearing 3′-PG and 5′-phosphate termini (Fig. 1A). Activity for 3′-PG-to-3′-hydroxyl conversion in the gapped duplex substrate eluted primarily in the 0.5 m KCl fraction (Fig.4A), which has been reported to contain the bulk of DNA end-joining activity (19Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, activity for conversion of 3′-PG to 3′-hydroxyl termini on the single-strand substrate eluted primarily in the 0.15 m KCl fraction (Fig.4B), suggesting that the activity was distinct from the activity that acts on 3′-PGs at internal gaps in duplex substrates (presumably Ape1/HAP1). In addition to the band corresponding to a 3′-hydroxyl terminus, there was, for samples treated with the 0.15m KCl fractions, substantial amounts of the putative 3′-phosphate band seen in assays with Ku, and indeed for the earliest-eluting 0.15 m KCl fraction this band was more prominent than the 3′-hydroxyl band. One candidate for catalyzing conversion of 3′-PG to 3′-phosphate termini would be the human tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase hTdp1. hTdp1 catalyzes cleavage of the diester bond between a terminal 3′-phosphate of DNA and tyrosine (11Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and is the only mammalian diesterase reported to convert any type of blocked 3′ DNA terminus to a 3′-phosphate. If the PG removal catalyzed by whole-cell extracts involved sequential removal of glycolate and phosphate by hTdp1 and PNKP, respectively, then it should be possible to trap the 3′-phosphate intermediate by addition of EDTA since PNKP requires Mg2+ (12Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Karimi-Busheri F. Daly G. Robins P. Canas B. Pappin D.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24187-24194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas hTdp1 does not (11Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Indeed, whereas in the presence of Mg2+ a 3′-PG 14-mer was extensively degraded in unfractionated whole-cell extracts, at 1 mm EDTA a full-length 3′-hydroxyl oligomer was produced, and at 5–40 mm EDTA the putative phosphate band was the predominant product (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that the 3′-phosphatase and exonuclease activities were both much more sensitive to EDTA than the glycolate-removing activity. EDTA also inhibited 3′-hydroxyl formation by the 0.15 m KCl phosphocellulose fraction and trapped the same 3′-phosphate intermediate (Fig. 5B). Similar formation of 3′-phosphate products was catalyzed in the presence of EDTA by extracts of Ku-deficient xrs6 hamster cells, suggesting that the glycolate-removing activity, despite its copurification with Ku, was not Ku and did not require Ku (Fig. 5B). To determine whether the activity for removal of glycolate from single-stranded 3′-PG termini in human cell extracts might be hTdp1, the extracts were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 (Fig. 6). A prominent peak of glycolate-removing activity coeluted with hTdp1 protein as detected with hTdp1 antiserum at a position approximately midway between the 44- and 158-kDa markers. In the presence of 5 mm EDTA, this fraction catalyzed the 3′-PG-to-3′-phosphate conversion with no detectable formation of 3′-hydroxyl. Titration of the activity in the peak fraction showed that it processed a 3′-phosphotyrosine oligomer 8-fold more efficiently than the PG-terminated 3′-overhang (Fig.7A), consistent with its identification as hTdp1. The single-stranded 3′-PG 14-mer was processed about 2-fold less efficiently than the 3′ overhang (not shown).Figure 7Relative efficiencies of native and recombinant end-processing activities. A 3′-phosphotyrosine 18-mer (▴), a 3′-PG 14-mer (▪), or a plasmid with a PG-terminated 3′-overhang (●,○) were treated with Sephacryl fraction 30 from human whole-cell extracts (A), recombinant hTdp1 (B, C), or recombinant scTdp (D) in the presence (open symbols) or absence (closed symbols) of Ku (75 ng). Each substrate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a 5-μl reaction containing 5 mm EDTA and no Mg2+. Conversion to a 3′-phosphate was assessed by denaturing gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purified Ku from human placenta was also found to contain substantial 3′-phosphotyrosine-processing activity. Assays of various fractions from the MonoQ chromatography step in Ku purification (see Ref. 21Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that the peak of phosphotyrosine-processing activity did not precisely coincide with Ku, but the two did overlap (data not shown). All of these results are consistent with the glycolate-removing activity in placental Ku (Fig. 3) being attributable to contaminating hTdp1 (Mr = 68,500), which comigrates with Ku70 on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and thus would not have been detected as a contaminant. To further assess the possibility that PG processing in extracts might be due to hTdp1, the 3′-PG substrates were treated with recombinant hTdp1 or scTdp1 (Fig. 8). Similar to the fractionated extracts, both recombinant tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases converted 3′-PG termini to 3′-phosphate termini in either the presence or absence of Mg2+. In each case, the putative 3′-phosphate terminus could be converted to a 3′-hydroxyl by PNKP. To determine the efficiency of the processing of 3′-PG termini by hTdp1, a 3′-phosphotyrosine DNA oligomer and the DSB substrate with a PG-terminated 3′ overhang were treated with various concentrations of the enzyme (Figs. 7B and 8B). The 3′-PG substrate required an ∼80-fold greater concentration of hTdp1 for half-maximal conversion than did the 3′-phosphotyrosine oligomer (Fig.7B), more than would have been expected based on the activities in fractionated extracts (Fig. 7A). Processing of the 3′-PG 14-mer required similarly high concentrations of hTdp1 (not shown). To assess whether this rather weak PG-processing activity might have been attributable to a bacterial contaminant rather than to hTdp1, the 3′-PG 14-mer was treated with various dilutions of crude bacterial lysates from both the hTDP1-overexpressing strain and the strain transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 8B). Only the lysate from hTDP1-overexpressing bacteria catalyzed conversion of 3′-PG to 3′-phosphate termini, confirming that the activity was attributable to hTdp1. The low PG-processing efficiency of the recombinant hTdp1 also raises the question of whether the PG-processing activity in human cell extracts, despite its functional similarity, might be some enzyme other than hTdp1. To address this question, the peak fraction of PG-processing activity from Sephacryl chromatography was immunodepleted with rabbit antiserum to hTdp1 (Fig. 9). At a 1/20 dilution, this antiserum completely eliminated 3′-PG-processing activity, whereas preimmune serum did not. These results are consistent with hTdp1 being the primary 3′-PG-processing activity for 3′ overhangs in human cell extracts. In contrast to hTdp1, recombinant scTdp1 processed the 3′-PG oligomer almost as efficiently as the 3′-phosphotyrosyl oligomer (Fig. 7D). The copurification of hTdp1 with human placental Ku raised the possibility that Ku might recruit hTdp1 to DNA ends. To examine this possibility, hTdp1-catalyzed glycolate removal from the plasmid with a protruding 3′-PG terminus was assayed in the presence or absence of 15 μg/ml recombinant Ku, which unlike native placental Ku was free of any PG-processing activity. As shown in Fig. 8C, the effect of Ku was inhibitory, decreasing the susceptibility of the substrate to hTdp1-mediated processing by approximately 16-fold, presumably because Ku binding rendered DNA ends less accessible. Thus, there was no evidence for recruitment of hTdp1 to DNA ends by Ku, although it is possible that the recombinant proteins differ from the native proteins in ways that interfere with such interactions. DSBs induced by the radiomimetic antibiotics neocarzinostatin and calicheamicin typically have PG-terminated 3′ overhangs at one end of the break (3Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Dedon P.C. Goldberg I.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). About half of radiation-induced strand breaks also have 3′-PG termini (5Henner W.D. Rodriguez L.O. Hecht S.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 711-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and many of these are presumably on 3′ overhangs of DSBs. In the repair of such lesions, removal of the 3′-PG termini must necessarily precede any polymerase-mediated gap filling and/or religation of the DSB. However, while the human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Ape1 can remove PGs from internal breaks in double-stranded DNA (24Demple B. Harrison L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), PGs on blunt and recessed 3′ termini of DSBs are relatively resistant to this enzyme, and PGs on 3′ overhangs are completely refractory (6Suh D. Wilson III D.M. Povirk L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The human polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase PNKP, which removes 3′ phosphates from single-stranded 3′ termini (12Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Karimi-Busheri F. Daly G. Robins P. Canas B. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Miller G.G. Fakhrai H. Davis E.M., Le Beau M.M. Weinfeld M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24187-24194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), also has no detectable effect on 3′-PGs (Fig. 3), just as was previously reported for rat polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (27Habraken Y. Verly W.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of 3′-PGs toEscherichia coli exonuclease I (28Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Radiat. Res. 1993; 135: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that PGs on 3′ overhangs might be removed by a mammalian 3′→5′ exonuclease. However, DNase III, which is the dominant 3′→5′ exonuclease in mammalian cell extracts, has no detectable effect on any 3′-PG substrates (29Inamdar K.V., Yu, Y. Povirk L.F. Radiat. Res. 2002; 157: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Wrn1 and Mre11 3′→5′ exonucleases are also unlikely candidates because 3′ overhangs, even if unblocked, are resistant to these enzymes (30Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000. 2002; 28: 2396-2405Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PGs on overhanging 3′ termini clearly are processed in Xenopus, human, and hamster cell extracts (8Chen S. Inamdar K.V. Pfeiffer P. Feldmann E. Hannah M.F., Yu, Y. Lee J.W. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24323-24330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Evidence for a 3′-phosphate intermediate in 3′-PG removal in human cell extracts suggested possible involvement of hTdp1, and indeed, both hTdp1 and scTdp1 were found to catalyze similar glycolate removal from a single-stranded oligomer as well as from a single strand overhang of a DSB. Failure to detect this activity in previous studies may have been due to the very small difference in electrophoretic mobility between 3′-PG and 3′-phosphate oligomers and the relative inefficiency of PG processing by recombinant hTdp1 compared with its nominal substrate, 3′-phosphotyrosine. The difference in relative preference for 3′-phosphotyrosine over 3′-PG substrates, 80-fold for purified recombinant hTdp1 versus8-fold for the native activity in extracts, raises the question of whether most of the native PG-processing activity might be attributable to some functionally similar but distinct enzyme. While this possibility has not been rigorously eliminated, it seems unlikely, as such an enzyme would have to precisely coelute from Sephacryl with hTdp1 and would have to cross-react with antibody raised to recombinant hTdp1 to explain the immunodepletion data. More likely, the different substrate preferences may be attributable to the presence of the histidine tag, differences in posttranslational modification in humanversus bacterial cells, or interactions with other proteins in the fractionated extract. It is also possible that there was a partial degradation of the recombinant protein during purification and storage that resulted in selective loss of PG-processing activity. In either case the relatively greater activity of the native enzyme toward PG termini makes a biological role in PG removal more plausible. Nevertheless, it remains possible that other more robust activities for PG removal exist in vivo but that they are degraded or otherwise inactive in extracts. It is also possible that only the initial rapid phase of PG processing is attributable to hTdp1, and that some other enzyme is responsible for the slower removal that occurs after the DNA-PK repair complex has formed on DSB ends. Thus, conclusive proof of the importance of hTdp1 in processing of terminally blocked, free radical-mediated DSBs must await construction of hTdp1-null mutants. If such a role is confirmed, the relative inefficiency of hTdp1 in PG removal may make it an attractive target for radiosensitization as a relatively modest decrease in hTdp1 activity might be sufficient to significantly inhibit the repair of radiation-induced DSBs and enhance their cytotoxicity.

IR radiation selectively excites individual NH stretch vibrational fundamentals of single conformations of the molecule in the early portions of a gas-phase expansion, and then this excited population is collisionally recooled into its conformational minima for subsequent conformation-specific detection. Efficient isomerization is induced by the IR excitation that redistributes population between the same conformations that have population in the absence of IR excitation. The quantum yields for transfer of the population into the various conformational minima depend uniquely on which conformation is excited and on which NH stretch vibration is excited within a given conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1991669931,"The invasion of migratory cells through connective tissues involves metallo- and serine types of cell surface proteases. We show that formation of a novel protease complex, consisting of the membrane-bound prolyl peptidases seprase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), at invadopodia of migratory fibroblasts is a prerequisite for cell invasion and migration on a collagenous matrix. Seprase and DPPIV form a complex on the cell surface that elicits both gelatin binding and gelatinase activities localized at invadopodia of cells migrating on collagenous fibers. The protease complex participates in the binding to gelatin and localized gelatin degradation, cellular migration, and monolayer wound closure. Serine protease inhibitors can block the gelatinase activity and the localized gelatin degradation by cells. Antibodies to the gelatin-binding domain of DPPIV reduce the cellular abilities of the proteases to degrade gelatin but do not affect cellular adhesion or spreading on type I collagen. Furthermore, expression of the seprase-DPPIV complex is restricted to migratory cells involved in wound closure in vitro and in connective tissue cells during closure of gingival wounds but not in differentiated tissue cells. Thus, we have identified cell surface proteolytic activities, which are non-metalloproteases, seprase and DPPIV, that are responsible for the tissue-invasive phenotype."

Envelope proteins are particularly accessible to host immune responses and to drug therapy and thus could be used to control this important human pathogen. Because of its outstanding importance, several approaches have been developed to identify and characterize additional H. pylori envelope proteins. Global theoretical predictions of outer membrane proteins based on the two completely sequenced genomes and physico-chemical properties and sequence similarities to proteins with known surface localization have yielded 64 putative candidates (12Alm R.A. Bina J. Andrews B.M. Doig P. Hancock R.E. Trust T.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4155-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Several of these have been experimentally verified, but it is unclear if all of the predicted surface proteins are expressed. Moreover, several proposed surface proteins including urease, Hsp60, Hsp70, flagellar sheath protein, and catalase do not share common properties of surface proteins and are therefore neglected by theoretical predictions. Surface proteins including outer membrane proteins can be experimentally identified by selective solubilization and sucrose gradient centrifugation for enrichment of outer membrane fractions. InH. pylori, these techniques yielded enriched outer membrane fractions, and many putative surface proteins have been found. However, these preparations are heavily contaminated by inner membrane components (13Nilsson C.L. Larsson T. Gustafsson E. Karlsson K.A. Davidsson P. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2148-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Exner M.M. Doig P. Trust T.J. Hancock R.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so that independent evidence, such as specific antibody binding to intact bacteria, is necessary to verify true surface proteins (15Doig P. Trust T.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4526-4533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five outer membrane proteins with the typical β-barrel structure were identified by their anomalous temperature-dependent migration in polyacrylamide gels (14Exner M.M. Doig P. Trust T.J. Hancock R.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but surface proteins with different structures escaped this method. Selective labeling with reactive reagents is an alternative approach to identify surface proteins. In H. pylori urease could be labeled with 125I demonstrating its surface localization (16Dunn B.E. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling with a reactive sugar ligand confirmed the specific binding of the Lewisb antigen to the surface-exposedH. pylori adhesin BabA (3Ilver D. Arnqvist A. Ogren J. Frick I.M. Kersulyte D. Incecik E.T. Berg D.E. Covacci A. Engstrand L. Boren T. Science. 1998; 279: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic reagent S-NHS-LC-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate) allowed us to selectively biotinylate surface proteins of Escherichia coli although to a lesser extent periplasmic proteins were also labeled (17Bradburne J.A. Godfrey P. Choi J.H. Mathis J.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we confirmed the periplasmic labeling for the well characterized MalE protein of E. coli and showed that lysis followed by membrane purification removes all of the labeled MalE protein. We then applied this technique to identify surface proteins of H. pylori. Biotinylated membrane proteins of H. pyloriwere further enriched by avidin-affinity chromatography, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. This generally applicable approach led to the rapid experimental identification of both new and previously known H. pylori envelope and putative surface proteins. E. coli HB2151 was grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% maltose, to induce the mal operon (18Ehrmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3539-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 0.1% hydrolysated casein, and 1 μm biotin to block active uptake of the biotinylation reagent. The cells were harvested at an OD600 nm of 0.6–0.7, corresponding to the mid-exponential growth phase. H. pylori strain 26695 (19Eaton K.A. Morgan D.R. Krakowka S. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured at 37 °C in a micro-aerobic atmosphere (5% O2, 85% N2, and 10% CO2) on serum-agar plates (20Odenbreit S. Wieland B. Haas R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6960-6967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 3 days, and grown for 1 additional day on fresh plates. The bacteria were harvested and suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm biotin at an OD600 nm of 2.5–3.5 (equivalent to 1–2 × 109 colony-forming units). The bacteria were surface-labeled by incubation with 200 μm(final concentration) S-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding two volumes of TNKCM (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2). After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation at 3,500 ×g for 10 min and washed three times with TNKCM. The viability of the bacteria before and after labeling was determined by plating on serum-agar and by flow cytometry as well as fluorescence microscopy using a membrane-permeable (Syto9) and a membrane-impermeable (propidium iodide) fluorophore according to the manufacturer's instructions (LIVE/DEAD kit, Molecular Probes) except that an altered ratio in millimolar of 3:27 of the dyes Syto9/propidium iodide was used. To isolate biotinylated membrane proteins, labeled bacteria were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2 with protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 2.9 mm benzamidin) and disrupted by 4 passages through a French press at 15,000 lb/in2. After removal of intact bacteria by two centrifugations at 4,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, membranes were pelleted at 40,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min and then washed, and resuspended in TKE (50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). Membranes were adjusted to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml, solubilized with 2% zwittergent 3-14 (Fluka), and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with head-over-head mixing. Insoluble membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C. The soluble fraction was purified by affinity chromatography on reversibly binding avidin-agarose according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with slight modifications. In brief, 20–24 mg of membrane proteins were diluted 10-fold in 100 mmNaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2 and mixed with 1 ml of avidin-agarose matrix equilibrated in washing buffer (100 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 0.2% zwittergent). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the matrix was washed five times with 2 ml of washing buffer. The biotinylated proteins were eluted by rising the avidin-agarose five times for 15 min at 37 °C with washing buffer containing 5 mmd-biotin. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by acetone precipitation. One dimensional SDS-PAGE and blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were performed according to standard protocols. Biotinylated proteins were detected on the blots using neutravidin-peroxidase staining (Pierce) and chemiluminescent visualization (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The maltose-binding protein MalE was detected with a monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and a polyclonal anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Nordic). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by MALDI-MS were performed as described previously (21Jungblut P.R. Bumann D. Haas G. Zimny-Arndt U. Holland P. Lamer S. Siejak F. Aebischer A. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In brief, protein samples were solubilized for 30 min at ambient temperature in 9m urea, 1% CHAPS, 70 mm dithiothreitol, 2% Servalyte pI 2–4 (Serva). For the resolution of protein samples a 23 × 30 cm two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system was used. For the identification of proteins 200–300 μg (total cell samples) or 50–70 μg (biotinylated proteins) were applied to the anodic side of the IEF gel. Proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting after in-gel tryptic digestion of excised spots. The peptide mixture was mixed (1:1) with a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, and 2 μl were applied to the sample template of a MALDI mass spectrometer (Voyager Elite, Perseptive). Peptide mass fingerprints were searched with the program MS-FIT (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml/msfit.htm) using all H. pylori proteins in the NCBI data base allowing a mass accuracy of 100 ppm for the peptide masses. Partial enzymatic cleavages leaving two cleavage sites, oxidation of methionine, pyroglutamic acid formation at the N-terminal glutamine, and modification of cysteine by acrylamide were considered in these searches. Surface proteins may mediate important pathogen-host interactions in H. pylori infections. To identify novelHelicobacter surface proteins, we adapted a method that had been originally developed for E. coli (17Bradburne J.A. Godfrey P. Choi J.H. Mathis J.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, bacteria are treated with the hydrophilic biotinylation reagent S-NHS-LC-biotin that cannot permeate lipid bilayers. As a result of its limited access, this compound reacts preferentially with free amino groups of surface proteins. However, some of the reagent obviously enters the periplasm possibly through water-filled channels of E. coli outer membrane porins, resulting in substantial labeling of periplasmic proteins, which potentially confuses the localization of previously uncharacterized proteins. To confirm these studies, we labeled E. coli lysate and intact cells, separated the samples by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and detected incorporated biotin by neutravidin staining (data not shown). Almost all proteins of the labeled lysate were biotinylated suggesting that most E. coli proteins contain accessible free amino groups. In contrast, labeling of intact bacteria resulted in a small subset of biotinylated putative surface proteins. However, MalE, which is a well characterized periplasmic protein and can be detected with a commercial monoclonal antibody, was also heavily labeled. We first tried to enhance the labeling selectivity by lowering the reagent concentration. A 5-fold lower amount (200 μm) compared with the original procedure still gave sufficiently strong biotinylation, but this did not prevent biotinylation of MalE. We then tried to increase selectivity by using a larger biotinylation reagent. As periplasmic labeling appears to be the result of permeation of the reagent through porin channels, enlargement of the reagent might prevent access to the periplasm resulting in higher selectivity. We increased the molecular weight by coupling sulfo-succinimidyl-6-[3′-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionamido]hexanoate via its sulfhydryl group to (+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidoproprionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine. The resulting biotinylation compound has a calculated molecular mass of 943 Da, which exceeds the exclusion limit of reported porin channels (< 600 Da, OmpF in E. coli, Refs. 22Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 241-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 23Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); <800 Da,Salmonella typhimurium, Ref. 24Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2176-2178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, this compound substantially reduced the relative biotinylation of MalE in comparison with other protein species, but the remaining MalE labeling was still not acceptable (data not shown). As the reagent was difficult to generate we discontinued its use. As the various attempts to enhance selectivity were only partially successful, we decided to remove the contaminating periplasmic biotin-labeled proteins by cell lysis followed by membrane sedimentation. After this simple membrane enrichment, there remained no detectable MalE protein suggesting that the periplasmatic proteins were indeed efficiently removed (Fig. 1). Accordingly, the remaining biotinylated proteins most likely represent true surface proteins (see “Discussion”). We then applied this modified procedure to H. pylori. In contrast to E. coli, this organism is especially prone to autolysis in vitro (25Phadnis S.H. Parlow M.H. Levy M. Ilver D. Caulkins C.M. Connors J.B. Dunn B.E. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 905-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Marcus E.A. Scott D.R. Helicobacter. 2001; 6: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which could prevent interpretable results. To test if such unwanted lysis occurred during labeling, the viability of the bacteria was determined before and after labeling by plating, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometric analysis using a combination of membrane-permeable and non-permeable fluorescent dyes (LIVE/DEAD staining). Plating indicated that less than 10% of the bacteria were killed during incubation and washing. Moreover, only 2–5% of the bacteria had a compromised membrane integrity after labeling as determined by LIVE/DEAD staining. The small portion of killed bacteria might have released some cytosolic material but most of this would be removed during subsequent washing steps. Therefore cytosolic components are not likely to contaminate the labeled proteins. In H. pylori, unlabeled samples contained only one weakly avidin-binding spot (apparent molecular mass of about 20 kDa, pI >9.0; data not shown) as shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis, blotting, and avidin-peroxidase conjugate staining. When H. pylorilysates were labeled, almost all proteins that could be detected by staining with Coomassie Blue were also biotinylated, indicating that almost all proteins possess accessible amino groups (Fig.2). Among the very few proteins that did not bind avidin, there were the previously identified citrate synthase and NapA (21Jungblut P.R. Bumann D. Haas G. Zimny-Arndt U. Holland P. Lamer S. Siejak F. Aebischer A. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp60 and the urease β-subunit were present in high amounts but gave comparatively weak signals in the neutravidin-peroxidase staining compared with other less abundant spots. This is surprising because Hsp60, NapA, and urease β-subunit contain many lysine residues. Possibly, these lysines are not readily accessible to the biotinylation reagent. In contrast to the almost complete labeling of lysate proteins, labeled intact H. pylori contained only 102 spots that were reproducibly biotinylated and resolved in three independent experiments (Fig. 3). Several species appeared as horizontal spot series instead of single spots, and such spot series might represent different modifications of a single protein species (see below). Taking this into account, 34 distinct protein species were resolved. Most species had isoelectric points in the alkaline range. A comparison of labeled intact cells versus labeled lysates (Figs. 2 and 3) revealed a high selectivity of biotinylation as expected for a hydrophilic reagent and intact membranes. In contrast, the uncharged sulfhydryl-reactive reagent polyethylene oxide-iodoacetyl biotin labeled several known cytoplasmic proteins, indicating permeation of the bacterial membranes. Based on our experience with labeled periplasmic proteins in E. coli that can be effectively removed by membrane isolation (see above), we enriched putative biotinylated Helicobactersurface proteins by lysis and membrane sedimentation. Surprisingly, in the case of Helicobacter this did not result in a major change in the two-dimensional electrophoretic pattern of biotinylated proteins, and all spots were preserved suggesting that few if any periplasmic proteins had been labeled. One possible explanation could be that H. pylori strain 26695 may lack large porin channels through which the biotinylation reagent can get access to the periplasm (see “Discussion”). Additional studies are required to clarify this issue. To further enrich the biotinylated proteins, they were solubilized with zwittergent 3-14 and applied to a reversible biotin-binding avidin D column and washed and eluted with biotin. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of these purified labeled proteins revealed 162 spots corresponding to 59 different species (see above) as detected by silver staining (Fig. 4 a) most of which (53Radcliff F.J. Hazell S.L. Kolesnikow T. Doidge C. Lee A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4668-4674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol.

The remaining 6 species were considered minor contaminants of non-biotinylated proteins as indicated by their weak silver staining. Moreover, 76 additional spots corresponding to 29 different species appeared in the neutravidin-peroxidase staining but were not visualized by silver staining probably due to their low amount. Compared with whole biotinylated H. pylori, the overall avidin binding patterns of purified proteins were quite similar but more complex and difficult to assign because of longer spot series and more total detectable species (48 spots in addition). Possibly, these additional species escaped detection in non-enriched whole cell samples because of low abundance. In contrast, all but 2 of 34 biotinylated proteins from whole H. pylori could also be detected in the enriched protein fraction. To tentatively identify the biotinylated proteins, we compared the avidin binding patterns with the H. pylori strain 26695 reference pattern in our data base (www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE, Ref. 21Jungblut P.R. Bumann D. Haas G. Zimny-Arndt U. Holland P. Lamer S. Siejak F. Aebischer A. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 710-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The relative positions of 18 biotinylated species matched with previously identifiedHelicobacter proteins (TableI). To confirm these tentative assignments, the 13 most abundant biotinylated species were cut out from the blots, digested, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. All of the direct identifications were consistent with the indirect assignments, which confirmed the validity of the indirect approach. For 8 of 13 proteins, tryptic peptide masses that fit theoretical masses covered more than 30% of the corresponding protein sequence. This allowed confident identification. For spots 6 and 10, sequence coverage was lower but all major mass peaks matched with HP1118 and HP1098, respectively. All 10 assignments and 2 additional proteins with weak sequence coverage (HP0231, HP0659) verified the previous identification based on comparison to the standard proteome pattern, suggesting the validity of this indirect approach.Table ISurface-exposed proteins of H. pylori1-a Sequence coverage of matching peptides in tryptic peptide mass fingerprints; c, identified by comparison with the standard proteome pattern.1-b sur, surface; sec, secreted; per, periplasm; homologue, paralogue or orthologue in other organisms.1-c Strongly recognized by sera from infected patients according to combined data from three studies (Refs. 41McAtee C.P.

In contrast, most labeled protein species appeared as horizontal spot series, which could represent the same protein with slight modifications that alter the pI. This was confirmed for three members of a biotinylated spot series corresponding to catalase (data not shown). Probably, a variable number of amino groups reacted with the biotinylation reagent resulting in a differential loss of protonable residues and stepwise decreasing pI values. The pI difference between consecutive members of spot series were largely constant and in the range of one protonable group per molecule (ΔpI of ∼0.05), which is consistent with this hypothesis. Using a 25-fold greater amount of biotinylation reagent, many extensive spot series were obtained (data not shown). Moreover, acidic members of spot series were enriched during the avidin-affinity chromatography, which further enriches for highly biotinylated species. Surface proteins of H. pylori mediate important pathogen-host interactions that are essential for colonization, adherence, survival, and virulence of this pathogen. To identifyH. pylori surface proteins, several approaches have been used (see the Introduction). Using a global proteome approach, we combined a selective biotinylation of free amino groups with membrane isolation followed by affinity purification of solubilized proteins, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and peptide mass fingerprinting. A prerequisite for this method is the presence of free amino groups that are exposed to the external medium. The genome sequences indicate that except for two predicted proteins all contain one or several lysine residues. 2D. Frishman, personal communication. Many of these residues seem to be on the outside of the corresponding protein structures, because almost all detectable protein species inH. pylori lysates can be labeled using the hydrophilic biotinylation reagent S-NHS-LC-biotin that reacts with free amino groups. In contrast, in intact bacteria only a subset of the proteome was labeled, indicating that the hydrophobic membranes limited the accessibility of most proteins for the highly hydrophilic biotinylation reagent. While the inner membrane is essentially impermeable for the reagent, previous studies (17Bradburne J.A. Godfrey P. Choi J.H. Mathis J.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which we confirmed in this study, have shown that in E. coli, the outer membrane is partially permeable for S-NHS-LC-biotin, resulting in substantial labeling of periplasmic proteins. Outer membrane porins contain water-filled channels that permit the diffusion of hydrophilic molecules with molecular masses up to 800 Da (24Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2176-2178Abstract Full"
https://openalex.org/W1980609038,"Apoptosis is an integral aspect of B lymphocyte development and homeostasis and is regulated by the engagement of antigen costimulatory and cytokine receptors. Although it is well established that interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a potent anti-apoptotic cytokine for B lymphocytes, little is known about the IL-4-induced molecular events regulating cell survival. Stat6 is rapidly activated after IL-4 stimulation, but its role in B lymphocyte apoptosis has not been explored. In this report we demonstrate that Stat6 is a critical signaling molecule for IL-4 in protecting primary B cells from passive and Fas-induced cell death. We show that expression of the Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL, is induced maximally by IL-4 and anti-IgM/IL-4 in a Stat6-dependent manner. Additionally, we demonstrate thatbcl-xL transcription is likely to be directly activated through a Stat6 binding site in the bcl-xL-flanking region. Finally, reconstitution of Stat6-deficient splenic B cells with Bcl-xL was able to protect those cells from Fas-induced cell death. These results suggest that the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-4 in B cells is mediated through the activation of Stat6 and subsequent transcription of Bcl-xL.

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Primed B lymphocytes can also be actively programmed to die through engagement of cell surface Fas by encountering Fas ligand (FasL) on activated T cells. These highly regulated processes are thought to be important for removing autoreactive B cells, terminating an immune response, and maintaining a state of equilibrium.The activation or suppression of apoptosis is regulated in part by the members of the Bcl-2 family, proteins found in various cytoplasmic membranes including mitochondrial membranes (for review, see Refs. 2Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (suppl.): 1693-1700Google Scholarand 3Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Several members, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are antagonistic to apoptotic stimuli and are thought to function by preserving mitochondrial membrane integrity and preventing cytochrome crelease into the cytoplasm. Other Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bad, promote apoptosis. These pro-apoptotic proteins are thought to antagonize the function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL through heterodimer formation. Consequently, the relative levels of intracellular pro-versus anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are critical in determining the viability of a cell. Clearly it is of interest to understand how the expression of these proteins is regulated in response to external stimuli.The cytokine IL-41 has been demonstrated to be a potent cofactor for B and T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation (for review, see Ref. 4Paul W.E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 204: 208-216PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, its role as an anti-apoptotic factor has been studied extensively. IL-4 has been demonstrated to prevent cell death by neglect of resting T and B lymphocytes after growth factor withdrawal in culture (5Vella A. Teague T.K. Ihle J. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp.

It can also prevent apoptosis of B cells induced by Ig cross-linking and glucocorticoids and render activated B cells insensitive to Fas ligation (7Parry S.L. Hasbold J. Holman M. Klaus G.G. J.

Colasante A. Piantelli M. Musiani P. Aiello F.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 4199-4205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular events induced by IL-4 that regulate cell survival are poorly understood.Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6) is a critical mediator of IL-4 signaling (for review, see Ref. 10Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Stat6 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor recruited specifically to the IL-4 receptor and activated by phosphorylation after IL-4 stimulation. Activated Stat6 homodimers are capable of translocating to the nucleus where they can influence the transcription of IL-4-responsive genes. The importance of Stat6 in IL-4 signal transduction has been demonstrated in Stat6-deficient lymphocytes, which are unable to proliferate normally in response to IL-4, are defective in their ability to activate IL-4 responsive genes, and are unable to undergo IL-4-dependent Th2 differentiation (11Shimoda K. van Deursen J.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). However, Stat6 does not appear to be required for the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-4 in resting or activated T cells or in myeloid cell lines (5Vella A. Teague T.K. Ihle J. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 14Wurster A.L. Withers D.J. Uchida T. White M.F. Grusby M.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1996-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether Stat6 is a required intermediary for the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-4 on B cells.In this study we demonstrate that in contrast to T lymphocytes, Stat6 signaling is involved in the anti-apoptotic activities of IL-4 in primary B cells that were committed to die by either growth factor withdrawal or by Fas ligation. We find that Stat6-deficient B cells are defective in their ability to maximally induce expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL, in response to IL-4 stimulation. Additionally, we have identified a Stat6-responsive element upstream of the bcl-xL, gene suggesting that Stat6 is directly responsible for activating the IL-4-induced transcription of this anti-apoptotic factor. Finally, reconstitution of Bcl-xL expression in Stat6-deficient primary B cells renders the cells resistant to Fas-induced cell death.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have demonstrated that IL-4 fails to efficiently rescue Stat6-deficient B cells from apoptosis produced by growth factor withdrawal or Fas engagement. We find that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL, is one likely candidate target gene directly activated by Stat6 that can modulate the response of B cells to apoptotic stimuli.In contrast to what we observed in B cells, Stat6 is not a critical regulator of the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-4 in T cells (Fig.1A and Refs. 5Vella A. Teague T.K. Ihle J. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This difference is reminiscent of the recent observation that IL-6 is a potent anti-apoptotic factor for resting T cells but not for activated T cells (40Teague T.K. Schaefer B.C. Hildeman D. Bender J. Mitchell T. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this situation, T cell activation appears to alter the cellular environment so that IL-6-induced Stat signaling is less potent. Although robust Stat6 activation is observed in both T cells and B cells after IL-4 exposure, the cellular context of this signal is clearly important in determining the anti-apoptotic outcome of IL-4 signaling.A number of cytokines are capable of suppressing apoptosis, and Bcl-xL expression has been demonstrated to be cytokine-inducible in a variety of systems. For example, IL-3 is required as a survival factor for a number of cytokine-dependent cell lines and is capable of inducing Bcl-xL expression in both myeloid and pro-B cell lines in a Jak kinase-dependent manner (30Packham G. White E.L. Eischen C.M. Yang H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Grillot D.A. Zambetti G.P. Nunez G. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Additionally, IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor are both capable of inducing Bcl-xL expression in wild type mouse bone marrow cells but not in Stat5a/b-deficient bone marrow cells, and the deficient cells are characterized by increased apoptosis (31Kieslinger M. Woldman I. Moriggl R. Hofmann J. Marine J.C. Ihle J.N. Beug H. Decker T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 232-244PubMed Google Scholar). Stat5 and Stat3 have also been recently demonstrated to activate the bcl-xL expression directly although through a different Stat response element than the one we have described here for Stat6 (32Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 41Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). The Stat5-responsive element is composed of two tandem GAS sites in the first intron ofbcl-xL (Fig. 4A). Not surprisingly we found that Stat6 was incapable of activating transcription through the Stat5 sites in our reporter assays since these are GAS elements with only a three-base pair spacer within the palindromes (Fig. 4C and data not shown). These findings suggest that bcl-xLtranscription can be regulated by a number of different cytokines through different Stat transcription factors, but this regulation is not necessarily mediated by the same Stat response elements in thebcl-xL gene. Interestingly, a recent report suggests that IL-15 is able to activate Stat6 specifically in mast cells and that in this cell type Stat6 is able to direct IL-15-induced bcl-xLtranscription through the Stat5 sites (42Masuda A. Matsuguchi T. Yamaki K. Hayakawa T. Yoshikai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26107-26113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This result implies that the context of the cytokine-Stat signal can also strongly influence downstream changes in gene regulation.We have demonstrated here that both IL-4 and IgM stimulation induce Fas-resistance in activated B cells in a manner that correlates with increased bcl-xL mRNA levels. It has been previously shown that IL-4- and anti-IgM-induced Fas resistance are mediated by signaling pathways that differ both in their time course and dependence on protein kinase C activation (8Foote L.C. Howard R.G. Marshak-Rothstein A. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2749-2753PubMed Google Scholar). Both IL-4 and anti-IgM stimulation ultimately result in increased bcl-xL transcription, although the mechanism of promoter activation is likely to be different for the two stimuli. Here we show that Stat6 is an IL-4-induced transcription factor that directly activates a bcl-xLregulatory element. Additionally we observed that the synergistic induction of Bcl-xL expression after IL-4 and antigen receptor stimulation is especially compromised in the absence of Stat6 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, anti-IgM has been shown to induce Stat6 phosphorylation, although this apparently plays no role in Ig-mediated Fas resistance or Bcl-xL expression (Figs. 2 and 3) (46Karras J.G. Wang Z. Coniglio S.J. Frank D.A. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-IgM stimulation has also been shown to induce the activation of NFκB and NFAT transcription factors, and a number of binding sites for these factors are present in the bcl-xL promoter region (37Grillot D.A. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar,43Venkataraman L. Francis D.A. Wang Z. Liu J. Rothstein T.L. Sen R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 44Liu J.L. Chiles T.C. Sen R.J. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1685-1691PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). However, we have yet been able to identify an anti-IgM responsive element in the bcl-xL promoter region (data not shown), suggesting that regulatory elements outside of the proximal promoter element may contribute to anti-IgM-induced bcl-xLexpression. It will be interesting to further define the regulatory elements that are involved in anti-IgM-induced bcl-xLtranscription and how these elements potentially cooperate with Stat6 to activate bcl-xL transcription synergistically.Even in the absence of Stat6, however, we observed that IL-4 was capable of partially rescuing B cells from passive cell death (Fig.1B) and inducing low levels of Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 3). Clearly other signal transduction pathways can be activated in response to IL-4 in addition to Stat6, and these may also contribute to the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-4. IRS-2 is an additional signaling protein that associates with the IL-4 receptor and is rapidly phosphorylated in lymphocytes after IL-4 treatment (23Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G., Jr. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). IRS-2 activation results in the recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ultimately Akt activation. This cascade has been suggested to lead to protection from apoptosis, and furthermore, B cells lacking the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have been shown to be deficient in their response to the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-4 (25Zamorano J. Wang H.Y. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4926-4934PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, we do not find that IRS-2 activation or Akt activation is absolutely required for IL-4-mediated rescue from growth factor withdrawal in that B cells from IRS-2-deficient mice are competent in their anti-apoptotic response to IL-4. (Fig. 1C). An additional pathway from the IL-4 receptor has also been implicated in rescue from apoptosis in myeloid cell lines (15Zamorano J. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway emanates from a different phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the IL-4 receptor that is not recognized by Stat6 or IRS-2. The nature of this pathway has not yet been defined, and its role in opposing apoptosis in primary B cells has not been reported.Although our results suggest that Bcl-xL is an important regulator of B cell apoptosis, we do not observe a direct correlation between Bcl-xL expression and protection from apoptosis. Both IL-4 and anti-IgM stimulation induce similar amounts of Bcl-xL protein in Stat6-deficient B cells, but only anti-IgM stimulation is protective of Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Additionally, overexpression of Bcl-xL in our retroviral gene expression experiments as well as in other reports resulted in only partial protection from Fas-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that other important factors are also induced by IL-4 or antigen receptor stimulation that modulate apoptosis. One likely candidate is a recently described anti-apoptotic factor, FAIM, which is induced specifically by anti-IgM stimulation in primary B cells and is capable of blocking Fas-induced cell death when overexpressed in B cell lines (48Schneider T.J. Fischer G.M. Donohoe T.J. Colarusso T.P. Rothstein T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also, antigen receptor stimulation has been demonstrated to block the association of Fas with its direct downstream effector, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), in a manner that is independent of new protein synthesis (49Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2378-2381PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found that BAG-1, a Bcl-2-associating protein with anti-apoptotic activities, is induced in primary B cells by IL-4 in a Stat6-dependent manner (50Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Clearly, the coordinated expression of a number of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors that are regulated by multiple signals is critical for determining the appropriate cellular response to a death signal.Because Bcl-2 family members are important regulators of cell survival, there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the role of these proteins in the generation of an oncogenic state. Bcl-xL in particular was shown to be specifically activated by retroviral insertion in a number of murine myeloid and T cell leukemias (30Packham G. White E.L. Eischen C.M. Yang H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Grillot D.A. Zambetti G.P. Nunez G. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because Stat proteins play important roles in cellular proliferation and apoptosis, they have also been implicated in playing a causative role in oncogenesis. Indeed, a mutant form of Stat3 was recently demonstrated to directly mediate cellular transformation (51Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a link between constitutive Stat3 activation and disregulated Bcl-xL expression was reported in squamous cell carcinomas (52Grandis J.R. Drenning S.D. Zeng Q. Watkins S.C. Melhem M.F. Endo S. Johnson D.E. Huang L., He, Y. Kim J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Constitutive Stat6 activation has also been associated with specific tumor cells (10Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether disregulated Stat6 can affect cellular transformation through the induction of Bcl-xL expression. Both resting and activated mature B lymphocytes require cytokine or antigenic survival signals for viability and die passively by neglect in their absence (for review, see Ref. 1Rothstein T.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Primed B lymphocytes can also be actively programmed to die through engagement of cell surface Fas by encountering Fas ligand (FasL) on activated T cells. These highly regulated processes are thought to be important for removing autoreactive B cells, terminating an immune response, and maintaining a state of equilibrium. The activation or suppression of apoptosis is regulated in part by the members of the Bcl-2 family, proteins found in various cytoplasmic membranes including mitochondrial membranes (for review, see Refs. 2Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (suppl.): 1693-1700Google Scholarand 3Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Several members, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are antagonistic to apoptotic stimuli and are thought to function by preserving mitochondrial membrane integrity and preventing cytochrome crelease into the cytoplasm. Other Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bad, promote apoptosis. These pro-apoptotic proteins are thought to antagonize the function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL through heterodimer formation. Consequently, the relative levels of intracellular pro-versus anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are critical in determining the viability of a cell. Clearly it is of interest to understand how the expression of these proteins is regulated in response to external stimuli. The cytokine IL-41 has been demonstrated to be a potent cofactor for B and T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation (for review, see Ref. 4Paul W.E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 204: 208-216PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, its role as an anti-apoptotic factor has been studied extensively. IL-4 has been demonstrated to prevent cell death by neglect of resting T and B lymphocytes after growth factor withdrawal in culture (5Vella A. Teague T.K. Ihle J. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6Illera V.A. Perandones C.E. Stunz L.L. Mower D.A., Jr. Ashman R.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2965-2973PubMed Google Scholar). It can also prevent apoptosis of B cells induced by Ig cross-linking and glucocorticoids and render activated B cells insensitive to Fas ligation (7Parry S.L. Hasbold J. Holman M. Klaus G.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2821-2829PubMed Google Scholar, 8Foote L.C. Howard R.G. Marshak-Rothstein A. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2749-2753PubMed Google Scholar, 9Brunetti M. Martelli N.

Additionally we observed that the synergistic induction of Bcl-xL expression after IL-4 and antigen receptor stimulation is especially compromised in the absence of Stat6 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, anti-IgM has been shown to induce Stat6 phosphorylation, although this apparently plays no role in Ig-mediated Fas resistance or Bcl-xL expression (Figs. 2 and 3) (46Karras J.G. Wang Z. Coniglio S.J. Frank D.A. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-IgM stimulation has also been shown to induce the activation of NFκB and NFAT transcription factors, and a number of binding sites for these factors are present in the bcl-xL promoter region (37Grillot D.A. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar,43Venkataraman L. Francis D.A. Wang Z. Liu J. Rothstein T.L.

However, we have yet been able to identify an anti-IgM responsive element in the bcl-xL promoter region (data not shown), suggesting that regulatory elements outside of the proximal promoter element may contribute to anti-IgM-induced bcl-xLexpression. It will be interesting to further define the regulatory elements that are involved in anti-IgM-induced bcl-xLtranscription and how these elements potentially cooperate with Stat6 to activate bcl-xL transcription synergistically.Even in the absence of Stat6, however, we observed that IL-4 was capable of partially rescuing B cells from passive cell death (Fig.1B) and inducing low levels of Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 3). Clearly other signal transduction pathways can be activated in response to IL-4 in addition to Stat6, and these may also contribute to the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-4. IRS-2 is an additional signaling protein that associates with the IL-4 receptor and is rapidly phosphorylated in lymphocytes after IL-4 treatment (23Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G., Jr. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). IRS-2 activation results in the recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ultimately Akt activation. This cascade has been suggested to lead to protection from apoptosis, and furthermore, B cells lacking the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have been shown to be deficient in their response to the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-4 (25Zamorano J. Wang H.Y. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4926-4934PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, we do not find that IRS-2 activation or Akt activation is absolutely required for IL-4-mediated rescue from growth factor withdrawal in that B cells from IRS-2-deficient mice are competent in their anti-apoptotic response to IL-4. (Fig. 1C). An additional pathway from the IL-4 receptor has also been implicated in rescue from apoptosis in myeloid cell lines (15Zamorano J. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway emanates from a different phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the IL-4 receptor that is not recognized by Stat6 or IRS-2. The nature of this pathway has not yet been defined, and its role in opposing apoptosis in primary B cells has not been reported.Although our results suggest that Bcl-xL is an important regulator of B cell apoptosis, we do not observe a direct correlation between Bcl-xL expression and protection from apoptosis. Both IL-4 and anti-IgM stimulation induce similar amounts of Bcl-xL protein in Stat6-deficient B cells, but only anti-IgM stimulation is protective of Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Additionally, overexpression of Bcl-xL in our retroviral gene expression experiments as well as in other reports resulted in only partial protection from Fas-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that other important factors are also induced by IL-4 or antigen receptor stimulation that modulate apoptosis. One likely candidate is a recently described anti-apoptotic factor, FAIM, which is induced specifically by anti-IgM stimulation in primary B cells and is capable of blocking Fas-induced cell death when overexpressed in B cell lines (48Schneider T.J. Fischer G.M. Donohoe T.J. Colarusso T.P. Rothstein T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also, antigen receptor stimulation has been demonstrated to block the association of Fas with its direct downstream effector, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), in a manner that is independent of new protein synthesis (49Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2378-2381PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found that BAG-1, a Bcl-2-associating protein with anti-apoptotic activities, is induced in primary B cells by IL-4 in a Stat6-dependent manner (50Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Clearly, the coordinated expression of a number of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors that are regulated by multiple signals is critical for determining the appropriate cellular response to a death signal.Because Bcl-2 family members are important regulators of cell survival, there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the role of these proteins in the generation of an oncogenic state. Bcl-xL in particular was shown to be specifically activated by retroviral insertion in a number of murine myeloid and T cell leukemias (30Packham G. White E.L. Eischen C.M. Yang H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Grillot D.A. Zambetti G.P. Nunez G. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because Stat proteins play important roles in cellular proliferation and apoptosis, they have also been implicated in playing a causative role in oncogenesis. Indeed, a mutant form of Stat3 was recently demonstrated to directly mediate cellular transformation (51Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a link between constitutive Stat3 activation and disregulated Bcl-xL expression was reported in squamous cell carcinomas (52Grandis J.R. Drenning S.D. Zeng Q. Watkins S.C. Melhem M.F. Endo S. Johnson D.E. Huang L., He, Y. Kim J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Constitutive Stat6 activation has also been associated with specific tumor cells (10Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether disregulated Stat6 can affect cellular transformation through the induction of Bcl-xL expression. In this report we have demonstrated that IL-4 fails to efficiently rescue Stat6-deficient B cells from apoptosis produced by growth factor withdrawal or Fas engagement. We find that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL, is one likely candidate target gene directly activated by Stat6 that can modulate the response of B cells to apoptotic stimuli. In contrast to what we observed in B cells, Stat6 is not a critical regulator of the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-4 in T cells (Fig.1A and Refs. 5Vella A. Teague T.K. Ihle J. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, and 14Wurster A.L. Withers D.J. Uchida T. White M.F. Grusby M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This difference is reminiscent of the recent observation that IL-6 is a potent anti-apoptotic factor for resting T cells but not for activated T cells (40Teague T.K. Schaefer B.C. Hildeman D. Bender J. Mitchell T. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this situation, T cell activation appears to alter the cellular environment so that IL-6-induced Stat signaling is less potent. Although robust Stat6 activation is observed in both T cells and B cells after IL-4 exposure, the cellular context of this signal is clearly important in determining the anti-apoptotic outcome of IL-4 signaling. A number of cytokines are capable of suppressing apoptosis, and Bcl-xL expression has been demonstrated to be cytokine-inducible in a variety of systems. For example, IL-3 is required as a survival factor for a number of cytokine-dependent cell lines and is capable of inducing Bcl-xL expression in both myeloid and pro-B cell lines in a Jak kinase-dependent manner (30Packham G. White E.L. Eischen C.M. Yang H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Grillot D.A. Zambetti G.P. Nunez G. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Additionally, IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor are both capable of inducing Bcl-xL expression in wild type mouse bone marrow cells but not in Stat5a/b-deficient bone marrow cells, and the deficient cells are characterized by increased apoptosis (31Kieslinger M. Woldman I. Moriggl R. Hofmann J. Marine J.C. Ihle J.N. Beug H. Decker T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 232-244PubMed Google Scholar). Stat5 and Stat3 have also been recently demonstrated to activate the bcl-xL expression directly although through a different Stat response element than the one we have described here for Stat6 (32Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 41Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). The Stat5-responsive element is composed of two tandem GAS sites in the first intron ofbcl-xL (Fig. 4A). Not surprisingly we found that Stat6 was incapable of activating transcription through the Stat5 sites in our reporter assays since these are GAS elements with only a three-base pair spacer within the palindromes (Fig. 4C and data not shown). These findings suggest that bcl-xLtranscription can be regulated by a number of different cytokines through different Stat transcription factors, but this regulation is not necessarily mediated by the same Stat response elements in thebcl-xL gene. Interestingly, a recent report suggests that IL-15 is able to activate Stat6 specifically in mast cells and that in this cell type Stat6 is able to direct IL-15-induced bcl-xLtranscription through the Stat5 sites (42Masuda A. Matsuguchi T. Yamaki K. Hayakawa T. Yoshikai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26107-26113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This result implies that the context of the cytokine-Stat signal can also strongly influence downstream changes in gene regulation. We have demonstrated here that both IL-4 and IgM stimulation induce Fas-resistance in activated B cells in a manner that correlates with increased bcl-xL mRNA levels. It has been previously shown that IL-4- and anti-IgM-induced Fas resistance are mediated by signaling pathways that differ both in their time course and dependence on protein kinase C activation (8Foote L.C. Howard R.G. Marshak-Rothstein A. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2749-2753PubMed Google Scholar). Both IL-4 and anti-IgM stimulation ultimately result in increased bcl-xL transcription, although the mechanism of promoter activation is likely to be different for the two stimuli. Here we show that Stat6 is an IL-4-induced transcription factor that directly activates a bcl-xLregulatory element. Additionally we observed that the synergistic induction of Bcl-xL expression after IL-4 and antigen receptor stimulation is especially compromised in the absence of Stat6 (Fig. 3).

Anti-IgM stimulation has also been shown to induce the activation of NFκB and NFAT transcription factors, and a number of binding sites for these factors are present in the bcl-xL promoter region (37Grillot D.A.

Although there is considerable debate regarding the endogenous ligands activating PPARs (reviewed in Ref. 1Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a recent report utilized a direct fluorescent binding assay and parinaric acid (naturally occurring fluorescent fatty acid) to show very high affinity of PPARα (i.e. 5–17 nm K d values) for long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (13Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Likewise, the parinaric acid binding assay (14Palmer C.N.A. Wolf C.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of PPARγ containing bound LCFA (i.e.eicosapentaenoic acid) (15Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Parks D.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These data strongly support the possibility that LCFAs may be natural ligands for PPARs and that LCFAs may be more specific ligands for PPARα as compared with other PPARs. Unfortunately, physiological significance of these findings is not yet clear since it is not known whether unesterified, unbound LCFAs are present in the cell and that their concentration in the nucleus is at least in the nanomolar range.A variety of studies suggest that unesterified LCFAs are present within the cell at levels physiologically significant for regulating PPARα activity. Based on the Michaelis constant of long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, the total cellular unesterified LCFA concentration has been estimated near 20 μm (18Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 94: 4312-4317Crossref Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). However, because of the presence of intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) (reviewed in Ref. 19McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intracellular concentration of unbound, unesterified LCFAs is thought to be nearly 3 orders of magnitude lower, near 7–50 nm in liver, heart, and intestine (20Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Burnett D.A. Lysenko N. Manning J.A. Ockner R.K. Gastroenterology. 1979; 77: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Whether nuclear levels of unbound LCFAs are also in the nanomolar range is not known. Another key question is the origin of nuclear unesterified LCFAs. Nuclei do not synthesize LCFAs but must import them from the cytosol (22Gorski J. Elsing C. Bucki R. Zendzian-Piotrowska M. Stremmel W. Life Sci. 1966; 59: 2209-2215Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23Gorski J. Nawrocki A. Murthy M. Mol. Cell.

Res. 1999; 31: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) by as yet unresolved transport systems. Nearly 20 and 4% of the plasma-derived unesterified LCFAs appear in nuclei isolated from hepatocytes (23Gorski J. Nawrocki A. Murthy M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 178: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and cerebral cortex or leukemic lymphocytes (22Gorski J. Elsing C. Bucki R. Zendzian-Piotrowska M. Stremmel W.

Res. 2000; 32: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), respectively. Despite data suggesting the presence of high (up to 40% of nuclear lipids) levels of unesterified LCFAs in isolated nuclei (27Song M. Rebel G. Basic Appl. Histochem. 1987; 31: 377-387PubMed Google Scholar), subcellular fractionation studies may be complicated by LCFAs derived from lipolytic release, transfer from other intracellular sites, or cross-contamination with other membranes. Furthermore, analysis of isolated nuclei does not discriminate between unesterified LCFAs present in the nuclear envelope versus the nucleoplasm.Although mechanism(s) regulating the distribution of LCFAs to the nucleus have not yet been elucidated, several factors suggest that the liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) may be a candidate to mediate LCFA targeting to the nucleus (28Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). First, L-FABP is present in the highest concentration in the cytoplasm (19McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, L-FABP increases the cellular uptake of naturally occurring LCFAs (palmitic acid (29Burczynski F.J.

Physiol. 1998; 38: G244-G249Google Scholar)). Third, L-FABP increases the intracellular transport/diffusion of LCFAs such as NBD-stearic acid (19McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D.

Fourth, L-FABP has 5–50-fold (depending on the specific fatty acids examined) lower affinity for LCFAs as compared with the affinity of PPARα for LCFAs and may thereby donate LCFAs to the nucleus and/or to PPAR within the nucleus (28Wolfrum C.

Despite these observations, there is as yet no evidence showing that L-FABP expression enhances the targeting/transport of unesterified LCFAs to the nucleus of living cells. In fact, since the majority of L-FABP is cytoplasmic, an alternate possibility is that the near millimolar concentration of L-FABP in the cytoplasm could compete with the nucleus for binding LCFAs and thereby potentially inhibit LCFA uptake to/into the nucleus.The objectives of the present paper are as follows. (i) Develop a series of poorly or non-metabolizable fluorescent fatty acids essential for examining the intracellular distribution of unesterified LCFAs in living cells. Both synthetic (i.e. BODIPY- or NBD-tagged) and naturally occurring (cis-parinaric acid) fluorescent fatty acids were shown to be poorly or not metabolized. (ii) Visualize and record in real time not only the cellular uptake of these fluorescent fatty acids but determine whether they are present in the nucleus of living cells. Synthetic (i.e. BODIPY- or NBD-tagged) fluorescent fatty acids were visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LCSM), whereas naturally occurringcis-parinaric acid was visualized by multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM). All were detected in nuclei. (iii) Examine if L-FABP expression in L-cell fibroblasts altered not only cellular uptake of these fatty acids but also their uptake into nuclei of living cells. Find out if L-FABP expression enhanced targeting of medium and long chain fatty acids to the nuclei. (iv) Determine if L-FABP targeting of fluorescent LCFAs to nuclei is specific. L-FABP expression did not enhance targeting of short chain fatty acids (not bound by membrane or intracellular FABPs) to nuclei of living cells. (v) Show whether L-FABP expression altered the relative intracellular distribution of fatty acids to the nucleus as determined by the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. L-FABP expression increased the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios of medium and long chain fluorescent fatty acids.DISCUSSIONA fundamental problem in understanding the potential role of LCFAs as natural ligands that activate the transcriptional activity of PPARα in the nucleus is our lack of knowledge regarding the presence of unesterified LCFAs in the nuclei of living cells. Almost nothing is known regarding potential factors regulating the distribution and targeting of unesterified LCFAs to the nucleus. The data presented herein make several new contributions addressing these issues.First, a series of fluorescent fatty acids (BODIPY-C5, -C12, -C-16; NBD-C6, -C18; cis-parinaric acid) were shown for the first time to be poorly or not at all metabolized, thereby making them useful probes for imaging the intracellular localization of unesterified LCFAs in real time in intact cells. By 5 min of incubation oxidation was negligible, whereas esterification was 0–2% for long chain (NBD-C18, BODIPY-C16), 8% for medium chain (BODIPY-C12), and 0% for short chain (BODIPY-C5, NBD-C6) fatty acids. Even by 30 min of incubation oxidation was still negligible, and only 0–3% of long chain (NBD-C18, BODIPY-C16, cis-parinaric acid), 11% of medium chain (BODIPY-C12), and no short chain (BODIPY-C5, NBD-C6) fluorescent fatty acids were esterified. In contrast, radiolabeled fatty acids (oleic, palmitic, etc.) are 40–95% metabolized by 1–5 min of incubation with cultured cells (33Murphy E.J. Prows D.R. Jefferson J.R. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 60Heyliger C.E. Kheshgi T.J. Murphy E.J. Myers-Payne S. Schroeder F. Mol. Cell.

Lipids. 1982; 17: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Second, the fluorescent fatty acids were taken up in an acyl chain length-dependent manner similar to that exhibited by non-fluorescent fatty acids, long chain (BODIPY-C16, NBD-C18) > medium chain (BODIPY-C12) ≫ short chain (BODIPY-C5, NBD-C6). Cells take up long and medium chain, but not short chain, fatty acids by specific plasma membrane transporters (19McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and are bound by cytoplasmic proteins such as L-FABP (50Stahl A. Gimeno R.E. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol.

Lipids. 1998; 92: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Third, imaging microscopy (LSCM and MPLSM) showed that poorly or non-metabolizable (i.e. unesterified) fluorescent LCFAs were rapidly (1–5 min) taken up and distributed primarily into the cytoplasm and/or cytoplasmic structures (e.g. lipid droplets) of living L-cells. The high distribution to the fluorescent LCFAs to cytoplasm reflected the predominant localization of soluble proteins that bind LCFAs, i.e. FABPs (42Bordewick U. Heese M. Borchers T. Robenek H. Spener F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 44Schroeder F. Atshaves B.P. Starodub O. Boedeker A.L. Smith R. Roths J.B. Foxworth W.B. Kier A.B.

Acta. 1989; 1002: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mock-transfected control L-cells contain an endogenous FABP immunologically distinct from L-FABP (45Jefferson J.R. Slotte J.P. Nemecz G. Pastuszyn A. Scallen T.J. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5486-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the high distribution of fluorescent LCFAs to lipid droplets in the cytoplasm reflects the fact that a lipid droplet-specific protein, adipocyte differentiation related protein, has high affinity for fatty acids such as NBD-C18 (47Frolov A.

Acta. 2000; 1488: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular distribution of the poorly or non-metabolizable fluorescent fatty acids primarily to cytoplasm and lipid droplets reflects that of proteins that bind fatty acids.Fourth, real time imaging (LSCM and MPLSM) revealed for the first time that both saturated (i.e. BODIPY- or NBD-tagged) and unsaturated (cis-parinaric acid) fluorescent unesterified LCFAs rapidly (1–5 min) distributed not only into the cytoplasm but also to nuclei, especially the nuclear envelope, of living cells. In contrast, short chain (BODIPY-C5, NBD-C6) fatty acids were diffusely localized in both the nucleoplasm as well as cytoplasm but not the nuclear envelope. Finally, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of average pixel intensities for these fluorescent fatty acids was in the range of 0.4–0.5, indicating that 28–33% these fatty acids appeared localized to nuclei. Thus, LSCM and MPLSM of fluorescent fatty acids in living cells for the first time supported earlier suggestions regarding the presence of unesterified LCFAs in nuclei (isolated by subcellular fractionation) were not simply due to artifacts of nuclear isolation or hydrolytic cleavage of esterified lipids to release LCFAs (23Gorski J. Nawrocki A. Murthy M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 178: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Song M. Rebel G. Basic Appl. Histochem. 1987; 31: 377-387PubMed Google Scholar, 66Keenan T.W. Bereszney R. Funk L.K. Crane F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 203: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,67Kleinig H. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 96: 396-402Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Fifth, it was striking that, despite the detection of nearly one-third of the fluorescent fatty acids appearing in the nucleus, much less appeared in the nucleoplasm. For example, in a separate experiment the proportion of cellular BODIPY-C16 in the nucleus of control and L-FABP expressing cells was estimated to be about 22.3 ± 4.2% (n = 9) and about 46.9 ± 2.8% (n= 7), respectively, representing a 2.1-fold increase in the L-FABP expressing cells (p < 0.001). However, when the proportion of cellular BODIPY-C16 in the nucleoplasm was estimated (by counting only those pixels within the nucleus and not in the nuclear membrane), only about 7.4 ± 1.5% (n = 9) of BODIPY-C16 was in the nucleoplasm of control L-cells. In contrast, about 17.3 ± 1.8% (n = 7) of BODIPY-C16 was in the nucleoplasm of L-FABP expressing cells, 2.3-fold higher (p < 0.001). It is important to note that z series scans showed that L-cell nuclei were 6-μm thick. To avoid fluorescence from the cytoplasm over the nucleus, all confocal (BODIPY- and NBD- tagged fatty acids) images were taken from slices (0.3 μm) through the median section of the nuclei. In multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (cis-parinaric acid) only those fatty acids in the focal volume (0.01 cu μ) within the median of the nuclei were excited, and images were collected therefrom. The presence of fluorescent fatty acids in the nucleus was also verified by colocalizing with a DNA-binding stain (not shown).Sixth, L-FABP expression in L-cell fibroblasts significantly (2.9–4.4-fold) and preferentially (2–3.6-fold) increased the total uptake of the medium and long chain fluorescent fatty acids into the nuclei of living L-cells. These were L-FABP-specific because of the following. (i) L-FABP expression (0.4% of cytosolic protein) increased the total FABP binding capacity by nearly 4-fold (45Jefferson J.R. Slotte J.P. Nemecz G. Pastuszyn A. Scallen T.J. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5486-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Although L-cells contain low levels of endogenous FABP (0.12% of cytosolic protein) that does not cross-react with antisera to L-FABP, L-FABP expression did not alter endogenous FABP expression in the transfected cells (45Jefferson J.R. Slotte J.P. Nemecz G. Pastuszyn A. Scallen T.J. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5486-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) As shown, L-FABP expression did not alter the nuclear content of short chain fatty acids (BODIPY-C5, NBD-C6). This was consistent with earlier findings demonstrating that L-FABP binds medium and long chain fatty acids but does not bind short chain fatty acids (51Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 52Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F.

Lipids. 1998; 92: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although it had been proposed earlier (28Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) that L-FABP might be involved in trafficking of unesterified LCFAs to nuclei, data show increased LCFAs in the nucleus were lacking. Thus, the results presented herein provide the first direct experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis.Whereas the mechanism whereby L-FABP enhances the trafficking and targeting of medium and long chain fatty acids to the nucleus is not yet completely clear, the data presented herein and in the literature suggest the following. (i) LSCM and MPLSM showed that L-FABP expression enhanced severalfold the total cellular uptake of non-metabolizable (NBD-C18) and poorly metabolizable (especially BODIPY-C16 and cis-parinaric) fluorescent fatty acids in real time in living cells, consistent with radiolabeled (30Wolfrum C.

To further elucidate the mechanism of action of these inhibitors, their impact on signaling through the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was studied. Proteasome inhibition with either carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-phenylalaninal or lactacystin led to a loss of dually phosphorylated, activated p44/42 MAPK in A1N4-mychuman mammary and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. This correlated with an induction of the dual specificity MAPK phosphatases (MKP)-1 and -2, and blockade of MKP induction using either actinomycin D or Ro-31-8220 significantly decreased loss of activated p44/42 MAPK. Inhibition of p44/42 MAPK signaling by use of the MAPK kinase inhibitors PD 98059 or U0126, or by use of a dominant negative MAPK construct, enhanced proteasome inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. Conversely, activation of MAPK by epidermal growth factor, or use of a mutant MAPK resistant to MKP-mediated dephosphorylation, inhibited apoptosis. These studies support a role for inactivation of signaling through the p44/42 MAPK pathway in proteasome inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. The proteasome is emerging as a target for cancer therapy because small molecule inhibitors of its catalytic activity induce apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo models of human malignancies and are proving to have efficacy in early clinical trials.

A role for the proteasome in programmed cell death was uncovered using small molecular weight, cell-permeable inhibitors, which induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor-derived cell lines (reviewed in Refs. 10Orlowski R.Z.

Most recently, proteasome inhibitors have entered clinical trials, and preliminary evidence of significant anti-tumor activity has been reported (19Stinchcombe T.E. Mitchell B.S. Depcik-Smith N. Adams J. Elliott P. Shea T.C. Orlowski R.Z. Am. Soc. Hematol. 2000; 96: 516aGoogle Scholar). It has been hypothesized that proteasomes act at a pre-mitochondrial, pre-caspase stage of apoptosis in some systems (10Orlowski R.Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Grimm L.M. Osborne B.A. Results Probl.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 35-40PubMed Google Scholar). Given the importance of the proteasome to normal cellular homeostasis, however, it is likely that inhibitors induce programmed cell death by affecting many apoptosis-associated pathways. Indeed, evidence has been presented that, at least in some systems, has implicated roles for p53 accumulation (see, for example, Ref. 21Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12893-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (22Meriin A.B. Gabai V.L. Yaglom J. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y.

Investigations have also supported the importance of blockade of nuclear translocation of NF-κB (see, for example, Refs. 24Wang C.Y. Cusack J.C., Jr. Liu R. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Nat.

Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Some of the more ubiquitous cellular signaling cascades are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including the p44/42 MAPK, also called the extracellular signal-related kinases, or ERK-1/2. These pathways play important roles in a variety of processes, including cell development, differentiation, inflammation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 28Dent P. Jarvis W.D. Birrer M.J. Fisher P.B. Schmidt-Ullrich R.K. Grant S. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 1843-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). A possible role for the proteasome in ERK-1/2 signaling has been suggested by studies with the peptidyl aldehyde inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN), that targets both calpains and the proteasome (31Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Banik N. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L.

Biochem. 1996; 119: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and induces nuclear accumulation of p44/42 MAPK in CCL39 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (34Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The cysteine proteinase inhibitors calpeptin and E64D have been reported to inactivate MAPK function in Balb/c 3T3 cells by inducing MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-1, but ALLN did not exhibit a similar ability in these cells (35Torres C., Li, M. Walter R. Sierra F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies in CCL39 cells reported that ALLN does indeed induce MKP-1 (36Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), but its impact on p44/42 MAPK was not investigated. Recent work with the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (16Adams J. Palombella V.J. Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Destree A. Lazarus D.D. Maas J. Pien C.S. Prakash S. Elliott P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2615-2622PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was decreased (37Hideshima T. Richardson P. Chauhan D. Palombella V.J. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar), but the impact of proteasome-specific inhibitors on the activation status of ERK-1/2 has not been well characterized. Furthermore, a role for this pathway in the induction of programmed cell death by proteasome inhibitors has not been described, and we therefore sought to investigate this possibility further. In the current report, we present data demonstrating that inhibition of the proteasome in breast epithelial and breast carcinoma cells resulted in inhibition of signaling through ERK-1/2 by a decrease in the abundance of the active, dually phosphorylated kinases. This decrease was accompanied by the induction of MKP-1 and -2, and both occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Blockade of MKP induction significantly inhibited MAPK dephosphorylation, suggesting that the two were closely linked. Inhibition of p44/42 MAPK signaling using both pharmacologic and dominant negative mutant constructs enhanced proteasome inhibitor-mediated apoptosis, whereas activation of MAPK by pharmacologic or genetic means decreased this programmed-cell death. These studies support a role for inhibition of MAPK signaling in the induction of programmed cell death by proteasome inhibitors. The proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-phenylalaninal (Z-LLF-CHO), synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding peptidyl alcohol, Z-LLF-OH, as previously described (38Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), was purified by crystallization from ethanol/water, whereas lactacystin was obtained fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). Phosphatase inhibitors deltamethrin, nodularin, and okadaic acid were fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., whereas sodium orthovanadate was from Sigma. Actinomycin D and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ), whereas Ro-31-8220 was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., as was the MEK inhibitor PD 98059, and U0126 was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Stock solutions and serial dilutions were prepared in 100% ethanol (Z-LLF-OH, Z-LLF-CHO, and PMSF; Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc., Paris, KY), 100% methanol (actinomycin D; Fisher Scientific), phosphate-buffered saline (sodium orthovanadate (PBS); 1× PBS, 9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; obtained from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Culture Facility (LCCC TCF)), or dimethyl sulfoxide (Fisher Scientific) for all others, and stored at −20 °C. These reagents were used at concentrations indicated in the text, with a final vehicle concentration that did not exceed 0.5% (v/v). All other chemicals, unless otherwise indicated, were obtained from Fisher Scientific. A1N4-myc cells (39Clark R. Stampfer M.R. Milley R. O'Rourke E. Walen K.H. Kriegler M. Kopplin J. McCormick F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4689-4694PubMed Google Scholar), the generous gift of Dr. R. B. Dickson (Georgetown University, Washington, DC), were grown in Richter's modified Eagle's medium with insulin, gentamicin, and 20 mm Hepes (LCCC TCF), and further supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) at 10 ng/ml unless otherwise indicated, 9% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G sodium at 100 units/ml, streptomycin sulfate at 100 μg/ml (these reagents from Invitrogen), and hydrocortisone (39Clark R. Stampfer M.R. Milley R. O'Rourke E. Walen K.H. Kriegler M. Kopplin J. McCormick F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4689-4694PubMed Google Scholar) (Sigma). MDA-MB-231 (40Cailleau R. Young R. Olive M. Reeves W.J., Jr. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) and BT-474 (41Lasfargues E.Y. Coutinho W.G. Redfield E.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1978; 61: 967-978PubMed Google Scholar) human breast carcinoma cells (LCCC TCF) were grown in Richter's modified Eagle's medium as above except without EGF and hydrocortisone. All cells were propagated in incubators providing a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2in air. Adherent cells were detached by exposure to trypsin (Invitrogen), counted using a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA), and 2 × 106 cells were seeded onto 60-mm Falcon 3002 tissue culture plates (BD PharMingen Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) in complete medium. These cells were allowed to reattach overnight and subjected to conditions described in the text along with the addition of fresh medium. At the completion of an experiment, all plates were placed on ice, washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and collected by scraping into eukaryotic lysis buffer (10 mmTris-hydrochloride (HCl), pH 7.4, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 1 nm deltamethrin, 180 nm nodularin, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were immediately denatured by heating to 95–100 °C for 10 min, and after the removal of aliquots for protein assays, samples were reduced by heating for another 5 min at 95–100 °C in 1× SDS sample buffer (31.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). Relative protein concentrations of each sample were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equivalent protein amounts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with the Broad Range Biotinylated Protein Marker set (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and/or the Low Range Prestained SDS-PAGE Standards (Bio-Rad) using the Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). A discontinuous buffer system essentially according to Laemmli was used (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to BA85 Protran nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Mini-PROTEAN II blotting system (Bio-Rad). These were blocked with a solution of nonfat dry milk (Nestle USA, Inc., Solon, OH) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.10% Tween 20, and exposed to the indicated antibodies diluted in this same solution. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit (New England Biolabs or Bio-Rad), anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences), or anti-rat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) secondary antibodies were then used, with an anti-biotin HRP-conjugated antibody (New England Biolabs) as needed. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected using either the Phototope-HRP Western detection kit (New England Biolabs) or the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences), Kodak Biomax ML film, and a Kodak model M6B RP X-Omat film processor (Eastman Kodak Co.). For repeated analyses of the same filter, blots were stripped for 45 min using Western Re-Probe (Geno Technology, Inc., St. Louis, MO) following the manufacturer's specifications. Activation status of the p44/42 MAPKs was determined using murine monoclonal antibodies recognizing active, dually phosphorylated p44/42 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), with rabbit p44/42 antibodies used as loading controls. The activation status of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) was determined using rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing active, dually phosphorylated MEK-1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), with rabbit MEK-1/2 antibodies (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) used as loading controls. Additional loading controls were provided by rat monoclonal antibodies 1B5 to HSC-70 and 9G10 to GRP-94 (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), the former a generous gift of Dr. J. Spychala. To quantify protein bands, autoradiographs were scanned with an Agfa Duoscan T2500 scanner (Agfa Corp., Ridgefield Park, NJ) into Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA), and densitometry was performed using NIH Image version 1.61. These procedures were performed by members of the laboratory who were blinded to the experimental conditions. Western blotting performed as described above was used to evaluate the expression of the MKP-1 and -2 phosphatases. Primary antibodies used included rabbit polyclonal C-19 antibody to MKP-1 and S-18 to MKP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). To inhibit phosphatases in intact cells, A1N4-myc and MDA-MB-231 lines were pre-incubated for 60 min with either sodium orthovanadate at 1 mm, okadaic acid at 30 nm, or both, and then subjected to conditions as described in the text and processed and analyzed as noted above. MKP-1 and -2 induction was inhibited by pre-incubation of cells for 60 min with either actinomycin D at 3.0 μg/ml, or Ro-31-8220 at 5.0 μm. For apoptosis experiments cells were seeded onto either Falcon 3226 24-well plates (BD PharMingen Labware) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well or Costar 3595 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in complete medium, unless indicated otherwise. Fresh medium was added containing the agents for which impact was being tested, and cells were analyzed for apoptosis using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Spectrophotometric data at a wavelength of 405 nm, with a reference of 490 nm, were acquired on a MAXline Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The enhancement of apoptosis induced by each condition was calculated in relation to parallel control cells which received vehicle alone, and tabulated in KaleidaGraph version 3.0.1 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Mean percentages and standard errors of the mean were then calculated and plotted in KaleidaGraph. The hyperactive, phosphatase-resistant allele of ERK2 (D319N) (43Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), as well as a dominant negative ERK2 allele (K52R) (44Robbins D.J. Zhen E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both tagged with hemagglutinin, were generous gifts of Dr. C. Der (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). These were cloned into the vector pLPCX (CLONTECH), where expression is driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, and verified by sequencing (DNA Sequencing Core Facility, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC). Stable cell lines were prepared in BT-474 cells by transfection using the GenePORTERTM reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA), followed by selection in medium containing puromycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.). Colonies were screened for mutant ERK expression by Western blotting, as described above, using a murine anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (F7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). To prepare A1N4-myc- and MDA-MB-231-based cell lines, the indicated ERK clones were transfected into AmphoPackTM-293 cells using the CalPhosTM mammalian transfection kit (both from CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Supernatants with retroviral particles were collected and used to infect the target cells in medium containing 8 μm Polybrene. Selection and screening of clones was performed as described above. To determine the impact of proteasome inhibition on ERK-1/2 pathway signaling immortalized A1N4-myc cells, derived from benzo(a)pyrene-treated normal human mammary epithelium (39Clark R. Stampfer M.R. Milley R. O'Rourke E. Walen K.H. Kriegler M. Kopplin J. McCormick F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4689-4694PubMed Google Scholar), and MDA-MB-231 human mammary carcinoma cells (40Cailleau R. Young R. Olive M. Reeves W.J., Jr. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) were studied. Analysis of extracts after mock treatment or exposure to vehicle revealed significant levels of dually phosphorylated, active p44 and p42 MAPK in A1N4-myc (Fig.1 A, left panel) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1 A,right panel). When these cells were exposed to Z-LLF-OH, a precursor peptidyl alcohol with no activity as a proteasome inhibitor (38Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 45Vinitsky A. Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C. Orlowski M. J. Biol.

Treatment with the active peptidyl aldehyde proteasome inhibitor Z-LLF-CHO, however, resulted in decreased levels of phospho-ERK-1 and -2, which were not because of a loss of p44/42 protein. Total MAPK levels were themselves unchanged, as determined by evaluation for an unrelated protein, the heat shock cognate protein HSC-70. Many of the proteasome inhibitors previously used in studies of the p44/42 MAPK pathway (34Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Torres C., Li, M. Walter R. Sierra F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been peptides that also inhibit calpains, and Z-LLF-CHO falls into this category as well (31Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Banik N.

Walter R. Sierra F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we evaluated the impact of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (46Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This agent also induced a loss of dually phosphorylated p44 and p42 MAPK (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating that in these cells proteasome inhibition was by itself sufficient to reduce signaling through this pathway. The effect of proteasome inhibitors on p44/42 MAPK signaling was tested further in concentration and time dependence studies. A1N4-myc (Fig. 1 B, left panel) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1 B,right panel) exposed to Z-LLF-CHO both exhibited decreased phospho-ERK-1/2 levels in a manner that was dependent on the proteasome inhibitor concentration. Exposure to lactacystin also resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in phosphorylated p44 and p42 MAPK (Fig. 1 C, leftand right panels). Time-course experiments revealed that A1N4-myc cells were especially sensitive in that phospho-MAPK levels decreased as early as 3 h after addition of either Z-LLF-CHO (Fig. 1 D, left panel) or lactacystin (Fig. 1 E, left panel), and decreased further with prolonged incubation in a time-dependent fashion. MDA-MB-231 cells showed a similar time dependence, although loss of active MAPK was somewhat delayed, and did not begin until 6 h after exposure to Z-LLF-CHO (Fig.1 D, right panel) or lactacystin (Fig.1 E, right panel). Inactivation of MAPK signaling was more transient with lactacystin for both A1N4-myc and MDA-MB-231 cells, however, in that phospho-ERK-1/2 levels reached their nadir at ∼9 h and then began to return to baseline at 12 h. Because lactacystin is a reactive compound with a short half-life (46Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the possibility was considered that the decline in MAPK inactivation after 9 h was because of the disappearance of the active proteasome inhibitor. When additional lactacystin was added to cell cultures after 6 h of incubation, phospho-p44/42 MAPK levels continued to decrease at 9 and 12 h (data not shown), further supporting the link between proteasome inhibition and MAPK inactivation. Phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK is catalyzed by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK (29Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

In particular, they are very much enriched in the nervous system and have been considered to control development, proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance of the neural tissues and cells (2Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar,3Schengrund C.L. Brain Res. Bull. 1990; 24: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).

Neurochem. 1967; 14: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that individual structures of gangliosides contain significant implications for individual situations. A number of studies have been performed to demonstrate the biological function of gangliosides primarily by modifying their structures with enzymes or using inhibitors to block some steps of synthesis (5Mutoh T.

Otherwise, the effects of addition of gangliosides to the culture medium or injection into the conditioned animals have been the primary approaches in addressing the significance of gangliosides. However, recent success in the molecular cloning of glycosyltransferase genes brought about an evolutional change in the experimental approaches for carbohydrate function analysis. Availability of glycosyltransferase genes responsible for the synthesis of gangliosides enabled us to remodel ganglioside compositions of cells and tissues in vivo (6Marth J.D. Glycoconj.

In the present study, we established double knock-out mice of the above described GM2/GD2 synthase gene and GD3 synthase gene by mating them to each other, and we analyzed the abnormal phenotypes of the mutant mice expressing only the GM3 ganglioside. Although these mutant mice might have a serious deficit in the nervous system (16Kawai H. Allende M.L. Wada R. Kono M. Sango K. Deng C. Miyakawa T. Crawley J.N. Werth N. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K.

We have investigated the mechanisms for the development of the skin lesion and have elucidated the reduced sensitivity of the sensory nerve based on nerve degeneration as a primary triggering factor for the lesion. The mice were maintained in our laboratory. GM2/GD2 and GD3 synthase gene knock-out mice were mated, i.e.heterozygotes of both mutants were mated, and genotypes of the offspring were screened for the two genes as described previously (11Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To generate double knock-out mice efficiently, we also mated female homozygotes of the GD3 synthase gene and male heterozygotes of the GM2/GD2 synthase gene. Double knock-out mice with the two genes were designated as Ho/Ho2mutant, and those with wild type for both genes were presented as Wd/Wd. Body weight was measured every week, and mice were observed every day. Genetic typing of GD3 synthase gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction with mouse tails using primers as follows, 5′-GCTGAGGGTACACTGACCCTGGGACATCGA-3′, 5′-TCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGCCGCTCCCGATT-3′, and 5′-ACTAGGGACAGACCGGCGAAATCCTTGATT-3′. The reaction was started with a 3-min cycle at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles for 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, and 1 min at 95 °C. Genetic typing of the GM2/GD2 synthase gene was performed as described previously (11Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10662-10667Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Glycolipids were extracted as described previously (18Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipid fractions were extracted by chloroform/methanol at ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, sequentially. Glycolipids were isolated by a Florisil column after acetylation, and then neutral and acidic fractions were separated by DEAE-Sephadex (A-50) column chromatography. Seven each of Wd/Wd-type and Ho/Ho-type 25-week-old male mice were housed in special cages usually used for metabolic study and were fed regular chow. Daily observation was performed for 2 months to check the body weight, generation of wounds, and frequency of skin scratching. Scratching measurements were performed every 5 min twice a week. Tissue sections from the skin lesions of the injured sites were prepared. The serial sections were divided into three groups, i.e. the first group was stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and the other two groups were stained with toluidine or used for immunohistochemical study with anti-PGP9.5 antibody directed toward the N terminus of the protein (19Day I.N. Hinks L.J. Thompson R.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The areas occupied with nerve fibers in the epidermis were quantitatively measured in consecutive sections, and the results were presented as an average of the values obtained from three sections. Actual measurement of the nerve-occupying area was performed as follows. Images were captured using the Olympus digital camera DP-11 or classical photomicrography on film. Analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (anonymous FTP from zippy.nimh.nih.gov). These analyses were performed by two independent persons with no preliminary information. Skin tissues were fixed by immersion in a fixative containing 1.5% paraformaldehyde and 1.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and osmicated in 1% OsO4 solution for 1 h. Fixed tissues were dehydrated in alcohols and embedded in Epon 812. After staining with uranylacetate and lead citrate, ultrathin sections were prepared and observed using the JEOL 100 CX electron microscope. To analyze sensory function in the mutant mice, we examined sensitivity to pain stimulation using the hot plate method and with the von Frey strings test as described previously (20Handwerker H.O. Anton F. Reeh P.W. Exp. Brain Res. 1987; 65: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Numeric data are expressed as mean ± S.D. The number of mice used in the experiments are as indicated in each figure. The significance of differences among groups was determined using analysis of variance for comparison. The heterozygous mutants of GM2/GD2 synthase and those of GD3 synthase were mated, resulting in nine combinations of the genotypes. Eventually, Ho/Ho mutants were obtained at the approximate ratio of 1:16, similar to the Wd/Wd mutants, corresponding to the classic Mendelian rule, indicating that Ho/Ho mutants had no critical disadvantage in development and birth. They appeared somewhat normal and could not be distinguished from their littermates at birth. Brain, liver, and skin tissues were used for the extraction of glycolipids and exhibited dramatic changes in the compositions of gangliosides, i.e.all complex gangliosides were deleted, and only GM3 was found in brain extracts in the double mutants (Fig.1B) as expected from the synthetic pathway (Fig. 1A). In the skin extracts GM3 was a major ganglioside, and an additional faint band of GD1a was present in Wd/Wd skin. Otherwise, no marked change was found in the extracts of Ho/Ho mice skin; only GM3 was detectable at similar levels during the course (Fig. 1C). Approximately 35% of the 30-week-old mutant mice (Ho/Ho) showed, more or less, skin injury primarily on their faces as shown in Fig.2, A and B, and the frequency increased up to 50% as they aged to 40 weeks old. In this situation, the injured mice showed characteristic scratching toward the injuries on their faces and necks (Fig. 2C). The frequency was about 90× per 5 min, whereas non-injured Ho/Ho and Wd/Wd mice scarcely exhibited this scratching movement (Fig. 2D). It was discovered occasionally that the skin lesions were generated easily when mice were housed in special cages for the studies of metabolism in which they frequently underwent trauma to the face while taking foods through wire mesh (Fig.3A). Therefore, we tried to house Ho/Ho and Wd/Wd mice in the metabolic cages under an isolated condition. Consequently, only Ho/Ho mice exhibited development of the skin injury earlier than they did in conventional cages (Fig.3B). Wd/Wd mice showed no injury. Ho/Ho mice undergoing the skin injury showed a much higher frequency of scratching than Wd/Wd mice (Fig. 3C), suggesting that this scratching might induce the skin injury and its exacerbation. In the sections of the injured skin tissues, skin erosion and granulocyte infiltration were observed in some portions (Fig.4A). A more characteristic feature in these lesions was proliferated peripheral nerves as shown in Fig. 4B. These hypertrophic nerves were stained with toluidine blue and were found frequently in the epidermis and subepidermis in Ho/Ho mice skin (Fig. 4, D and E) but rarely in Wd/Wd mice (Fig. 4C). A few cells with granules were found occasionally in Ho/Ho skin (Fig. 4D). To identify the nerve-like structures that appeared characteristically in the Ho/Ho mice skin, immunohistochemistry with anti-PGP9.5 antibody was performed. As shown in Fig. 4F, a large number of nerve fibers were found in the subepidermis and epidermis, and electron micrographs exhibited almost normal-shaped, slightly invaginated, myelinated, and unmyelinated nerve fibers (Fig. 4G). As shown in Fig. 4H, measurement of nerve fiber-occupied area revealed that 6.0 ± 5.2% (as an average) of the skin was occupied by nerve fibers in the skin of the mutants with injury. In contrast, non-injured skin showed a minimal number of nerve fibers similar to those in Wd/Wd mice skin (1.3% ± 1.5%). To investigate the mechanisms for generation of the skin lesion in Ho/Ho mice, we examined the sensory nerve function with two methods using three mouse groups consisting of adolescent (20 weeks old), adult (35 weeks old), and intermediate (25 weeks old). Ho/Ho mice with no injury exhibited a clear reduction in sensitivity to mechanical pain stimuli at 25 weeks old and showed exacerbation at 35 weeks old (Fig. 5A), suggesting that their sensitivity was reduced markedly at a certain time point after 20 weeks and that this may induce over-scratching after the first triggering event. On the other hand, sensitivity to hot stimuli as measured with hot plates was enhanced rather significantly in Ho/Ho mice at 35 weeks old but not at 20 weeks old (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that the response to heat stimuli increased as a result of the injury and subsequent nerve fiber hyperplasia. In observation of the cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve) and the peripheral nerve (sciatic nerve), strong degenerative changes were found even in the myelinated fibers of 20-week-old Ho/Ho mice. Nerve fibers of Ho/Ho mice showed an irregular array, swollen, beaded, and duplicate myelin appearances compared with those of Wd/Wd mice (Fig. 6, Aand B). Degeneration in the sciatic nerves was more prominent (Fig. 6B, bottom panel). Width measurement of nerve fibers revealed that the diameter of fibers including myelin sheath in homozygotes generally was increased in both trigeminal and sciatic nerves compared with wild type (data not shown). The width of axon and myelin sheath also was significantly increased in homozygotes in both nerves as indicated in Fig. 6, C and D. However, the ratio of myelin sheath/axon was almost equivalent between homozygotes and wild type mice in both sciatic nerve and trigeminal nerve, suggesting that nerve fibers enlarged by a whole unit (Fig. 6E). Although the double knock-out mice containing only the GM3 ganglioside were born and grew up almost normally at a glance, they started to die suddenly 12 weeks after birth. The accumulative survival rates were 92.2% after 10 weeks, 77.4% after 20 weeks, and 33.2% after 30 weeks of birth. The cause of death is not clear and may not be due to audiogenic convulsion for these mutant mice in contrast with those reported previously (16Kawai H. Allende M.L. Wada R. Kono M. Sango K. Deng C.

In surviving mice, serious skin injury was found in the significant population of Ho/Ho mice, which never has been observed in single mutant mice, e.g. GM2/GD2 synthase or GD3 synthase gene knock-out. Even with the isolation in metabolic cages, the single knock-out mice as well as the Wd/Wd mice did not show such serious injury, suggesting that the deletion of all ganglioside structures except for GM3 induced a novel defect in the skin. Because a definite difference in ganglioside composition in the double mutants from that of GM2/GD2 synthase gene knock-out mice (11Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reason why our Ho/Ho mice showed no audiogenic seizure yet exhibited rather prominent skin injury is not known. Genetic backgrounds of the embryonic stem cells used are different between the two groups, i.e. 129SvEv (TC-1) (16Kawai H. Allende M.L. Wada R. Kono M. Sango K. Deng C. Miyakawa T. Crawley J.N.

There were no complex gangliosides other than GM3 and a low level of GD1α on a thin layer chromatography of the extracted glycolipids from Wd/Wd mice skin. This pattern was similar to that of Ho/Ho mice skin, suggesting that the change in ganglioside composition in skin tissue might not be a primary factor to induce the serious skin injury. The amounts of GM3 in Ho/Ho mice showed no marked change in either brain or skin during observation, despite the progress of skin injury. We also focused on their movement to scratch the initially injured sites to observe whether it induced exacerbation of the wound. Particularly in the special cages, it was apparent that the scratching became more frequent as the injury advanced and was tightly associated with the development of refractory lesions. In human atopic dermatitis, scratching the itchy sites was thought to induce serious dermatitis, and it frequently caused hypertrophy of peripheral nerve and hyperplasia of neural fiber bundles (22Tobin D.

A similar situation may occur in the skin of Ho/Ho mice, i.e. the reduced sensation to mechanic pain might promote very frequent and repetitive scratching, and the resulting inflammatory processes might induce peripheral nerve hyperplasia. Histological analysis of the sciatic nerve and trigeminal nerve revealed that peripheral nerves in Ho/Ho mutant mice underwent serious degeneration more prominently than those in the single mutants as reported previously (12Sheikh K.A. Sun J. Liu Y. Kawai H. Crawford T.O. Proia R.L. Griffin J.W. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7532-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). 4Y. Sugiura, K. Furukawa, M. Okada, and K. Furukawa, unpublished data.The reduced sensitivity to the mechanic pain observed in Ho/Ho mice with no injury might reflect these degenerative changes. Of course, Ho/Ho mutants should have various defects other than those in peripheral nerves as expected from abnormal phenotypes such as immunodysfunction and endocrinological defects in the single mutant mice (14Zhao J. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Furugen R. Miyazaki H. Takamiya K. Aizawa S. Shiku H. Matsuyama T. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

These factors might also be involved in the generation of the severe skin injury. However, it seems reasonable to consider that a defect in peripheral nerve regulation is one of the major causes of the skin injury. Furthermore, there have been no clear studies on the role of gangliosides in skin, although we reported previously that transgenic mice of the GM2/GD2 synthase gene showed a rather increased reaction to exogenous stimulation and a delay in healing (26Fukumoto S. Yamamoto A. Hasegawa T. Abe K. Takamiya K. Okada M. Min Z.J. Furukawa K. Miyazaki H. Tsuji Y. Goto G. Suzuki M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, this study demonstrates for the first time an important role of gangliosides in the regulation of skin integrity by manipulating ganglioside synthase genes. For a long time, gangliosides have been thought to play an important role in the nervous system as a sort of neurotrophic factor (27Unsicker K. Wiegandt H. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Ferrari G. Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actually, neurite extension, synaptogenesis, or regeneration of damaged nerves was enhanced in the presence of gangliosides (29Hicks D. Heidinger V. Mohand-Said S. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 30: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If this is the case, the hyperplastic nerve fibers found in Ho/Ho mice skin seem to be a paradox. Could the deletion of all gangliosides except for GM3 result in increased neural regeneration? If so, might GM3 itself induce and promote neurogenesis? The hypertrophic neural fibers also might be an abnormal proliferative reaction as a result of deregulation after the deletion of complex gangliosides triggered by repetitive scratching and sustained inflammation. As yet, significant mechanisms for promotion of the proliferation of peripheral nerve fibers remain unknown. The sensitivity of neural tissues to neurotrophins, including expression levels of the neurotrophin receptors, might have changed. Neuropeptides (30Giannetti A. Girolomoni G. Br. J.

Transcytosis refers to the collective process whereby macromolecules are transported across an epithelial layer. Consistent with the potentially hostile environment intimately associated with many epithelial barriers, the adaptive immune system has harnessed the transcytotic machinery to transport intact antibodies across epithelial cell monolayers through the use of at least two transmembrane receptors, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)1 and the MHC class I-related Fc receptor originally defined in neonatal life, FcRn. Significant progress has been made in molecularly characterizing pIgR-dependent transcytosis of dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM in the basolateral to apical direction. A large proportion of the work associated with dissecting pIgR cell biology has utilized the polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell model stably expressing the rabbit pIgR (1Mostov K.E.

Together with the numerous studies on transferrin receptor trafficking, a detailed characterization of the itineraries traveled by proteins undergoing such processes as basolateral recycling, basolateral to apical transcytosis, and apical recycling has been generated for MDCK cells (4Leung S.M.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 480-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One major area of understanding that is currently lacking, however, is the pathway traversed by proteins trafficking in the apical to basolateral direction. This is mainly due to the lack of a good model protein that physiologically harnesses this pathway. Additionally, the ability to generalize the numerous discoveries made studying pIgR and transferrin receptor trafficking in MDCK cells needs to be directly tested by comparing the cell biology of additional receptor systems, which share similar functional behaviors but which may or may not involve new pathways, sorting signals, or machinery. Two functions have been attributed to FcRn, both of which depend on the abilities of FcRn to bind IgG at acidic pH (pH ≤ 6.5) but not at or above neutral pH (pH ≥ 7.0) and traffic in cells (7Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Abrahamson D.R. Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In adult rodents and, likely, in all mammals, FcRn acts as a saturable catabolic protection receptor critical for the maintenance of normal steady-state IgG levels in the blood (9Brambell F.W.

Second, in suckling mice and rats, FcRn mediates the vectorial transport of maternal IgG from the intestinal lumen across the intestinal epithelial cells into the systemic circulation of the neonate (8Abrahamson D.R. Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Brambell F.W. Lancet. 1966; 2: 1087-1093Abstract PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jones E. Waldmann T. J. Clin.

In humans, maternofetal transfer of IgG also depends on FcRn in a manner analogous to the processes described in neonatal rodents (17Story C.M. Mikulska J.E. Simister N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2377-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 18Simister N.E. Story C.M. Chen H.L. Hunt J.S. Eur. J.

Thus, FcRn has the in vivo capacity to transport IgG in the apical to basolateral direction and is therefore an attractive candidate to model trafficking in this direction. Interestingly, several in vitro studies have demonstrated the expanded capacity of FcRn to transcytose in both the apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical directions (22Dickinson B.L.

Conversely, FcRn may be devoid of any strong sorting signal and detectable IgG transport in any one direction is secondary to either a steep pH and/or IgG concentration gradient. Although major advances have been made on the interaction of FcRn with its ligand, IgG (27Huber A.H. Kelley R.F. Gastinel L.N. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9698-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), progress in characterizing the cell biology of human and rodent FcRn as expressed in polarized epithelia has been comparatively slow. Although work on endogenously expressed human FcRn (hFcRn) is vital in substantiating the hypothesis that FcRn is a bidirectional transporter (22Dickinson B.L. Badizadegan K., Wu, Z. Ahouse J.C.

Physiol. 2002; 282: F358-F365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it has the major setback of not allowing the type of structure-function analysis required to dissect where the sorting information of FcRn is contained. A major effort by Simister and colleagues (26McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wu Z. Simister N.E. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar) has focused on characterizing rat FcRn trafficking in the rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cell line. Two main advantages of utilizing the IMCD cell line to study rat FcRn is that it doesn't express endogenous rat FcRn heavy chain but does express the homologous rat β2m subunit. This latter fact is an important consideration, because, like most other MHC class I-like receptors, FcRn is expressed as a heterodimer consisting of a glycosylated heavy (α) chain (40–44 kDa in humans; 48–50 kDa in rodents) associated non-covalently with β2m (41Simister N.E. Rees A.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 42Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the importance of β2m for FcRn function is highlighted by the dual observations that β2m co-distributes with FcRn along the entire transcytotic pathway in neonatal rat small intestinal epithelial cells (43Berryman M. Rodewald R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2347-2360PubMed Google Scholar) and that in β2m−/−mice, both of FcRn's aforementioned functions are abrogated (10–13,16). However, one disadvantage of the IMCD cell line is that, compared with the MDCK cell system, relatively little is known about the trafficking of other model receptors. Given that the MDCK cell system is so well characterized, it is an attractive candidate to dissect how FcRn traffics in polarized epithelia. The fact that FcRn is an obligate heterodimer, however, adds a level of complexity beyond simply expressing a heterologous FcRn heavy chain in MDCK cells and that was not addressed in a previous study of hFcRn expressed in MDCK cells (25Praetor A. Ellinger I. Hunziker W. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2291-2299PubMed Google Scholar). Determining the potential requirement to express the homologous human β2m (hβ2m) subunit is of fundamental importance in establishing a model system that would allow a future structure-function approach. The importance of addressing this variable is underscored by the fact that canine β2m contains a valine at amino acid 1 of the mature protein (44Smithies O. Poulik M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2914-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) instead of the isoleucine found in rodents and humans, the exact residue demonstrated to contribute a contact site during IgG binding. Previously, it was demonstrated through site-directed mutagenesis that another relatively conserved change, Ile1 → Ala, in rat β2m significantly affected IgG binding by rat FcRn (34Vaughn D.E. Milburn C.M. Penny D.M. Martin W.L. Johnson J.L. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another confounding variable is that there is no published information detailing the amount of β2m expressed endogenously by MDCK cells. The possibility that canine β2m as expressed in MDCK cells may be either deficient and/or defective with respect to human FcRn function is supported by a few anomalous observations in the only report available in this area by Praetor et al.(25Praetor A. Ellinger I. Hunziker W. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2291-2299PubMed Google Scholar). First, despite the ability to detect human FcRn on the cell surface by both immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation pH-dependent binding of IgG on the cell surface was not observed, even though FcRn in whole cell lysates retained the ability to bind IgG. Additionally, although bidirectional transcytosis of the FcRn heavy chain was demonstrated, transport of FcRn's ligand, IgG, was not described. As a necessary prerequisite to establishing a MDCK cell model with the goal of dissecting the cell biology of human FcRn in polarized epithelia, the behavior of a constant amount of hFcRn heavy chain was compared in the absence or presence of increasing quantities of co-expressed hβ2m. Taken together, the results indicate that hβ2m facilitates the maturation, trafficking, and function of hFcRn in the MDCK cell line, allowing for definition in the current report of a strict hβ2m dependence for the appropriate functional expression of hFcRn in the MDCK polarized cell model. Therefore, future structure-function studies on FcRn and, by extension, all other β2m-dependent MHC class I-like molecules (45Rodionov D.G. Nordeng T.W. Pedersen K. Balk S.P. Bakke O. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1488-1495PubMed Google Scholar, 46Rodionov D.G. Nordeng T.W. Kongsvik T.L. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8279-8282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in MDCK cells must adopt an appropriate strategy to control for this potentially confounding β2m variable. The human FcRn cDNA subcloned into pGEM7zf(+) was a kind gift of Dr. Neil Simister (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA). The cytoplasmic tail of hFcRn (residues 299–342) was amplified from this plasmid by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX 4-T-3 vector (AmershamBiosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Fusion proteins were purified from BL21Escherichia coli as per the manufacturer's instructions. To generate full-length hFcRn containing an NH2-terminal HA tag (5′-YPYDVPDYA-3′), PCR was performed with a 5′ primer containing anEcoRI restriction site followed by the HA tag sequence fused to the first 20 base pairs of the predicted mature FcRn protein (17Story C.M. Mikulska J.E. Simister N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2377-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The 3′ primer was specific for the COOH terminus of FcRn and included both the predicted stop translation codon and an engineered XhoI site. The sequences of all primers are available upon request. The PCR product was digested and subcloned into the expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To allow targeting into the secretory pathway, HA-FcRn was further subcloned in-frame immediately downstream of the murine MHC I Kb signal sequence, previously cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (referred to as pcDNAH, kind gift of Dr. Hidde Ploegh, Harvard Medical School). The entire sequence of HA-FcRn was verified by sequencing (kindly performed by Jennifer Hicks). The functionality of the MHC I kb signal sequence in the context of FcRn was demonstrated by in vitro transcription and translation with and without canine microsomes (TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation kit, Promega, Madison, WI). Interestingly, HA-FcRn in the context of the murine Igk signal sequence appeared to act anomalously in these assays as though FcRn was targeted into the secretory pathway, the Igk signal sequence was not cleaved (data not shown). Importantly, FcRn in the context of its endogenous signal sequence (i.e. FcRn cDNA) was handled normally with respect to microsomal targeting and signal sequence cleavage. The potential effect on the cell biology of a molecule resulting from a lack of signal sequence cleavage is unclear, but was not considered in a previous study involving an NH2-terminally FLAG-tagged human FcRn placed under the control of the same murine Igk signal sequence previously mentioned (25Praetor A. Ellinger I. Hunziker W. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2291-2299PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for human β2m was kindly provided by Dr. Xiaoping Zhu (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) and subcloned into the pEF6/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen). Antibodies were raised in rabbits against the human FcRn cytoplasmic tail domain appended to glutathioneS-transferase. Specificity of the anti-hFcRn cytoplasmic tail antisera (α-FcRnCT) was demonstrated in every protocol by the absence of a band of ∼44 kDa in MDCK II cells transfected with empty parental vectors versus MDCK II cells transfected with the cDNA encoding human FcRn. Monoclonal antibodies 12CA5, reactive against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, and BBM1, specific for human β2m, were purified from hybridoma supernatants by standard methods (52Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-hβ2m and anti-HA antisera, mouse anti-β-actin and anti-Golgi 58K (clone 58K-9) monoclonal antibodies (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), Alexa conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were used. The rabbit anti-endoplasmic reticulum antiserum was a generous gift of Dr. David Meyer (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). MDCK stain II cells (kind gift of Karl Matlin, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential media (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. MDCK II cells were first transfected with pcDNAH.FcRn using the FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and single colonies isolated using glass ring cloning cylinders. Expressing clones were identified by Western blot for the HA tag. One positive clone was then supertransfected with either pEF6/V5-HisA or pEF6.β2m using the FuGENE reagent and selected with 8 μg/ml Blasticidin S (Invitrogen) in the continued presence of 0.5 mg/ml G418. Single colonies were screened by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. MDCK II cells transfected with the parental pcDNA3.1 and pEF6/V5-HisA vectors were additionally generated to act as negative controls. All clones were maintained with constant drug selection. MDCK cells were seeded onto coverslips and grown for ∼36 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Following a wash with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells fixed for 20 min at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA). All remaining steps were performed at room temperature in a humidified chamber. For 12CA5/rabbit anti-ER staining, fixed cells were extensively washed in 1× PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% saponin + 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. For all additional primary antibody combinations, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin in PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 10% non-immune goat serum for 30 min (Zymed Laboratories Inc., So. San Francisco, CA). All antibody incubations were performed in the continued presence of 10% non-immune goat serum. Following extensive washing, Alexa-conjugated, species-specific goat secondary antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:400. Coverslips were mounted using the Molecular Probes Prolong Antifade reagent. All images were collected using a 60×/1.4 oil objective attached to an MRC 1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). For each staining, three or four clusters of cells were analyzed by first identifying the top and bottom of the cells and then collecting serial x-y images with 0.2 μm steps. The resultant data files were further analyzed using the tilt and rotate functions present in the Bio-Rad software, and representative sections were chosen for each clone. Final image processing and labeling was performed using Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, CA). Depending on the assay, either confluent or subconfluent cells grown in Petri dishes were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS twice sequentially and lysis buffer supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.17 mg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and bovine serum albumin (20 μg/ml), added (all protease inhibitors from Sigma). 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm iodoacetamide) was used for cell lysis in the pulse-chase experiments. RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) was used for all other immunoprecipitations. Following lysis, post-nuclear supernatants were generated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and lysates were quantified using the BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates were first precleared against either normal mouse serum or normal rabbit serum (both from Sigma), and antigens were recovered upon incubation with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) containing prebound antibodies with gentle rotation at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were sequentially washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with high salt wash buffer (RIPA lysates: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate; 1% Nonidet P-40 lysates: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmiodoacetamide) and once with low salt wash buffer (RIPA lysates: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate; 1% Nonidet P-40 lysates: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm iodoacetamide). Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Western blot analyses were performed following overnight transfer onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk (Stop and Shop, Boston, MA), 0.05% Tween-20/PBS and then incubated with primary antibody with rocking for 1 h at room temperature. Following three successive washes with PBST (PBS with 0.2% Tween-20), HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 45 min, the membranes were washed three times with PBST and twice with PBS, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate from Pierce. To reprobe a blot, membranes were incubated with stripping buffer (100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7) at room temperature for at least 1 h and then washed extensively prior to blocking the membrane again. Quantitation of bands was performed using Quantitation One software (Bio-Rad). In brief, for each individual experiment, two or three exposures were separately quantitated and the average intensity was determined for each band in each experiment. Averages and standard deviations were calculated using such values from at least three separate experiments. For removal ofN-glycans from whole cell lysates, confluent 12-well dishes were lysed with 100 μl of 1% SDS and diluted to 0.5% SDS, 1% β-ME by the addition of 100 μl of 2% β-ME. The lysates were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min and then quantified using the Bradford Method (Bio-Rad). Equal quantities of lysate for each clone were then digested at 37 °C overnight in the absence (mock) or presence of either endoglycosidase H (EndoH) or peptidyl-N-glycanase (PNGaseF) (both from New England BioLabs). For removal of N-glycans post-immunoprecipitation, denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-ME) was added to the washed immune complexes, the precipitates were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min, and deglycosylation reactions were performed as described above. MDCK cells were plated ∼18–24 h prior to metabolic labeling, at which time they were all 75–90% confluent. Cells were washed twice with prewarmed 1× PBS and then incubated in starvation medium (methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The starvation medium was removed, and the cells were metabolically labeled with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and cysteine (Easytag express protein labeling mix: PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Following three washes with prewarmed 1× PBS, chase medium (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 90 μg/ml each of l-cysteine andl-methionine) was added, and the cells were incubated for the times indicated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, at which point lysates were harvested as described above. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled lysates was performed as described above except that lysates were precleared twice, instead of once, with irrelevant antibodies of the same species prior to the addition of the immunoreactive antibody (either 12CA5 or rabbit anti-hFcRnCT antisera). Densitometry was performed utilizing Quantitation One software. Data were analyzed using SigmaStat 1.0 Software (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). For all experiments involving IgG binding, parallel cultures of each clone were separately lysed as described above, in either 5 mg/ml CHAPS, pH 6.0 (5 mg/ml CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10 mm iodoacetamide) or 5 mg/ml CHAPS, pH 8.0 (5 mg/ml CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm iodoacetamide). Lysates were first precleared against Protein A-Sepharose, pre-equilibrated at pH 6.0 or 8.0 for 4 h, and then incubated with IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), pH 6.0 or 8.0, with gentle rotation at 4 °C overnight. Following three successive washes with 1 mg/ml CHAPS, pH 6.0 or 8.0, the bound fractions were either directly processed for SDS-PAGE, or alternatively, deglycosylation reactions were performed as described prior to resolution by SDS-PAGE. For experiments assessing the biochemical function of surface hFcRn, the non-binding fraction or flowthrough, following the overnight incubation with IgG-Sepharose, pH 6.0 or 8.0, was transferred into a new Eppendorf and incubated in the presence of avidin-agarose with gentle rotation at 4 °C for at least 4 h. Following extensive washing with 1 mg/ml CHAPS, pH 6.0 or 8.0, the precipitated samples were processed directly for SDS-PAGE. For all biotinylation experiments, cells were plated ∼18–24 h prior to biotinylation, at which point they were ∼60–80% confluent. Following two washes with ice-cold 1× PBS, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min with gentle rocking at 4 °C. This incubation was repeated with fresh sulfo-NHS-biotin. Unreacted biotin was quenched by two sequential 10-min washes with 50 mm NH4Cl/PBS at 4 °C. Following two additional washes with ice-cold 1× PBS, cell lysates were harvested with RIPA lysis buffer as describe"

Among these immune mediators, the involvement of type I interferons (IFNs) in osteoclastic bone resorption remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the participation of IFN-β and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and -3 in osteoclastogenesis. Addition of exogenous IFN-β to osteoclast progenitors (bone-derived monocytes/macrophages) inhibited their differentiation toward osteoclasts induced by the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor with/without transforming growth factor-β, where inhibition was associated with down-regulation of the gene expressions of molecules related to osteoclast differentiation. In addition, RANKL induced the expression of IFN-β; furthermore, neutralizing antibody against type I IFNs accelerated the osteoclast formation, indicating type I IFNs as potential intrinsic inhibitors. On the other hand, RANKL also induced the expression of SOCS-1 and -3, suppressors of the IFN signaling. Pretreatment with RANKL for a sufficient time for the induction of SOCSs attenuated phosphorylation of STAT-1 in response to IFN-β in osteoclast progenitors, causing a decrease in the binding activity of nuclear extracts toward the interferon-stimulated response element. mRNA levels of STAT-1, STAT-2, and IFN-stimulated gene factor-3γ, comprising IFN-stimulated gene factor-3, were not altered by RANKL. Thus, although the inhibitory cytokine such as IFN-β is produced in response to RANKL, the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis may be rescued by the induction of signaling suppressors such as SOCSs.

Bone (New York). 1995; 17: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) has been identified as the most important and critical molecule for osteoclast development in cooperation with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and the RANKL/RANK system produces an essential signal for osteoclast differentiation in the interaction between stromal cells and cells of the osteoclast lineage (5Lacey D.L.

More recently, we demonstrated that endogenous production of transforming growth factor (TGF-β) was essential for osteoclastogenesis as a cofactor with RANKL and M-CSF (8Kaneda T. Nojima T.

Most of the osteotropic factors regulating osteoclast differentiation also affect the immune system as well, suggesting a strong relationship between the two systems. Such immune mediators can be divided into the following two groups regarding their effects on osteoclast differentiation: one consists of stimulatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-α; and the other consists of inhibitory cytokines including IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (9Sabatini M.

Furthermore, the cytokines belonging to each group can also be separated into two subclasses based on their direct or indirect action via stromal cells on cells of the osteoclast lineage. Among the above inhibitory cytokines, one well known immune mediator is the T-cell product IFN-γ, a type II IFN (20Fox S.W. Fuller K. Bayley K.E. Lean J.M. Chambers T.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4957-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). IFN-γ has been demonstrated from in vivo and in vitroobservations to inhibit strongly osteoclast differentiation and function (21Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Tanaka K. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). On the other hand, involvement of type I IFNs (IFNα/β) in osteoclastogenesis remains to be investigated, although the inhibitory effect has been reported recently (22Takayanagi H. Kim S. Matsuo K.

Type I IFNs are produced by a variety of cell types in response to viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections, representing a critical link between innate and acquired immunity through their multiple effects on natural killer cells and T-cells (23Le Page C.

Osteoclasts, macrophages, and dendritic cells are derived from common mononuclear hemopoietic progenitors (1Felix R. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Elford P.R. Stutzer A. Fleisch H. J. Bone Miner.

Taken together, the available data suggest that type I IFNs may potentially influence osteoclastogenesis in an autocrine manner. In this study, we found that bone marrow-derived M/MØ as osteoclast progenitors constitutively expressed type I IFN and that the expression of IFN-β was particularly up-regulated by RANKL. IFN-β intrinsically inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts. However, RANKL simultaneously induced the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 (37Nicola N.A. Greenhalgh C.J. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 1105-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which were earlier shown to block the signaling of IFNs by inhibiting phosphorylation of STATs by Janus kinases (JAK) (38Kile B.T. Alexander W.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thus causing a decrease in IFN-dependent transcription factor complex (IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3)) formation (39Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, although the inhibitory cytokines such as type I IFNs are produced in response to RANKL, the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis may be rescued by inducing the production of signaling suppressors such as SOCSs. The results presented here indicate the intimate cross-talk between inhibitory and stimulatory signalings in osteoclast formation. Recombinant human M-CSF and recombinant mouse soluble RANKL (sRANKL) were kindly provided by Morinaga Milk Industry Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and Snow Brand Milk Industry Co. (Tochigi, Japan). Recombinant human TGF-β1 was obtained from Genzyme/Techne (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant mouse IFN-β was purchased from PBL Biomedical Laboratories (New Brunswick, NJ). The IFN-β was titrated with the use of the cytopathic effect inhibition assay (40Rubinstein S. Familletti P.C. Pestka S. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 755-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this antiviral assay, 1 unit/ml IFN-β was the quantity necessary to produce a cytopathic effect of 50%. Sheep neutralizing antiserum against mouse IFN-α/β was purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Anti-STAT-1 and -STAT-2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Anti-phospho-STAT-1 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Femora and tibiae were obtained from 4- to 5-week-old ICR mice (Shizuoka Laboratories Animal Center, Shizuoka, Japan), and the connective soft tissues were removed from the bones. Bone marrow cells were flushed out from the bone marrow cavity, suspended in α-minimum Eagle's medium (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), M-CSF (100 ng/ml), and 100 units/ml of penicillin, and cultured in Petri dishes in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. During the 3 days in culture, the cells remaining on the bottom of the dishes consisted of a large population of adherent M/MØ-like cells expressing MØ-specific antigens such as Mac-1 and F4/80 and exhibiting phagocytotic activity (8Kaneda T. Nojima T. Nakagawa M. Ogasawara A. Kaneko H. Sato T. Mano H. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4254-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and only a small population of non-adherent cells and adherent stromal cells. After removal of nonadherent cells and stromal cells by washing the dishes with PBS and by subsequent incubation for 5 min in 0.25% trypsin, 0.05% EDTA, respectively, the M/MØ-like hemopoietic cells were harvested in PBS by vigorously pipetting. Isolated M/MØ-like hemopoietic cells were seeded at an initial density of 2.5 × 104/cm2 and cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, M-CSF (20 ng/ml) with or without sRANKL (50 ng/ml) and/or other cytokines or agents. The culture medium was exchanged every 2 days. After a culture period of the desired length, the cells were fixed in 10% formalin and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity with a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma). The total number of cells and numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleate cells (MNCs) with more than three nuclei were counted under a microscope. The TRAP-MNCs were considered to be osteoclastic cells. Thereafter, nuclei of these cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in 0.1% sodium citrate, and the numbers of nuclei in the total cell population and in the TRAP-positive MNCs in the culture were counted under a fluorescence microscope. The total number of nuclei was considered to represent the rate of cell division. A fusion index was calculated as the percentage of the number of nuclei in TRAP-positive MNCs per those in total cells; and this value was considered to be the percent of cells that participated in cell fusion, indicating osteoclast maturation. Total RNA (1 μg) extracted from cells in the culture was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. cDNA was prepared by use of a Superscript II preamplification system (Invitrogen). Primers were synthesized on the basis of the reported mouse cDNA sequences for TRAP, integrin αv, integrin β3, calcitonin receptor, cathepsin K, CD14, interferon-α and -β, SOCS-1, SOCS-3, STAT-1, STAT-2, and ISGF-3γ. Sequences of the primers used for PCR were as follows: TRAP forward, 5′-CACGATGCCAGCGACAAGAG-3′; TRAP reverse, 5′-TGACCCCGTATGTGGCTAAC-3′; integrin αv forward, 5′-GCCAGCCCATTGAGTTTGATT-3′; integrin αv reverse, 5′-GCTACCAGGACCACCGAGAAG-3′; integrin β3 forward, 5′-TTACCCCGTGGACATCTACTA-3′; integrin β3 reverse, 5′-AGTCTTCCATCCAGGGCAATA-3′; cathepsin K forward, 5′-GGAAGAAGACTCACCAGAAGC-3′; cathepsin K reverse, 5′-GTCATATAGCCGCCTCCACAG-3′; calcitonin receptor forward, 5′-ACCGACGAGCAACGCCTACGC-3′; calcitonin receptor reverse, 5′-GCCTTCACAGCCTTCAGGTAC-3′; CD14 forward, 5′-AAGTTCCCGACCCTCCAAGTT-3′; CD14 reverse, 5′-CTGCCTTTCTTTCCTTACATC-3′; IFN-β forward, 5′-CTTCTCCACCACAGCCCTCTC-3′; IFN-β reverse, 5′-CCCACGTCAATCTTTCCTCTT-3′; IFN-α (including consensus sequence of IFN-αs (41Hughes T.K., Jr. Chin R.

Amplification was conducted for 22–32 cycles, each of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5 μl of each cDNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 1 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After amplification, 15 μl of each reaction mixture was analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. After various treatments, the cells were washed with PBS, scraped into a solution consisting of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and sonicated for 15 s. The protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Each sample containing equal amounts of protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins separated in the gel were subsequently electrotransfered onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After having been blocked with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with anti-STAT1 and anti-phospho-STAT1 antibodies and subsequently with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with Western blot chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. After M/MØ-like hemopoietic cells had been incubated with or without sRANKL for 8 h, the cells were treated with IFN-β for the indicated times and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 10 min on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), and scraped into the buffer. The cell lysates were incubated further for 10 min on ice and then transferred to tubes. The nuclei obtained by centrifugation for 1 min at 5,000 ×g were extracted by a 30-min incubation in ice-cold buffer C, consisting of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 420 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The extracts were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE, 5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′, element underlined (42Petricoin III, E. David M. Igarashi K.

The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by competition with a 50-fold molar excess of nonlabeled oligonucleotides. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 7.2% PAGE in 0.5× TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. In addition, the nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-STAT-1 and anti-STAT2 for 30 min on ice after binding to the oligonucleotides and then were subjected to PAGE. When bone marrow-derived M/MØ was incubated with M-CSF and sRANKL, and particularly when TGF-β was also present, most of the cells differentiated into cells of the osteoclast lineage and became mature osteoclasts, as described previously (8Kaneda T. Nojima T. Nakagawa M. Ogasawara A. Kaneko H. Sato T. Mano H. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4254-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Addition of exogenous IFN-β reduced the number of osteoclastic TRAP-positive MNCs formed in these cultures in a dose-related manner (Fig.1), whereas the total nuclear number was not changed (data not shown). The fusion index of TRAP-positive MNCs, defined as the percent of cells participating in the fusion, was suppressed by IFN-β in parallel with the inhibition of the formation of TRAP-positive MNCs. Semiquantitative PCR analysis revealed that treatment with M-CSF and sRANKL for 6 days or with M-CSF, TGF-β, and sRANKL for 4 days induced an increase in the levels of mRNA for TRAP, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, and integrin αvand β3, all of which are abundantly expressed in osteoclasts and considered as marker molecules for osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 2). IFN-β decreased the induced levels of mRNA for these molecules (Fig. 2). These results indicate that exogenous IFN-β strongly suppressed the process of osteoclast differentiation from the progenitors, bone marrow-derived M/MØ cells.Figure 2Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis for the expression of various mRNAs. Isolated M/MØ cells were treated for 6 days with M-CSF (20 ng/ml, M), M-CSF + sRANKL (50 ng/ml, MR), M-CSF + sRANKL + IFN-β (10 units/ml,MRI), and M-CSF + IFN-β (MI) or for 4 days with M-CSF+ TGF-β (1 ng/ml, MT), M-CSF + TGF-β + sRANKL (MTR), M-CSF + TGF-β + sRANKL + IFN-β (MTRI), and M-CSF + TGF-β + IFN-β (MTI), and then the total RNA in each culture was extracted. Primers used were designed for mouse genes of TRAP, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, integrins αv and β3 and β-actin. Each cDNA was amplified for the number of PCR cycles indicated inparentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Type I IFNs were demonstrated earlier to be produced by a variety of cell types including M/MØ cells (27Rothfuchs A.G.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 2553-2557PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the potential ability of osteoclast progenitors to produce type I IFNs in osteoclast progenitors. Thus, we examined the expression of type I IFNs in osteoclast progenitors in response to sRANKL. The messenger RNA level of IFN-α did not change consistently (data not shown). However, the level of IFN-β mRNA significantly increased as early as 1 h after exposure to sRANKL (Fig.3 A). The increase reached a maximum after 5 h of treatment, and the increase was not affected by adding cycloheximide (Fig. 3 B), indicating that sRANKL strongly induced the expression of IFN-β in osteoclast progenitors and that the induction was not mediated by any other RANKL-induced proteins but occurred via the direct action of RANKL. Thus, we next examined how the endogenous type I IFNs influenced osteoclastogenesis from osteoclast precursors. When anti-IFNα/β neutralizing antibody was added to cultures of bone marrow-derived M/MØ cells in the presence of M-CSF and sRANKL with or without TGF-β, formation of osteoclastic TRAP-positive MNCs in the cultures was accelerated compared with that in the absence of the antibody (Fig.4 A). The acceleration depended on the dose of the neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 4, B andC), suggesting that the osteoclast progenitors endogenously produced type I IFNs depending on the signal of RANKL and that these cytokines inhibited the osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL.Figure 4Effect of neutralizing anti-IFNα/β antibody on osteoclast generation. A, osteoclast precursors (M/MØ cells) were isolated after a 3-day treatment of bone marrow cells with M-CSF (100 ng/ml), and the isolated M/MØ cells (5 × 104 cells/each well of 24-well plates) were cultured for the indicated periods with neutralizing anti-IFN α/β antiserum (closed symbols, 40 neutralization units (N.U)/ml) or the same concentration of normal sheep serum (open symbols) in the presence (triangles) of M-CSF (20 ng/ml) and sRANKL (50 ng/ml), or in the presence (circles) of M-CSF (20 ng/ml), sRANKL (50 ng/ml), and TGF-β (1 ng/ml). One N.U is defined as the amount of antiserum required to neutralize 50% of the activity of 1 unit of mouse IFN-α/β. B and C, the isolated M/MØ cells were cultured with various concentrations of neutralizing anti-IFN-α/β antiserum (shaded bars) or normal sheep serum (open bars) in the presence of M-CSF (20 ng/ml) and sRANKL (50 ng/ml) for 6 days (B), or in the presence of M-CSF (20 ng/ml), sRANKL (50 ng/ml), and TGF-β (1 ng/ml) for 4 days (C). At the end of the culture period, the cells were stained for TRAP activity, and the number of TRAP-positive MNCs per well was then counted. The experiments were performed three times, and the reproducibility was confirmed. Values are means + S.E. for three cultures in a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These above results highlight the discrepancy between the induction of osteoclast differentiation and the production of the inhibitory cytokines such as type I IFNs, both of which were mediated by RANKL signaling, thus leading to a possibility that there may be a mechanism for negating the inhibitory action of endogenous IFNα/β on osteoclastogenesis. So we next focused on SOCSs as negative regulators of the action of IFNα/β. Eight isoforms of SOCS were earlier identified as a family of intracellular proteins controlling the magnitude and/or duration of signals propagated by diverse cytokine receptors by suppressing their signal transduction process (37Nicola N.A. Greenhalgh C.J. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 1105-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of sRANKL on the expression of SOCS-1 and -3 mRNAs in osteoclast progenitors by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Messenger RNA levels of SOCSs in bone marrow-derived M/MØ cells as osteoclast progenitors were time-dependently increased by treatment with sRANKL. The magnitude of the"

They are activated by the phosphorylation of the T loop of their kinase domain by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and by phosphorylation of a residue located C-terminal to the kinase domain in a region termed the hydrophobic motif. Recent work has implicated the NIMA (never in mitosis, geneA)-related kinase-6 (NEK6) as the enzyme that phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6K1 in vivo. Here we demonstrate that in addition to phosphorylating S6K1 and SGK1 at their hydrophobic motif, NEK6 also phosphorylates S6K1 at two other sites and phosphorylates SGK1 at one other site in vitro. Employing the Jerini pepSTAR method in combination with kinetic analysis of phosphorylation of variant peptides, we establish the key substrate specificity determinants for NEK6. Our analysis indicates that NEK6 has a strong preference for Leu 3 residues N-terminal to the site of phosphorylation. Its mutation to either Ile or Val severely reduced the efficacy with which NEK6-phosphorylated peptide substrates, and moreover, mutation of the equivalent Leu residue in S6K1 or SGK1 prevented phosphorylation of their hydrophobic motifs by NEK6 in vitro. However, these mutants of S6K1 or SGK1 still became phosphorylated at their hydrophobic motif following insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation of transfected 293 cells. This study provides the first description of the basis for the substrate specificity of NEK6 and indicates that NEK6 is unlikely to be responsible for the IGF1-induced phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of S6K, SGK, and protein kinase B isoforms in vivo.

(2001) http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans ;2001/108/re17Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase triggers the phosphorylation of PKB, S6K, and SGK isoforms at 2 residues, leading to their activation. One of these residues lies in the T-loop (also known as the activation loop) of the kinase domain (Thr308 in PKBα, Thr252 in S6K1, and Thr256 in SGK1), and the other is located C-terminal to the catalytic domain, in a region termed the “hydrophobic motif” (Ser473 in PKBα, Thr412 in S6K1, and Ser422 in SGK1). Phosphorylation of PKBα at Thr308 is sufficient to activate PKBα substantially, which is then further activated following its phosphorylation at Ser473. In contrast, S6K and SGK require phosphorylation of both their T-loop and hydrophobic motif residues to become activated significantly. PKB, S6K, and SGK isoforms are phosphorylated at their T-loop by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) (7Alessi D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar,8Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). PDK1 is also an AGC family member and possesses a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding Pleckstrin homology domain C-terminal to the catalytic domain. Following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, PDK1 and PKB are co-localized at the plasma membrane through their mutual interaction with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In addition to recruiting PKB to cell membranes, the binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to the Pleckstrin homology domain of PKB may induce a conformational change that enables PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr308 (reviewed in Ref. 9Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). In contrast, S6K and SGK do not interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, since these enzymes do not possess a Pleckstrin homology domain; nor is the rate at which they are phosphorylated by PDK1 in vitroenhanced in the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Recent evidence indicates that the phosphorylation of S6K and SGK at their hydrophobic motif plays a key role in promoting the interaction of these enzymes with PDK1, hence resulting in their activation (10Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that if phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase could trigger the activation protein kinase(s) that phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6K and SGK, this would convert these enzymes into better substrates for PDK1. Much recent work has therefore focused on identifying the protein kinases that phosphorylate S6K, SGK, and PKB at their hydrophobic motif. Recently, Avruch and colleagues purified a major activity from rat liver extracts that phosphorylates S6K1 at its hydrophobic motif and identified this enzyme as the NIMA (neverin mitosis, gene A)-related kinase-6 (NEK6) (11Belham C. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NEK6 in unstimulated cells, induced phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr412, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant of NEK6 prevented insulin-mediated activation of S6K and its phosphorylation at Thr412. These observations suggested that NEK6 might phosphorylate the hydrophobic motif of S6K1 directly in vivo. The hydrophobic motifs of S6K, SGK, and PKB isoforms lie in a conserved Phe-Pro/Leu-Xaa-Phe-Ser/Thr-Tyr motif, where Xaa is any amino acid and the Ser/Thr is the phosphorylated residue. It is therefore possible that a common upstream protein kinase phosphorylates the hydrophobic motifs of all three enzymes. In this study, we investigate the molecular determinants of NEK6 substrate specificity and perform experiments that indicate that NEK6 is unlikely to phosphorylate the hydrophobic motif of PKB, S6K, and SGK in cells.

The lysates were pooled and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and eluted in buffer A containing 20 mm glutathione and 0.27m sucrose, as described previously for PKBα (16Alessi D.R.

Wild type and kinase-dead NEK6 were expressed and purified in a similar manner except that the 293 cells were not deprived of serum. Typically between 0.3 and 0.5 mg of each GST fusion protein was obtained, and each protein was more than 90% homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified, and activated by phosphorylation with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 as described previously (19Alessi D.R.

In order to generate transfer vectors for baculovirus production, the NEK6 cDNASpeI-SpeI insert fragments derived from the pCR2.1-Topo vector were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pFastBAC-Hta vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct encodes FLAG-NEK6 with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and was then used to generate recombinant baculovirus using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. These baculoviruses were used to infect Spodoptera frugiperda 21 cells (1.5 × 106/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The infected cells were harvested 72 h postinfection, and His-tagged protein was purified as previously described for His-PDK1 (20Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R.

NEK6 was purified with yields of ∼5 mg/liter of infected cells and was greater than 85% homogeneous as judged by densitometric scanning of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The wild and mutant AGC kinases (4 μg) were incubated with wild type NEK6 (2 μg in Fig. 2 and 1 μg in Fig. 1) in buffer A containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (104 cpm/pmol), and 1 μm microcystin-LR in a total reaction volume of 30 μl. After the indicated times, the reactions were terminated by adding SDS to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and dithiothreitol to 10 mm and heated at 100 °C for 1 min. After cooling, 4-vinylpyridine was added to a concentration of 50 mm, and the samples were left on a shaking platform for 30 min at room temperature in the dark to alkylate cysteine residues and then subjected to electrophoresis on a BisTris 4–12% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 and autoradiographed, and the bands corresponding to phosphorylated AGC kinases were excised and cut into smaller pieces. These were washed sequentially for 15 min on a vibrating platform with 1 ml of the following: water, a 1:1 mixture of water and acetonitrile, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, and finally acetonitrile. The gel pieces were dried by rotary evaporation and incubated in 0.1 ml of 50 mmammonium bicarbonate, 0.05% (by mass) Zwittergent 3-16 containing 1 μg of alkylated trypsin. After 18 h, 0.1 ml of acetonitrile was added, and the mixture was incubated on a shaking platform for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the gel pieces were further washed for 10 min in 0.3 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 0.1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid. The combined supernatants containing >90% of the 32P radioactivity were chromatographed on a Vydac 218TP54 C18 column (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) as described in the legend to Fig 2.Figure 1Time course of NEK6-catalyzed phosphorylation of S6K1, SGK1, and PKB α. 2 μg of S6K1ΔCT, SGK1ΔNT, or PKBα were incubated with 1 μg of wild type (WT) or catalytically inactive (KD) NEK6[D183A] in buffer A containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (103 cpm/pmol), and 1 μm microcystin-LR in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for the times indicated, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 6 μl of sample buffer and electrophoresed on a BisTris 4–12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was stained with Ponceau S dye and autoradiographed. The bands corresponding to S6K1ΔCT, SGK1ΔNT, and PKBα were excised, and the 32P radioactivity was quantitated by Cerenkov counting. 32P incorporation into substrates is shown quantitatively (upper panel) and by autoradiography (lower panel).

Spectra were obtained in both the linear and reflector mode. Edman sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 494A sequenator also confirmed the sequence identity of certain peptides. The site of phosphorylation of all of the32P-labeled peptides was determined by solid-phase Edman degradation of the peptide coupled to Sequelon-AA membrane (Milligen, Bedford, MA) as described previously (21Stokoe D.

Immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-Thr412 S6K phosphospecific antibodies (1:2000 dilution of stock antibody), anti-S6K1 (0.2 μg/ml), and anti-SGK1 (0.2 μg/ml) was performed overnight at 4 °C in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% (by volume) Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) containing 10% (by mass) skimmed milk. Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For substrate identification, peptide arrays termed Jerini pepSTAR were employed. Peptides for the arrays were synthesized on cellulose membranes in a parallel manner using SPOT technology (22Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 23Wenschuh H. Volkmer-Engert R. Schmidt M. Schulz M. Schneider-Mergener J. Reineke U. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 188-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Following side chain deprotection, the solid phase bound peptides were transferred into 96-well microtiter filtration plates (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and treated with 0.1% (by volume) triethylamine for 1 h in order to cleave the peptides from the cellulose. After filtration, the triethylamine solution was removed by lyophilization and treated with 75% (by volume) Me2SO in aqueous acetate buffer (0.2 m, pH 4). The peptides were deposited to aldehyde functionalized glass slides (Quantifoil, Jena, Germany) using a noncontact piezoelectric driven pipetting system as described by the manufacturer (GESIM, Großerkmannsdorf, Germany). For each peptide spotted onto the glass slide, four droplets of 0.5 nl were sequentially deposited. Each spot was separated by 0.7 mm and possessed a diameter of 550 μm. Finally, the peptides were covalently immobilized to the glass slide surface via an N-terminal spacer element, composed of a moiety that is able to react chemoselectively with the aldehyde groups at the glass slides and a β-alanine spacing unit. Two types of pepSTAR arrays were employed in this study. One contained overlapping peptide sequences from MBP and histone H1, whereas the other chip contained 710 different peptide sequences from the annotated phosphorylation sites of human proteins of the SWISSPROT data base as well as 10 control peptides. Each peptide is present in triplicate on the chip, and details of the peptide sequences present on each chip can be obtained on the World Wide Web at www.Jerini.com. One peptide substrate identified, namely GLAKSFGSPNRAYKK, was selected for further substitutional analysis. This was achieved by generating another peptide microarray in which each residue of this peptide was substituted by each of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids and also included the parent peptide as a control. These peptides were immobilized to glass slides as described above. Two peptide chips were layered face to face to each other, with a polypropylene spacer of 0.2-mm thickness placed at both ends. The resulting space between them was filled with a 0.3-ml solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol), and 3 μg of His-NEK6. After a 60-min incubation at 30 °C, the peptide microarrays were washed three times, alternating between water and 0.1m phosphoric acid. The phosphorylated peptides were detected following phosphorimaging on a FLA-3000 phosphor imager (Fuji, Japan) with a resolution of 50 μm. The evaluation of the data was performed using ArrayPro software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Peptides were synthesized using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids on rink amide resin (24Rink H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 3787-3790Crossref Scopus (809) Google Scholar). A 20% solution of piperidine in dimethylformamide was used for deprotection of resin-bound fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-conjugated peptides. Final deprotection and resin cleavage was performed using 98% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h. Peptides were precipitated in methyl tert-butyl ether. Following filtration, peptides were lyophilized and dissolved in 30% acetonitrile in water. Peptides were then purified using a preparative high pressure liquid chromatography (Merck; column: 25 × 250 mm, LiChrosorb, 7 μm, RP18; Merck) and aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity and identity of all peptides was checked by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, respectively. In all cases, purity exceeded 95%. A 40-μl reaction mixture was prepared containing 200 ng of His-NEK6 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 μm microcystin-LR, and the indicated concentration of peptide substrate. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm magnesium acetate and 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol). After incubation for 5–15 min at 30 °C, incorporation of [32P]phosphate into each peptide substrate was determined using P81 phosphocellulose paper, as described previously (25Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Time course reactions were performed in order to ensure that the rate of phosphorylation was linear with time. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten relationship by nonlinear regression using the computer program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). For the data shown in Figs. 7and 8, 50 μg of 293 cell lysate were used to affinity-purify on glutathione-Sepharose the wild type and mutant forms of GST-S6K1 or GST-SGK1. The lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a shaking platform with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and twice with 1 ml of Buffer A. The assay (50-μl total volume) in addition to the washed glutathione-Sepharose beads contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm glutathione, 2.5 μm protein kinase A inhibitor (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol), and 30 μmCrosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as the S6K1/SGK substrate. The assays were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C, with the assay tubes being agitated continuously, and then terminated and analyzed as described previously for extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 kinase assays (25Alessi D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2142097464,"Cystic fibrosis is characterized by chronic inflammation and an imbalance in the concentrations of alveolar and lung oxidants and antioxidants, which result in cell damage. Modifications in lung glutathione concentrations are recognized as a salient feature of inflammatory lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, and glutathione plays a major role in protection against oxidative stress and is important in modulation of apoptosis. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is permeable to Cl−, larger organic ions, and reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, and the ΔF508 CFTR mutation found in cystic fibrosis patients has been correlated with impaired glutathione transport in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia. Because intracellular glutathione protects against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, we studied the susceptibility of epithelial cells (HeLa and IB3–1) expressing normal and mutant CFTR to apoptosis triggered by H2O2. We find that cells with normal CFTR are more sensitive to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis than cells expressing defective CFTR. In addition, sensitivity to apoptosis could be correlated with glutathione levels, because depletion of intracellular glutathione results in higher levels of apoptosis, and glutathione levels decreased faster in cells expressing normal CFTR than in cells with defective CFTR during incubation with H2O2. The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, BAX, is also activated faster in cells expressing normal CFTR than in those with mutant CFTR under these conditions, and artificial glutathione depletion increases the extent of BAX activation. These results suggest that glutathione-dependent BAX activation in cells with normal CFTR represents an early step in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of these cells.

Mutations in the gene encoding CFTR are responsible for cystic fibrosis, whose pathology was thought to be due primarily to a decrease in Cl− permeability through the CFTR (4Quinton P.M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2709-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how a change in Cl− permeability could account for the large variety of symptoms observed during cystic fibrosis. The pathology associated with cystic fibrosis is maintained by repeated lung infections, mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which provokes inflammatory responses that lead to lung fibrosis and respiratory failure (5Konstan M.W. Berger M. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 1997; 24: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 6Lyczak J.B. Cannon C.L. Pier G.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Pulmonary injury is related to the production of oxidants in the inflammatory environment that lead to necrosis of lung epithelial cells (3Hudson V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1440-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 5Konstan M.W. Berger M. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 1997; 24: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and infected epithelial cells expressing mutant CFTR are less sensitive to apoptosis than cells expressing normal CFTR (7Cannon C.L. Stopak K. Pier G.B. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1999; 19: 322Google Scholar). However, even in the absence of infection, inflammation is manifest in young children, and inflammatory mediators are maintained constitutively at high levels in cystic fibrosis patients (8Muhlebach M.S. Stewart P.W. Leigh M.W. Noah T.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Weber A. Nguyen B. Bryan R.T. Ratner A. Prince A. Pediatr. Pulmonol.

Because cells undergoing necrosis release debris that initiate inflammatory responses, it is thus likely that cells expressing mutant CFTR are also more resistant to apoptosis than normal cells in the absence of infection. Consistent with this view, large DNA fragments, typical of necrotic cells, are released in cystic fibrosis epithelia, thus increasing the viscosity of the mucus, and inhaled DNase I improves the respiratory condition of cystic fibrosis patients (11Ranasinha C.

In apoptotic cells, DNA is fragmented into small fragments and packaged into apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by neighboring cells, in a way that minimizes an inflammatory response. Recently it was shown that both the anionic tripeptide glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH) as well as the oxidized glutathione can permeate through the plasma membrane from the cytosol to the extracellular space via a CFTR-dependent mechanism (1Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C323-C326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gao L. Kim K.J. Yankaskas J.R. Forman H.J. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L24-L30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) thus establishing a possible link between CFTR and antioxidant defenses of the lung. Glutathione is considered to be the most important water-soluble antioxidant within cells. It keeps other antioxidants such as β-carotenes, tocopherols, and ascorbate in their reduced form, and it functions in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide in reactions catalyzed by glutathione peroxidases (18Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione is also an important antioxidant in the lung (19Van Klaveren R.J. Demedts M. Nemery B. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1392-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Rahman I. MacNee W. Eur. Respir. J. 2000; 16: 534-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), and the GSH concentration is greatly reduced in airway surface fluid of cystic fibrosis patients (21Roum J.H. Buhl R. McElvaney N.G. Borok Z. Crystal R.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These defects can be attributed directly to missing or defective CFTR channels, because the glutathione concentration in the lung epithelial lining fluid of CFTR-deficient mice is decreased by half, compared with that in wild-type mice (22Velsor L.W. van Heeckeren A. Day B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L31-L38PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidative stress that results from chronic inflammation in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients could thus be exacerbated by the decrease in GSH levels. Because glutathione effluxes through the CFTR directly (1Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C323-C326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gao L. Kim K.J. Yankaskas J.R. Forman H.J. Am.

Toxicol. 1999; 29: 543-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the decreased ability of cells expressing mutant CFTR to secrete glutathione may result in their decreased ability to undergo apoptosis (3Hudson V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1440-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, glutathione is actively extruded during apoptosis of cells treated with reactive oxygen species (25Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Maresca V. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To address directly the link between glutathione transport by CFTR and apoptosis, we have measured apoptosis of epithelial cells expressing mutant and normal CFTR after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. We have also measured the concentration of glutathione in the same cells as a function of time during oxidative stress and have studied the effects of glutathione depletion on apoptosis of the cells. Finally, because metabolic or oxidative stress activates or induces expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BAX (26Ho Y.S. Lee H.M. Mou T.C. Wang Y.J. Lin J.K. Mol.

Our results support the view that cells expressing normal CFTR are more sensitive to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis than cells expressing mutant CFTR because of enhanced glutathione depletion in the normal cells. In addition, we propose that glutathione depletion results in BAX activation, which is responsible for the subsequent apoptosis of normal cells.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin and 250 μg/ml Zeocin (all reagents were from Invitrogen) in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The starting cell lines were regularly maintained in Plasmocin (Invitrogen). IB3–1 CF airway epithelial cells (31Zeitlin P.L., Lu, L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K.A. Craig R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) were grown in airway epithelial cell growth medium KIT from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany) containing the Supplement Pack without epinephrine-250 and RA-50 and supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. HeLa cells at 70% confluency were incubated with H2O2 at the indicated concentrations for different times by diluting the H2O2 directly into the cell culture medium. Both adherent cells and cells in supernatant were collected, washed, and prepared for cytofluorimetry. Annexin V-PE (BD PharMingen) was used to identify apoptotic cells, following the manufacturer's instructions (32Schmid I. Krall W.J. Uittenbogaart C.H. Braun J. Giorgi J.V. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The cells were washed and transferred into 12- × 75-mm Falcon 2052 FACS tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and data from 10,000 HeLa cells were collected on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with an argon laser tuned to 488 nm. Cell death was quantified using CellQuest software. Cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells in 60-mm Petri dishes 24 h before transfection with the pTracer plasmid, the wild-type CFTR construct (pTCFwt), or pTCFΔF508 using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells in each Petri dish were transfected with 500 μl of cell culture medium, 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 8 μl of Plus reagent, and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE without FCS or antibiotics. After transfecting the cells for 4 h at 37 °C, 2 ml of cell culture medium containing 20% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin was added to each dish. Transfection of IB3–1 CF cells under these conditions yielded 40–55% positively transfected cells, as determined by cytofluorimetry measurement of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of H2O2 for an additional 24 h. Apoptosis was measured by cytofluorimetry using annexin V-PE, as above, but gating only on GFP-positive cells. A quantitative determination of the total intracellular glutathione was performed as described by Tietze (33Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Confluent HeLa cell monolayers in six-well plates were collected in 0.5 ml of PBS, 1 mm EDTA. Glutathione extraction was performed by treating the cell suspension with 0.2 equivalent volume of a 5% sulfosalicylic acid solution on ice for 15 min and assaying the supernatant reactions after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge (stored at 4 °C until use). After glutathione extraction, the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay). Samples were diluted 10-fold in a 100 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA buffer solution at pH 7.5, and 50 μl per well were transferred to a 96-well microplate. The following freshly prepared reagents were then mixed at room temperature: 2.8 ml of 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), 3.75 ml of 1 mm NADPH, 5.85 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA buffer, and 20 units of glutathione reductase (reaction mixture). A range of reduced glutathione concentrations was prepared on the same day in 100 mmsodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, with 0.02 equivalent volumes of 5% sulfosalicylic acid, and was used for calibration by transferring 50 μl per well to a 96-well microplate. One hundred microliters of reaction mixture was immediately added to each well containing sample or standard, and the microplate was placed on the microtiter plate reader using a 420-nm filter. The samples were mixed for 5 s, and absorbance was read for 5 min. Samples were compared with the calibration curve to determine the glutathione concentration in each well. dl-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and glutathione ethyl ester (GSHee) were from Sigma Chemical Co. For depletion of intracellular glutathione, an HeLa cell monolayer at 50% confluence was pretreated with 200 μm BSO for 24 h before incubating with H2O2 in the presence of the same concentration of BSO (34Celli A. Que F.G. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G749-G757PubMed Google Scholar). For reversal of glutathione depletion, the cells were treated with 200 μm BSO and 3 mm GSHee for 24 h, changing the medium every 12 h, and then with H2O2 in the presence of the same concentrations of BSO and GSHee (34Celli A. Que F.G. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G749-G757PubMed Google Scholar). A monolayer of HeLa cells confluent at 70% was plated in six-well plates and incubated for the indicated times with H2O2in culture medium. The cells were then collected with PBS, 1 mm EDTA, and washed twice with PBS by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 2 μg/ml BAX rabbit polyclonal IgG (BAX N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% saponin for 30 min, then washed with PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of PE-conjugated anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG (1:200 dilution; from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% saponin for 20 min. Samples were washed and suspended in PBS, transferred into 12- × 75-mm Falcon 2052 FACS tubes, and analyzed on the FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software, as above. HeLa cells were cultured on microscope slides in six-well plates. After treatment with 90 μm H2O2 for 8 h, the supernatant was removed and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (35Ojcius D.M. Niedergang F. Subtil A. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. Res. Immunol. 1996; 147: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fixation was stopped by adding the same volume of 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 20 min. Slides were washed in PBS and incubated with 2 μg/ml BAX rabbit polyclonal IgG in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% saponin for 45 min, then washed with PBS and incubated with 10 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG (Immunotech) in PBS, 0.05% saponin for 15 min. A monoclonal antibody against mitochondrial hsp70 (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) was used at a dilution of 1:100, followed by a Cy3-conjugated second antibody at a 1:100 dilution. The microscope slides were rinsed in PBS, air-dried, and mounted with Dako mounting medium. Samples were examined with a Leica confocal microscope (Institut Jacques Monod, Paris), and images were analyzed with Adobe Photoshop software. The CFTR contains several functional domains, including hydrophobic regions thought to interact with membranes, a regulatory region with several protein kinase substrate sites, and two ATP-binding domains. The most common CFTR mutation associated with cystic fibrosis leads to omission of a phenylalanine residue (Phe-508) in a nucleotide binding region (36Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). We therefore studied apoptosis induced by H2O2 in epithelial (HeLa) cell lines stably transfected with the plasmid (pTracer), the wild-type CFTR construct (pTCFwt), and the CFTR ΔF508 mutation (pTCFΔF508). All cell lines showed a similar level of apoptosis after a 24-h incubation in cell culture medium, but there was a significant increase in apoptosis after treatment with 90 or 900 μmH2O2 for 24 h (Fig.1). Little enhancement of apoptosis due to 90 μm H2O2 was observed after 8 h, but wild-type cells displayed higher levels of H2O2-induced apoptosis than pTracer or ΔF508 after treatment with 90 μm H2O2for 24 h. The same tendency, although at higher levels, was observed when the different cell lines were exposed to 900 μm H2O2 for 8 h or 24 h (Fig. 1). Thus, HeLa cells expressing normal CFTR are more sensitive to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis than either cells expressing plasmid alone or cells expressing the ΔF508 mutation. Sensitivity to H2O2-induced apoptosis was also measured in a human airway epithelial cells from a cystic fibrosis patient (IB3–1) (31Zeitlin P.L., Lu, L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K.A. Craig R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) that were transiently transfected with pTracer, pTCFwt, or pTCFΔF508. This CF bronchial epithelial cell line was incubated with 90 or 300 μm H2O2, and apoptosis was measured by cytofluorimetry using annexin V-PE staining, as above for HeLa cells. Because the transfected cells also expressed GFP, apoptosis was measured only for the GFP-positive cells. After treatment with 90 μm H2O2, IB3–1 cells expressing normal CFTR were significantly more sensitive to apoptosis than cells expressing mutant CFTR (Fig.2). There was also a higher sensitivity of the CFTR-expressing cells to apoptosis induced by 300 μm H2O2, but the difference between wild-type and mutant CFTR became smaller. Glutathione protects cells against oxidative damage and other types of toxicity that could lead to apoptosis (18Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, H2O2 induces apoptosis in many cell types, including epithelial cells, and H2O2-mediated apoptosis is inhibited by intracellular glutathione (37Hultberg B. Andersson A. Isaksson A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 283: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Morcillo E.J. Estera J. Cortijo J. Pharmacol. Res. 1999; 40: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Hall A.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether glutathione levels could correlate with sensitivity to H2O2-induced apoptosis in our cells, the relative glutathione concentration was measured for the HeLa cell lines transfected with plasmid (pTracer) or expressing wild-type CFTR. The basal glutathione concentration was reproducibly lower in cells expressing normal CFTR than vector alone, and glutathione levels decreased faster in wild-type than control cells after treatment with 90 μm H2O2 (Fig.3), suggesting that wild-type cells lose intracellular glutathione due to CFTR-dependent transport during oxidative stress. Glutathione is synthesized by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is an irreversible inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and is often used to inhibit glutathione synthesis (18Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large decrease in the intracellular concentration of glutathione was observed after treatment of HeLa cells with BSO, in the absence of H2O2(Fig. 3). Because the glutathione depletion by BSO was equally effective in cells expressing wild-type CFTR and no CFTR, the effect of BSO was then tested on the sensitivity to H2O2-induced apoptosis of wild-type cells. BSO treatment by itself had no effect on the level of spontaneous apoptosis, but it increased dramatically the extent of apoptosis after incubation with H2O2 (Fig.4). In addition, the effect was reversible, because it could be counteracted by the presence of GSHee, which prevents BSO-dependent glutathione depletion. Cells expressing wild-type CFTR are, therefore, more sensitive to H2O2-induced apoptosis at least in part due to the lower intracellular glutathione concentration in wild-type cells. Likewise, the sensitivity to apoptosis could be exacerbated through artificial depletion of intracellular glutathione. We then explored the possibility that enhanced depletion of glutathione in CFTR-expressing cells could cause BAX to be activated faster than in cells with defective CFTR. The state of BAX activation was detected by immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetry using an antibody that is specific for an N-terminal epitope that becomes exposed during activation of BAX and its translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria (28Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 43Pawlowski J. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells in the absence of H2O2treatment, there was only faint labeling of BAX, suggesting that the BAX was present mostly in the cytosol. Following incubation with 90 μm H2O2 for 8 h, the fluorescence labeling of BAX became more intense, as expected for BAX activation, and most of the protein was localized on organelle structures that expressed a mitochondrial heat-shock protein (Fig.5). Thus, oxidative stress causes BAX to become activated in epithelial cells and to translocate to mitochondria. The ability of H2O2 to activate BAX was then tested in pTracer, wild-type CFTR cells, ΔF508, and cells expressing another CFTR mutation, G551D. The G551D mutation is less common than ΔF508, but it traffics normally to the plasma membrane, unlike ΔF508, most of which is processed improperly and remains within the cell (44Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). There was no significant increase in BAX activation in any of the cell lines after a 2-h incubation with 90 μmH2O2, but a large increase in BAX activation was already observed in wild-type cells after 4 h (Fig.6). Some BAX activation, reaching 20%, was measured in all cell types after 8 h of H2O2 treatment, at which time 40% of wild-type cells contained activated BAX. Oxidative stress is therefore able to activate BAX in epithelial cells, and BAX is activated faster in cells expressing normal CFTR than in cells expressing defective CFTR. The possible correlation between glutathione levels and BAX activation was then investigated by measuring BAX activation by cytofluorimetry in wild-type cells treated with 90 μmH2O2 for 6 h. In cells depleted of glutathione by BSO, oxidative stress induced BAX activation to a higher extent than in the absence of depletion, and the enhancement of apoptosis by BSO could be reversed by GSHee (Fig.7). Intracellular glutathione concentrations therefore control the extent to which H2O2 promotes BAX activation in epithelial cells. Because there is significant BAX activation in H2O2-treated cells within 4 h (Fig. 6), at which time there is still only a low level of apoptosis (Fig. 1), these results suggest that glutathione-dependent BAX activation precedes apoptosis of these cells during oxidative stress. Cystic fibrosis was originally thought to be due to CFTR mutations that impair Cl− channel activity. However, additional CFTR functions modified by the mutations were later identified, affecting notably Cl−-coupled HCO3−transport (45Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 46Clarke L.L. Harline M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G718-G726PubMed Google Scholar, 47Illek B. Yankaskas J.R. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L752-L761PubMed Google Scholar), and CFTR may also transport ions and molecules other than Cl−, including both the oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione (1Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C323-C326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gao L. Kim K.J. Yankaskas J.R. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L113-L118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CFTR-dependent Cl−-coupled HCO3− transport could potentially modify cytosolic and extracellular pH, and CFTR mutations have been associated with defects in tissue acidification (45Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Cytosolic acidification is also an early step in many pathways of apoptosis (28Khaled A.R."

The full-length mouse EMR4 cDNA encodes a predicted 689-amino acid protein containing two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules, a mucin-like spacer domain, and a seven-transmembrane domain with a cytoplasmic tail. Genetic mapping established thatmEMR4 is localized in the distal region of mouse chromosome 17 in close proximity to another EGF-TM7 gene,F4/80 (Emr1). Similar toF4/80, mEMR4 is predominantly expressed on resident macrophages.

By coupling heterotrimeric G proteins to their characteristic seven-transmembrane (TM7) and cytoplasmic regions, GPCRs mediate the signal transduction of an extensive array of exogenous stimuli including hormones, cytokines, peptides, amino acid derivatives, ions, neurotransmitters, light, taste, and odors (1Bockaert J.

Characterized by a set of 6 conserved cysteine residues typically disulfide bond in a 1–3, 2–4, 5–6 arrangement, the tandemly arrayed EGF-like modules of the EGF-TM7 molecules belong to the class I EGF-like modules often found in connective tissue proteins such as fibrillin-1 and -2 and fibulins (19Downing A.K.

Within this region, a highly conserved Cys-rich domain located immediately before the first TM segment has been identified in all EGF-TM7 proteins. This domain, termed the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) domain, is characterized by four invariant Cys, one Gly, and two conserved Trp residues spaced in restricted positions (25Krasnoperov V.G.

Although its significance is still unknown, this unusual yet highly conserved post-translational protein modification is likely to have a physiological function for the EGF-TM7 receptors.

Based upon their unique protein structure and restricted expression patterns, it has been suggested that the EGF-TM7 molecules may play a role in the cellular functions of myeloid leukocytes and cardiac muscle differentiation by interacting with other cell surface proteins or extracellular matrix proteins, leading to intracellular signaling. Indeed, the presence of cellular ligands has been demonstrated for CD97 (42Hamann J. Vogel B. van Schijndel G.M. van Lier R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), EMR3 (13Stacey M. Lin H.H. Hilyard K.L. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18863-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and EMR2. 2Lin et al., manuscript in preparation. CD97 is the first EGF-TM7 molecule shown to interact with a defined cellular ligand, CD55 (decay-accelerating factor; DAF) (42Hamann J. Vogel B. van Schijndel G.M. van Lier R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 43Hamann J. Stortelers C. Kiss-Toth E. Vogel B. Eichler W. van Lier R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have recently further demonstrated that CD97 interacts with CD55 solely by the EGF-like modules and that the interaction is characterized by a low affinity (86 μm) and rapid off-rate (≤0.6 s−1) (44Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V. Chaudhry Y. Evans D. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Handford P. Lea S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24160-24169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Likewise, by employing soluble multivalent EMR3 probes in a sensitive cell-binding assay, a putative EMR3 ligand has been found on the surface of human monocyte-derived macrophages and activated human neutrophils (13Stacey M. Lin H.H. Hilyard K.L. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18863-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it is currently not known whether these protein-protein interactions can lead to signal transduction via the TM7 moiety of these receptors. In addition to the strong structural-functional similarity, the EGF-TM7 molecules are also closely linked at the genomic level. With the exception of ETL, which maps to human chromosome (Chr) 1, all other human EGF-TM7 members are located within Chr 19p13 region with EMR1 on 19p13.3, and CD97, EMR2, and EMR3 on 19p13.1 (9Baud V.

Furthermore, the mouse homologues of EMR1 (F4/80) and CD97were mapped to the corresponding syntenic regions of mouse Chr 17 and Chr 8, respectively (11Lin H.H. Stubbs L.J. Mucenski M.L.

More significantly, the genomic organization of CD97 and EMR2 was found to be identical in that each EGF-like module is encoded by a single exon and the TM7 region by a total of five exons (12Lin H.H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 47Hamann J. Hartmann E. van Lier R.A. Genomics. 1996; 32: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These findings strongly indicate that the EGF-TM7 genes are derived from a common ancestral gene through gene duplication and are highly conserved among vertebrate species. It is therefore of great interest to decipher how individual EGF-TM7 genes evolve and function. Herein, we describe the molecular and functional characterization of a new EGF-TM7 molecule, mouse EMR4. The mEMR4 gene maps to the distal region of mouse Chr 17 in close proximity to Emr1 and encodes a cell-surface receptor restrictedly expressed in macrophages (Mφ), neutrophils (PMN), and dendritic cells (DC). The regulation of mRNA expression, the biochemical-structural characteristics, and the ligand-binding properties of mEMR4 are discussed. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell lines were provided by the cell bank at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford. Laboratory-bred mice were housed in and provided by the animal facility at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology under standard pathogen-free conditions with access to food and water ad lib. Recombinant murine IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α, and interferon-γ were obtained from R&D Systems. The mEMR4 full-length cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a mouse spleen Marathon Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH). Two rounds of PCR reactions were conducted to amplify visible mEMR4 cDNA fragments. Marathon adapter primers, AP-1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and AP-2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) were paired individually with nested mEMR4-specific primers, 5′-1 (5′-TTGAGAGAAGAAAGTTTGCTTCTCAA-3′) and 5′-2 (5′-CGCTGGCCCCAAGAAGCTCCAGATGAA-3′) as well as 3′-1 (5′-CTGGAAGGGCTACATCTTTTTCTCACT-3′) and 3′-2 (5′-GGCAGATTCAAGAAGAGGTTCATGTAT-3′) to generate 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE fragments, respectively. mEMR4 cDNA fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel, purified, subcloned, and sequenced using standard molecular techniques. All cDNA fragments and expression constructs were subjected to DNA sequencing of both strands to confirm their integrity. DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye™ Terminator DNA sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Samples were electrophoresed on an ABI 373A DNA Sequencer and analyzed by ABI Prism Model Version 2.1.1 software (PE Applied Biosystems). An homologous DNA sequence search was carried out using BLAST algorithm against DNA sequences in GenBankTM/EMBL data bases. Protein alignment and alignment of consensus sequences were analyzed using ClustalW software. To determine the chromosomal position of the mEMR4 gene, the segregation of sequences detected by a full-length mEMR4 cDNA probe was followed in 118 progeny of a Mus musculus × Mus spretusinterspecific back-cross: (C3Hf/R1-Mgf Sl-ENURg/+ × M. spretus) × C3Hf/R1. The mEMR4 cDNA probe hybridized to fragments of ∼4.8, 4.5, 4.38, 4.2, 3.9, 1.9, 1.8, and 0.85 kb in HincII-digested M. spretus (S) DNA and fragments of ∼4.8, 4.5, 4.38, 4.2, 3.9, 3.45, 3.05, 1.55, and 0.8 kb in HincII-digested C3Hf inbred mouse (M) DNA. Other variant fragments were described recently (48Doyle J. Hoffman S. Ucla C. Reith W. Mach B. Stubbs L. Genomics. 1996; 35: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and were traced as follows: Nfya, BamHI (S) 1.6 kb (M) 3.2 kb; C3, PvuII (S) 4.6, 6.2 kb (M) 3.3 kb; Mllt1,EcoRI (S) 1.3 kb (M) 0.8 kb; Emr1,BamHI (S) 7.7, 5.2 kb (M) 15.0, 9.8 kb; Vav,TaqI (S) 5.0, 5.5 kb (M) 5.6 kb; Rfx2,TaqI (S) 2.7 kb (M) 3.6 kb. Gene linkage, order, and intergenic distances with associated standard errors were calculated according to standard statistical methods with the aid of the Map Manager data analysis programs (49Silver J. J. Hered. 1985; 76: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 50Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). All culture media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% humidity incubator. A20 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Mouse primary cells were obtained from 8–10-week-old C57/Bl6 or BALB/c mice. Mouse bone marrow-derived Mφ (BMMφ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% L-cell-conditioned medium as described previously (51Hume D.A. Gordon S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mouse resident peritoneal Mφ (RPMφ), Biogel-elicited peritoneal Mφ (BioMφ), thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal Mφ (ThioMφ), and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal neutrophils (ThioPMN) were obtained using standard protocols described previously (52Johnston Jr., R.B. Godzik C.A. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 53Fauve R.M. Jusforgues H. Hevin B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 64: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the cytokine treatment of RPMφ, cells were cultured for 1 h for adherence, washed, and then treated with or without IL-4 (20 ng/ml), IL-10 (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), and interferon-γ (250 u/ml) for 36 h prior to the isolation of total RNA. Mouse spleen B and T cells were isolated from a single cell suspension by magnetic separation of B220 mAb-coated Dynabeads (Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway) and by nylon wool purification, respectively (54Julius M.H. Simpson E. Herzenberg L.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1973; 3: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). Mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were obtained by incubating bone marrow cells in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor as described previously (55Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from mouse primary cells and cell lines using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (56Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Duralon-UV, Stratagene), and hybridized with gene-specific probes as previously describe (11Lin H.H. Stubbs L.J. Mucenski M.L. Genomics. 1997; 41: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, a commercially available mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (OriGene Technologies, Inc) was hybridized with a full-length mEMR4 cDNA probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridized blots were washed in 0.5× SSC (0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min and exposed to x-ray films (X-Omat, Kodak) at −80 °C for 2–4 days. Radioactive probes were stripped from RNA blots by washing in 0.1× SSC, 1% SDS for 15 min at 95 °C, and the blots were rehybridized with a mouse β-actin cDNA probe to compare the amount of RNA loaded in each lane. RT-PCR analysis was conducted using RNA isolated from mouse spleens to study whether mEMR4 is alternatively spliced. Primers used in the analysis include 5′-57TTCCCAGAATGTTGATGGGAGCAACTAGA85 and 5′-1090CACACCATCCTCCTCATGGGGTAGAGCCA1062 for the 5′-end extracellular domain and 5′-875TCTGAACCTGTACTCCTGACTTTACAA901 and 5′-2134TCAATCACTAATAGTTCTGCTCCAGTA2108 for the 3′-end TM7 domain. The PCR reactions were carried out using the Advantage HF PCR kit (CLONTECH) for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. All mEMR4 expression vectors were constructed on pcDNA3.1(+) or pcDNA3.1-V5-His (Invitrogen). For the construction of V5-His-tagged mEMR4 vector, pmEMR4-V5-His, the entire mEMR4 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using 5′-Hind (5′-CTTAAGCTTCCCAGAATGTTGATGGGAGCAACTAGA) and 3′-BamH (5′-TGGATCCTTGGGCCCATCACTAATAGTTCTGCTCCAGTA) and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-V5-His vector via HindIII andBamHI sites. For the construction of vectors expressing mouse Fc (mFc) fusion proteins, two mEMR4 DNA fragments containing either the entire extracellular domain (1–341 amino acids) or the EGF-like modules (1–147 amino acids) were generated by PCR using 5′-Hind + 341BamH (5′-AAGGATCCACACCATCCTCCTCATGGGGTAGAGCCA) and 5′-Hind + 147EcoR (5′-TGAATTCACTCAGTACTCCCAAAGTA), respectively. A truncated mFc DNA fragment containing the hinge and constant regions (CH2 + 3) of a mouse γ2b immunoglobulin heavy chain was generated by PCR using 5′-AGGATCCTGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGAGCCCAGCGGGCCT and 5′-TCTTCTAGATTTACCCGGAGACCGGGA primers and the PSV-169/mIgG2b-322 plasmid as a template (57Tucker P.W.

https://openalex.org/W1964946297,"We previously found that the angiogenic factors TNFα and HIV-1 Tat activate an NAD(P)H oxidase in endothelial cells, which operates upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a MAPK involved in the determination of cell fate. To further understand oxidant-related signaling pathways, we screened lung and endothelial cell libraries for interaction partners of p47 phox and recovered the orphan adapter TNF receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4). Domain analysis suggested a tail-to-tail interaction between the C terminus of p47 phox and the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF4. In addition, TRAF4, like p47 phox , was recovered largely in the cytoskeleton/membrane fraction. Coexpression of p47 phox and TRAF4 increased oxidant production and JNK activation, whereas each alone had minimal effect. In addition, a fusion between p47 phox and the TRAF4 C terminus constitutively activated JNK, and this activation was decreased by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. In contrast, overexpression of the p47 phox binding domain of TRAF4 blocked endothelial cell JNK activation by TNFα and HIV-1 Tat, suggesting an uncoupling of p47 phox from upstream signaling events. A secondary screen of endothelial cell proteins for TRAF4-interacting partners yielded a number of proteins known to control cell fate. We conclude that endothelial cell agonists such as TNFα and HIV-1 Tat initiate signals that enter basic signaling cassettes at the level of TRAF4 and an NAD(P)H oxidase. We speculate that endothelial cells may target endogenous oxidant production to specific sites critical to cytokine signaling as a mechanism for increasing signal specificity and decreasing toxicity of these reactive species.

We speculate that endothelial cells may target endogenous oxidant production to specific sites critical to cytokine signaling as a mechanism for increasing signal specificity and decreasing toxicity of these reactive species. tumor necrosis factor human immunodeficiency virus Jun N-terminal kinase untranslated region hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase mitogen-activated protein kinase TNF receptor-associated factor 4 human umbilical vein endothelial cell The vascular endothelium is generally well supplied with oxygen and produces significant quantities of oxidants when stimulatedin vivo or in vitro (1Al-Mehdi A.B.

Flores S.C. Terada L.S. Virology. 2001; 286: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As in other cell types, such tightly regulated oxidant bursts appear to transduce a variety of signals. Mechanical forces, growth factors, and cytokines stimulate oxidant production by endothelial cells, leading to migration, proliferation, apoptosis, or adhesion protein expression (3Bhunia A.K.

As an example, a number of studies now support the participation of oxidants in both proliferative (6Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol.

The basis for the divergent responses to oxidants is not clear. Endothelial cells possess an NAD(P)H oxidase (11Mohazzab K.M. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2568-H2572PubMed Google Scholar) thought to participate in a number of these signal pathways. Inhibitors of this oxidase suppress growth factor, TNFα,1 HIV-1 Tat, and shear cessation-induced signaling (2Gu Y., Wu, R.F., Xu, Y.C. Flores S.C. Terada L.S.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in endothelial cells. Recently, both cytochrome subunits of the oxidase, p22 phox , and gp91 phox , were cloned from rat and human endothelial cells (14Bayraktutan U. Blayney L. Shah A.M. Arterio. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1903-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Gorlach A. Brandes R.P. Nguyen K. Amidi M. Dehghani F. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We subsequently cloned the oxidase adapter subunit p47 phox from HUVEC, demonstrating its participation in TNFα signaling (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, endogenous p47 phox was found to be constitutively associated with the cytoskeleton of unstimulated ECV-304 cells, contrasting the free cytosolic location of p47 phox in unstimulated neutrophils. Because most signaling proteins are associated with the cytoskeleton at some point in their activation cycle, the strong association of p47 phox with the endothelial cytoskeleton suggested specific localization of the oxidase with cytoskeletally anchored signaling complexes. Indeed, cytoskeletal disruption derailed both oxidase activation and downstream signaling (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Spatial targeting of the oxidase may therefore potentially confer signal specificity to these evanescent radicals. To identify potential vicinal signaling elements associated with the endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase, we screened lung and HUVEC libraries for p47 phox -interacting proteins and recovered the orphan adapter TRAF4. This interaction appears to participate in downstream activation of JNK by the oxidase-activating endothelial agonists TNFα and HIV-1 Tat. All PCR amplifications for subcloning or mutagenesis were performed with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene). The bait vector pGBKT7-p47 was created by a single base mutation of p47 phox (T to C at −2), creating a newNcoI site. The NcoI-EcoRI fragment containing the coding region and 3′-UTR of p47 phox was then subcloned into pGBKT7 (CLONTECH) in-frame with the GAL4-BD. Full-length TRAF4 was PCR-amplified from a HUVEC library (Stratagene) between theEcoRI and SalI sites. It was directly ligated into the expression vector pCI (Promega) to create pCI-T4 and into the yeast shuttle vector pGBKT7 to create pGBKT7-T4. The C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF4 was excised from the library prey plasmid pACT2-T4 using EcoRI and PshAI and ligated into pCIneo-FLAG (16Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Wang B. Weissler J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to create pCINF-T4(CT). pGBKT7-p47-(1–205) was constructed by removing the C-terminalBamHI-BamHI fragment from pGBKT7-p47, and pGBKT7-p47-(205–390) was obtained by isolation of the N-terminalSalI-BamHI fragment of p47 phox and ligation into pGBKT7. pGBKT7-p47-(1–346) was derived by excision of aSmaI-SmaI segment from pGBKT7-p47. pGBKT7-p47-(1–298) was derived by complete restriction of pGBKT7-p47 with EcoRI, partial restriction with NarI, T4 polymerase end fill-in, gel purification, and blunt-end ligation to reseal the plasmid. pGBKT7-p47-(347–390) was obtained by PCR deletion of p47-(1–346) from pGBKT7-p47 and frame correction by NcoI restriction, end fill-in, and blunt-end resealing. GAL4-BD fusions for p47-(153–286), (299–345), and (299–390) were derived by PCR amplification of segments between EcoRI and SalI sites, with insertion of appropriate stop codons, followed by ligation into pGBKT7. GAL4-AD fusions with TRAF4-(266–307) and TRAF4-(308–470) were produced by PCR amplification of segments between EcoRI and XhoI sites and ligation into pGADT7 (CLONTECH). The coding region of p47 phox was PCR-amplified betweenEcoRI and SalI sites and ligated into pCIneo-FLAG to yield pCINF-p47, and between two EcoRI sites with ligation into pGEX-2TK to yield pGEX-p47. HA-JNK2 was derived by reversal of HA-JNK2(APF) mutant (gift from Dr. Lynn Heasley) back to wild type with PCR mutagenesis, and HA-JNK1 was a gift from Dr. Stephen Dreskin (17Dreskin S.C. Thomas G.W. Dale S.N. Heasley L.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5646-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). pGAD424-TRAF1 and pGAD424-TRAF2 were gifts from Dr. Preet Chaudry. The frame of the former construct was corrected prior to use. The fusion construct pCINF-p47-T4 was produced by PCR amplification of p47 phox -(1–389) between EcoRI sites and ligation into pCINF-T4(CT) between the FLAG tag and TRAF4 C terminus. p47-GFP was constructed as previously described (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. HUVEC were transfected with p47-GFP and plated onto fibronectin-coated slides. After 24 h, cells were fixed and permeablized (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), counterstained with rhodamine-phalloidin (5 units/ml), and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV LSM 410 laser-scanning system. A commercial human lung library cloned into pACT2 was obtained (CLONTECH). An endothelial cell library was constructed using poly(A+) RNA from passage 4–5 HUVEC (Clonetics). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was cloned directionally into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of lambda phage HybriZAP 2.1XR (Stratagene). The primary library (4.8 × 106 plaque-forming units) was amplified once as lambda phage, and the library was dropped out in the yeast shuttle vector pAD-GAL4-2.1 by mass excision using a kit (Stratagene). The average insert size was 1.7 kb. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 (CLONTECH) were stably transformed with the bait vector pGBKT7-p47 under tryptophan-deficiency selection, and full-length p47 phox was found to lack autonomous transactivation activity. Stable transformants were then secondarily transformed with the lung or endothelial cell libraries using lithium acetate. AH109 yeast contains two auxotrophic reporter genes (ADE2 and HIS3) andlacZ under the control of three distinct promoters. Therefore, colonies that survived selection using medium deficient in tryptophan (bait selection), leucine (library selection), adenine, and histidine (interaction selection) were tested for lacZexpression using a filter lift assay. Positive colonies were restreaked, and single clones were retested for auxotrophy andlacZ expression. Library plasmids from triple-positive clones were extracted and passaged through Escherichia coliwith selection for GAL4-AD plasmids and stably transformed back into AH109. Autonomous transactivation negative clones were then mated with Y187 yeast containing pGBKT7-p47 and diploids tested forlacZ expression. A similar approach was used to rescreen the HUVEC library using full-length TRAF4 as bait after stable transformation of AH109 with pGBKT7-T4. Phoenix-293 (Fx) cells electroporated with indicated vectors were incubated in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C, sonicated for 5 s, and centrifuged at 6000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was then performed using antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), pelleting protein G-agarose (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.) conjugates at 1500 × g. Immunoblots were performed with antisera recognizing the C terminus of TRAF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-20) or FLAG. Cytoskeletal fractions were collected as previously described (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and cytosolic fractions were recovered by acetone precipitation of supernatant. AH109 yeast stably transformed with GAL4-AD-TRAF4 constructs were tested first for autonomous transactivation; negative colonies were mated with Y187 yeast stably transformed with various GAL4-BD-p47 deletion constructs. Diploids were replated on medium selecting for both plasmids and tested forlacZ expression with a filter lift assay. Negative controls were Tyr-187 transformed with empty pGBKT7 and pGBKT7-lamin C; the positive control was AH109 transformed with holo-GAL4 (pCL1, CLONTECH). Positive interactions were identified by development of a blue color within 1 h, negative interactions remained white for >24 h. Direct interactions were confirmed in vitro (18Zapata J.M. Matsuzawa S. Godzik A. Leo E. Wasserman S.A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12102-12107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). BL21-RP E. coli (Stratagene) were transformed with either pGEX-2TK or pGEX-p47, induced for 3 h at 37 °C, and the GST proteins were captured on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Approximately 2 μg of GST or GST-p47 was used per 200 μl of binding reaction. Full-length TRAF4 was transcribed and translated in vitro from pCI-T4 (TnT Quick Coupled, Promega) using [35S]methionine, and 5 μl (3 μCi) of translation mix was added to each binding reaction. In some reactions, p47-(299–390) was in vitro transcribed and translated from pGBKT7-p47-(299–390) without isotope and added directly to the binding reaction simultaneously with labeled TRAF4. A silent G360C mutation was introduced in p47 phox to eliminate a potential PI-CeuI site. The entire p47 phox cDNA was excised with XbaI and KpnI and ligated into pShuttle, and the expression cassette was then subcloned into the backbone pAdeno-X (CLONTECH). The linearized adenoviral DNA was then transfected into HEK-293 cells and replication-incompetent viruses harvested and titered. Ad-lacZ was similarly constructed according to the manufacturer's suggestions (CLONTECH). Robust expression of p47 phox was demonstrated by immunoblot at multiplicity of infections of 50–200 (not shown), and lacZexpression was demonstrated in >95% of cells. JNK activity of Fx cells was assessed using a traditional immunoprecipitation kinase technique using anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-17) and GST-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (2Gu Y., Wu, R.F., Xu, Y.C. Flores S.C. Terada L.S. Virology. 2001; 286: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Equivalent capture of JNK was assessed with immunoblot using a pan-specific anti-JNK (JNK-FL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To increase HUVEC transfection efficiency, passage 2–3 HUVEC (Clonetics) were synchronized at the G1-S transition with 3.5 mmthymidine overnight (19Schwachtgen J.L. Ferreira V. Meyer D. Kerbiriou-Nabias D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 882-887PubMed Google Scholar). Six hours after thymidine release, cells were electroporated with 10 μg of each plasmid, keeping total DNA concentration constant for each experiment. HUVEC were cotransfected with either HA-JNK1 or HA-JNK2. Cells were stimulated with either human TNFα (100 ng/ml, Peprotech) or HIV-1 Tat, prepared as a GST fusion as previously described (2Gu Y., Wu, R.F., Xu, Y.C. Flores S.C. Terada L.S. Virology. 2001; 286: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The JNK activity of anti-HA immunoprecipitates was then assessed. We found first that similar to the situation with ECV-304 cells (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), p47 phox appears to constitutively associate with the actin cytoskeleton of HUVEC. p47-GFP colocalized with submembranous lateral actin bundles as well as actin microspikes in unstimulated HUVEC (Fig. 1). To find binding partners for p47 phox , a whole lung library was chosen for an initial screen because of its high representation of endothelium. 1.7 × 105 transformants were screened, and 80 colonies survived initial auxotrophic selection and were restreaked. Of these, 23 single clones were found to be positive for lacZexpression. PCR amplification and HaeIII restriction digest pattern revealed nine independent clones. Only one clone represented an autonomous transactivation-negative interaction-positive clone containing an in-frame library insert; this clone was bidirectionally sequenced and found to encode the C-terminal 210 amino acid residues of TRAF4. To accomplish a more endothelial-specific screen, 1.9 × 106 clones were screened from the HUVEC library, and only 10 colonies were found to survive auxotrophic selection. Of these, four were lacZ-positive and two were subsequently found to be true positives. These clones were identical by restriction digest analysis. Sequence of one revealed the C-terminal 287 residues of TRAF4. Yeast mating demonstrated lack of binding of p47 phox to full-length TRAF1 and 2 (not shown). When overexpressed in Fx cells, TRAF4 preferentially remained with the detergent-insoluble fraction, with a smaller portion of the protein found in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig.2 a), mimicking the cytoskeletal distribution of p47 phox (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When coexpressed, TRAF4 was found to specifically coprecipitate with FLAG-p47 (Fig. 2 b). TRAF4 was also found to coprecipitate with p47-GFP, using anti-GFP, though at reduced efficiency (not shown). In addition, full-length TRAF4 coprecipitated with the C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF4 (Fig. 2 c), suggesting self-association through this domain. Two-hybrid interactions were used to determine interacting domains of p47 phox and TRAF4. The C terminus of p47 phox -(299–390), containing a variant proline-rich (PR) sequence, an arginine-rich basic motif, and a C-terminal PR site, was both necessary and sufficient for interaction with TRAF4 (Fig. 3 a). Interestingly, the extreme C terminus (347–390) of p47 phox was necessary but by itself insufficient, and the adjacent segment (299–345) was also necessary but insufficient either by itself or attached to the rest of the protein N-terminal to it. The GST pull-down assay confirmed a direct interaction of p47 phox with full-length TRAF4in vitro (Fig. 3 b). In addition, in vitro-translated p47-(347–390) competed with full-length p47 phox for TRAF4 binding, consistent with a specific interaction of the C terminus of p47 phox with TRAF4. The smaller of the TRAF4 library inserts obtained encoded residues 261–470, corresponding to both the 6th exon and the TRAF domain of TRAF4, indicating an interaction of p47 phox with this domain. The TRAF domains of TRAFs 1–6 contain a C-terminal β-sheet-predominant subdomain (TRAF-C) preceded by a shorter coiled-coil subdomain (TRAF-N). By homology and secondary structure prediction, these regions span residues 308–470 and 267–307, respectively, of TRAF4 (20Regnier C.H. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Yeast mating studies suggested that the isolated TRAF-N and TRAF-C domains were each insufficient to bind p47 phox , whereas the entire TRAF domain bound p47 phox (Fig.4). Overexpression of either p47 phox or full-length TRAF4 alone in Fx cells did not appreciably affect JNK activity. In contrast, overexpression of both p47 phox and TRAF4 increased JNK activity greater than 4-fold over control, suggesting a functional as well as physical interaction between the two proteins (Fig.5 a). Similarly, coexpression of p47 phox and TRAF4 increased DCF oxidation, consistent with an increase in oxidant production. To demonstrate that interaction of p47 phox with the TRAF4 TRAF domain was sufficient for JNK activation, we fused this TRAF domain to the C terminus of p47 phox . Overexpression of the fusion protein increased JNK activity in HUVEC (Fig. 5 b), whereas overexpression of either p47 phox or the TRAF4 TRAF domain alone did not. This activation was decreased by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). To further implicate TRAF4-p47 phox interactions in endogenous endothelial cell signaling pathways, we investigated the effect of TRAF4 p47 phox binding domain overexpression on signaling by TNFα and HIV-1 Tat, two agonists that activate endothelial cell JNK through p47 phox -dependent oxidant production (2Gu Y., Wu, R.F., Xu, Y.C. Flores S.C. Terada L.S. Virology. 2001; 286: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this TRAF4 truncation consistently decreased activation of both HA-JNK1 and HA-JNK2 by TNFα and HIV-1 Tat in HUVEC (Fig. 6), whereas full-length TRAF4 did not affect JNK activation (not shown). A secondary screen of the HUVEC library using full-length TRAF4 was performed on 5 × 106 AH109 transformants. Of 92 His+/Ade+/LacZ+ clones, 73 were thought to be unique by PCR and digest pattern. These clones were isolated, passaged through E. coli, and 71 clones were confirmed by mating back to Y187/pGBKT7-T4 and lacZ expression testing. These clones were all sequenced and found to represent 23 unique genes with coding regions in-frame with GAL4-AD, including 4 extracellular proteins, 4 nuclear proteins, and 3 unpublished cDNAs. Of the remaining 12 genes, 8 encoded proteins involved in the determination of cell death and/or proliferation (TableI).Table IcDNAs retrieved from TRAF4 protein interaction screenProteinAbbreviationNo. of clonesGenBankTMMelanoma-associated antigenMAGE1AF200348NADP+-dependent malic enzyme1X79440Non-smooth muscle α-actinin1M95178α-Ketoacid dehydrogenase kinaseBCKDK2XM 008106Ubiquitin conjugase 9UBC95X96427Phospholipid scramblase2NM 021105Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5Hic-52NM 015927Tar-binding protein 2TARBP21NM 004178Arg/Abl binding protein 2ArgBP-21NM 021069Neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homologNRAGE2NM 006986α-Helical coiled-coil rod homologHCR1NM 019052Vascular Rab-GAP/TBC domain-containing proteinVRP2NM 007063 Open table in a new tab TRAF4 is the least well understood of the traditional TRAF family members. Originally identified in a differential screen of metastatic breast cancer lymph nodes (21Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Lidereau R. Basset P. Rio M.C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), it was subsequently shown to be widely expressed in normal human tissues, especially actively dividing epithelium (22Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Van Arsdale T. Gascoyne R.D. Berern K. McFadden D. Shabaik A. Hugh J. Reynolds A. Clevenger C.V. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1549-1561PubMed Google Scholar). Its closest relative in both domain organization and amino acid sequence is the Drosophila adapter DTRAF1, which interacts with Misshapen (Msn), a MAP4K acting upstream of JNK (23Liu H., Su, Y.C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The biological function of TRAF4, however, is poorly understood, beyond its ability to prevent dimerization of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (24Ye X. Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. VanArsdale T. Zhang H.

Maltepe E. Padrid P.A. Sperling A. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Full-length TRAF4 demonstrated a preference for the detergent-insoluble cell fraction, a distribution similar to that of p47 phox in endothelial cells (12Gu Y., Xu, Y.C., Wu, R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The constitutive association of p47 phox with the cytoskeleton demonstrated in ECV-304 cells in this prior study and in HUVEC in the present study stands in marked contrast to its behavior in neutrophils. In the latter cell type, p47 phox migrates from a cytosolic location to the cytoskeleton and membrane skeleton only upon stimulation (26Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. McCormick S. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5911-5917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27El Benna J. Ruedi J.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6729-6734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive association of p47 phox with the endothelial cytoskeleton suggests that the oxidase may exist in a preformed but inactive complex in endothelial cells. Abrupt cessation of flow, for instance, causes oxidant production by endothelial cell NADPH oxidase within 15 s (28Manevich Y., Al- Mehdi A. Muzykantov V. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2126-H2135PubMed Google Scholar). Although the basis for such constitutive cytoskeletal association is not known, there are clear differences in cytoskeletal structure between adherent endothelial cells and suspended neutrophils. Adhesion-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton may create or expose p47 binding sites or initiate partial phosphorylation of p47 phox , resulting in cytoskeletal localization. Notably, adhesion primes neutrophils for a robust respiratory burst upon TNFα stimulation in a mechanism dependent upon actin polymerization (29Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1550-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may operate in adherent endothelial cells. The isolated TRAF domain of TRAF4 also demonstrated a preference for the detergent-insoluble fraction. Because the TRAF4 TRAF domain also bound p47 phox , these data do not allow us to determine whether TRAF4 is primarily associated with the cytoskeleton or whether this localization arises secondarily from its association with p47 phox . The retrieval of α-actinin as a potential TRAF4-interacting partner (Table I) is consistent with the former possibility. This situation may be somewhat different from the localization of TRAF5, because the zinc finger motifs of this latter protein rather that its TRAF domain appear to confer detergent insolubility (30Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2539-2544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is equally plausible that TRAF4 and p47 phox each have independent cytoskeletal association domains. The C-terminal tail of p47 phox from residues 299–390 comprised the minimum TRAF4 binding domain we identified. This region encompasses a variant proline-rich site (299–302), a basic region (314–347), and a type II polyproline motif (362–368). In addition, this tail har"

The higher uterine endometrial expression of SLPI during pregnancy in species with the epitheliochorial, as opposed to the hemochorial type of placentation, suggests an important role for this protein in the maintenance of an intact utero-placental interface (28Badinga L. Michel F.J. Fields M.J. Sharp D.C. Simmen R.C.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Its relevance to the regulation of pregnancy-associated events is further bolstered by the recent findings of elevated SLPI expression in endometriotic tissues and corresponding peritoneal fluids (29Suzumori N. Sato M. Yoneda T. Ozaki Y. Takagi H. Suzumori K. Fertil. Steril. 1999; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in amniotic fluids during the onset of labor (30Denison F.C. Kelly R.W. Calder A.A. Riley S.C. J.

Gynecol. Reprod. Biol. 1995; 59: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).A possible role for SLPI in the control of cell proliferation was initially gleaned from the high levels of SLPI found in epithelial carcinomas (31Garver R.I., Jr. Goldsmith K.T. Rodu B., Hu, P.C. Sorscher E.J. Curiel D.T. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 46-50PubMed Google Scholar, 32Robertson III, M.W. Wang M. Siegal G.P. Rosenfeld M. Ashford R.S., II Alvarez R.D. Garver R.I. Curiel D.T. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 331-336PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, SLPI was shown to support the growth of human hematapoietic progenitor cells in serum-free medium in vitro (33Goselink H.M. van Damme J. Hiemstra P.S. Wuyts A. Stolk J. Fibbe W.E. Willemze R. Falkenburg J.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and to increase the production of hepatocyte growth factor in human lung fibroblasts (34Kikuchi T. Abe T. Yaekashiwa M. Tominaga Y. Mitsuhashi H. Satoh K. Nakamura T. Nukiwa T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our own studies demonstrated that SLPI, added at levels comparable with those found in uterine luminal fluids in vivo, elicited an increase in DNA synthesis in primary cultures of glandular epithelial cells isolated from pregnant pig uterine endometrium (35Badinga L. Michel F.J. Simmen R.C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, clonal lines of the human endometrial epithelial cell line Hec-1-A overexpressing the transcription factor BTEB1 (Basic TranscriptionElement-Binding protein 1) and, consequently, exhibiting higher proliferative potential as well as increased expression of a number of cell cycle-associated genes, have augmented SLPI mRNA and protein levels, relative to more slowly growing clonal lines with lower BTEB1 expression (36Zhang X.L. Simmen F.A. Michel F.J. Simmen R.C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the increased proliferative responsiveness to serum of the higher expressing BTEB1 lines has now been partially elucidated by the identification ofBTEB1 gene targets and by the demonstration of BTEB1 transactivation of promoters for a number of growth-associated genes (37Simmen R.C.M. Zhang X.L. Michel F.J. Min S.H. Zhao G. Simmen F.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism underlying SLPI regulation of cell proliferation remains unresolved.In the present study, we used the well differentiated human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line Ishikawa (38Nishida M. Kasahara K. Kaneko M. Iwasaki H. Hayashi K. Nippon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi. 1985; 37: 1103-1111PubMed Google Scholar) to establish sublines that stably express antisense SLPI RNA. By using these derived clonal lines, we have directly linked cellular SLPI production to proliferation. We also show that SLPI specifically increases cyclin D1 gene expression via the transcriptional activation of its promoter, and we identify LOX as an SLPI negatively regulated gene using the methodology of differential display-reverse transcriptase-PCR. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse relationship between expression of SLPI and mRNA levels of two potent epithelial growth inhibitors, namely TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3. These results suggest a novel function for SLPI in epithelial cell proliferation that is mechanistically distinct from its general protease inhibitory and antibiotic activity.DISCUSSIONThis study identifies a novel mechanism by which SLPI, a multisubstrate anti-protease member of the Serpin family, functions as an epithelial cell growth factor. Several lines of evidence presented herein suggest that the growth-regulatory role of SLPI, as measured by its ability to increase cell number as well as DNA synthesis, is mediated by its activation as well as its inhibition of distinct cell cycle and growth-associated gene expression. In particular, the following findings are consistent with a regulatory role for SLPI in growth-signaling pathways: 1) SLPI increased cyclin D1 gene expression at the level of the promoter activity of this gene; 2) cellular SLPI levels are inversely correlated with those of TGF-β1 mRNA and IGFBP-3 mRNA and secreted protein; 3) the expression of the gene encoding LOX, a phenotypic inhibitor of the oncogenic raspathway (52Ekholm E.C. Ravanti L. Kahari V. Paavolainen P. Penttinen R.P. Bone (New York). 2000; 27: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 53Chinoy M.R. Zgleszewski S.E. Cilley R.E. Krummel T.M. Am J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L312-L318PubMed Google Scholar), is markedly up-regulated in sublines with undetectable SLPI; and 4) TGF-β1 inhibits SLPI gene expression. The diverse actions of SLPI highlighted here expand the repertoire of SLPI-regulated genes and encoded products, which previously have included the nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor IκBβ (55Lentsch A.B. Jordan J.A. Czermak B.J. Diehl K.M. Younkin E.M. Sarma V. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 239-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and prostaglandin H2 synthase-2 (24Zhang Y. DeWitt D.L. McNeely T.B. Wahl S.M. Wahl L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), to those linked to growth control, and implicate distinct mechanisms employed by SLPI in modulating cell function and phenotype.A most intriguing finding is the identification of cyclin D1 as a downstream target of SLPI. The ability of SLPI to induce cyclin D1 expression occurred at the levels of its mRNA, protein, and promoter activity; is highly specific as evident from the lack of comparable effects on the expression levels of other G1phase-associated genes such as cdk4, PCNA, and p21; and was observed irrespective of the mode of SLPI delivery (intracellular or extracellular). A supportive role for SLPI in growth processes had been observed previously (34Kikuchi T. Abe T. Yaekashiwa M. Tominaga Y. Mitsuhashi H. Satoh K. Nakamura T. Nukiwa T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Badinga L. Michel F.J. Simmen R.C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in epithelial and fibroblastic cell types, although the molecular mechanism underlying this function remained unclear. Members of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family, specifically TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, exhibit growth-promoting activities, which appear to be mediated by signal transduction pathways independent of their protease inhibitor functions and involve cAMP (56Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Tanzawa K. Uchijima E. Iwata K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 57Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shinagawa A. J.

Pathol. 2001; 158: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The immediate and direct route for SLPI to modulate cell cycle progression via regulation of cyclin D1 expression is consistent with a mechanistically distinct pathway from that utilized for its protease inhibitory function, although this contrasts with previous findings of the requirement for the trypsin inhibitory activity of this protein in the up-regulation of hepatocyte growth factor gene expression (34Kikuchi T. Abe T. Yaekashiwa M. Tominaga Y. Mitsuhashi H. Satoh K. Nakamura T. Nukiwa T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SLPI transactivation of the cyclin D1 gene appears to be dose-dependent and was markedly reversed by a 2-fold increase in the amount of transfected SLPI vector. Although the reason for this is presently unclear, this may be related in part to a previously reported (55Lentsch A.B. Jordan J.A. Czermak B.J. Diehl K.M. Younkin E.M. Sarma V. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 239-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) activity of SLPI to inhibit the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB via its maintenance of the expression of IκBβ, a crucial step in NF-κB activation. Because NF-κB is a transactivator of cyclin D1 gene expression (59Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin A.S.Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Hinz M. Krappmann D. Eichten A. Heder A. Scheidereit C. Strauss M. Mol. Cell.

Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25245-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), a reduction in its nuclear levels secondary to its sequestration in the cytoplasm by SLPI-enhanced expression of IκBβ, might underlie the opposing consequence of SLPI on cyclin D1 promoter activity. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to note that the changes in cyclin D1 transcriptional activity with SLPI are relatively modest. This finding coupled with the observation that the 8As subline with undetectable SLPI gene expression is competent to grow, although at a much diminished rate than cells with robust expression of this anti-protease, is indicative of a contributory rather than a critical role for SLPI in growth regulation. Consistent with this, mice null for SLPI are viable and do not exhibit gross phenotypic consequences (25Ashcroft G.S. Lei K. Jin W. Longenecker G. Kulkarni A.B. Greenwell-Wild T. Hale-Donze H. McGrady G. Song X.Y. Wahl S.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).Another potential (and novel) mechanism behind SLPI control of cell growth, as demonstrated here, may involve its effective inhibition of the expression of a number of growth suppressor and/or tumor suppressor genes. The latter include the following: 1) TGF-β1, a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell proliferation; 2) LOX, also known asras-recision gene (51Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which down-regulates theras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (62Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar,63Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); and 3) IGFBP-3, a major factor in the control of IGF-I bio-availability and, hence, of its growth promoting activity and a pro-apoptotic agent that may be IGF-independent in this latter action (64Rechler M.M. Clemmons D.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 176-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this regard, we observed an inverse correlation between the expression of these genes and that of SLPI at the levels of mRNA (TGF-β1, LOX, IGFBP-3) or protein (IGFBP-3), although attempts to establish a causal relationship by the addition of rhSLPI to 8As cells in culture or by transient transfection of human SLPI expression construct to these cells did not yield the anticipated effects. Because these same treatments resulted in the induction of cyclin D1 gene expression, these findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms underlying the control of the expression of these genes by SLPI, unlike that for cyclin D1, occur indirectly or via more long term changes in cell phenotype. For LOX, this is a likely possibility because it is a known transcriptional target of TGF-β1 (65Gacheru S.N. Thomas K.M. Murray S.A. Csiszar K. Smith-Mungo L.I. Kagan H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The intermediate steps leading to the inhibition of TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 gene expression upon increased expression of SLPI cannot be deduced from the present studies, although a regulatory loop arising from TGF-β1 inhibition of SLPI gene expression, as demonstrated here, is consistent with reports observed for a bronchial epithelial cell line (66Jaumann F. Elssner A. Mazur G. Dobmann S. Vogelmeier C. Eur. Respir. J. 2000; 15: 1052-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In further agreement with the present results, a negative correlation between SLPI and TGF-β1 was reported in SLPI null mutant mice (25Ashcroft G.S. Lei K. Jin W. Longenecker G. Kulkarni A.B. Greenwell-Wild T. Hale-Donze H. McGrady G. Song X.Y. Wahl S.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In those studies, however, the consequence of the loss of SLPI expression was observed at the level of TGF-β activation, rather than at the level of mRNA induction as reported here. Although the concentration of bioactive TGF-β1 was not measured in the present study, the parallel rise in protein (in vivo) and transcript (in vitro) levels of this growth inhibitor after ablation of the SLPI gene is clearly indicative of the physiological relevance of the SLPI/TGF-β linkage.Based on the observations from this study, we propose a model that illustrates the regulation by SLPI of cell proliferation via its positive and negative influence on the expression of genes with known growth regulatory activities (Fig. 9). In this model, SLPI activates cell proliferation directly through its control of cyclin D1 gene expression. SLPI inhibits the expression of the growth suppressors IGFBP-3 and TGF-β1, although the mechanism is likely indirect and may entail the participation of yet unknown intermediary steps. Furthermore, SLPI negatively regulates LOX (tumor suppressor) gene expression likely through a TGF-β1-mediated pathway. The end result of this multiple regulation is the synergistic induction of cell proliferation. Thus, despite the modest effect of SLPI on the expression of individual genes, the sum total of the collective SLPI actions is the generation of a significant growth stimulus.Several important questions are raised by our results. One relates to the signaling pathway(s) by which SLPI promotes proliferation. Our finding that the addition of SLPI to culture medium results in the up-regulation of cyclin D1 gene expression is perhaps indicative of an integral membrane-localized SLPI receptor/binding protein. This may or may not be functionally related to a recently described SLPI-interacting protein identified by yeast two-hybrid screen as scramblase, an integral membrane protein of 35–37 kDa involved in movement of membrane phospholipids (67Tseng C.C. Tseng C.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 68Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6603-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, in another report (70McNeely T.B. Shugars D.C. Rosendahl M. Tucker C. Eisenberg S.P. Wahl S.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SLPI bound to a monocyte membrane protein of 55 kDa. It has been noted that the three-dimensional structure of SLPI is suggestive of its ability to utilize membrane receptor(s) to mediate its biological actions (71Jin F.-Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D.

Furthermore, the similar inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 and SLPI on IGFBP-3 expression are not entirely consistent with their opposing consequences on cell proliferation, although this apparent discrepancy might be related to the nature of the parental cell line (Ishikawa) utilized in this study. In a number of adenocarcinoma cell lines, abnormal TGF-β response could be generated in a gene-specific context (72Park B.J. Park J.I. Byun D.S. Park J.H. Chi S.G.

Finally, it would be of interest to ascertain whether other growth-regulatory genes mediate the proliferative effects of SLPI, and if their encoded products delineate sensitivity to SLPI in cell types other than the endometrial epithelial cells used here. Future studies in our laboratories utilizing the microarray and other approaches will address these questions.In summary, the generation and subsequent use of an SLPI “knock-out” in vitro model has allowed for the initial elucidation of the molecular mechanism behind the proliferative function ascribed to SLPI. Our data suggest that this newly described pathway involves the up- and down-regulation by SLPI, respectively, of positive (cyclin D1) and negative (TGF-β1, LOX, IGFBP-3) growth-associated factors via direct and indirect mechanisms. Our results for TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 are particularly intriguing because recent work (75Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7255-7261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggests a functional interaction of both systems to inhibit epithelial cell growth. In particular, IGFBP-3 appears to utilize the TGF-β receptor/signaling systems (including Smads) to elicit its anti-proliferative effects. Our results place SLPI at the node of this interactive pathway as well as those for cyclin D1 (ras/MAPK and NF-κB) and LOX. Our findings may have physiological relevance to further understanding the growth control of normal epithelium as well as the lack thereof in certain epithelially derived carcinomas wherein high expression of SLPI is manifest. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI),1 also known as anti-leukoprotease, human mucus proteinase inhibitor, and human seminal plasma inhibitor, is a 12-kDa member of the chelonianin class of serine protease inhibitors, which also includes SKALP/elafin (1Potempa J.

Biol. 1997; 268: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SLPI is composed of two homologous cysteine-rich domains. The carboxyl-terminal domain manifests inhibitory activities against chymotrypsin, trypsin, granulocyte and pancreatic elastases, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase (3Thompson R.C. Ohlsson K. Proc.

They have anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects, they are believed to stimulate blood coagulation, and they are reported to accelerate the healing of wounds (1Estrada A. Yun C-H. Van Kessel A., Li, B. Hauta S. Laarveld B. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Ohno N. Miura N.N. Nakajima M. Yadomae T. Biol. Pharmacol. Bull. 2000; 23: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, (1,3)-β-d-glucans have attracted attention as carcinostatic agents (3Maeda Y.Y. Chihara G. Nature. 1971; 229: 634Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and as immunomodulators in human immunodeficiency virus therapy (4Wasser S.P. Weis A.L. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 65-96PubMed Google Scholar). Although (1,3)-β-d-glucans can be isolated in good yield from a number of microbial sources (5Stone B.A. Clarke A.E. The Chemistry and Biology of (1,3)-β-Glucans. La Trobe University Press, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia1992Google Scholar), it is becoming apparent that their therapeutic value is dependent on fine structural detail, including molecular mass, the degree of substitution or branching, and three-dimensional conformation (6Falch B.H. Espevik T. Ryan L. Stokke B.T. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 329: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In many cases, the (1,3)-β-d-glucans that can be easily isolated from biological sources do not meet these criteria. Thus, realization of their potential value in therapeutic applications will rely on the development of efficient methods for the synthesis of (1,3)-β-d-glucans with quite specific physical and chemical properties. Chemoenzymic procedures for the synthesis of specific oligo- or polysaccharides are now available. In these procedures, the normal hydrolytic direction of glycoside hydrolases can be reversed, either through manipulation of reaction conditions or through targeted modification of the enzyme, so that the hydrolases actually form glycosidic linkages between donor and acceptor glycosides (7McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Specificity is usually maintained in the biosynthetic direction. The application of retaining glycoside hydrolases for the synthesis of β-linked oligo- and polysaccharides encompasses two distinct approaches. The first is an “equilibrium” approach, which relies upon high substrate concentrations and/or lowered water concentrations to generate synthetic products. This approach offers very modest yields (about 10%) and suffers from a low degree of regioselectivity (8Armand S. Vieille C. Gey C. Heyraud A. Zeikus J.G. Henrissat B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The second, “kinetic” approach uses a relatively reactive glycosyl donor, typically an aryl glycoside or a glycosyl fluoride, and offers yields ranging from ∼25% to about 60% (9Armand S. Drouillard S. Schülein M. Henrissat B. Driguez H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2709-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Planas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic reactions can be performed either in an aqueous environment (11Biely P. Vrsanska M. Kratky Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or in hydro-organic media (12Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Viladot J.L. Planas A. Driguez H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1998; 1: 3571-3576Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The modest yields can be attributed to hydrolysis of the newly generated reaction products that are themselves substrates for the hydrolytic enzyme or to limited stability or denaturation of the enzyme in nonaqueous media. These problems have largely been overcome through “glycosynthase” methodology, which is a variation of hydrolase-catalyzed chemoenzymic synthesis of glycosidic linkages first developed on the exo-actingAlcaligenes faecalisβ-d-glucosidase/β-d-galactosidase (13Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Glycosynthases are generated by the replacement of the catalytic nucleophile of the glycoside hydrolase with a nonnucleophilic amino acid residue. This results in a hydrolytically inactive mutant and therefore completely eliminates the problem of hydrolytic cleavage of newly formed oligo- or polysaccharide products. However, the mutated enzymes can transfer a sugar moiety from an α-glycosyl fluoride donor molecule to substituted or unsubstituted glycoside acceptors. The reactive α-glycosyl fluoride donor mimics the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate observed for the wild-type glycoside hydrolase and may be generated prior to the reaction (13Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar) or prepared in situ(14Trincone A. Perugino G. Rossi M. Moracci M. Biorg. Med. Chem.

The glycosynthase reactions proceed in aqueous buffers and offer much higher product yields (between 80 and 100%) than other chemoenzymic methods (8Armand S. Vieille C. Gey C. Heyraud A. Zeikus J.G. Henrissat B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Armand S. Drouillard S. Schülein M. Henrissat B. Driguez H. J. Biol.

Here we describe mutated (1,3)-β-d-glucan glycosynthases that are capable of efficient chemoenzymic synthesis of a variety of (1,3)-β-linked oligo- and polysaccharides.

The catalytic efficiencies and other kinetic properties of the mutated enzymes have been compared, and the chemical and physical properties of the polymeric products of the glycosynthase reaction are defined. Orcinol; laminarin, a (1,3)-β-d-linked glucan of degree of polymerization (DP)2 ∼33 fromLaminaria digitata; bovine serum albumin (fraction V); and 4′-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (4NPGlc) were purchased from Sigma, and tryptone and yeast extract were from Becton Dickinson Co. (Sparks, MD). Microcon microconcentrators were from Amicon (Beverly, MA), Kieselgel 60 thin layer plates were from Merck, and (1,3)-β-d-oligosaccharides of DP 2–7 were from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The pET 3a-HT expression vector and E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS were from Novagen (Madison, WI), E. coli strain XL-1 Blue used for construction of mutated cDNAs was from Stratagene (La Jolla, Ca, USA), and the pET 3a-HT/(1,3)-β-d-glucanase isoenzyme GII cDNA plasmid was constructed by Dr. Richard Stewart (18Stewart R. Varghese J.N. Garrett T.P.J. Høj P.B. Fincher G.B. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Paramylon was a generous gift from Professor Bruce Stone (La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia). Barley (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase isoenzyme GII was purified from a homogenate of 2-day-old seedlings by fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion chromatography as described previously (19Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The purity of the (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase was assessed by SDS-PAGE, where a single protein band was detected at high protein loadings. The purity was confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. No secondary amino acid sequences were detected in the first 52 amino acid residues, and quantification of recoveries during the sequence analysis showed that they were close to theoretical values (data not shown). All mutants were generated using a procedure modified from Stratagene's QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The template DNA consisted of the wild type (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase isoenzyme GII cDNA inserted in theNdeI/SacII site of a pET 3a expression vector modified by Dr. Helen Healy (University of Adelaide, Australia) to include expression of a thrombin cleavage site followed by a His6 purification tag at the COOH terminus. Approximately 0.5 μg of template DNA was added to a PCR containing 190 ng of both forward and reverse orientation mutagenic primers and amplified withPfuI DNA polymerase. Forward and reverse primers, respectively, for the PCRs were as follows: 5′-G GTG GTG GGT TCGGCG AGC GGG TGG CCG TCG G-3′ and 5′-C CGA CGG CCA CCC GCTCGC CGA CAC CAC CAC C-3′ (for mutant E231A); 5′-G GTG GTG GTG TCG GGG AGC GGG TGG CCG TCG G-3′ and 5′-C CGA CGG CCA CCC GCT CCC CGA CAC CAC CAC C-3′ (for mutant E231G); 5′-G GTG GTG GTG TCG TCG AGC GGG TGG CCG TCG G-3′ and 5′-C CGA CGG CCA CCC GCT CGA CGA CAC CAC CAC C-3′ (for mutant E231S). After PCR amplification (25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1.5 min, and 68 °C for 20 min), the reaction mixture was treated with DpnI restriction endonuclease to digest methylated template DNA. Remaining PCR-synthesized mutated plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli XL-1 Blue cells via a 45-s heat shock at 42 °C. Dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R.

Wild type and mutated cDNAs were expressed in the pET 3a vector in E. colistrain BL21 (DE3) pLysS induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (18Stewart R. Varghese J.N. Garrett T.P.J.

Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing, followed by sonication in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. Insoluble proteins and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min), and soluble proteins were fractionated through a pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The column was washed three times in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole, before elution of bound proteins with 270 mm imidazole in the same buffer.

A further aliquot of the enzyme was added after 4 h. The mixture was separated on Kieselgel 60 thin layer plates, developed in ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (2:1:1; by volume), and the reducing sugar products were detected with the orcinol reagent (19Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Products of polymerization reactions with β-laminaribiosyl fluoride as a donor molecule and laminaribiose or 3-thiolaminaribiose as acceptor molecules were also investigated at donor/acceptor ratios of 1 or 10. The conditions of heterocondensation reactions were identical to those described above.

The solution was diluted with CH2Cl2 and poured onto ice-cold aqueous NH3 (3 m), and stirring was continued for 30 min. The organic phase was diluted with CH2Cl2, evaporated, and purified by flash chromatography (40–50% EtOAc/petrol), to yield hepta-O-acetyl-3-thio-α-laminaribiosyl fluoride (5) as fine needles (98 mg, 82% yield), m.p. 163–164 °C (EtOH). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ 5.69 (dd, 1 H, J1,2 = 2.4 Hz, J1,F = 53.5 Hz, H-1I), 5.16 (t, 1 H, J2,3 =J3,4 = 9.1 Hz, H-3II), 5.06–4.85 (m, 4 H, H-2I, H-2II, H-4I, H-4II), 4.73 (d, 1 H, J1,2 = 10.2 Hz, H-1II), 4.26–4.18, 4.12–4.06 (2m, 5 H, H-5I, H-6I, H-6II), 3.69 (ddd, 1 H, J4,5 = 10.0 Hz, J5,6a = 4.9 Hz, J5,6b = 2.4 Hz, H-5II), 3.20 (t, 1 H, J2,3 = J3,4 = 10.8 Hz, H-3I), 2.19–1.99 (7s, 21 H, 7× Me).13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 170.47–169.00 (7s, 7× CO), 103.30 (d, J1,F = 230 Hz, C-1I), 83.18, (C-3I), 75.71, 73.70, 70.32, 68.04, 65.22 (C-2II, C-3II, C-4I, C-4II, C-5II), 71.7 (d, J2, F = 25 Hz, C-2I), 71.0 (d, J5,F = 4.6 Hz, C-5I), 61.82, 61.68 (C-6I, C-6II), 20.65–20.44 (7s, 7× Me).

A suspension of the heptaacetate 5 (212 mg) in MeOH (10 ml) was treated with NaOMe (100 μl, 0.1 m), and the mixture was stirred at progressively higher temperatures from 0 to 25 °C until dissolution was complete. The solution was neutralized with Amberlite IR-120 resin (H+ form); the resin was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated. The residual oil was lyophilized from H2O to give 3-thio-α-laminaribiosyl fluoride (6) as colorless foam (112 mg). MS: m/z 383 (M + Na)+. (1,3)-β-d-Glucan endohydrolase E231G (3.1 nmol, 0.1 mg) was added to a solution of 3-thio-α-laminaribiosyl fluoride (6) (175.8 μmol, 60 mg) in 0.25 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (1.4 ml), and the combined mixture was incubated (37 °C, 24 h) with mild shaking (Scheme FS1). After 24 h, a further aliquot of enzyme (3.1 nmol, 0.1 mg) was added, and incubation continued for 24 h before MeOH (2.8 ml) was added to the mixture. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with H2O and reprecipitated (MeOH; three times) before lyophilization to yield (3Maeda Y.Y. Chihara G.

This residue was further lyophilized (D2O, three times) prior to NMR analysis. Initial rates of (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase E231A, E231G, and E231S mutated enzymes were measured in the presence of 14.7 mmα-laminaribiosyl fluoride or 3-thio-α-laminaribiosyl fluoride (autocondensation reactions) or in the presence of 14.7 mmα-laminaribiosyl fluoride and a 5-fold excess (74 mm) of 4NPGlc (heterocondensation reaction). Freshly deacetylated α-laminaribiosyl fluoride was dissolved in 150 mmphosphate/citrate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 160 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, with or without 4NPGlc, and incubated with 36–136 μmol of the purified mutated enzymes at 30 °C with gentle shaking. An Orion fluoride electrode (Orion Research, Beverly, MA) interfaced with a pH/ion meter was used to determine the fluoride release and thus to deduce the glycosynthetic reaction rates. All enzymic reactions were corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of α-laminaribiosyl fluoride. Kinetic parameters of (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase E231A, E231G, and E231S mutated enzymes were determined at 30 °C by incubating 18–108 pmol of the enzymes in 150 mm sodium phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 160 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Initial rates of hydrolysis were determined in triplicate at substrate concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 3 times theKm values. An Orion fluoride electrode interfaced with a pH/ion meter was used to determine the fluoride release. S.D. values, which were ∼10%, were calculated according to Samuels (24Samuels M.L. Statistics for Life Sciences. Dellen Publishing Co., San Francisco1991Google Scholar). Kinetic data were processed by a proportional weighted fit using a nonlinear regression analysis program based on the Michaelis-Menten model equation (25Perella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The initial enzyme concentration [E]0 was ≪ [S]0, where [E]0 and [S]0 represent enzyme and substrate concentrations at zero time, and initial reaction rates were therefore measured in all cases. The pH optima were determined over the range 3.0–9.3 in 150 mm sodium phosphate/citrate buffer containing 160 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, with 18–80 μmol of purified mutated enzymes at 30 °C under gentle shaking. The glycosynthetic rates were monitored with the fluoride electrode. The progress of the reactions was corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of α-laminaribiosyl fluoride. Reaction mixtures containing 0.2% (w/v) laminarin and 0–3.2 m sodium formate or sodium azide were incubated with 30–60 pmol of (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase E231G, E231A, and E231S mutated enzymes. The mixtures were incubated for up to 60 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking, in triplicate, in 200 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 160 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The rates of hydrolysis of laminarin were estimated from the increase in reducing sugars (19Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), after correction for background reducing levels of laminarin. One unit of hydrolytic activity is defined as 1 μmol of glucose equivalents released per min. One unit corresponds to 16.67 nanokatals. The molecular masses of the O- and S-linked polymeric products were determined on a Voyager DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The molecular masses of the compounds were estimated from the m/z ratio of the quasimolecular-ionic (M + Na)+ adducts. Products from the O-series glycosynthase reactions were methylated and analyzed for linkage type by the permethylated alditol acetate procedure (26Harris P.J. Henry R.J. Blakeney A.B. Stone B.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Partially methylated monosaccharides released by trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis were reduced with NaBD4 and acetylated. The resulting methylated alditol acetates were separated on a HP-6890 series gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a CP-Sil5 Chrompak capillary column (25 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter; Supelco), using a temperature gradient (165–230 °C; 2.5 °C min−1). The derivatives were identified by electron impact mass spectrometry using a NERMAG R-1010C spectrometer (Scientific Instruments, Ringoes, NJ), equipped with a HP5973 mass selective detector and using myo-inositol hexaacetate as an internal standard (27Bulone V. Fincher G.B. Stone B.A. Plant J. 1995; 8: 213-225Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The lyophilized product was fixed on a stub using conductive glue and coated with gold/palladium alloy by ion-sputtering prior to observation. Scanning electron microscopy examinations were made with a JEOL JSM-6100 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and a working distance of 16 mm. For transmission electron microscopy, droplets of aqueous suspensions of the dialyzed product were deposited onto carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Samples were observed with a Philips CM200 cryoelectron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Selected area electron diffraction was performed using the nonstained sample over an area 1 μm in diameter and at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The thickness of the crystals corresponding to the glycosynthase product was estimated using latex beads having a diameter of 0.109 μm as a reference, after shadowing the sample with a tungsten/tantalum alloy. Lyophilized product was packed in a thin wall x-ray glass capillary (0.5-mm diameter) and mounted in a flat Wharus vacuum camera equipped with a 0.25-mm pin hole collimator. The sample was subjected to nickel-filtered Cu-Kαradiations generated at 30 kV and 20 mA. The resulting x-ray diffraction diagrams were recorded at room temperature on Kodak DEF-5 films. For comparison, the x-ray diffraction pattern of paramylon, a highly crystalline (1,3)-β-d-glucan from Euglena gracilis, was obtained under similar conditions. The three-dimensional molecular model of (1,3)-β-d-glucanase mutant E231G was built from a wild type enzyme (Protein Data Bank accession code 1GHS; Ref. 17Varghese J.N. Garrett T.P.J. Colman P.M.

The models of the three mutated enzymes were further checked manually on O and GRASP (31Nicolls A. Sharp K. Hönig B. Proteins. 1991; 4: 281-296Crossref Scopus (5311) Google Scholar) and were essentially identical. Models of molecular surfaces of wild type and mutated enzymes were generated with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Electrostatic potentials were calculated using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation with GRASP. In hydro-organic media, the wild type (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase, purified from barley seedlings or expressed in an heterologous expression system of E. coli, converted β-laminaribiosyl fluoride into (1,3)-β-d-linked oligosaccharides in the presence or absence of acceptors (data not shown). However, the overall yields of the products with β-laminaribiosyl fluoride (about 20%) were consistently low with the wild type (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase (data not shown), in agreement with previously published data (12Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Viladot J.L. Planas A. Driguez H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1998; 1: 3571-3576Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mutations causing amino acid substitutions E231G, E231S, and E231A were introduced at the cDNA level using site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The three mutated (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolases were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Single protein bands were observed following SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). The expressed wild type and mutated enzymes had molecular masses of 33–34 kDa (Fig. 1), which corresponded to that calculated for the barley enzyme (32Høj P.B. Hartman D.J. Morrice N.A. Doan D.N.P. Fincher G.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Yields of the recombinant enzymes varied for each mutant and between experiments but were generally 1.5–6.6 mg of protein per liter of bacterial culture. The expressed wild type enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 220 units mg−1 protein, which is similar to values reported for (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolase isoenzyme GII preparations purified from barley seedlings (19Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, no activity against laminarin, a (1,3)-β-d-linked glucan of DP ∼33 (5Stone B.A. Clarke A.E. The Chemistry and Biology of (1,3)-β-Glucans. La Trobe University Press, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia1992Google Scholar), could be detected for the three mutated enzymes, even after prolonged incubation with the substrate. When the expressed wild type and mutated enzymes were stored at 4 °C at a concentration of 0.15–1.2 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 300 mm NaCl and 270 mm imidazole, no appreciable loss of hydrolase or glycosynthase activity was observed over several weeks. When the expressed, mutated (1,3)-β-d-glucan endohydrolases E231G, E231A, and E231S were incubated with α-laminaribiosyl fluoride, a white flocculant precipitate formed within 2–24 h. Precipitation was notably faster with the E231G mutant and slowest with the E231A mutant. Preliminary analyses of the supernatant from the E231G reaction by thin layer chromatography showed the depletion of the α-laminaribiosyl fluoride substrate and the accumulation of carbohydrate that remained at the origin (data not shown). After prolonged incubation, a yield of 75% was calculated, on the basis that 0.2 mg of the E231G mutant converted 60 mg of α-laminaribiosyl fluoride to 45 mg of insoluble product.

Monoclonal antibodies, which contain constant specificity and affinity, are often used for the identification of Z-mutation carriers. A mouse monoclonal antibody (ATZ11) raised against PiZZ hepatocytic AAT was successfully used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and in identification of Z-related AAT globular inclusions by immunohistochemical techniques. Using electrophoresis, Western blotting, and ELISA procedures, we have shown in the present study that this monoclonal antibody specifically detects a conformation-dependent neoepitope on both polymerized and elastase-complexed molecular forms of AAT. The antibody has no apparent affinity for native, latent, or cleaved forms of AAT. The antibody ATZ11 illustrates the structural resemblance between the polymerized form of AAT and its complex with elastase and provides evidence that Z-homozygotes beyond the native form may have at least one more circulating molecular form of AAT, i.e. its polymerized form. In addition, staining of endothelial cells with ATZ11 antibody in both M- and Z-AAT individuals shows that AAT attached to endothelial cells is in a polymerized form. The antibody can be a powerful tool for the study of the molecular profile of AAT, not only in Z-deficiency cases but also in other (patho)physiological conditions.

Serpins possess two structural elements that are conformationally labile and are essential for efficient proteinase inhibition: a reactive center loop and a β-sheet (β-sheet A) that is able to open and accommodate the reactive center loop after its cleavage by the attacking proteases (2Sun J. Rose J.B. Bird P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16089-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G.

The x-ray crystal structures of native, cleaved, cleaved in complex with protease, and polymerized forms of serpins have confirmed the abilities of these proteins to undergo profound conformational changes under certain environmental conditions (6Ye S. Goldsmith E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Skinner R. Abrahams J.P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol.

The crystal structure of the α1-antitrypsin-trypsin complex showed complete insertion of the reactive site loop, which substantially increases thermal and conformational stability of the serpin and results in the irreversible inhibition and then the structural destruction of the proteinase (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar).The conformational changes that occur in the serpin molecule during the formation of the enzyme-serpin complexes, interaction with other molecules, polymerization, cleavage, and oxidation lead to the generation of conformation-dependent neoepitopes (10Strandberg K. Kjellberg M. Erb E.M. Persson U. Mosher D.F. Villoutreix B.O. Stenflo J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15713-15720Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunochemical analysis by means of monoclonal antibodies is a useful approach for study of the formation of new epitopes that occur as a result of the conformational polymorphism of serpins (11Saunders D.N. Buttigieg K.M. Gould A. McPhun V. Baker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10965-10971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Abbink J.J. Kamp A.M. Swaak A.J. Hack C.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 143: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For example, the suggestion that the whole reactive site loop is incorporated as an additional strand into the β-sheet A upon complex formation is supported by immunological evidence obtained using antithrombin in which unique epitopes were exposed through binding to proteases and cleavage of the reactive side bond (13Picard V. Marque P.E. Paolucci F. Aiach M. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4586-4593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These epitopes were also present in the cleaved serpin, where crystallographic data have revealed full loop insertion. For another serpin, the C1 inhibitor, it was shown that neoepitopes are induced upon interaction with target and non-target proteases, illustrating the structural similarities between its complexed and cleaved forms. (14Nuijens J.H. Huijbregts C.C. van Mierlo G.M. Hack C.E. Immunology. 1987; 61: 387-389PubMed Google Scholar).Molecular mobility confers on serpins not only the capacity to bind and entrap their target proteinases in highly stable complexes but also a concomitant propensity to form dysfunctional molecules (15Kopito R.R. Ron D. Nat. Cell Bio. 2000; 2: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). A change of a single amino acid in certain domains of the serpin molecule can block changes in the structure necessary for normal inhibitory activity and folding and can lead to the polymerization of mutant serpin into intracellular aggregates (16Elliott P.R. Pei X.Y. Dafforn T.R. Lomas D.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the lost and altered activities of dysfunctional serpins has been greatly advanced by correlating studies on molecular structure with analysis of the mechanisms of serpins and their target proteinases and of their physical properties (17Carrell R.W. Whisstock J. Lomas D.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S171-S175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. N. Engl. J.

Acta. 2001; 1535: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).α1-Antitrypsin is the major serpin in the human circulation. It is produced predominantly by hepatocytes but also by blood monocytes, macrophages, pulmonary alveolar cells, and intestinal epithelial cells (20Travis J. Shieh B.H. Potempa J. Tokai. J. Exp. Clin. Med. 1988; 13: 313-320PubMed Google Scholar, 21Molmenti E.P. Perlmutter D.H. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The biological activity of AAT can be affected by point mutations modifying its structure and/or secretion. Several genetic variants of AAT are associated with low plasma AAT levels (22Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Sidhar S. Foreman R. Chest. 1996; 110: 243S-247SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Severe AAT deficiency of the homozygous PiZ phenotype, which differs from the normal M variant in the substitution of Glu342 with Lys, was first recognized as a new hereditary condition predisposing to disease on the basis of low plasma levels (10% normal) of the protein that arise not from the lack of AAT synthesis but from a blockage of its secretion (23Eriksson S. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 34-39PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kalsheker N. Morgan K. Thorax. 1990; 45: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Molecules of the Z variant of AAT are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes as inclusion bodies that can be recognized by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining (25Bolmer S. Kleinerman J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 377-389PubMed Google Scholar). PAS-positive intracellular inclusions are the end result of AAT polymerization due to a sequential insertion of the reactive loop from one AAT molecule into a β-sheet of another (26Lomas D.A. Respir. Med. 2000; 94: S3-S6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.S. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The retained Z-AAT polymers are cytotoxic for the hepatocytes and can cause liver damage with a variable clinical presentation, from neonatal hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in adults (28Teckman J.H., Qu, D. Perlmutter D.H. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1504-1516PubMed Google Scholar).Individuals with AAT deficiency are also at an increased risk of developing emphysema, which is the most frequent complication of AAT deficiency and is believed to occur because of the decrease in elastase inhibitory capacity normally provided by AAT. However, AAT polymers also occur in the lungs of patients with AAT deficiency (29Reid P.T. Sallenave J.M. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 2: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar,30Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. Thorax. 1998; 53: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, an association has been shown between Z-AAT deficiency and immunomediated diseases, particularly C-ANCA positive vasculitic disorders (31Esnault V.L. Audrain M.A. Sesboue R. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 206-213PubMed Google Scholar).A monoclonal antibody raised against the PiZZ type of AAT purified from the liver of Z-homozygotes was widely used for the recognition of AAT deficiency in ELISA procedures (32Wallmark A. Alm R. Eriksson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5690-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The antibody was shown to recognize specifically the Z type of AAT, and the linear epitope was thought to be located at the mutation site (Lys342 → Glu) in the AAT molecule. This idea was challenged by later studies showing the ability of a single amino acid substitution in a protein molecule to change the shape of the molecule and result in the opening and/or creation of new, conformation-dependent epitopes (11Saunders D.N. Buttigieg K.M. Gould A. McPhun V. Baker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10965-10971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Picard V. Marque P.E. Paolucci F. Aiach M.

Typically, the pronounced structural change that occurs during the formation of the enzyme-serpin complex leads to the generation of new epitopes (36Patston P.A. Gettins P.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To date, monoclonal antibodies have been described that recognize a conformation-dependent neoepitope in both the activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex and the cleaved, loop-inserted inhibitor but lack affinity for the native form of inhibitor (10Strandberg K. Kjellberg M. Erb E.M. Persson U. Mosher D.F. Villoutreix B.O. Stenflo J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15713-15720Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Such antibodies provide evidence that identical neoepitopes can be present in two different molecular forms of proteolytically modified inhibitor and that they are conformationally dependent.We hypothesize that the change in protein folding of Z-AAT could cause formation of the multidomain, conformational epitopes but need not necessarily involve the mutation site. Here we have shown that a mouse monoclonal antibody, ATZ11, which has been produced against Z-AAT, recognizes a conformational neoepitope including both polymerized and elastase-complexed forms of AAT but lacks affinity to native, latent, or cleaved AAT.DISCUSSIONA monoclonal antibody, ATZ11, has been prepared after immunization of mice with globular AAT inclusions purified from a ZZ liver (32Wallmark A. Alm R. Eriksson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5690-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Screening of a large number of plasma samples with ATZ11 using a double sandwich ELISA procedure allowed rapid and easy identification of individuals with homozygous PiZ or intermediate PiMZ, SZ, and FZ AAT deficiency. There was no overlapping observed between plasma from subjects lacking the Z allele and those that were PiZ homozygotes or heterozygous. No false positive plasma samples have been found (40Carlson J. Eriksson S. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1985; 20: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41Elzouki A.N. Segelmark M. Wieslander J. Eriksson S. J. Intern. Med. 1994; 236: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 42Elzouki A.N. Verbaan H. Lindgren S. Widell A. Carlson J. Eriksson S. J. Hepatol. 1997; 27: 42-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The antibody was also utilized for the identification of PiZ gene carriers in liver tissue sections (43Callea F. Brisigotti M. Faa G. Lucini L. Eriksson S. J. Hepatol. 1991; 12: 372-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Together these studies have suggested that the ATZ11 antibody is of great value for the identification of PiZ gene carriers at both plasma and tissue levels.Recently, however, Fischer et al. (44Fischer H.P. Ortiz-Pallardo M.E., Ko, Y. Esch C. Zhou H. J. Hepatol. 2000; 33: 883-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have shown that the ATZ11 antibody reacts with endothelial cells of portal capillaries and larger blood vessels from both PiM and PiZ individuals. They have suggested that this is due to a cross-reaction of the antibody with an epitope on endothelial cells. We have confirmed these findings by showing that various non-Z specimens of vessel endothelium stain intensely positive for AAT with monoclonal ATZ11. The observation that ATZ11 antibody is unable to distinguish between the normal and the deficiency variant of AAT on endothelial cells led us to predict that the ATZ11 antibody recognizes a conformation-dependent, presumably non-linear, epitope of the AAT molecules, not necessarily involving the Z mutation per se. Because a mouse monoclonal antibody ATZ11 was developed against hepatic inclusion bodies isolated from a Z-homozygote, one can assume that the AAT protein used as an antigen was in a polymerized form. In both the native PAGE immunoblot analysis and ELISA systems, polymers prepared in vitro from purified M-AAT clearly showed that the ATZ11 antibody recognizes a polymeric form of AAT. We also found that, in addition to AAT polymers, the antibody reacts with AAT-elastase complex but shows no reaction with the native, inhibitory form of AAT or its non-inhibitory forms, viz. cleaved or latent. A synthetic peptide covering the Z mutation of AAT (Glu342 → Lys) failed to inhibit the antibody reaction with polymerized and complexed AAT, providing further evidence that a neoepitope recognized by the ATZ11 antibody does not involve the mutation site of the Z-AAT molecule.An interaction between AAT and its target enzyme results in a conformational transition of AAT that allows the opening of β-sheet A and insertion of the cleaved reactive site loop (45Seo E.J., Im, H. Maeng J.S. Kim K.E. Yu M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16904-16909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The insertion of the reactive site strand into β-sheet A can also be induced under mild denaturation conditions and during intermolecular polymerization of AAT (46Koloczek H. Banbula A. Salvesen G.S. Potempa J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2226-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structural transitions associated with loop insertion expose epitopes that can stimulate antibody production. Recently a monoclonal antibody has been identified that recognizes a neoepitope covering both complexed and cleaved forms of the protein C inhibitor but shows no affinity for the native form of the serpin (10Strandberg K.

It is generally assumed that small conformational differences between the cleaved serpin complexed with an enzyme and cleaved serpin without complex formation limit the possibilities to produce an antibody that recognizes only one of these inactive forms (12Abbink J.J. Kamp A.M. Swaak A.J. Hack C.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 143: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, for the C1 inhibitor at least one antibody has been described which recognizes a neoepitope exclusively exposed on the cleaved inhibitor and not on the complexed form of the protein (14Nuijens J.H. Huijbregts C.C. van Mierlo G.M. Hack C.E. Immunology. 1987; 61: 387-389PubMed Google Scholar).To date no antibody has been described covering a neoepitope on both AAT complexed with enzyme and polymerized AAT. The finding that ATZ11 antibody reacts specifically with two non-inhibitory forms of AAT, polymerized and complexed with elastase but not with cleaved or latent forms, implies that the dislocations of structural elements in the AAT molecule caused by the insertion of the active site strand into the β-sheet during polymerization and complex formation are distinct from those occurring in the latent and proteolytically cleaved forms of AAT. The structures of intact, latent, cleaved, and polymerized serpins and serpins complexed with enzyme confirm the polymorphic character of the reactive site strand, which to varying extents can undergo an insertion into β-sheet A (5Lawrence D.A.

The ATZ11 antibody that can discriminate conformational states associated with reactive site insertion into β-sheet A may provide great help in elucidating the structural features of AAT as well as in detecting molecular forms of AAT in vivo.In the classic form of AAT deficiency, phenotype PiZ, the mutant Z-AAT molecules are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver cells due to an aberrant protein polymerization (50Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that plasma freshly obtained from patients with homozygous Z deficiency also contains a significant amount of AAT polymers. This observation provides good evidence that Z-AAT polymerization occurs not only within hepatocytes but also in the circulation. Non-Z carriers were found to have very low levels or a total lack of plasma AAT polymers, which is also consistent with the high sensitivity and specificity of the ATZ11-based ELISA system used for the detection of Z carriers in earlier studies (40Carlson J. Eriksson S. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1985; 20: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41Elzouki A.N. Segelmark M. Wieslander J. Eriksson S. J. Intern. Med. 1994; 236: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Considering the potential cytotoxicity of Z-AAT polymers to hepatocytes and their occurrence in the circulation, it is relevant to discuss the potential pathogenic role of these polymers in extrahepatic clinical manifestations of AAT deficiency, such as emphysema and vasculitic disorders. The accompanying plasma deficiency predisposes the Z-homozygote to early onset emphysema, particularly in cigarette smokers (52Campbell I.C. Respir. Med. 2000; 94: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 53Perlmutter D.H. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 54Eriksson S. Chest. 1996; 110: 237S-242SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Emphysema is thought to be caused by uninhibited proteolysis in the lung tissue (23Eriksson S. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 34-39PubMed Google Scholar, 55Perlmutter D.H. Clin. Liver Dis. 2000; 4: 387-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although Z-AAT polymers have also been identified in the lungs of Z-AAT homozygotes with emphysema (56Elliott P.R. Bilton D. Lomas D.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, at present we can only speculate about the putative role of AAT polymers in the pathogenesis of emphysema. The polymers of Z-AAT molecules, either locally formed de novo or deriving from the circulation, may favor proteolytical events but also provide as yet unknown biological activities.The intrinsic property of the wild type AAT to undergo loop-sheet polymerization is much less pronounced than for mutant Z-AAT. To date,in vivo, wild type AAT polymers have been described only in human bile, where AAT interaction with the hydrophobic microenvironment is supposed to enhance polymer formation (57Janciauskiene S. Toth E. Sahlin S. Eriksson S. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1996; 56: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The observed reaction of ATZ11 antibody with vascular endothelial cells from non-Z AAT individuals clearly demonstrates that endothelial-bound AAT is in a polymerized form. Neutrophil elastase staining of endothelial cells turned out to be negative, arguing against any significant contribution of AAT-elastase complexes to the observed staining pattern.Expression of AAT in human islet, microvascular endothelial cells has been demonstrated (58Lou J. Triponez F. Oberholzer J. Wang H., Yu, D. Buhler L. Cretin N. Mentha G. Wollheim C.B. Morel P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1773-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and endothelial binding of AAT and α1-antichymotrypsin derived from plasma has been identified (59Forsyth K.D. Talbot V. Beckman I. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 95: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the loss of endothelial serpins predisposes to vascular injury (60Smedly L.A. Tonnesen M.G. Sandhaus R.A. Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 61Nakatani K. Takeshita S. Tsujimoto H. Kawamura Y. Sekine I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 241-247PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of biosynthesis and/or uptake mechanisms of AAT in endothelial cells, however, needs further investigation. Moreover, our findings highlight the need for the elucidation of the putative role of AAT in large vessel diseases and also in small vessel disorders, particularly Wegener's granulomatosis, a characteristic C-ANCA entity. Many recent studies have shown a firm relationship between the presence of a Z allele and anti-proteinase-3-positive systemic vasculitis (31Esnault V.L. Audrain M.A. Sesboue R. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 206-213PubMed Google Scholar, 33Borgmann S. Endisch G. Urban S. Sitter T. Fricke H. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 98: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Taken together, our data describe a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conformation-dependent neoepitope in polymerized AAT and in the AAT-elastase complex but that has no affinity for the native form of inhibitor or for the non-inhibitory cleaved or latent forms. We have also shown that a fraction of plasma AAT in Z-homozygotes exists in a polymerized form and that a polymeric wild type AAT is an endothelial cell marker. The ATZ11 antibody can be a valuable tool for further conformational studies of AAT and for various clinical applications. The capacity to undergo conformational changes is crucial for the physiological function of many proteins; the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins)1 are a clear case for such changes having been exploited during evolution as a means of modulating inhibitory activity (1Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

Serpins possess two structural elements that are conformationally labile and are essential for efficient proteinase inhibition: a reactive center loop and a β-sheet (β-sheet A) that is able to open and accommodate the reactive center loop after its cleavage by the attacking proteases (2Sun J. Rose J.B. Bird P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16089-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G.

The x-ray crystal structures of native, cleaved, cleaved in complex with protease, and polymerized forms of serpins have confirmed the abilities of these proteins to undergo profound conformational changes under certain environmental conditions (6Ye S. Goldsmith E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Skinner R. Abrahams J.P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol.

The crystal structure of the α1-antitrypsin-trypsin complex showed complete insertion of the reactive site loop, which substantially increases thermal and conformational stability of the serpin and results in the irreversible inhibition and then the structural destruction of the proteinase (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The conformational changes that occur in the serpin molecule during the formation of the enzyme-serpin complexes, interaction with other molecules, polymerization, cleavage, and oxidation lead to the generation of conformation-dependent neoepitopes (10Strandberg K. Kjellberg M. Erb E.M. Persson U. Mosher D.F. Villoutreix B.O. Stenflo J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15713-15720Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunochemical analysis by means of monoclonal antibodies is a useful approach for study of the formation of new epitopes that occur as a result of the conformational polymorphism of serpins (11Saunders D.N.

The Arabidopsisgenome encodes a large number of protein kinases (1Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7004) Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent protein kinase or calmodulin-like domain protein kinase family is responsive to calcium, because they contain a kinase catalytic domain fused with a calmodulin-like regulatory domain (2Roberts D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the family of Salt Overly Sensitive 2 (SOS2)1-like protein kinases (i.e. PKSes) in plants is also responsive to calcium through interaction with the SOS3 (Salt Overly Sensitive 3) family of calcium-binding proteins, and thus may be functionally analogous to animal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (3Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis SOS2 and SOS3 genes are required for sodium and potassium ion homeostasis and salt tolerance (4Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SOS2 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase with an N-terminal kinase catalytic domain similar to SNF1/AMPK (7Hardie D.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 97-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and a novel C-terminal regulatory domain (4Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). SOS3 physically interacts with SOS2 in the yeast two-hybrid system as well as in vitro (8Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). A 21-amino acid sequence in the regulatory domain of SOS2, the FISL motif, has been determined to be necessary and sufficient to bind SOS3 (3Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium, SOS3 activates the substrate phosphorylation of SOS2 (8Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Salt stress up-regulation of the SOS1 (Salt Overly Sensitive 1) gene encoding a putative Na+/H+ antiporter is partially under control of the SOS3-SOS2 regulatory pathway (9Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis contains 23 PKS genes, several of which have been cloned and their transcript expression analyzed (3Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, neither the biochemical properties nor the physiological functions of the PKS gene products are known. By analogy to SOS2, these PKSes do not seem to have substrate phosphorylation activity in the absence of specific interacting proteins,i.e. the SOS3-like calcium-binding proteins, 2D. Gong, Z. Gong, Y. Guo, X. Chen, and J.-K. Zhu, unpublished observations. 2D. Gong, Z. Gong, Y. Guo, X. Chen, and J.-K. Zhu, unpublished observations. and thus further characterization is difficult to carry out. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to make these inactive PKSes active in order to characterize their biochemical properties. In addition to being excellent materials for biochemical characterization, active forms of PKSes may be expressed in plants to probe their in vivo functions. In this current work, we cloned the cDNA and analyzed the tissue-specific expression of a PKS gene, PKS11. We found that PKS11 was preferentially expressed in roots ofArabidopsis plants. A highly active PKS11 mutant form was constructed by substituting a threonine residue with aspartate (designated PKS11T161D) within the putative activation loop (10Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). This observation strongly suggests that activation loop phosphorylation may be an important determinant of the kinase activity in vivo. We then further characterized the activated PKS11 in terms of cofactor preference, substrate specificity, kinetic properties, effect of ADP and AMP, and pH and temperature dependence. We expressed the constitutively active PKS11 kinase mutant in transgenicArabidopsis, and we found that the transgenic plants were more resistant to high levels of glucose. Our results provide the first detailed biochemical characterization of the PKS and suggest that PKS11 is involved in sugar signaling in plants. A cDNA containing the complete open reading frame of PKS11was obtained by reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)-PCR. Template mRNA was isolated from 2-week-old wild-type Arabidopsis(Columbia ecotype) plants. PKS11-specific primer pairs containing KpnI and EcoRI sites at the termini are as follows: 5′-GCGGTACCATGGTGGTAAGGAAGGTGGGCATATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGAATTCAACGTCTTTTACTCTTGGCCTTGGTGAC-3′ (reverse) (MWG Biotec, High Point, NC). The PCR products were gel-purified, digested, and cloned into a modified pGEX-2T-CMS vector and completely sequenced. Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) nutrient agar plates under continuous light (11Wu S. Ding L. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 617-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 10-day-old seedlings were treated with NaCl, abscisic acid (ABA), cold, and drought as described previously (9Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 12Shi H. Xiong L. Stevenson B., Lu, T. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). For the collection of different tissues, wild-type plants were grown in Turface soil to facilitate root harvesting. Roots and leaves were collected from 3-week-old-seedlings, and stems, flowers, and siliques were harvested from mature plants. Total RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (13Zhu J.-K. Liu J. Xiong L. Plant Cell. 1998; 8: 1181-1191Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar). For analysis of transgene expression, total RNA was isolated from 10-day-old seedlings grown on MS agar plates containing 3% glucose. Thirty micrograms of total RNA was loaded in each lane, size-fractionated by electrophoresis, and blotted onto a nylon membrane. The blot was hybridized with a gene-specific DNA probe for PKS11. A 1207-bp promoter region of the PKS11 gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with the following primer pair introducing a BamHI site at the 5′ end and an SmaI site at the 3′ end to facilitate cloning: 5′-CGGGATCCATTATTTAGGAGAC-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-TCCCGGGCATTTCTTCAAGTCTAG-3′ (SmaI site underlined). The fragment was cloned intoBamHI- and SmaI-digested pBI101 vector to obtain a transcriptional fusion of the PKS11 promoter and the β-glucuronidase coding sequence. Transgenic plants harboring this construct were generated as described previously (12Shi H. Xiong L. Stevenson B., Lu, T. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). For β-glucuronidase assay, materials were stained at 37 °C overnight in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-β-D glucuronic acid, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100. Both the T/S/Y to D change within the activation loop and the FISL motif deletion mutation of the PKS11 were introduced using oligonucleotide-directed in vitromutagenesis. The mutagenic primers for T/S/Y to D changed mutation are as follows: pPKS11T161D-forward, 5′-CAAGGAGTTACCATCCTAAAGGACACATGTGGAACTCCC-3′; pPKS11T161D-reverse, 5′-AATTGGGAGTTCCACATGTGTCCTTTAGGATGGTAACTC-3′; pPKS11S154D-forward, 5′-ATATCTGATTTTGCCTCGACGCATTACCTGAACAAGGAG-3′; pPKS11S154D-reverse, 5′-TCCTTGTTCAGGTAATGCGTCGAGGCCAAAATCAGATATC-3′; pPKS11Y173D-forward, 5′-ACATGTGGAACTCCCAATGACGTTGCTCCTGAGGTTCTCAG-3′; and pPKS11Y173D-reverse, 5′-GAGAACCTCAGGAGCAACGTCATTGGGAGTTCCACATGTTG-3′. The mutagenic primers for deletion mutation are as follows: pPKS11Δ F-forward, 5′-TCCACTAACTGGAAAGGACTCCATGAAGCACCAGACAAGG-3′; and pPKS11ΔF-reverse, 5′-AGTCCTTTCC- AGTTAGTGGACCTGTGTCTCTTGTTCCATC-3′. Mutagenesis reactions were carried out on the double-stranded plasmid DNA using an enzyme mix of LA Tag (Takara Shuzo Ltd., Kyoto) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (1:1) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following PCR cycle: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were gel-purified and treated with DpnI to digest the parental supercoiled double-stranded DNA. The digested PCR products were transformed into DH5α-competent cells. The sequences of mutation as well as the fidelity of the rest of the DNA in all constructs were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-PKS11 was obtained as described previously (8Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The PKS11 open reading frame was cloned into pGEX-2T-CMS vector and expressed in bacteria as a C-terminal fusion protein with the bacterial GST under control of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible tacpromoter. All GST fusion constructs were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21 codon plus cells (Stratagene). A 10-ml overnight Luria-Bertani (LB) culture was transferred to a fresh 1000 ml of LB and further cultured at 37 °C until theA 600 reached about 0.8. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 0.6 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer, pH 7.5, containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and Triton X-100 (1%, v/v) were added to the suspension and incubated on ice with gentle shaking for 1 h before sonication. The sonicate was then clarified by centrifugation, and the recombinant proteins were affinity-purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE (10%, w/v) analysis was used to evaluate the protein composition of each preparation. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). In vitro phosphorylation assays using a synthetic peptide p3 (ALARAASAAALARRR, Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) as substrate were performed as described previously (8Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) with modification. Peptide phosphorylation was measured as the incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into the peptide substrate. Reactions without the peptide p3 or kinase proteins were used as controls. The kinase assay buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm MnCl2 or 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Kinase reactions (in a total volume of 40 μl) were started by adding 150 μm p3 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 600 cpm/pmol), and reaction mixtures were immediately transferred to 30 °C for 30 min. All reactions contained ∼400–500 ng of purified proteins. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The stained bands on SDS-PAGE gels were also compared with a bovine serum albumin dilution series to adjust for the potential presence of other minor proteins that may copurify with the kinases. Enzyme activities were linear with respect to incubation time and amount of enzyme assayed. Reactions were terminated by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and the GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were pelleted. Fifteen microliters of the supernatant was spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) for peptide phosphorylation analysis. The P-81 paper was then washed 4 times in cold 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid (10 min per wash) and dried, and the phosphorylated peptide was quantified by phosphorimaging using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) with the ImageQuant software. To the remaining 25 μl of reaction mixture, 5 μl of 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and denatured by boiling for 3 min, the samples were then separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak) to detect kinase autophosphorylation. For the analysis of a cofactor requirement, peptide phosphorylation and autophosphorylation assays were performed in the kinase assay buffer with 0–20 mm MnCl2 or MgCl2, whereas the concentrations of p3 (150 μm) and ATP (10 μM) were fixed. For substrate specificity assays, peptides p1 (LRRASLG) and p2 (VRKRTLRRL) (Sigma) were used in addition to the p3. Individual kinetic parameters were determined by varying the concentrations of p3 (0–300 μm) while holding ATP constant (10 μm). Alternatively, ATP concentrations were varied (0–20 μm) while keeping p3 constant (150 μm). The amount of recombinant proteins added to individual assays and the time of incubation were varied to maintain substrate conversion within a linear range. Optimal concentration of MnCl2 was used in the activity assays for the determination of kinetic parameters. Kinase assay buffers containing 10 μm to 1 mm ADP or AMP were used to test the effect of ADP or AMP on substrate phosphorylation. For the determination of optimal temperature of substrate phosphorylation, reaction mixtures were incubated at 15–42 °C instead of 30 °C. The effect of pH on substrate phosphorylation activity was determined using 20 mm BisTris titrated to the desired pH with either HCl or KOH in place of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer. To generate the expression construct of PKS11T161D, PCR was carried out using two restriction sitesXbaI/SstI containing primers (5′-GCTCTAGAATGGTGGTAAGGAAGGTGGGCAAGTG-3′, forward,XbaI site underlined, and 5′-CGAGCTCTCAACGTCTTTTACTCTTGGCCTTGGTG-3′, reverse,SstI site underlined) on the PKS11T161D cDNA template. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel, digested, and cloned into the binary vector, pBIB, under control of the super promoter (14Narasimhulu S.B. Deng X. Sarria R. Gelvin S.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 873-886PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter is located upstream of thePKS11T161D coding region and causes expression in all tissues constitutively. The construct was introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation, and Arabidopsis transformation was performed according to the method described previously (15Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type PKS11coding sequence was similarly overexpressed in Arabidopsisunder control of the super promoter. After harvesting, the seeds were planted on MS agar medium containing 40 mg/liter hygromycin and 500 mg/liter vancomycin, and the transgenic lines were selected out. The transformed seedlings were transferred into soil to set seed under routine conditions. Seeds of wild-type and transgenic plants were surface-sterilized in 100% bleach for 10 min, followed by 5 washes in sterile distilled water. The seeds were embedded on MS agar plates and germinated and grown on the vertical plates at 22 °C, 300 PAR, 16-h light and 8-h dark photoperiod. Seed germination and seedling growth of the wild-type control plants, T2and T3 generation transgenic plants expressingPKS11T161D or PKS11 were tested for responses to various concentrations of ABA, salt, mannitol, and glucose treatments. To observe the effect of glucose on seed germination and seedling growth, transgenic and control lines were germinated and grown on MS plates containing 1–5% glucose, 0.1 to 0.5 mm2-deoxyglucose, or 1–5% 3-O-methylglucose. Seedlings were grown in the dark for 6 days, and hypocotyl length was measured from 20 seedlings at each glucose concentration in the control and transgenic plants. The values of apparent K m and maximal velocityV max for p3 and ATP were determined by at least triplicate measurements of initial velocity for different concentrations of p3 and ATP. Eadie-Hofstee regression was used to fit the data in a defined concentration range to a straight line, andK m and V max values were determined from the regression equation. In order to determine experimentally the open reading frame of PKS11gene, the cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. The deduced amino acid sequence of PKS11 was found to be identical to that in the database, which was obtained from computer-based annotation. As a first step toward functional analysis, the steady-state transcript level ofPKS11 gene in different tissues of mature plants as well as under various stresses was determined. Blots of total RNA from different tissues or from stress-treated young seedlings were hybridized to a specific DNA probe for PKS11. PKS11 was expressed in all tissues examined, but the expression level in roots was substantially higher than that in leaves, stems, flowers, or siliques of mature Arabidopsis plants (Fig. 1 A). Because of our interest in plant stress responses, potential regulation of thePKS gene by salt, cold, drought, and ABA was examined in young Arabidopsis seedlings (Fig. 1 B). No significant induction or repression of PKS11 was observed under any of the treatments. A promoter-glucuronidase reporter fusion was used to investigate further the tissue distribution of PKS11 expression. InArabidopsis seedlings, promoter-glucuronidase staining was readily detected in roots, but the staining in other tissues was very weak or below the detection limit (Fig.1 C). Like SOS2, the founding member of the PKS family, PKS11 also contains an N-terminal SNF1-like kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (Fig.2 A). An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of PKS11 with SOS2 showed that these kinases are highly conserved throughout the entire length (Fig.2 B). In the superfamily of protein kinases, the PKSes belong to SNF1/AMPK family (16Hanks S.K. Hunter T. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. Academic Press, London1995: 7-47Google Scholar). Like many other protein kinases including SOS2, PKS11 contains a putative “activation loop” or “activation segment” in the kinase catalytic domain, located between the conserved DFG and APE sequences (Fig. 2 B). The kinase also contains a conserved FISL motif, a stretch of 21 amino acid residues, located near the kinase domain (Fig. 2 B). The FISL motif in SOS2 has been identified recently as the SOS3-interacting sequence and is autoinhibitory to substrate phosphorylation (3Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). PKS11 contains an open reading frame of 1338 bp and is predicted to encode a protein of 446 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 50.4 kDa.PKS11 is located on chromosome 4, based on information in the Arabidopsis genomic sequence database (www.arabidopsis.org). We expressed PKS11 and a number of other PKS proteins in bacteria, and we found that none had any kinase activity against commonly used protein or peptide substrates (data not shown). In order to biochemically characterize the enzyme, we attempted to construct active forms of the kinase. Previously, we have found that aspartate substitution of Thr168 in the putative activation loop of SOS2 could activate the kinase (3Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A comparison of the putative activation loop of PKS11 and a number of other PKSes (data not shown) with that of SOS2 showed that the threonine residue is conserved (Fig.2 B). This suggests that the threonine residue in PKS11, Thr161, could be a target site for phosphorylation by a putative upstream activating kinase(s). To produce active PKS11 protein, we substituted the threonine residue with aspartate to partially mimic phosphorylation by an upstream kinase(s) using site-directed mutagenesis on the PKS11 cDNA. The resulting mutant, designated PKS11T161D, was produced by changing Thr161 to Asp (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the FISL motif in PKS11 may be autoinhibitory to the kinase activity. Therefore, a FISL motif deletion mutant, designated PKS11ΔF, was constructed by deleting the FISL motif between Lys304 and Leu325 (Fig.2 B) using site-directed mutagenesis. PKS11 wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Fig.3 A). The expression level of the recombinant PKS11 mutant proteins was similar to that of the wild-type counterpart, as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis. These purified GST-PKS11 fusion proteins showed the expected apparent molecular mass of about 80 kDa, with GST-PKS11ΔF slightly smaller. We have shown previously (8Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) that SOS2 can phosphorylate a peptide p3 in the presence of SOS3. We measured substrate phosphorylation of the peptide and autophosphorylation in vitro for the mutant and wild-type kinases in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ as a cofactor. The FISL motif deletion mutant, PKS11ΔF, displayed a 3-fold increase in substrate phosphorylation compared with the wild-type kinase (designated PKS11WT) (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the activation loop mutant, PKS11T161D, was extremely active, with 130-fold higher activity in p3 phosphorylation than PKS11WT (Fig.3 B). Both PKS11 mutants also had higher autophosphorylation activity than PKS11WT (Fig. 3 C). In addition to the threonine residue, a serine and a tyrosine residue within the activation loop are also completely conserved in all PKSes (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). We wanted to investigate whether changing the conserved serine or tyrosine to aspartate could also make the kinase constitutively active. We thus constructed PKS11S154D and PKS11Y173D, respectively, by mutating Ser154to Asp and Tyr173 to Asp, respectively, via site-directed mutagenesis. Kinase assays showed that PKS11S154D and PKS11Y173D exhibited 16- and 15-fold higher activity, respectively, in p3 phosphorylation than the wild-type kinase (Fig. 3 D). The most active mutant, PKS11T161D, was therefore used for subsequent biochemical and functional analysis. To determine the cofactor preference for divalent cations in vitro of PKS11T161D, we measured substrate phosphorylation activity in the presence of various concentrations of two divalent cations, Mg2+ and Mn2+. Divalent cations were absolutely required for substrate phosphorylation of p3 as well as autophosphorylation of the kinase, as shown by the lack of activity in the absence of the cations (Fig. 4 A). Substrate phosphorylation increased as the concentrations of Mn2+ or Mg2+ in the range of 0–2.5 mm(Mn2+) or 0–5.0 mm (Mg2+) increased. Interestingly, Mn2+ appeared to be a much more effective cofactor than Mg2+ for PKS11T161D. As low as 0.25 mm Mn2+ could activate substrate phosphorylation of PKS11T161D. Optimal activation was observed at around 2.5 mm Mn2+, and higher concentrations (>5 mm Mn2+) became inhibitory. In contrast, Mg2+ did not activate PKS11T161D at concentrations of less than 1 mm. Optimal activation was achieved at 5 mm or higher concentrations of Mg2+ (Fig.4 A). The intracellular concentration of Mn2+ is in the micromolar range, whereas that of Mg2+ is in the millimolar range (17White M.F. Kahn C.R. Enzymes. 1986; 17: 248-361Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these results suggest that Mn2+ could play a role in activity regulation of the PKS under physiological conditions. We tested whether PKS11T161D also preferred Mn2+ over Mg2+ as a cofactor for autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation was assayed in the presence of various concentrations of the two divalent cations. Mn2+ also strongly activated autophosphorylation of PKS11T161D even in the micromolar range (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, Mg2+only weakly activated the autophosphorylation, and the activation required millimolar concentrations of Mg2+. These results suggest that PKS11 is a novel protein kinase with an uncommon cofactor preference. With 2.5 mm Mn2+ as a cofactor in the kinase assay, PKS11T161D displayed even higher peptide phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C) as well as autophosphorylation activity (data not shown). The PKS family of proteins tested thus far does not show any kinase activity against commonly used protein substrates, such as myelin basic protein, histone H1, and casein. However, three synthetic peptide substrates (p1, p2, and p3), derived from the recognition sequences of protein kinase C or SNF1/AMPK, are known to be phosphorylated by SOS2 (8Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). These peptides were thus chosen to analyze the substrate specificity of PKS11T161D in the present study. The above results show that PKS11T161D can phosphorylate the peptide substrate p3.

Osterix, containing three zinc finger motifs, is another prerequisite transcription factor for osteoblastic differentiation, and its expression is also induced by BMP treatment in immature mesenchymal cell lines (16Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer P.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). In addition to the positive aspects of BMP actions on osteoblastic differentiation, this cytokine also up-regulates inhibitory systems for its own actions (16Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer P.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). First, BMP enhances expression of several soluble inhibitory molecules including noggin, follistatin, chordin, and gremlin, which inhibit BMP actions by binding to BMPs and blocking their binding to cognate receptors (17Narita T.

Development. 1999; 126: 5515-5522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, in the proximity of the BMP receptors or inside cytoplasm, the BMP signal is inhibited by inhibitory Smad proteins including Smad6 and Smad7, whose expression is enhanced by BMPs (21Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, downstream from the receptor complex, other types of proteins, like Tob, act to block Smad actions and to inhibit BMP activities in vivo and in vitro, and BMPs enhance Tob expression (22Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of the networks of the inhibitory activities against BMPs have not yet been fully understood. BMP actions are also under the influence of the signals triggered by the interaction between osteoblastic cells and extracellular matrix (23Jikko A. Harris S.E. Chen D. Mendrick D.L. Demsky C.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is known to activate a subset of integrin receptor signalings either through the tyrosine kinase pathway (24Takeuch Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (25Pasco S. Monboisse J.C. Kieffer N. J. Biol.

Enhancement of type I collagen production by ascorbate and simultaneous treatment with β-glycerophosphate activate mineralized nodule formation in osteoblast cultures via the involvement of BMPs. BMP actions in osteoblasts are thus regulated not only by the several soluble molecules but also by the extracellular matrix-induced signalings (23Jikko A. Harris S.E. Chen D. Mendrick D.L. Demsky C.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27Ross J.J. Shimmi O. Vilmos P. Petryk A. Kim H. Gaudenz K. Hermanson S. Ekker S.C. O'Connor M.B. Marsh J.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cas-interacting zinc finger protein (CIZ) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, localized at focal adhesion and in the nuclei. It was initially identified by far Western screening of a rat 3Y1 cDNA library using the Src homology 3 domain of Cas as a probe (28Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Sakai R. Ogawa S. Honda H. Ueno H. Hirano N. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CIZ contains a nuclear localization signal, 5–8 zinc fingers, and glutamine-alanine repeats, and it indeed acts as a transcription factor or a modulator via binding to consensus DNA elements, (G/C)AAAAA, present in the promoter regions of the genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases 1, 3, and 7. Therefore, CIZ has been suggested to have a role between cell attachment and related gene expression. In order to further understand the regulatory mechanisms of BMP actions in the osteoblastic cells, we examined the effect of CIZ overexpression on the BMP2-induced differentiation of osteoblastic cells. We found that CIZ overexpression blocked BMP2-induced expression of alkaline phosphatases (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN) as well as type I collagen. Furthermore, CIZ overexpression blocked BMP-induced expression of the Cbfa1 gene. Analysis of CIZ action on the transcriptional activity indicated that CIZ overexpression suppressed Smad-induced transcriptional activity independent of inhibitory Smad6. These observations indicate that CIZ is a novel inhibitory protein that modulates BMP2-induced differentiation of osteoblastic cells. MC3T3E1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics/antimyotics (100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air. Cell differentiation was induced by treatment with the indicated concentrations of recombinant human BMP2 in a standard growth medium. MC3T3E1 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in a 60-mm dish (Corning Glass). On the next day, either pSSRabsr expression vector containing FLAG-tagged full-length CIZ cDNA (28Nakamoto T.

After 5 days, the cultures were treated with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen). The surviving (Geneticin-resistant) cells were cloned, and the clonal cells were further maintained in the presence of 500 μg/ml Geneticin in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and a mixture of antibiotics and antimyotics. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant human BMP2. The cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 10 mmTris-HCl containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.2. The cell lysates were briefly sonicated on ice after two cycles of freezing and thawing. Aliquots of supernatants were subjected to ALP activity measurement (29Debiais F. Hott M. Graulet A.M.

In brief, the lysate was mixed with assay buffer containing 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10, and 1 mm MgCl2, followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. After adding 1 m NaOH, the amounts ofp-nitrophenol liberated were measured by a spectrophotometer. Total cellular RNA was prepared according to the acid guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (28Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Sakai R. Ogawa S. Honda H. Ueno H. Hirano N. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 μg of the total RNA per lane were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gel containing 0.66 mformaldehyde and were transferred to GeneScreen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) filters by electroblotting and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Filters were prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in a buffer containing formaldehyde, 1% SDS, 20 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 1× Denhardt's solution. Complementary DNA probes for alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, type I collagen, Cbfa1, and CIZ mRNAs were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the BcaBEST random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 24 h in a buffer containing labeled cDNA probes. Filters were rinsed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Rinsed filters were then exposed to x-ray film using intensifying screens at −70 °C. The intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometric scanning, and the values were normalized against those of GAPDH bands. Probes on the filters were stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS. Cells were plated in a 60-mm dish at 1 × 104cells/cm2. Three days later, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 40 mm NaF and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). The cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with anti-CIZ antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the immunoprecipitates with high salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 40 mm NaF, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) three times and with lysis buffer once, the immunoprecipitates and aliquots of total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed subsequently with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The filters were treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the bands were visualized according to the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The cells (1 × 105 cells/well in six-well tissue culture plates) were transfected with various combinations of the following plasmids using the FuGene6 transfection reagent: 0.85 μg of reporter constructs (−1.8 kb to −8 bp Cbfa1/luciferase or −1.8 kb to +394 bp Cbfa1/luciferase or 12× GCCG/luciferase), Smads expression vector (0.2 μg), CIZ expression vector (0.4 μg), and pBS as a negative control. pGL3 control plasmid was used as a positive control. After 24 h of incubation, cell extracts were prepared using 0.25 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by two or three freezing/thawing cycles to accomplish complete lysis of the cells. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and used for the luciferase activity assay. Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay system (Promega) was used to measure luciferase activity, and the values were normalized against the efficiency of transfection using the same system. Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by AutoLumat (LB 953; EG & G). Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by the standard Bradford's method. Cells (5 × 104/cm2) were cultured for 33 days in α-minimal essential medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid) and were subjected to Alizarin Red staining (30Stanford C.M. Jacbson P.E. Eanes E.D. Lembke L.A. Midura R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9420-9428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 5 min in 10% formalin/saline. The cells were then incubated with Alizarin Red (0.1% in saline) solution for 3–7 min followed by several rinses with water. Statistical evaluations of the data were conducted by using Student's t test for per-comparison analysis. The data were presented as mean ± S.D. In order to examine the action of CIZ on osteoblastic cells, we established CIZ-overexpressing stable cell lines by cotransfection with neo resistance gene followed by selection with Geneticin (G418). These clonal cell lines (D8, D9, and D12) expressed 2.9-kb CIZ mRNA (Fig.1A) and CIZ protein (70 kDa) (Fig. 1A) at levels higher than those in control cell lines where an empty vector was transfected (E2 and E3) (Fig. 1A). GAPDH mRNA levels served as control (Fig. 1A). The exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged CIZ was also detected in immunoprecipitation experiments in clones D8, D9, and D12 but not in clones E2 and E3 (Fig. 1B). For the analysis of osteoblast phenotype-related gene expression, we treated the control cells (transfected with an empty vector, EV-MC3T3E1) or CIZ-overexpressing cells (transfected with a CIZ expression vector, CIZ-MC3T3E1) with BMP2. The cells were cultured for 3 days before initiation of the treatment. The basal ALP activity in untreated EV-MC3T3E1 and CIZ-MC3T3E1 cells was low. In control EV-MC3T3E1 clones (clones E2 and E3), BMP2 treatment enhanced the alkaline phosphatase activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). These BMP2 effects were observed at the doses over 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1D). In contrast, CIZ overexpression significantly suppressed BMP2 enhancement of ALP activity in both of the independent clonal cell lines (D8 and D9) at all of the time points examined (Fig. 1C) and at the doses over 100 ng/ml (Fig.1D). These inhibitory effects of CIZ overexpression on BMP action were similarly observed in the other CIZ-overexpressing clonal cell lines (data not shown). To examine the mode of CIZ action to suppress BMP2-induced ALP activity, we conducted Northern blot analyses using control (empty vector-transfected EV-E2) cells and CIZ-overexpressing cells (CIZ-D8). Treatment with BMP2 induced the expression of ALP mRNA in EV-MC3T3E1 cells on day 3, and the BMP2 effects on ALP mRNA expression were observed up to day 14 (Fig.2). In contrast, CIZ overexpression suppressed such BMP2-enhancement of alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression at all of the time points examined up to day 14 (Fig. 2). To ask whether CIZ overexpression also suppresses BMP2 effects on the expression of other genes encoding osteoblast phenotype-related proteins, OCN mRNA levels were examined. OCN mRNA expression was not detectable in the cells before treatment with BMP2 (Fig. 2), whereas treatment with BMP2 induced the expression of OCN on day 3 in EV-MC3T3E1 cells (Fig. 2). CIZ overexpression again suppressed such stimulatory effect of BMP2 on OCN mRNA expression at all of the time points examined (Fig. 2). The effects of BMP2 on ALP and OCN mRNAs were specific as shown by the GAPDH mRNA levels in the lower panel (Fig. 2). Type I collagen is the major product in osteoblasts. We previously reported an increase in the expression of type I collagen mRNA and the promoter activity in a CIZ-overexpressing MC3T3E1 cell pool selected as a batch in the absence of BMP2 treatment (31Furuya K. Nakamoto T Shen Z.J. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Hirai H. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we conducted a detailed time course study (3–14 days) on type I collagen expression in clonal CIZ-overexpressing MC3T3E1 cells in response to recombinant human BMP2 treatment. CIZ overexpression alone transiently enhanced the level of type I collagen expression on day 7 (Fig. 3A, lane 5 versus lane 7) similarly to our previous results (31Furuya K. Nakamoto T Shen Z.J. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Hirai H. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Treatment of EV-MC3T3E1 cells with BMP2 significantly enhanced type I collagen mRNA levels on day 3, and this effect was observed until day 14 (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 6, and 10). Strikingly, such strong BMP2 effects on type I collagen mRNA expression were totally blocked by CIZ overexpression at all of the time points examined (Fig.3A, lanes 4, 8, and 12). The basal levels of type I collagen expression in EV-MC3T3E1 cells were increased moderately on day 14 even in the absence of the exogenous addition of BMP2 into the cultures (Fig. 3, A (lane 9) and B). CIZ overexpression alone moderately suppressed spontaneous increase in type I collagen mRNA expression on day 14, possibly suggesting the presence of endogenous BMP2 actions during the long term cultures (Fig. 3, A (lane 9 versus lane 11) and B). We further examined whether CIZ overexpression regulates upstream molecular events that control the expression of the downstream osteoblastic phenotype-related genes (ALP, OCN, type-I collagen, and osteopontin). Cbfa1 has been implicated in the differentiation of osteoblastic cells as an upstream transcription factor, and mice null for this gene completely lack bone (13Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 32Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishmoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). BMP2 treatment enhanced Cbfa1 mRNA expression in the control EV-MC3T3E1 cells on day 3 (Fig. 4A, lane 2), and this BMP effect was observed until day 14 (Fig. 4A, lane 10). CIZ overexpression suppressed the BMP2-induced enhancement of Cbfa1 mRNA expression (Fig. 4, A(lanes 4, 8, and 12) and B). Interestingly, CIZ overexpression alone moderately enhanced the levels of Cbfa1 mRNA expression (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 7) in the absence of BMP2 treatment. We further investigated the mechanisms how CIZ overexpression interferes with BMP signaling events. As BMP signaling is mediated by Smad proteins, we examined the effect of CIZ on the transcriptional activity of Smads in osteoblastic cells. We used a luciferase reporter construct containing a BMP-specific Smad-binding element (12× GCCG) linked to the type X collagen promoter (−90 to +59 bp) (33Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). BMP2 treatment enhanced the transcriptional activity of this construct, whereas CIZ overexpression suppressed this BMP2-dependent activation of the luciferase activity (Fig. 5, lane 2 versus lane 4). For this Smad-binding element construct, CIZ alone did not enhance the basal activity of the luciferase activity (Fig. 5, lane 3). When Smad1 MH2 domain expression vector was cotransfected with the luciferase reporter gene, the luciferase activity was enhanced significantly (Fig. 5, lane 5). This Smad1 MH2-dependent enhancement was suppressed by CIZ overexpression (Fig. 5, lane 5 versus lane 7). BMP2 treatment further enhanced the Smad1 MH2-dependent enhancement of luciferase activity (Fig. 5, lane 6); however, CIZ overexpression suppressed such co-enhancement of luciferase activity by BMP2 and Smad1 MH2 domain (Fig. 5, lane 8). Overexpression of Smad6 suppressed the Smad1-induced luciferase activity as reported previously (34Krishnan P. King M.W. Neff A.W. Sandusky G.E. Bierman K.L. Grinnell B. Smith R.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 42: 115-132Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of BMP2 (Fig. 5, lane 5 versus lane 9 and lane 6 versus lane 10, respectively). CIZ overexpression in the presence of Smad6 expression vector further suppressed the Smad1-induced and Smad1/BMP2-induced luciferase activities both in the absence (Fig. 5, lane 9 versus lane 11) and the presence of BMP2 (Fig. 5, lane 10 versus lane 12), indicating that the inhibitory action of CIZ would be independent of the Smad6 activity. As BMP effects are mediated not only by Smad1 but also by Smad5, we also examined the effect of CIZ overexpression on Smad5 activity. For Smad5, we used a full-length Smad5 expression vector. Similar to the case in Smad1, overexpression of Smad5 enhanced luciferase activities in both the absence (Fig. 5, lane 13) and the presence of BMP2 (Fig. 5, lane 14). Such Smad5 activity was suppressed by CIZ overexpression in the absence and presence of BMP2 (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and 16). These data indicated that CIZ overexpression suppressed Smad element-dependent transactivation of gene expression. The CIZ effects were specific to the Smad response element reporter gene, since CIZ overexpression did not affect pGL3-control luciferase activities in the absence or the presence of BMP2 (Fig. 5, lanes 21–24). We asked whether the moderate enhancement of Cbfa1 mRNA levels by CIZ overexpression in the absence of BMP2 was due to CIZ action on the promoter region of Cbfa1 gene. Sequence analysis of the promoter region indicated the presence of 14 CIZ binding sites within a −1.8 kb/−8 bp fragment of the promoter (Fig.6A, top panel). Cbfa1 expression alone enhanced the luciferase activity of the reporter construct, which contains the −1.8 kb/−8 bp promoter fragment (Fig.6B, lane 3 versus lane 4). Another promoter construct (−1.8 kb/+394 bp) containing an additional 394-bp sequence (Fig. 6A, bottom panel) downstream to the transcriptional start site showed lower base-line activity of luciferase in the absence of CIZ overexpression (Fig. 6B, lane 5). CIZ overexpression, however, again enhanced the levels of luciferase activity of the longer constructs (Fig. 6B, lane 6). These effects of CIZ overexpression were specific to these promoters, since no response to CIZ was observed with the pGL3 construct (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 2). In order to examine the effects of CIZ on the authentic Cbfa1 promoter activity in the presence of BMP/Smad signaling, −1.8 kb/−8 bp Cbfa1 promoter luciferase construct was cotransfected with Smad5 expression vector. Smad5 overexpression enhanced the −1.8 kb/−8 bp promoter activity (Fig. 6C, lane 5) compared with the basal activity (Fig. 6C, lane 4). CIZ overexpression alone also enhanced the 1.8-kb promoter activity of Cbfa1 (Fig. 6C, lane 8). However, combination of the two together (i.e. Smad5 and CIZ coexpression) suppressed the promoter activity (Fig. 6C, lane 9), and the final levels were lower than the base line (Fig.6C, lane 4). Combination of BMP2 and CIZ together reversed the CIZ activation of the luciferase activity driven by the authentic promoter both in the absence or the presence of Smad5 (Fig.6C, lanes 10 and 11). As known previously, BMP2 treatment per se (Fig. 6C, lane 6) or the co-treatment with BMP2 and Smad5 together (Fig. 6C, lane 7) did not alter the promoter luciferase activity in this 1.8-kb construct (Fig. 6C, lane 6), suggesting that an as yet unidentified region(s) other than the 1.8-kb region in addition to the 1.8-kb region is simultaneously required for the BMP action and/or interaction between BMP2 and Smad5. Thus, the 1.8-kb region at least in part mediates CIZ suppression in the presence of Smad5 and BMP2. To address whether CIZ can block osteoblastic function to form mineralized nodulesin vitro, the cultures of the cells overexpressing CIZ or control cells were subjected to treatment with ascorbic acid and β-glycerol phosphate for 33 days. In control cultures of the cells transfected with an empty vector alone or mother cell line MC3T3E1, numerous nodules positive for Alizarin Red were formed (Fig.7, top panels). In contrast, CIZ overexpression completely blocked nodule formation in these cultures (Fig. 7, bottom panels). Finally, we examined whether BMP2 per seregulates CIZ expression in MC3T3E1 osteoblastic cells. In the presence of vehicle alone, the levels of CIZ mRNA expression declined on day 7 and day 14 (Fig. 8A, lanes 3 and 5) compared with the levels on day 3 (Fig. 8A, lane 1). In the presence of BMP2, the levels of CIZ mRNA expression were maintained at similar levels at all of the time points (Fig. 8A, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Consistent with the maintenance of the high levels of CIZ mRNA expression in the presence of BMP2 in cultures, the levels of CIZ protein expression were also maintained at similar levels (Fig. 8B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). In contrast, there was a clear decline in the levels of CIZ protein expression in the cells without BMP2 treatment on days 7 and 14 (Fig. 8B, lanes 3 and 5) compared with the levels on day 3 (Fig. 8B, lane 1). In this study, we provided evidence that overexpression of CIZ suppressed BMP2-induced enhancement of the expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes encoding ALP, OCN, and type I collagen. CIZ overexpression also suppressed BMP2-induced expression of Cbfa1 mRNA, which is indispensable for osteoblastic differentiation and acts upstream of the other phenotype-related genes. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms of such CIZ actions to suppress BMP2-induced activation of osteoblastic differentiation indicated that CIZ blocked Smad-mediated transcriptional events that take place upon BMP treatment. In addition, CIZ overexpression blocked the formation of mineralized nodules in MC3T3E1 cell cultures. These data indicate that CIZ is one of the suppressive regulators of BMP signaling cascade in osteoblastic differentiation. BMP signaling is counterbalanced by several inhibitory systems. Negative modulations of BMP signaling could occur in the nuclei, in the cytoplasm, and at the cytoplasmic component of the membrane via the inhibitory Smads. Smad6 activity is more specific to inhibit BMP signaling, whereas Smad7 similarly blocks both transforming growth factor-β/activin and BMP signaling (21Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad proteins are highly conserved in their MH1 and MH2 domains, whereas the connecting proline-rich linker region is divergent (36Wu J.W. Hu M. Chai J. Seoane J. Huse M. Li C. Rigotti D.J. Kyin S. Muir T.W. Fairman R. Massague J. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1277-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 37Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Payletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain has effector functions, whereas the MH1 domain interferes with effector functions of MH2 domain and exhibits DNA binding properties (38Heldin C. Miyazono K. Dijke P.ten. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 39Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that CIZ not only inhibited the full-length Smad5-mediated BMP signaling but can also inhibit the Smad1 MH2 domain-mediated signaling (Fig. 5), it is possible that the inhibitory action of CIZ could be at the levels prior to the DNA binding of the R-Smads. Although BMPs are potent factors that promote osteoblastic differentiation (40Wozney J.M. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the molecular events downstream of BMP signaling that positively regulate tissue-specific gene expression have not been fully understood. Previous investigations have been directed to elucidate factors that are involved in BMP-regulated osteoblast differentiation (41Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 42Kearns A.E. Donohue M.M. Sanyal B. Demay M.P. J. Biol.

First, BMPs play a critical role in the induction of positive regulators that promote differentiation, such as Cbfa1 (14Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar), Dlx5 (44Miyama K. Yamada G. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Miyado K. Sakai M. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Dev.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46515-46522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). BMPs also induce expression of negative transcriptional regulators including Id (12Ogata T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42213-42218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cbfa1 expression is necessary for osteoblast differentiation, whereas cooperation and/or interaction with other genes, such as osterix, would be required for osteoblastic differentiation under the control of BMP signaling (16Nakashima K.

Second, BMPs have also been shown to induce the expression of follistatin and noggin (17Narita T. Saitoh K. Kameda T. Kuroiwa A. Mizutani M. Koike C. Iba H. Yasugi S. Development. 2000; 127: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar, 18Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1999; 14: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), both of which are BMP-binding proteins that suppress the actions of BMPs. A third level at which BMPs modulate osteoblastic differentiation is exemplified by the induction of inhibitory Smads or Tob (22Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Tob negatively regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by interacting with R-Smads (22Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our observations on CIZ function add a novel mechanism of osteoblastic differentiation by which it modulates BMP2 activity, since CIZ does not belong to any of these previously reported groups of proteins that regulate osteoblastic differentiation. Although CIZ overexpression enhanced the promoter activity of the Cbfa1 gene in the absence of BMP2, it suppressed the promoter activity in the presence of BMP2. The luciferase assay using R-Smad binding elements indicated that CIZ overexpression suppressed the Smad activity as well as BMP2 actions on the transcription through these Smad-binding elements. Thus, the balance between the positive and the negative actions of CIZ would determine the levels of osteoblastic differentiation. BMP forms a negative feedback system as exemplified by the activations of the noggin gene (17Narita T. Saitoh K. Kameda T. Kuroiwa A. Mizutani M. Koike C. Iba H. Yasugi S. Development. 2000; 127: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar) as well as Smad6 gene expression (21Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, BMP2 treatment maintained CIZ expression levels that otherwise decline without BMP2 treatment, suggesting the presence of a novel negative feedback system utilizing the CIZ actions. Previously, an increase in the expression of type I collagen mRNA and the promoter activity was observed in a CIZ-overexpressing MC3T3E1 cell pool selected as a batch in the absence of BMP2 treatment (31Furuya K. Nakamoto T Shen Z.J. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Hirai H. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 5 versus lane 7), CIZ overexpression alone transiently enhanced the level of type I collagen expression on day 7 similarly to our previous observations (31Furuya K. Nakamoto T Shen Z.J. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Hirai H. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On day 14, the basal levels of type I collagen expression in EV-MC3T3E1 cells were increased moderately even in the absence of the exogenous addition of BMP2 into the cultures (Fig. 3, A (lane 9) and B), and CIZ overexpression alone moderately suppressed a spontaneous increase in type I collagen mRNA expression. This could imply the presence of endogenous BMP2 activity, which may accumulate in the cases of the longer term cultures. Thus, the actions of CIZ could be influenced by the co-existence of BMP depending on the time points of the cultures. In conclusion, our observations demonstrate that CIZ suppresses osteoblastic cell differentiation through interference with the BMP/Smad signaling pathway. Thus, CIZ would act as a critical modulator for BMP signaling in osteoblastic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2004894413,"A major goal in protein engineering is the tailor-making of enzymes for specified chemical reactions. Successful attempts have frequently been based on directed molecular evolution involving libraries of random mutants in which variants with desired properties were identified. For the engineering of enzymes with novel functions, it would be of great value if the necessary changes of the active site could be predicted and implemented. Such attempts based on the comparison of similar structures with different substrate selectivities have previously met with limited success. However, the present work shows that the knowledge-based redesign restricted to substrate-binding residues in human glutathione transferase A2-2 can introduce high steroid double-bond isomerase activity into the enzyme originally characterized by glutathione peroxidase activity. Both the catalytic center activity (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) match the values of the naturally evolved glutathione transferase A3-3, the most active steroid isomerase known in human tissues. The substrate selectivity of the mutated glutathione transferase was changed 7000-fold by five point mutations. This example demonstrates the functional plasticity of the glutathione transferase scaffold as well as the potential of rational active-site directed mutagenesis as a complement to DNA shuffling and other stochastic methods for the redesign of proteins with novel functions. A major goal in protein engineering is the tailor-making of enzymes for specified chemical reactions. Successful attempts have frequently been based on directed molecular evolution involving libraries of random mutants in which variants with desired properties were identified.

Accepting the view that only a finite number (a few thousand) of protein folds exist (1Thornton J.M. Orengo C.A. Todd A.E. Pearl F.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Wolf Y.I. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we conclude that the vast majority of the naturally occurring proteins have evolved by recruitment and redesign of existing structural modules. For the engineering of a new enzyme, it would consequently be feasible to select a suitable polypeptide scaffold and then insert new building blocks in the form of essential amino acid residues, secondary structure elements, or even new domains. Given that the fold is maintained, the question is whether it is sufficient to build the active-site cavity with the limited number of residues contacting the substrate or whether additional more remote residues have to be included in the design (Fig. 1). In the first alternative, it would appear possible to make a rational design based on the computational algorithms optimizing the choice of functional groups, active-site topography, various anisotropic parameters representing charge density, and hydrophobicity among other variables. For the second alternative, it is not obvious that the design is computationally tractable on the basis of available knowledge. Despite numerous investigations, it is still not clear to what extent it is possible to rationally change the substrate specificity and obtain an enzyme with high activity by mutating amino acid residues that determine substrate selectivity in the active site (4Penning T.M. Jez J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3027-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, aspartate transaminase was made more efficient with the cationic amino acids Lys and Arg than with its natural anionic substrates but at the expense of a dramatic loss of catalytic efficiency (5Cronin C.N. Malcolm B.A. Kirsch J.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2222-2223Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rational modifications of active-site residues in a phosphotriesterase elevated the activity (kcat) with the alternative substrate diisopropylfluorophosphate up to 10-fold, but the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was not increased >2-fold because of increased Km values in all mutants (6Watkins L.M. Mahoney H.J. McCulloch J.K. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25596-25601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several attempts at redesigning enzymes suggest that the mutations distant from the active site may be necessary complements to obvious active-site modifications (4Penning T.M. Jez J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3027-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Oue S. Okamoto A. Yano T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2344-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The conversion of trypsin into a mutant with chymotrypsin-like activity required surface loops to be modified in addition to the substrate specificity pocket to approach the catalytic properties of the naturally evolved chymotrypsin (8Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Major efforts are currently focused on computational approaches to the tailoring of proteins for new functions (9Voigt C.A. Mayo S.L. Arnold F.H. Wang Z.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3778-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Bolon D.N. Mayo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The molecular recognition of the substrate and the complementary binding of transition states may involve contacts with ≤10–15 active-site residues (Fig. 1) that govern substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Successful examples of redesign by rational modification of active-site residues leaving the remainder of the protein scaffold intact will be consequential to protein engineering and clarify options in the natural evolution of enzyme function. Tailor-making enzymes for novel functions is largely based on directed molecular evolution of parental structures (13Arnold F.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 14Minshull J. Stemmer W.P.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The redesign would be more powerful if necessary active-site modifications could be predicted and implemented. We tested the feasibility of rational redesign based on homology by exchanging active-site residues in glutathione transferase (GST)1 A2-2 to install the high 3-ketosteroid isomerase activity of the homologous GST A3-3. Five amino acid substitutions afforded a 3500-fold increase in catalytic efficiency with Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione (AD). The substrate selectivity of GST A2-2 changed 7000-fold from cumene hydroperoxide to AD, demonstrating functional plasticity and a notable switch from peroxidase into steroid isomerase activity. PCR with the proof-reading Pfu DNA polymerase and mutagenic oligonucleotides introduced the point mutations in the GSTA2 cDNA sequence in pGEM (Promega Co., Madison, WI). All of the nucleotide sequences were confirmed subsequent to PCR. For protein expression, wild-type and mutant GST cDNA were subcloned into the pET-21 vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). Expression and purification of wild-type GSTs A2-2, A3-3, and mutants were made as described previously (15Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Gustafsson A. Mannervik B. J. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16648-16654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using a HiTrap SP cation exchange column (AmershamBiosciences). The activity with AD was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 (15Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the activities with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and cumene hydroperoxide were assayed in 100 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.5 (18Mannervik B.

Specific activities with cumene hydroperoxide were determined in the presence of 2 mm glutathione (GSH) to approach saturation. All of the measurements were made at 30 °C. The ionization of the thiol group of GSH was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the thiolate at 239 nm (Δε239 = 5200 m−1cm−1 (19Gustafsson A. Etahadieh M. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16268-16275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) as a function of pH. The spectra of GSH bound to enzyme were obtained by subtracting the spectra of free GSH at different pH values and of free enzyme at pH 5.8 from the spectrum of the sample. The enzyme (subunit) and GSH concentrations were 15 and 500 μm, respectively. The pKa value of Tyr-9 in the absence of GSH was determined by subtracting the spectrum at pH 5.5 from the spectra obtained at higher pH values and calculated from the absorbance of the tyrosinate at 253 nm (Δε253= 11000 m−1 cm−1 (19Gustafsson A. Etahadieh M. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16268-16275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). The buffers were 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8–7.9, and ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.2–9.6. To test a redesign restricted to active-site residues, we decided to attempt the conversion of human GST A2-2 with non-selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity into a variant GST with steroid double bound isomerase activity. Wild-type A2-2 is the human GST with the highest peroxidase activity (20Zhao T. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but as a steroid isomerase, it is a very poor catalyst in comparison with the homologous human GST A3-3 (Table I). The GST-catalyzed isomerization of AD involves acid-base catalysis promoted by Tyr-9 with the thiolate of glutathione serving as a catalytic cofactor (15Pettersson P.L. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11698-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the peroxidase reaction, the same thiolate assisted by Tyr-9 makes a nucleophilic attack on oxygen in the hydroperoxide substrate. The reduction of the hydroperoxide proceeds in two steps via an unstable glutathione sulfenic acid conjugate and leads to the formation of glutathione disulfide (Fig. 2). The catalytic residues are common to the homologous Alpha class GSTs, but still the catalytic efficiency of GST A3-3 with AD is 5000-fold higher than that of GST A2-2 (Table II). The protein sequences of 221 residues are 89% identical, and of the 25 variant amino acids, five (Fig. 1) are located in the binding site of the hydrophobic substrate (H-site). Apparently, the limited structural differences between GST A2-2 and GST A3-3 govern the differential utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the glutathione sulfur atom.Table ISpecific activities with the substrates AD, CDNB and CuOOH for wild-type human GST A2–2, GST A3–3, and GST A2–2 mutantsGSTTerminologySpecific activities (μmol/min−1/mg−1)ADCDNBCuOOHA2–2, wild-typeA2–20.155821A2–2/S10F/I12GN-Double530NDA2–2/M208A/S216AC-Double337NDA2–2/S10F/I12G/M208A/S216AQuad1058NDA2–2/F111LF111L36023A2–2/S10F/I12G/F111LN-Triple23755.1A2–2/F111L/M208A/S216AC-Triple38276.2A2–2/S10F/I12G/F111L/M208A/S216APenta230643.6A2–2/S10F/112G/D42G/F111L/M208/S216AHexa22073NDA3–3, wild-typeA3–3360303.7 Open table in a new tab Table IICatalytic constants kcat and specificity constants kcat/Km for wild-type human GST A2–2, GST A3–3, and GST A2–2 mutants with the substrates AD and CuOOH.GSTADCuOOHkcatkcat/Kmkcatkcat/Kms−1mM−1s−1s−1mM−1s−1A2–20.28 ± 0.021.0 ± 0.133 ± 329 ± 0.3F111L6 ± 111 ± 134 ± 839 ± 2N-triple34 ± 2140 ± 1010 ± 125 ± 1C-triple44 ± 2300 ± 1728 ± 2011.6 ± 0.1Penta195 ± 113500 ± 4506.0 ± 0.514.6 ± 0.6A3–3228 ± 95000 ± 3505.9 ± 0.79.9 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab The five variant H-site residues in GST A2-2 were mutated into the residues of GST A3-3 with the goal of installing increased steroid isomerase activity. The mutations were introduced sequentially and in different combinations, and the highest activity was obtained when all of the five amino acid substitutions were present in GST A2-2 mutant Penta (Table I). The H-site is formed by three regions of the primary structure: the α1-β1 loop (residues 9–15), the C-terminal portion of α4 (residues 104–111), and α9 with flanking amino acids (residues 208–222). Table I shows that all of the three regions contribute to the steroid isomerase activity. A sixth residue distinguishing GST A2-2 from GST A3-3 (Asp-42 into Gly) is located in helix α2 in which Pi class GSTs have been shown to be highly mobile and linked to catalysis (21Stella L., Di Iorio E.E. Nicotra M. Ricci G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Hitchens T.K. Mannervik B. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11660-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, this residue is not part of the H-site, and the mutation of Asp-42 to give GST A2-2 mutant Hexa did not add to the isomerase activity (Table I). The mutation of a seventh variant residue, S18P, did not markedly alter the specific activity with any of the substrates used (AD, 0.09 μmol min−1mg−1; 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 38 μmol min−1mg−1). Residue 18 is located in helix α1 leading away from the active site, and Pro is potentially a helix breaker. The gain of isomerase activity afforded in the GST A2-2 mutants is primarily akcat effect (Fig.3). The Km values are only moderately changed. It is noteworthy that the mutations did not markedly alter the kinetic parameters for the standard GST substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (cf. Table I). Furthermore, the high glutathione peroxidase activity of wild-type GST A2-2 was only moderately decreased by the mutations (Table II). Thus, the main result of the mutagenesis was a highly selective installment of a 3500-fold increased catalytic efficiency in the steroid isomerase reaction. Expressed in terms of relative substrate specificity (ratio betweenkcat/Km values), mutant Penta has acquired enhanced substrate selectivity for steroid isomerization over hydroperoxide reduction by a factor of 7000-fold. GST A3-3 is characterized by an active-site Tyr-9 of unusual acidity (pKa 7.9). The significantly lower acidity of the corresponding Tyr-9 in GST A2-2 (pKa 9.2) is increased in mutant Penta (pKa 8.2) approaching that of GST A3-3. Thus, a low pKa value of the phenolic group is reflected in an enhanced catalytic activity in the steroid isomerization. In contrast, no such correlation is apparent with the other substrates tested (Table I). The pKa value of the thiol group of enzyme-bound glutathione is also low compared with the value for glutathione in aqueous solution (pKa9.2). However, in this case, the differences among GST A2-2 (pKa 6.8), GST A3-3 (pKa 6.1), and the mutant Penta (pKa 6.2) are less pronounced. It is noteworthy that the H-site mutations of uncharged residues distant from the ionizable groups of Tyr-9 and glutathione significantly increase their acidities and selectively enhance the isomerization activity. The isomerization of the Δ5- to the Δ4-keto steroid involves an intermediate dienolate with an extended planar π-orbital system (23Thornburg L.D. Goldfeder Y.R. Wilde T.C. Pollack R.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9912-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The stabilization of this planar structure relative to the puckered conformation of the substrate AD is expected to provide transition state stabilization in the catalyzed reaction. The 3500-fold increasedkcat/Km value in mutant Penta compared with wild-type GST A2-2 corresponds to an incremental stabilization of the transition state (ΔΔG =R T ln3500, where G is the Gibbs-free energy, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ln is natural logarithm) of 21 kJ/mol. On the basis of the homologous GST A1-1 structure (Fig. 1) (3Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L.

Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), we conclude that the H-site residue 111 is in a sterically critical position for this transition state stabilization to occur. In the low activity enzyme GST A2-2, this residue is Phe, whereas in GST A3-3, the residue is Leu (Table III). Apparently, the bulky and conformationally restricted benzyl group of Phe-111 in GST A2-2 is unfavorable for catalytically productive interactions with the steroid structure. However, for maximal catalytic efficiency, the H-site has to be further adjusted by mutations in addition to F111L (Tables I and II). This finding is in accord with the notion that the fine tuning of substrate-enzyme interactions is critical for optimized catalytic efficiency (25Koshland D.E., Jr. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1112-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Table IIIActive-site residues and catalytic efficiencies with AD distinguishing human GST A1–1, GST A2–2, and GST A3–3GST (wild-type)Amino acid positionCatalytic efficiency1012111208216kcat/KmmM−1 s−1A2–2SerIlePheMetSer1.0 ± 0.1A1–1PheAlaValMetAla500 ± 403-aFrom Ref. 12.A3–3PheGlyLeuAlaAla5000 ± 3503-a From Ref. 12Looger L.L.

Open table in a new tab GST A1-1, which has a catalytic efficiency with AD in between that of GST A2-2 and GST A3-3, is more similar in the H-site to the most efficient GST A3-3 (Table III). Residue 111 in GST A1-1 is Val, similar to Leu in GST A3-3. In addition, residue 10 is Phe in both GST A1-1 and GST A3-3. In total, two of the variant H-site residues, GST A1-1 and GST A3-3, are identical. The most conspicuous difference is residue 208, Ala in GST A3-3, and the more bulky Met in GST A1-1. Thus, the H-site residues in GST A1-1 afford a topology for interacting with AD, which appears only moderately different from that of GST A3-3 that is reflected in the small difference in transition state stabilization of 6 kJ/mol (ΔΔG = R T ln10). It has been proposed that the chemistry of the catalyzed reaction is a fundamental determinant in the evolution of enzymes with new activities (26Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30591-30594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 27Teichmann S.A. Rison S.C.G. Thornton J.M. Riley M. Gough J. Chothia C. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 482-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The glutathione peroxidase activity of GSTs is based on nucleophilic attack of the thiolate of enzyme-bound glutathione, and the steroid isomerization involves the same thiolate acting as a base. The common denominator is the negatively charged sulfur atom serving as a Lewis base, in one case reacting with a Lewis acid in the form of electrophilic oxygen of the hydroperoxide and in the second case reacting with an acidic C4 proton (pKa 13) of the Δ5-3-ketosteroid. Despite mechanistic commonalities, a major difference is still that the redox reaction involves the consumption of glutathione as a reducing substrate, whereas the isomerization does not spend glutathione but adopts the thiol as a catalytic cofactor in the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 2). The present investigation shows that active sites can be designed in preexisting protein scaffolds by a rational selection of amino acid residues that contribute to first-sphere interactions with the desired substrate (Fig. 1). Mutant Penta of GST A2-2 has acquired not only the highkcat (195 s−1) and kcat/Km (3.5 × 106m−1s−1) values characterizing AD as a substrate for the naturally evolved GST A3-3 but also exceeds by two orders of magnitude the Y catalytic efficiency of the 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5→4 isomerase traditionally regarded as the enzyme-catalyzing double-bond isomerization in steroid hormone biosynthesis (28Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The acquisition of efficient steroid double-bond isomerase activity by a small number of mutations in the detoxication enzyme GST A2-2 adds to the notion of GSTs as a family of enzymes with great functional plasticity (29Nilsson L.O.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Itk, another Btk family member, is required for CD3-induced actin polymerization in Jurkat cells (11Woods M.L. Kivens W.J. Adelsman M.A. Qiu Y. August A. Shimizu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1232-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is reported that Btk family kinases may interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Vav and may act upstream of Rho GTPases (12Guinamard R. Fougereau M. Seckinger P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1997; 45: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these kinases exert their effects on cytoskeletal reorganization are not yet understood. The structures of small GTP-binding proteins revealed that they have two interconvertible forms, GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active (6Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5165) Google Scholar, 13Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Most small GTP-binding proteins are localized either in the cytosol or on membranes. In the cytosol, the small proteins are complexed with the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) and maintained in the GDP-bound inactive form. The GDP-bound form is first released from a GDI by a still unknown mechanism and is converted to the GTP-bound form with the aid of the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. The activated Rho proteins interact with cellular target proteins or effectors to trigger a wide variety of cellular responses, including the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in gene transcription (14Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the GTP-bound form is converted to the GDP-bound form by its intrinsic GTPase activity and GTPase activating proteins. The GDP-bound form then binds to a GDI and returns to the cytosol. It has been reported that GTP-RhoA binds to and activates Rho-kinase, resulting in elevated myosin light chain phosphorylation (15Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). Lang et al. (16Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) reported that membrane-bound RhoA is the only target for protein kinase A and that cytosolic RhoA might be protected from protein kinase A phosphorylation by its binding to GDI. In the present study, we explore the role of the Etk in the regulation of small GTPase RhoA signaling. Our data suggest that Etk acts upstream of RhoA and activates RhoA in a kinase activity-independent manner by releasing GDI from the RhoA-GDI complex through the interaction between the PH domain of Etk and RhoA. 293, COS-1, HeLa, MDCK, and C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. T7-tagged Etk and its mutants were cloned into pcDNA3 vector as described previously (1Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). HA-tagged Rho family constructs were kindly provided by Drs. Xiang-Dong Ren and Martin Schwartz (17Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Anti-T7 antibody was purchased from Novagen. Anti-HA antibody was from Babco. Anti-RhoA and anti-Myc (9E10) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal Etk antibody was developed as described previously (1Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed in the buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and antibodies were added to lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were collected with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads, and protein complexes were washed three times at 4 °C with the lysis buffer. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (1Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for the visualization of actin stress fibers. For RhoA and Etk staining, cells were incubated with anti-RhoA, -Etk, or -HA antibody followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit. Slides were examined with a confocal microscope. In some cases, transfected cells were identified by co-transfected GFP marker. RhoA activity was assayed as described previously (8Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). GST-C21 was purified from Escherichia coli transformed with pGEX-2T-Rhotekin Rho binding domain (RBD) (kindly provided by Dr. John Collard). Bacteria were harvested in bacterial lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmNa2S2O3·5H2O, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% sucrose, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors and were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min), GST-C21 was collected by rocking at 4 °C for 45 min with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and resuspended in fresh buffer. 24 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 100 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by brief centrifugation and then incubated with Sepharose-bound GST-C21 at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed three times in cold lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were immunoblotted with anti-HA monoclonal antibody as described above. The precipitated RhoA was normalized to the RhoA present in total cell lysate. GST-RhoA fusion protein was expressed and purified as described above. T7-tagged wild-type and mutant Etk were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-T7 antibody, mixed with 100 ng of GST-RhoA, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in lysis buffer with rotation. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-RhoA antibody. We reported previously that Etk is translocated to the plasma membrane upon extracellular matrix protein stimulation (3Chen R. Kim O., Li, M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Rho proteins also have been shown to move from cytosol to membranes upon activation (18Kranenburg O. Poland M. Gebbink M. Oomen L. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 20Boivin D. Beliveau R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F180-F189PubMed Google Scholar). To look for the possible links between these two events, we examined the localization of Etk and RhoA in C2C12 cells in which both proteins are quite abundant. As shown in Fig. 1A, in the absence of serum both Etk and RhoA were primarily distributed in the perinuclear compartments. Upon serum stimulation, significant fractions of RhoA and Etk were translocated to the membrane. Moreover, they appeared to be colocalized with each other on the membrane as evidenced by the extensive yellow color when the RhoA and Etk images were merged. In contrast, minimal staining was observed on the membrane in the absence of serum. These observations suggest that Etk and RhoA are translocated and colocalized to membrane upon serum stimulation. This raises the possibility that Etk may be physically associated with RhoA, which is supported by the following co-precipitation experiments (Fig.1B). A protein of ∼84 kDa immunoprecipitated with anti-RhoA antibody was recognized by the Etk antibody, suggesting that endogenous RhoA and Etk might form a complex in the presence of serum. To confirm this result, we also co-expressed various HA-tagged Rho GTPases with Etk in COS-1 cells. Fig. 1C shows that all three forms of RhoA were co-precipitated with Etk, regardless of its GTP/GDP binding status. This result was further confirmed by in vitro binding assays using nucleotide-depleted, GTP- or GDP-loaded purified GST-RhoA fusion proteins (Fig. 1D). Because the other related small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, did not show appreciable interaction with Etk, the interaction between Etk and RhoA appears to be quite specific. To determine the Etk sequence required for its interaction with RhoA, we expressed HA-tagged RhoA with wild-type Etk or various Etk deletion mutants (ΔPH, ΔSH3, ΔSH2, and ΔKin). Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Etk and followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. In Fig.2A, RhoA was co-precipitated with wild-type Etk, ΔSH3, ΔSH2, and ΔKin but not with the ΔPH mutant. Furthermore, the PH domain of Etk alone was sufficient to immunoprecipitate RhoA, but the SH2 or SH3 domains alone were not (Fig.2B). The same results were obtained from the in vitro binding assay. We mixed immunoprecipitated wild-type Etk or its mutants with purified GST-RhoA fusion protein. The bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-RhoA antibody. Fig. 2C shows that wild-type Etk, EtkΔSH3, and EtkΔSH2 bound to the GST-RhoA protein, but EtkΔPH did not. These results indicate that the PH domain of Etk is required for its association with RhoA. To examine whether the interaction between Etk and RhoA effects RhoA activity, HA-tagged wild-type RhoA was co-transfected into COS-1 cells with T7-tagged Etk or its mutants. The active GTP-RhoA was then isolated from cell lysates by a GST pull-down assay using the fusion protein containing the binding domains of rhotekin (GST-C21) (8Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3A, co-expression of Etk with wild-type RhoA resulted in significant increases of GTP-bound RhoA. The kinase activity of Etk was dispensable for this effect because kinase-inactive Etk (EtkKQ) enhanced GTP-bound RhoA formation to similar levels as the wild-type Etk. Consistent with the co-precipitation data, deletion of the PH domain of Etk significantly reduced the level of GTP-RhoA in the cells, whereas deletion of the SH3 domain had little effect. This suggests that the PH domain of Etk is required for RhoA activation. Next, we examined the effect of Etk and its mutants on the formation of stress fibers, one of the phenotypic changes resulting from RhoA activation. Wild-type RhoA and GFP were co-transfected with Etk or its mutants into HeLa cells. The cells then were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin. There was a marked increase in actin stress fiber formation in the cells transfected with Etk or its mutant lacking the SH3 domain EtkΔSH3 but not with the PH deletion mutant (EtkΔPH) (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the Etk PH domain is required for the formation of actin stress fiber resulting from activation of RhoA by Etk. We also examined the effect of Etk on RhoA-mediated transcriptional activity of the promoter containing the serum responsive element (SRE-L) (21Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In agreement with its effects on stress fiber formation, overexpression of Etk in MDCK cells resulted in more than a 2-fold increase of RhoA-mediated transcriptional activity of SRE-L containing promoter, whereas EtkΔPH had very little effect (Fig. 3C). It has been shown that Rho-GDI negatively regulates RhoA activity by sequestering RhoA from its GEFs such as Dbl and Vav (14Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 22Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 23Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We reasoned that Etk might activate RhoA by disrupting the RhoA/Rho-GDI complex by interacting with RhoA through its PH domain. To test this possibility, HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged wild-type RhoA, Myc-tagged Rho-GDI, and T7-tagged Etk or Etk PH domain. The level of the RhoA/Rho-GDI complex in these cells was determined by the amount of Myc-tagged Rho-GDI co-immunoprecipitated with the HA-tagged RhoA. Fig. 4A shows that Myc-tagged Rho-GDI was effectively co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged RhoA, whereas the co-expression of wild-type Etk or Etk PH domain dramatically reduced the amount of Rho-GDI associated with RhoA without affecting the expression level of these proteins. These data suggest that the association of RhoA with Rho-GDI is disrupted by the Etk through its PH domain. Furthermore, we examined the effect of Etk on the subcellular location of RhoA in HeLa cells. As can be seen in Fig.4B, when HA-tagged RhoA and Myc-tagged Rho-GDI were co-transfected with a vector control, the majority of RhoA was found in the cytosol, and very little was detected on the plasma membrane because of the inhibition by Rho-GDI. However, in the presence of Etk, the Rho-GDI effect was reduced dramatically, and a significant fraction of RhoA was translocated to the membrane. Consistent with the above experiments described in this study, the PH domain of Etk was essential for its inhibition of GDI because Etk mutant lacking the PH domain (EtkΔPH) could no longer promote RhoA translocation. These observations provide evidence that Etk activates RhoA by disrupting the Rho-GDI interaction and promoting the translocation of RhoA to the membrane where it is converted to the GTP-RhoA by GEFs. Small Rho GTPases function as GDP/GTP-regulated signaling relay switches and play important roles in cytoskeletal reorganization in response to diverse extracellular stimuli. Although many modulators and effectors of Rho GTPases have been identified in the past decade, only a handful of them seem to be selective or specific for a single small Rho GTPase (e.g. Rac-specific GEF Tiam1 and Cdc42-specific GEF Intersectin). In this report, we provided evidence that the PH domain-containing tyrosine kinase Etk is a selective upstream regulator for RhoA but not for the related Cdc42 or Rac1. Our data suggest a direct interaction between Etk and RhoA. The PH domain of Etk appears to be required for its association with RhoA and its effects on RhoA-mediated stress fiber formation and transcriptional activation. Moreover, the interaction between the Etk PH domain and RhoA resulted in its dissociation from the Rho-GDI complex, which is thought to be a prerequisite step in the activation of Rho GTPases by GEFs. Interestingly, the Dbl family GEFs all contain tandem DH-PH domains, and the PH domain of Dbl family GEFs has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of the localization and modulation of the activity of the DH domain (24Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar, 25Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We speculate that during the GTP loading process, the PH domain of Dbl GEFs also may be involved in excluding the GDI from the GTPase complex, which allows the DH domain to exert its catalytic activity. Further experiments are needed to explore this possibility. The PH domain of Etk has been shown to interact with a number of protein partners such as G protein βγ-subunits, the FERM domain of FAK, and STAT3. It is likely that the interaction between the Etk PH domain and these signaling molecules is dynamic and spatially restrained. Our preliminary data showed that both FAK and RhoA are detectable in Etk immunoprecipitates when three proteins are overexpressed in COS-1 cells. We do not see competition between RhoA and FAK for Etk binding. Overexpression of RhoA enhances the interaction of FAK with Etk, and the reverse is true also. This suggests that both FAK and RhoA could bind to Etk simultaneously and cooperatively. Our results further support the notion that the PH domain of Etk plays an important role not only in receiving such upstream signals as phospholipids, βγ subunits of trimeric G proteins, and FAK but also in exerting effects on its downstream effectors such as STAT3 and RhoA. It is noteworthy that up-regulation of RhoA and Etk activities has been implicated in metastasis of several human cancers including prostate and breast. Overexpression of RhoA promotes invasion and metastasis of many tumor cell lines both in vivo and in vitro (26del Peso L. Hernandez-Alcoceba R. Embade N. Carnero A. Esteve P. Paje C. Lacal J.C.

Modulation of the expression of FT5 also changes the susceptibility of Leishmania cells to methotrexate.

Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). The main chemotherapeutic regimen consists of pentavalent antimonials, but resistance to this class of antiquated drugs is now prevalent in several endemic areas (2Sundar S. Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2001; 6: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). New targets are urgently required. One metabolic pathway that has been exploited extensively for the development of drugs is the folate biosynthesis pathway. Folates are made of a pterin moiety conjugated topara-aminobenzoic acid and glutamic acid. Reduced folates are key cofactors in the biosynthesis of thymidylate, and inhibitors of this pathway act primarily at the level of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),1 the enzyme responsible for supplying the cell with reduced folates (3Schweitzer B.I. Dicker A.P. Bertino J.R. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2441-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Antifolates have been used successfully as anticancer drugs (methotrexate) or in the treatment of bacterial (trimethoprim) or parasitic infections (pyrimethamine) (4Ouellette M. Leblanc E. Kundig C. Papadopoulou B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). No effective antifolate chemotherapy has yet been established against infections with the protozoan parasite Leishmania. Nevertheless, many distinct features in the folate metabolism of this organism have been identified that could prove to be useful therapeutic targets (5Nare B. Luba J. Hardy L.W. Beverley S.

Parasitol. 2002; 32: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our understanding of folate metabolism in Leishmania is derived mostly from work carried out on studies related to the mechanisms of resistance to the model antifolate drug methotrexate (MTX). Leishmania is sensitive to MTX, and step by step selection of mutants for MTX resistance has revealed a multiplicity of resistance mechanisms that have been permitted to pinpoint novel biochemical pathways. Amplification of the gene coding for the target DHFR (DHFR in Leishmania is a bifunctional enzyme where it is fused to thymidylate synthase) was shown to contribute to MTX resistance (7Coderre J.A.

Indeed, it is well established that pterins can have a folate sparing effect permitting Leishmania cells and related parasites to grow in folate-deficient medium (17Kidder G. Dutta B. J. Gen.

It remains to be demonstrated, however, whether Leishmania can synthesize folates de novo, but Leishmania promastigotes in culture rely heavily on uptake systems for meeting their folate needs. A folate transport activity has been studied biochemically inLeishmania, but the gene and proteins involved have yet to be characterized at the molecular level. It consists of a saturable active transport system recognizing both folate and MTX withKm values ranging from 250 to 700 nmdepending on the species (22Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol.

This reduced uptake of MTX is paralleled by a marked decrease in folate uptake, suggesting that the expression of the common folate/MTX transporter is strongly down-regulated in MTX-resistant Leishmania. Given that Leishmania is a folate auxotroph, this brings up the question of how the resistant parasite can meet its folate requirements. An answer was found for Leishmania tarentolae in which the biopterin transporter BT1 (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Lemley C. Yan S. Dole V.S. Madhubala R. Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was found to be overexpressed in all MTX-resistant cells with a markedly reduced folate uptake. Sufficient folates (but not MTX) could be transported through BT1 to meet the folate requirement of the cell (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here we show that BT1 is part of a large gene family and that some of these genes are consistently deleted in cells in which MTX uptake was abrogated. The molecular and biochemical analyses of one of these genes indicate that it corresponds to a high affinity folate transporter. The L. tarentolae cell line TarII WT has been described previously (29White T.C. Fase-Fowler F. van Luenen H. Calafat J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16977-16983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leishmaniacells were grown in SDM-79 or M199 medium supplemented with 5 or 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, respectively, and 5 mg/ml hemin. The L. tarentolae MTX-resistant mutants TarII MTX1000.3 to TarII MTX1000.7 have been described previously (26Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). L. tarentolae promastigotes were transfected by electroporation as reported previously (12Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Total DNA was isolated using DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen). Southern blotting, hybridization, and washing conditions were performed following standard protocols (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probes containing coding sequences of the FT gene family were obtained by PCR. The sequences of primers 1–4 (see Fig. 2) are 1, AGTCTAGAGCAGCACTCCTTACCTCTGC; 2, ATCGGATCCTGCGCACGGACAGATTAACC; 3, TCAATCAGAGGTGCCGCAGC; and 4, CTTTTGGGCATACACGCGGC. The XbaI and BamHI restriction sites in oligonucleotides 1 and 2 are underlined. The FTgenes were obtained from a cosmid derived from an L. tarentolae genomic DNA library (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), hybridized with a 500-bpSalI-EcoRI FT probe that was first isolated from a cosmid using a BT1 probe. A 2.3-kbSphI-PstI fragment containing the L. tarentolae FT3 was subcloned in the pSL1180 vector. The resulting construct was then digested by BamHI which cuts in the vector multiple cloning site and at the 3′ end of FT3 after the stop codon. This fragment was then inserted into theLeishmania expression vector pSP72αNEOα(31Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The L. tarentolae FT5 gene construct was obtained with a 4-kb MluI fragment inserted into theLeishmania expression vector pSLαNEOα(32Lamontagne J. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A 3.2-kb DNA fragment containing the L. tarentolae FT5 gene (2.1-kb) with flanking regions of about 550 bp on each side of the gene was amplified by PCR with primers 1 and 2 (see Fig. 2) containing a BamHI and anXbaI site, respectively, for directed cloning. This fragment was subcloned into pBluescriptII KS (Stratagene). An EcoRV digest of the resulting construct was made to delete 1.4 kb of theFT5 coding sequence and replaced by a hygromycin B phosphotransferase expression cassette (HYG) derived from pSPY-HYG (31Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This 3-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment was used for disrupting one FT5 allele by homologous recombination. An L. tarentolae FT5 null mutant was obtained by selection for loss of heterozygosity (33Gueiros-Filho F.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5655-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) by increasing the hygromycin B selection pressure to 400 ng/μl and cloning of the cell pool. FT5 null mutants were characterized by Southern blot and PCR analyses. DNA sequencing was done on an Applied Biosystems 377 automated sequencer. Analysis of the sequence was performed using the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group) and Clone Manager 5TM. The nucleotide sequences reported here will appear in the GenBankTM sequence data base under the accession numbers AY099959 and AY099960. Transport experiments were performed as described previously (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Tritium-labeled pteridines [3H]folate (19.6 Ci/mmol) and [3H]MTX (21.2 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. Transport studies were carried out using various concentrations of radioactive pteridines (10 nm to 5 μm) to determine apparent affinity constant (Km). The quantity of accumulated radioactivity was normalized with Leishmania cell numbers. To measure folate and MTX transport, the uptake of cells incubated on ice was subtracted. Leishmania cells selected for MTX resistance have numerous mutations including transport defects for MTX and folate. Two types of transport defects have been observed. In some mutants, the defect in transport consists of an ∼5-fold reduction of both MTX and folate (9Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13501-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas in another class of mutant the uptake of MTX is not measurable (23Kaur K. Coons T. Emmett K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7020-7028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The L. tarentolaeMTX 1000.4 mutant is a representative of the first class of mutants, whereas the mutant MTX 1000.6 has no measurable MTX uptake (Fig.1A). In L. tarentolae-resistant cells in which MTX uptake cannot be measured, we have shown that the biopterin transporter BT1 is overexpressed thereby permitting a small amount of folate to enter the cell (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We had noticed that even at relatively high stringency, aBT1 probe was hybridizing to fragments other thanBT1 (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that the biopterin transporter is part of a multigene family. We isolated a cosmid cross-hybridizing to theBT1 gene, and when we used a 500-bpSalI-EcoRI fragment derived from this cosmid as a probe, we could indeed observe multiple hybridizing bands, indicating that this fragment probe is part of a multigene family (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Some fragments hybridized more strongly than others suggesting that several gene copies could comigrate. This multigene family is not only present in L. tarentolae but also in all other Leishmania species tested (data not shown). Because BT1 can transport folates (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that one of the hybridizing fragments shown in Fig. 1B could correspond to a folate transporter. The total DNA of various independent L. tarentolae MTX-resistant mutants was hybridized to this 500-bp probe. In the mutants MTX 1000.4 and MTX 1000.5, which have only a partial reduction in folate and MTX transport (Fig. 1A, and not shown), we did not notice any change in the copy number of members of the gene family (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Most interestingly in three mutants L. tarentolae MTX 1000.3, MTX 1000.6, and MTX 1000.7, in which MTX uptake was greatly impaired (26Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we observed the complete absence of a 3.0-kbSalI-SalI hybridizing band, whereas the intensity of the 2.4- and 6-kb SalI-SalI fragments diminished extensively (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). In the latter cases this may correspond to hemizygous deletions, or if the fragments of more than one gene comigrate deletion of one gene will lead only to a decrease in the hybridization signal. To test whether one of the deleted bands could potentially correspond to a folate transporter, we further characterized cosmid 2B, which contains a 8.6-kb BamHI-BamHI fragment harboring both the 3.0- and 2.4-kb SalI-SalI fragments that appear to be deleted in some of the MTX-resistant mutants (Fig.2). The nucleotide sequence of the 8.6-kbBamHI-BamHI fragment revealed two open reading frames of about 2 kb each resulting in predicted proteins of 678 and 721 amino acids. These two ORFs were 58% identical to each other and 39 and 40% identical to the Leishmania BT1 (Fig.3). A search of data banks has revealed that the only homologues of the sequenced genes were found inLeishmania and in the related parasite Trypanosoma brucei. At least three homologues were found in T. brucei. One corresponds to the expression site associated geneESAG10 (34Gottesdiener K.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the two others consist of ORFs found on chromosomes IA and VIII of the ongoing T. bruceigenome project (GenBankTM accession numbers GB_HTG: TBBChRIA_05, and AC092212). In Leishmania, in addition to BT1, several other homologous sequences have been identified. In Leishmania donovani there are a series of six putative pteridine transporters (FT1 toFT6; GenBankTM accession numbersAAD52046, AAD52047, AAD52048, AAD52049, AAD52050, and AAD52051) and sequences found in chromosomes 4, 14, and 34 of the Leishmania major genome (GenBankTM accession numbersAL389894; AL358652; GB_HTG:LMFLCHR34_14) were similar to the genes sequenced. Sequence comparison and ClustalW analysis indicated that one of the two ORF (GenBankTM accession number AY099959) is closely related to a cluster of L. donovani sequences consisting of FT1, FT3, and FT4 (82% identity with FT3), and the other ORF (GenBankTM accession number AY099960) is highly similar to FT5 (79% identity), and we have thus retained the nomenclature for FT5 and have tentatively given the name FT3 for the other gene product derived from cosmid 2B of L. tarentolae. The L. tarentolae gene corresponding to FT5 contains the 3.0-kb SalI-SalI fragment that is completely absent in the MTX-resistant mutants TarII MTX1000.3, 1000.6, and 1000.7 (Fig. 1B). The FT3 gene contains a 2.4-kb fragment (Fig. 2), and whereas the hybridization intensity of a 2.4-kb fragment decreases in MTX-resistant mutants (Fig. 1B), it is not certain whether this is because of deletion of FT3 or another gene. The family of transporter exemplified by FT5 is predicted to contain 12 putative transmembrane domains as determined by the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy profiles but otherwise are not closely related to other families of transport proteins. Neither FT3 nor FT5 show sequence similarity with the reduced folate carrier of mammals (35Williams F.M. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or folate-binding proteins (36Elwood P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lacey S.W. Sanders J.M. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. Kamen B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 38Ratnam M. Marquardt H. Duhring J.L. Freisheim J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8249-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 39Sadasivan E. Rothenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5806-5811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that if one of these gene products indeed corresponds to a folate transporter, it may constitute a novel type of transport proteins. To test whether FT3 or FT5 were capable of transporting folates, we subcloned the two genes in Leishmania expression vectors and transfected them intoL. tarentolae MTX 1000.6 in which folate and MTX uptake are greatly impaired (Fig. 1A and Fig.4). The steady-state accumulation of [3H]MTX and [3H]folic acid were thus measured in these transfectants. Under the conditions tested, we could not observe any increase in either folate or MTX uptake in theFT3 transfectant (data not shown). However, theFT5 transfectant exhibited a clear increase in folate and MTX transport (Fig. 4). The level of accumulation in the TarII MTX1000.6- FT5 transfectant is only about 10% that of wild-type cells, suggesting that FT5 is not the sole folate transporter. The apparentKm of this FT5 transporter for folate and methotrexate was calculated using a double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot and found to be lower than the conventional Kmmeasured for folate and methotrexate uptake in Leishmaniawild-type cells (Table I). This may suggest that FT5 corresponds to a high affinity folate transporter. To test this hypothesis further, we generated an L. tarentolae FT5 null mutant.Table IAffinities of folate transport in L. tarentolaeKm(nM)1-aAverage of three independent measurements with a range of substrate concentration from 10 to 1000 nm.Tar II wild-typeTarII MTX1000.6 transfected withFT5Folic acid26084Methotrexate451881-a Average of three independent measurements with a range of substrate concentration from 10 to 1000 nm. Open table in a new tab To generate an FT5 null mutant, we made a targeting construct to replace most of the coding region of FT5 by an hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG) expression cassette (Fig. 2). This cassette, containing ∼550 bp of flanking intergenic sequences on each side of the deleted FT5 gene necessary for homologous recombination, was electroporated in L. tarentolae wild-type cells. Transfectants growing in the presence of hygromycin B were analyzed by Southern blots. In wild-type cells, anFT5 probe recognizes an 8.6-kbBamHI-BamHI fragment (Fig.5A, lane 1). Because FT5 is part of a gene family, other hybridizing bands are also observed. The integration of the HYG cassette also introduces a unique EcoRI site (Fig. 2). ABamHI-EcoRI digest would lead to new 3.1- and 5.2-kb fragments being hybridized by the probe. This is exactly what we have observed by analyzing one cloned transfectant (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Leishmania is a diploid organism, and thus for a null mutant, two alleles need to be disrupted. Loss of heterozygocity can be achieved by increasing the concentration of the selective drug hygromycin B (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Gueiros-Filho F.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5655-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As expected, the hybridization intensity of the 3.1- and 5.2-kb bands corresponding to the inactivatedFT5 increased in a cloned transfectant subjected to high hygromycin B selection (Fig. 5A, lane 3), suggesting that the second allele was inactivated. Nonetheless an 8.6-kb fragment at the size of the wild-type FT5 allele hybridized to an FT5 probe, suggesting either that another homologous gene was comigrating with FT5 or that theLeishmania recombinant strain became triploid forFT5. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we carried out PCRs using primers 3 and 4 (Fig. 2) that can distinguish between an intact copy of FT5 and a disrupted one. PCR amplification of the wild-type allele should lead to a 2.1-kb fragment, whereas the deleted gene with the HYG cassette should give rise to a 1.9-kb PCR fragment. PCR amplification of the wild-type DNA using primers 3 and 4 indeed lead to a 2.1-kb PCR fragment (Fig.5B, lane 1), whereas the heterozygous parasites gave, as expected, 2.1- and 1.9-kb fragments representing the wild-type and deleted allele, respectively (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Finally, a single 1.9-kb fragment was amplified in the heterozygous FT5 mutant submitted to loss of heterozygocity, demonstrating the disruption of both FT5 alleles and the generation of an FT5 null mutant. The availability of an FT5 null mutant has enabled further studies on its role in folate transport. We would have expected that less folate would enter the cells in the mutant. When we used 1 μm of either folate or MTX, we did indeed observe a reduction in the uptake of both substrates, but this was not statistically different from wild-type cells (Fig.6, A and B). In contrast, at a lower substrate concentration of 50 nm,there was a clear reduction in the uptake of both folate and MTX by theFT5 null mutant compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 6, C and D). This further supports other results suggesting that FT5 is a high affinity folate transporter (Table I). The mutant TarII MTX 1000.6 is highly resistant to MTX and is associated with a marked reduction in the uptake of the drug. FT5 is deleted in this mutant (Fig. 1B), and re-introduction of FT5 in this mutant increases the transport of both folate and MTX (Fig. 4). Because MTX uptake is increased in the MTX 1000.6-FT5transfectant, we would expect a concomitant increase in the MTX sensitivity of the mutant. The FT5 transfectant was indeed found to be much more sensitive to MTX than the mutant, but the reversion was not to wild-type levels (Fig.7A), suggesting that further mechanisms of resistance possibly including other transport mutations have occurred in this mutant. In the case of the FT5 null mutant, we could have expect a decrease in MTX susceptibility. However, when cells were grown in SDM-79, a medium with a high concentration of folates (15.4 μm), we could not observe a difference in MTX susceptibility between wild-type cells and the FT5 null mutants (Fig. 7B). Because the role of FT5 appears to be more important under limiting concentrations of folate (Fig. 6), we grew the wild-type cells and the FT5 null mutant in M199, a medium much poorer in folates (22.7 nm). As observed previously, the IC50 value of MTX in Leishmaniacells is highly dependent on the folate concentration of the medium (5Nare B. Luba J. Hardy L.W. Beverley S. Parasitology. 1997; 114 (suppl.): 101-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and indeed, L. tarentolae wild-type cells were 60 times more sensitive to MTX in M199 than in SDM-79 (Fig. 7, B and C). Interestingly, the FT5 null mutant was hypersensitive to MTX in M199 medium with an IC50 of 10 nm (Fig. 7C). To prove that the effect observed was due to a difference in folate concentration, we added folic acid to M199 medium to reach the concentration found in SDM-79. Under these conditions of high folate concentration, we did not observe a significant difference in MTX susceptibility between the wild-type cell and the FT5 null mutant (not shown). In recent years, a number of genes involved in pterin and folate metabolism have been isolated in Leishmania (5Nare B. Luba J. Hardy L.W. Beverley S. Parasitology. 1997; 114 (suppl.): 101-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J., El Fadili A. Kundig C. Richard D. Roy G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The biopterin transporter BT1 was recently characterized with regard to both substrate affinity and specificity (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and its role in parasite physiology (41Cunningham M.L. Titus R.G. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Roy G. Kundig C. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 97: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The BT1 gene appears important for intracellular parasite survival (43Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Breton M. Kundig C. Dumas C. Fillion I. Singh A.K. Olivier M. Ouellette M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). BT1 appears to be the sole biopterin transporter in Leishmania but can also transport folate although with a much lower affinity than theLeishmania folate transporter (24Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Through this work we have pinpointed a novel large gene family, with a least one member transporting folate. At least nine hybridizingSalI-SalI fragments of various intensities could be observed (Fig. 1B). Data bank searches indicated that, in addition to BT1, six complete homologous open reading frames were found in L. donovani, and to date three L. majorchromosomes (chromosome 4, 14, and 34) whose sequences are currently being completed also carry sequences that are related to the folate transporter gene family. It is not known yet whether all these genes are active or if some correspond to pseudogenes. Most strikingly, some members of this gene family appear to be deleted in MTX-resistantLeishmania cells having no measurable MTX uptake (Fig.1B, lanes 4–6). We assume that one of these genes could likely correspond to a folate transporter. It is nonetheless worth noting that two mutants, with a 5-fold decrease in MTX uptake, appear to have an intact set of FT gene homologues (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, in mutants TarII MTX1000.4 and 1000.5, the transport defect could be related to either point mutations or to the modulation of RNA expression in one of the FT genes. It is also possible that the transport defect in these two mutants was not related to this newly described FT gene family. To test whether one of the deleted genes in the mutant TarII MTX1000.6 corresponds to the folate transporter, we carried out gene transfection and gene deletion events. Our work on FT5 has shown that it corresponds to a high affinity (Fig. 6 and Table I) but relatively low capacity (Fig. 4) folate transporter. FT5 is therefore not the primary folate transporter of Leishmania, and possibly another related gene could correspond to this transporter. We currently think that theSalI-SalI band at 2.4 kb (Fig. 1B) represents at least a doublet, one band corresponding to FT3 (Fig. 2) and the other possibly to the main folate transporter. Work is in progress to clone this gene part of the family. Leishmaniais a pteridine auxotroph, and pterins such as biopterin have long been known to be essential growth factors (6Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J., El Fadili A. Kundig C. Richard D. Roy G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) although their exact role remains unclear. One role appears to be in parasite differentiation (41Cunningham M.L. Titus R.G. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Due to the importance of pteridines in Leishmaniagrowth, it is understandable that this parasite has evolved a number of redundancies in pteridine transporters. BT1 preferentially transports biopterin; FT5 corresponds to a high affinity folate transporter, whereas at least one more transporter of folic acid is present as indicated by the observed folate uptake in theFT5 null mutant (Fig. 6). Leishmania cycles between sand flies and host macrophages, and through various steps of its life cycle, the parasite may encounter a folate-poor environment, thereby needing a high affinity folate transporter such as FT5.Leishmania and possibly the African trypanosome appear to have several more genes related to the BT1-FT family. Some of these products could have the ability to transport different types of pteridines, or perhaps multiple genes are required because differential expression is required at discrete periods during the parasite life cycle. The generation of gene-specific probes should permit us to study the expression of individual genes along the Leishmania life cycle. The uptake of folate is indeed known to be dependent on the growth phase of the parasite (22Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10053-10058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). FT5 would be the first non-mammalian folate transporter characterized in such detail. In addition to mammalian systems (reviewed in Refs. 44Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 11-23PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 46Matherly L.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 67: 131-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), folate transport activities have been reported in Xenopus (47Lo R.S. Said H.M. Unger T.F. Hollander D. Miledi R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 246: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and in bacteria (48Shane B. Stokstad E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2243-2253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Kumar H.P. Tsuji J.M. Henderson G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7171-7179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the gene products responsible for these activities have not yet been isolated in non-mammalian systems. The FT5 gene is deleted in L. tarentolae mutants selected for MTX resistance, suggesting that it may be implicated in resistance. As expected, transfection of this gene in the L. tarentolae MTX1000.6-resistant mutant partially reverts resistance because increased MTX uptake will sensitize cells to this inhibitor (Fig. 7A). We could have expected that a null mutation ofFT5 would lead to resistance. However, this was not observed in SDM-79 (Fig. 7B), and under limited folate concentration it led to hypersensitivity (Fig. 7C). This is nonetheless consistent with FT5 being a high affinity folate transporter. Indeed, in folate-rich medium most folates enter the cell independently of FT5, whereas in folate-poor medium the role of FT5 is much more important. Because MTX susceptibility was modulated very effectively by folate concentration in Leishmania (5Nare B. Luba J. Hardy L.W. Beverley S. Parasitology. 1997; 114 (suppl.): 101-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it does make sense that an FT5 null mutant becomes more sensitive to MTX in a folate-poor environment. Indeed, because less folates enter the cells, it cannot compete as effectively with MTX. The mutants were selected in the folate-rich SDM-79 medium, and thus the deletion of FT5should be more neutral in term of MTX susceptibility (Fig.7B). We think that FT5 was possibly codeleted with another member of the FT gene family, and the deletion of both genes contributes to the resistance phenotype inTarII MTX1000.6. Indeed, in addition to FT5 a number of other fragments hybridizing to an FT probe are deleted (Fig.1B). DNA deletion in Leishmania occurs exclusively by homologous recombination (50Ouellette M. Hettema E. Wust D. Fase-Fowler F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 51Grondin K. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and this recombination could have occurred between the conserved sequence of two members of the FT family that are physically linked. In conclusion, we have described a novel gene product inLeishmania that corresponds to a high affinity folate transporter. Moreover, several related transporters are also present inLeishmania that could potentially transport various pteridine substrates under a variety of conditions.Leishmania is a successful parasite that is a pteridine auxotroph and has thus needed to develop a complex pathway of pteridine transporters and salvage enzymes. FT5 is part of a novel family of 12 putative transmembrane domain proteins, and the uniqueness of the pteridine transporters family in Leishmania opens the possibility to generate specific inhibitors.

A previous study showed that IgD synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin and lacking the three N-linked glycans on the heavy chain was not secreted (Shin, S. U., Wei, D. F., Amin, A. R., Thorbecke, G. J., and Morrison, S. L. (1992) Hum. Antibodies 3, 65–74). The contribution of each of the carbohydrates in the Fc of IgD to assembly and secretion was now analyzed by eliminating the carbohydrate addition sequence, Asn-X-Ser/Thr, through site-directed mutagenesis. Only the carbohydrate nearest the sole disulfide bond between heavy chains, which remained high mannose and appeared to be buried within the folded molecule, was found to be essential for secretion. When IgD lacked that glycan, assembly reached only the heavy/light chain half-molecule stage, and heavy chains were held inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Using benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (BADG) to inhibit complete O-linked glycosylation, we found that IgA1 and IgD with incomplete hinge carbohydrates were assembled and secreted from cells. Thus, one N-linked glycan plays a structural role in IgD and is required for proper assembly and secretion, but the O-linked carbohydrates in the hinge of IgD and IgA1 are not required for folding and export.

They are unique also in that they bear O-linked carbohydrates in the hinge region. The two types of glycans differ in several ways. Asparagine- or N-linked carbohydrates are added as large GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 precursors to proteins co-translationally in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prior to folding. O-linked glycans are assembled sequentially onto folded proteins in the Golgi apparatus, where N-glycans may continue to be enzymatically processed to their mature form (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for addition of the precursor carbohydrate to asparagine residues of nascent proteins is Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X may be any amino acid except proline, and if Ser is in the third position, X may only rarely be Asp, Glu, Trp, or Leu (2Gavel Y. von Heijne G.

There exists no defined addition sequon for the attachment of the firstN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue, although through statistical methods some trends in the surrounding sequences have been identified (6Elhammer A.P.

Nielsen J.O. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). N-linked glycans are large and contain a pentasaccharide core derived from the precursor, consisting of twoN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and three mannose residues. To this may be attached mannose, glucose, galactose (Gal), and/or GlcNAc residues as well as sialic acid and fucose. Mature carbohydrates may be high mannose, hybrid, or complex. High mannose glycans are the least processed and resemble a trimmed version of the precursor. Hybrid glycans are trimmed to a greater degree, with some residues added to terminal mannoses. Complex carbohydrates are the most highly processed and appear in a variety of structures with a greater number of residues added to the pentasaccharide core. O-linked carbohydrates are comprised of a smaller, more diverse core consisting of a GalNAc-Gal pair or a GalNAc with GlcNAc and Gal attached via different possible linkages. More residues also may be present on the mature carbohydrate (8Hounsell E.F. Davies M.J. Renouf D.V. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Schachter H.

Glycosylation may play a role in protein stability, prevention or induction of aggregation, secretion, ligand/receptor recognition and binding affinity, activity, protease and heat resistance, and cell-cell interactions, among others (11Dwek R.A.

Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In particular, the carbohydrate present in the Fc of IgG has been shown to be important for effective activation of the complement cascade and recognition by Fc receptors (15Jefferis R. Lund J. Goodall M. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 44: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Radaev S. Sun P.D. J. Biol.

Med. 1994; 180: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Earlier reports have shown that N-linked carbohydrates may be necessary for assembly and secretion of IgA and IgD antibodies. Although murine IgA1 was not secreted when the glycosylation sites were removed by site-directed mutagenesis (18Taylor A.K. Wall R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the assembly and secretion of murine-human chimeric IgA1 was unaffected by removal of glycosylation sites (19Chuang P.D. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 724-732PubMed Google Scholar). Human IgD bears three addition sites, Asn-354, Asn-445, and Asn-496 (20Takahashi N. Tetaert D. Debuire B. Lin L.C. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Murine-human chimeric IgD was not secreted from a transfectant myeloma cell line when produced in the presence of tunicamycin (Tm), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. IgD lacking N-linked glycans was assembled into HL half-molecules rather than fully formed H2L2 antibodies (21Shin S.U. Wei C.F. Amin A.R. Thorbecke G.J. Morrison S.L. Hum. Antibodies. 1992; 3: 65-74Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and these remained within the cell. Although this study did not identify the role of individual carbohydrate molecules, it was hypothesized that the glycan at Asn-354 may be critical for the proper conformation of the hinge region in which a single disulfide bond links the two heavy chains at Cys-290. In the absence of this glycan the conformation may have been altered, blocking assembly and resulting in retention in the secretory pathway. We have now investigated the role of each N-linked glycan in IgD assembly and secretion using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines producing IgD proteins mutated to lack a single addition site, two sites, or all three. We found that the presence of carbohydrate at Asn-354, but not at Asn-445 or Asn-496, was required for IgD assembly and secretion. Using immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy, the heavy chains from an N354Q IgD mutant were found to remain in the ER and not to traffic to the Golgi apparatus. The carbohydrate at Asn-354 remained high mannose and could not be bound effectively by lectin-coated Sepharose resin, suggesting that it was buried between protein domains. Truncation of O-linked glycans in the hinge region of IgD and IgA1 using benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (BADG) (22Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not inhibit secretion. The initial human IgD heavy chain gene expression vector constructed in this laboratory (21Shin S.U. Wei C.F. Amin A.R. Thorbecke G.J. Morrison S.L. Hum. Antibodies. 1992; 3: 65-74Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) contained the IgD heavy chain gene in its genomic form with six exons. For the current study, a new IgD heavy chain vector was constructed in which the introns within the coding sequence of the constant region were removed using a combination of PCR and cloning. Additionally, the 5′-intron separating VH from CH1 was shortened to 223 bases. The heavy chain gene contained the murine 27.44 VH specific for the hapten dansyl (23Dangl J.L. Parks D.R. Oi V.T. Herzenberg L.A. Cytometry. 1982; 2: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the 3′-untranslated region from IgG3 (24Shin S.U. Friden P. Moran M. Morrison S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4979-4985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the gene was inserted as an EcoRV-BamHI fragment into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). IgD mutants lacking N-linked glycosylation sites were made using nested PCR to produce point mutations in the Asn codons. Primers encoded an Asn → Gln substitution in all three cases plus aXhoI site near the substitutions at Asn-354 and Asn-445. Primer sets were designed as listed below.

Restriction enzyme sites are in parentheses, substituted bases are in boldface type, and Asn → Gln is underlined. PCR products were cloned into the TA Cloning Vector (Invitrogen) and analyzed by restriction enzyme digests. Selected products were then sequenced using reagents and directions by PerkinElmer Life Sciences and the ABI Prism method. Data were collected at the UCLA Core Facility or at Laragen, Inc. (Los Angeles, CA). Mutant cassettes were reconstituted into the complete IgD heavy chain gene, generating sequences lacking one, two, or three carbohydrate addition sites. Transfection of CHO cells was performed using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). Cells first were transfected with a murine-human chimeric anti-dansyl κ chain expression vector described previously (17Wright A. Morrison S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), generating a light chain producer. The anti-dansyl heavy chain constructs then were transfected into the light chain producer as described previously (17Wright A. Morrison S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), with 10 μg of uncut H chain vector per Petri dish containing ∼5 × 106 adherent cells. After transfection, the cells were plated into six 96-well plates in 125 μl/well of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and either 0.5 mm histidinol for selection on the light chain vector or 0.5 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for selection on the heavy chain vector. Culture supernatants from surviving clones were screened subsequently by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using either goat anti-human κ-coated or dansyl-BSA-coated plates followed by goat anti-human κ antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Selected cell populations were subcloned by limiting dilution, and the clone producing the highest amount of IgD was selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For biosynthetic labeling, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated either 3–4 h or overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium deficient in methionine, cysteine, and glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 μl/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine Easytag mix (Amersham Biosciences) and 1× GlutaMax glutamine analog (Invitrogen). For overnight labels 1–2 × 106 cells were used, and for shorter incubations 5 × 106 cells were used. Coincident labeling and Tm treatment were performed by preincubating cells with 8 μg/ml Tm for 3 h and then washing and incubating overnight in labeling medium supplemented with 8 μg/ml Tm. Following labeling, supernatants were collected, cytoplasmic lysates were prepared, and these were immunoprecipitated as described previously (25Shin S.U. Morrison S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 178: 459-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using goat anti-human IgD (Sigma) and rabbit anti-human Fab followed by rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions using 5% phosphate gels or under reducing conditions, as described (25Shin S.U. Morrison S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 178: 459-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using 8 or 12.5% Tris-glycine gels. To inhibit complete O-linked glycosylation in transfectant cells, 5 mm BADG (Sigma) was added to culture medium. Proteins containing complete O-linked carbohydrates were precipitated from unlabeled cell supernatants and cytoplasmic lysates using jacalin-coated agarose beads (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Following this, the remaining immunoglobulins with truncated O-glycans containing only GalNAc were immunoprecipitated with 40–60 μl of Sepharose 4B coated with dansyl-BSA (Amersham Biosciences). Agarose beads were washed and eluted using the immunoprecipitation protocol above. Sepharose beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8, and eluted by incubating with 40–60 μl of 3 mm dansyl-lysine on ice followed by centrifugation. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, as described above, with the position of the proteins determined by Western blot (see below). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment of antibody samples was performed as described previously (26Coloma M.J. Trinh R.K. Martinez A.R. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2162-2170PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates from the supernatants of ∼2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Endo H Reaction Buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (β-Me)). 25 μl of each sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C with or without 6–9 units of Endo H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 5× sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 1.5% SDS, 50% glycerol, and 20 μg/50 ml bromphenol blue) was added to each tube, and samples were heated in a boiling waterbath for 3 min to elute labeled molecules prior to analysis on a 12.5% Tris-glycine gel. 5–10 × 106 transfectant cells were biosynthetically labeled overnight, supernatants were collected, and concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose (Sigma) binding was performed as described previously (27Wright A. Tao M.H. Kabat E.A. Morrison S.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2717-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After the resin was removed by centrifugation, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG or anti-IgD as described above. Antibodies eluted from the resin with 0.5 m methyl α-d-mannopyranoside also were immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG or anti-IgD. Immunoprecipitated antibodies from the original supernatants and from the ConA-Sepharose eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as described above. Antibodies in sample buffer containing β-Me were run on 8% Tris-glycine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P®, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with goat anti-human IgD or rabbit anti-human IgA (Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma) or HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, Madison, WI), respectively. All bands were visualized using Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Wells of 8-chamber Permanox slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) were seeded with CHO transfectant cells in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight. Cells were gently washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in a freshly prepared solution of 0.01 m sodium metaperiodate, 0.075m lysine, 0.0375 mNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, and 2% paraformaldehyde for 2–3 h at room temperature. Wells were rinsed three times with a solution of 0.5% ovalbumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Buffer A), for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized by a 5-min incubation with Buffer B (Buffer A containing 0.05% saponin (Sigma)) at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in Buffer B and added to relevant wells, and slides were incubated with shaking overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used were goat anti-human IgD, diluted to 1/75; rabbit anti-MERG (major ER glycoprotein, a generous gift from Dr. D. Meyer), diluted to 1/30; and rabbit anti-Golgi β-coatomer protein (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), diluted to 1/75. Cells were then washed in Buffer B three times, and secondary antibody was added. Secondary antibodies (Texas Red-conjugated swine anti-goat IgG (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) and FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Nordic Immunology, Tilburg, The Netherlands)) were diluted 1/25 and 1/100, respectively, in Buffer B. Prior to adding diluted secondary antibodies to wells, the solutions were centrifuged to remove any antibody aggregates, which bind to cells directly and increase background fluorescence. Secondary antibody staining was performed at room temperature for 1 h, and the cells were washed. Chambers were then removed from each slide, and a drop of Prolong (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was laid over each group of cells to reduce quenching of dyes followed by a coverslip, which was sealed to the slide. The heavy chain gene used for the expression of murine-human chimeric anti-dansyl IgD is shown in Fig. 1. The gene has a shortened intron separating VH and CH1 and no introns within the constant region. The 3′-untranslated region was derived from IgG3, an antibody produced at high levels in transfectants. Mutant IgD molecules were generated using nested PCR with the heavy chain gene template. Glutamine was substituted for asparagine in each N-glycan addition sequence. Three cassettes, each encompassing a portion of IgD with a mutated addition site, were used to replace wild type sequences, yielding IgD genes with one, two, or all three glycosylation sites mutated. To determine the contribution of each of the individualN-linked glycans on IgD to its assembly and secretion, we analyzed wild type IgD and mutants missing glycosylation sites at residues 354, 445, or 496 and combinations thereof. Transfectants expressing wild type or mutant IgD were biosynthetically labeled for 3–4 h, cytoplasmic lysates were prepared, and IgD was immunoprecipitated. Analysis of non-reduced samples by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A) showed that all antibodies assembled into HL half-molecules but that only those with heavy chains bearing carbohydrate at site 354 assembled into H2L2 antibodies (lanes 2,4, 5, and 7). Analysis of IgD immunoprecipitated from cell supernatants following overnight labeling showed that only antibodies with asparagine at site 354 of the H chain were secreted as H2L2 species (Fig.2 B). Small amounts of HL half-molecules also were present in secretions along with free light chain and light chain dimers. Unexpectedly, we also observed that all heavy chains with carbohydrate at Asn-445 exist as two glycoforms (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the site at 445 is variably glycosylated. The observed band pattern consistent with variable glycosylation of Asn-445 is diagrammed in Fig. 2 D. Immunofluorescent staining was used to determine the intracellular localization of non-secreted IgD HL half-molecules (Fig. 3). Cells fixed to slides were permeabilized with saponin and probed with goat anti-IgD and rabbit antiserum specific for an ER major glycoprotein or the Golgi β-coatomer protein and then stained with either Texas Red-conjugated swine anti-goat or FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Comparison of the transfectant stably expressing wild type IgD with that expressing the N354Q heavy chain mutant showed that wild type IgD heavy chain is found in both the ER (panel C) and the Golgi apparatus (panel F), whereas the mutant is found in the ER (panel I), but not in the Golgi apparatus (panel L). Thus, it appears that the heavy chain lacking the hinge-proximal glycan can assemble into HL half-molecules, but these are retained in the ER and do not proceed any further along the secretory pathway. It has been reported that the carbohydrate at Asn-354 is high mannose in wild type IgD (28Mellis S.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11546-11556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the Asn-354 oligosaccharide processing was also minimal when other heavy chain glycans were absent, cells synthesizing wild type IgD or mutant IgD containing carbohydrate at Asn-354 were biosynthetically labeled. The secreted IgD was immunoprecipitated and digested with Endo H. We observed that all were Endo H-sensitive (Fig.4). Therefore, the glycan at Asn-354 remains high mannose in antibodies with glycans missing at sites 445, 496, or both as well as in the wild type. The glycan at site 445 appears to remain complex when its neighbor at site 496 is missing, as there are two glycoforms following digestion with Endo H (lane 6), one representing H chains with no carbohydrate and one with complex carbohydrate at Asn-445. Similarly, the carbohydrate attached to Asn-496 remains complex when the glycan at 445 is missing because the single heavy chain band (lane 4) is larger than the lower bands (lanes 6 and 8), which represent heavy chains missing all N-glycans. After demonstrating that the carbohydrate attached to Asn-354 was necessary for proper assembly of IgD, we used ConA to investigate whether that carbohydrate is sequestered within the folded protein. ConA is a lectin that preferentially binds high mannose sugars but also recognizes complex, bi-antennary oligosaccharides (29Brewer C.F. Bhattacharyya L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7306-7310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ConA-Sepharose effectively precipitated antibody bearing high mannose carbohydrate in the V region (Fig. 5,lanes 3 and 4) but not IgA1 lackingN-linked carbohydrates (lanes 1 and2), although the presence of a small amount of protein inlane 1 indicated that ConA-Sepharose beads bound some IgA1 non-specifically. Wild type IgD, which bears Asn-354 high mannose glycan and two complex glycans as well, was bound by the ConA-Sepharose (lanes 5 and 6). However, the IgD mutant with only the Asn-354 high mannose carbohydrate failed to be effectively and specifically bound by ConA-Sepharose (lanes 7 and8). This suggested that the carbohydrate at site 354 is buried within the folded antibody and is not available on the surface for binding by the lectin. To determine whether the O-linked glycans that are attached to the hinge region of IgD and IgA1 are necessary for antibody secretion, transfectants producing each isotype were grown in the presence of BADG, an inhibitor of full-length O-glycosylation. Supernatants were collected and cytoplasmic lysates prepared after overnight incubation with or without the drug. Sequential precipitations were performed with each sample, first with jacalin-coated agarose to bind antibodies containing complete O-glycans, followed by Sepharose 4B coated with dansyl-BSA, for which the antibody variable region is specific. Precipitated proteins were reduced, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to membranes that were probed with anti-IgA (Fig.6 A) or anti-IgD (Fig.6 B). Wild type IgA1 binds to jacalin (Fig. 6 A,lane 1), whereas IgA1 with truncated O-glycans does not (lane 2). Although IgA1 lacking completeO-glycans was not bound by jacalin-agarose, it was indeed present in the supernatant and bound to dansyl-BSA Sepharose (lane 4). Under the conditions of the experiment, jacalin-agarose did not remove all antibodies from the supernatant of untreated IgA1 transfectants (lane 3). However, in a subsequent experiment involving three sequential precipitations of supernatant containing wild type IgA1 with jacalin-agarose resin, no IgA1 remained after the second precipitation (data not shown). Therefore, it appeared that all of the IgA1 synthesized by cells not treated with BADG was O-glycosylated. Similar results were obtained for IgD (Fig. 6 B). However, jacalin-agarose bound less than half of the total IgD-bearingO-glycans (lanes 1 and 3). Sequential precipitations with jacalin-agarose, in an experiment like that described above, showed that no IgD remained after the second precipitation, indicating that all wild type IgD was indeedO-glycosylated (data not shown). Interestingly, a comparison of the ratio of the signal seen in lanes 3 and 7with those in lanes 4 and 8 suggests that less IgD was secreted in the presence of BADG. Therefore, although theO-linked carbohydrates in the hinge of IgD may not be absolutely required, they may facilitate its assembly and secretion. Analysis of cell lysates shows little or noO-glycosylated IgA1 or IgD present prior to secretion (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 5), consistent with O-glycosylation taking place in the Golgi apparatus. Also, two N-linked glycoforms are visible for IgA1. We occasionally observed variable processing of the N-linked carbohydrates on the heavy chain from this transfectant. Analysis of the intracellular assembly of IgA1 and IgD showed that it was not affected by the presence or absence of complete O-glycans (data not shown). To further analyze the role of glycosylation in IgA1 secretion, cells were biosynthetically labeled overnight with BADG and/or Tm added to the medium. IgA1 lacking complete O-linked sugars,N-linked sugars, or both is secreted (Fig. 6 C). The thin non-specific band migrating below IgA1 (lanes 1 and 2) and above IgA1 (lanes 3 and4) serves as a marker to discern the small differences in size between each IgA1 glycoform. The apparent molecular weight of the IgA1 heavy chain is largest in lane 1 with a reduction in size observed in successive lanes, representing truncation ofO-linked glycans (lane 2), loss ofN-linked glycans (lane 3), or both (lane 4). In cell lysates, no change in apparent molecular weight is observed when O-glycosylation is altered, consistent with its being a late event occurring just prior to secretion. Similar analysis of a wild type IgD transfectant showed that antibodies produced in cells treated with BADG and lacking completeO-glycans were secreted, whereas no IgD was secreted in the presence of tunicamycin, as expected (data not shown). Previously we observed that in transfectants expressing murine-human chimeric IgD, treatment with Tm halted assembly of antibodies at the HL half-molecule stage, and IgD was not secreted. Tm inhibits all N-linked glycosylation in the cell and prevents carbohydrate addition to all three sites in IgD (30Kuo S.C. Lampen J.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, the earlier study cou"

TRH receptors tagged with FLAG and hemagglutinin epitopes were co-precipitated only if they were co-expressed, and 10–30% of receptors were isolated as hemagglutinin/FLAG-receptor dimers under basal conditions. The abundance of receptor dimers was increased when cells had been stimulated by TRH, indicating that TRH either stabilizes pre-existing dimers or increases dimer formation. TRH increased receptor dimerization and phosphorylation within 1 min in a dose-dependent manner. TRH increased phosphorylation of both receptor monomers and dimers, documented by incorporation of32P and an upshift in receptor mobility reversed by phosphatase treatment. The ability of TRH to increase receptor phosphorylation and dimerization did not depend on signal transduction, because it was not inhibited by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. Receptor phosphorylation required an agonist but was not blocked by the casein kinase II inhibitor apigenin, the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, or expression of a dominant negative form of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. TRH receptors lacking most of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus formed dimers constitutively but failed to undergo agonist-induced dimerization and phosphorylation.

The TRH receptor, once occupied by agonist, activates phospholipase C through Gq/11, leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), which causes an elevation of intracellular calcium by mobilizing an InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ store in the endoplasmic reticulum (10Hinkle P.M.

Thus, GPCR dimerization appears to underscore a novel mechanism of modulating GPCR-mediated signal transduction or mediating “cross-talk” between different receptor families. Eidne and co-workers (43Kroeger K.M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Seeber R.M. Miles L.E. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12736-12743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) recently concluded that the TRH receptor forms dimers. Using transiently transfected COS cells, they found that bioluminescence resonance energy transfer occurs between receptors labeled with luciferase and yellow fluorescent protein and that TRH increases energy transfer (43Kroeger K.M.

TRH receptors have also been reported to run at the molecular weight of dimers on SDS-PAGE (44Willars G.B. Heding A. Vrecl M. Sellar R. Blomenrohr M. Nahorski S.R. Eidne K.A. J. Biol.

One caveat in the interpretation of these experiments is that the receptors were overexpressed, which would be expected to favor oligomerization. In the present study, we characterize dimerization and phosphorylation of epitope-tagged TRH receptors biochemically using human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and a pituitary cell model system, both expressing receptors at levels no higher than those typical of endogenous pituitary receptors. We show that TRH receptor monomers and dimers are isolated from non-stimulated cells and that TRH increases receptor phosphorylation and dimerization in a dose- and time-dependent manner independent of signaling. HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Day (University of Virginia Medical School, Charlottesville, VA), plasmids encoding GRK2 and dominant negative GRK2-K220R were provided by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA), and an HA-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor was provided by Dr. Richard Clark (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX). Type 1 rat TRH receptor was tagged at its amino terminus with either two repeats of hemagglutinin (HA) nonapeptide (YPYDVPDYA) separated by a Gly residue or with two repeats of a FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK), also separated by a Gly residue, using polymerase chain reaction as described previously (46Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The forward primer for HA tagging carried a BamHI recognition site at its 5′ end followed by a Kozak sequence (47Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), HA-coding sequences, and a sequence derived from the first 18 nucleotides of the TRH receptor cDNA. The reverse primer was complimentary to the last 23 nucleotides (for making the full-length receptor) or to the region between nucleotides 978 and 1002, with the addition of a stop codon (for making a mutant receptor truncated after Leu-334) of the receptor cDNA with a flanking XbaI recognition site at its 5′ end. The fragments were amplified from a plasmid carrying type 1 rat TRH receptor cDNA (48Zhao D. Yang J. Jones K.E. Gerald C. Suzuki Y. Hogan P.G. Chin W.W. Tashjian A.H., Jr. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3529-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), digested withBamHI and XbaI, and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3, yielding p2HA-TRHR andp2HA-CTTRHR, respectively, which encode full-length and carboxyl domain-truncated 2HA-tagged type 1 rat TRH receptors. Because the receptor containing two FLAG epitopes at the amino terminus did not localize to the cell membrane based on radioligand binding and immunolocalization, we introduced a prolactin signal peptide preceding the FLAG sequence to create pProl2FLAG-TRHR. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that the receptor encoded by this construct was expressed primarily on the cell membrane. All sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. HEK293 cell monolayers were grown in 6-cm dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 7.5% fetal bovine serum as described previously (49Yu R. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 737-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GHFT cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was changed every 2–5 days and replaced with serum-free medium 4–12 h before the cells were challenged with stimuli. Results were not different when serum starvation was omitted. For transient transfection, cell monolayers at ∼80% confluence were washed twice with serum-free medium and then overlaid with 1.6 ml/dish of transfecting complex prepared from 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 16 μl of LipofectAMINE in serum-free medium. After a 5-h incubation, cells were washed once with serum-containing medium, and culture was subsequently resumed in 2.5 ml of the same medium. Experiments were conducted 2 or 5 days after transfection. To create cell lines stably expressing TRH receptors, cells were transfected as described above and either 400 (GHFT cells) or 500 (HEK293 cells) μg/ml Geneticin was added to the culture medium to start selection 24 h after transfection (50Yu R. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Geneticin-resistant colonies were amplified and then screened for expression of TRH receptors; pools were then cloned. The established cell lines were maintained in the same media as the parental lines. Cells in 6-cm dishes were detached and harvested in 1 ml/dish of buffer containing 155 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min, cell pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, plus 1:200 protease inhibitor mixture and then disrupted by 30 passages through 25-gauge needles. The unbroken cells were removed after centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of homogenization buffer, and protein concentrations were quantified. Finally, the sample was mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer containing 100 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, pH 6.8, for further analysis. Cells in 6-cm dishes were solubilized by incubation for 30 min in 1 ml/dish of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, plus 1:200 protease inhibitor mixture. In the experiments shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, phosphatase inhibitors were also included (10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 nmsodium orthovanadate, and 100 nm okadaic acid). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min. The supernatant fractions were collected and then incubated for 2–18 h at 4 °C with HA11 (1:5,000), a monoclonal antibody against HA, or M2 (1:5000), a monoclonal antibody against FLAG. The incubation was continued for another 2 h in the presence of protein A-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B (protein A beads) (5 mg/sample).

After dilution with 90 μl of 20 mmphosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), 50 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm NaN3, the receptors were incubated at 37 °C for 10 h in the presence of 0.5 units of peptide PNGaseF. Alternatively, immunoprecipitates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.14 m β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm sodium azide, 5 mm EDTA, and 500 units of PNGaseF. For dephosphorylation (52Merello S. Parodi A.J. Couso R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7281-7287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), immunopurified receptors from a 6-cm dish of cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then incubated with up to 100 units/ml alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 30 min. Where noted, receptors were absorbed for 2–18 h at 4 °C on wheat germ agglutinin (20-μl suspension/1 ml of cell lysate) and then deglycosylated. In all enzymatic steps, control lanes show preparations that were incubated identically but without enzyme. Membrane preparations or immunopurified receptors were boiled for 2 min and resolved along with prestained molecular mass markers on 10% SDS-PAGE as described previously (36Xie Z. Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When the boiling step was omitted and samples were run without heating or after heating to 37 °C, the ratio of monomers to dimers was not altered, but much of the receptor did not enter the gel. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then subjected to two sequential 1-h incubations with primary (1:10,000 HA11, or M2) and secondary (1:2,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG) antibodies, respectively, and immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence. All blots are representative of experiments repeated 2–6 times. In some experiments, the apparent intensity of TRH receptor bands increased after TRH treatment. Control experiments confirmed that equal amounts of protein had been loaded per lane and that all immunoreactive receptors had been solubilized by lysis buffer and entered the gel, suggesting that the immunoreactivity of receptor may be increased after TRH treatment. Cells on 6-cm dishes were washed twice and incubated for 1–2 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then incubated for 3–4 h in the same buffer containing 0.2–0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate, washed 3 times, lysed, and treated as described above in buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitates from each dish were suspended in 50–65 μl of sample buffer, in some cases after deglycosylation with PNGaseF or dephosphorylation with potato acid phosphatase; 5–10 μl were subsequently used for Western blots, and 10–30 μl were used for phosphorimaging. Lanes contained equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 32P. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose paper and either immunoblotted or analyzed for 32P-containing bands on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To identify TRH receptors by immunocytochemistry, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and stained with HA11 (1:1000) followed by rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:200) as previously described (49Yu R. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 737-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure calcium responses, cells were grown on glass coverslips and loaded with fura2/AM in buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution at room temperature. The cells were washed and incubated in the same buffer at 37 °C. Cells were alternately excited with 340- and 380-nm light, and fluorescence emission was measured at 490 nm; 340/380 fluorescence ratios were determined every 1200 ms (53Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteins were determined by the Lowry or Bradford methods using bovine serum albumin as standard. Spe"
https://openalex.org/W1989217499,"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 plays a critical role in vasculogenesis during embryonic development and pathological angiogenesis, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing its functions. Here we investigated the role of tyrosine 1212 on mouse VEGFR-2 autophosphorylation and its signal transduction relay in endothelial cells. Mutation of tyrosine 1212 on VEGFR-2 to phenylalanine severely impaired the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and its ability to associate with and activate Src. This mutation also reduced the VEGFR-2 ability to phosphorylate phospholipase Cγ1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Unlike mutation of tyrosine 1212 to phenylalanine, replacement of tyrosine 1212 with glutamic acid preserved the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 and activation of VEGFR-2-associated signaling proteins including Src, phospholipase Cγ1, and MAPK. Further analysis showed that Src activation is not required for activation of VEGFR-2, since cells co-expressing wild type receptor with kinase dead Src or wild type Src displayed no apparent effect in the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Similarly, expression of wild type VEGFR-2 in fibroblast (SYF) cells obtained from the triple knockout Src family kinases showed normal ligand-dependent autophosphorylation.

Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7394) Google Scholar). Activation of VEGFR-2 elicits endothelial cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and permeability to macromolecules (7Waltenberger J. Calaesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that feature the activity of VEGFR-2 are largely unknown. As with other receptor tyrosine kinases, binding of its ligand induces receptor dimerization, leading to autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR-2. Many tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR-2 have been shown to be phosphorylated in response to ligand binding to the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 (10Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation sites in general are either involved in the regulation of kinase activity or serve as binding sites for SH2- and phosphotyrosine binding-containing signaling proteins (12Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosines 1054 and 1059 in the activation loop of VEGFR-2 has been shown to be required for its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (13Kendall R.L. Rutledge R.Z. Mao X. Tebben A.J. Hungate R.W. Thomas K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6453-6460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similarly, replacement of lysine 866 residue with arginine in the ATP binding pocket of VEGFR-2 abolishes its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This suggests that the kinase activation of VEGFR-2 depends on its intrinsic kinase activity. In addition, ligand stimulation also causes many other tyrosine sites mainly outside of the kinase domain to be phosphorylated. These phosphotyrosine sites along with their surrounding amino acids, act as docking sites for SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins (12Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). For instance, recently we have shown that tyrosines 799 and 1173 of mouse VEGFR-2 act as binding sites for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Replacement of these tyrosine sites with phenylalanine impairs the ability of VEGFR-2 to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Noticeably, mutations of these tyrosine sites do not influence the intrinsic kinase activity or ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of the VEGFR-2 (14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has been suggested that in addition to their catalytic domains, other tyrosine sites located outside the catalytic domains of receptor tyrosine kinases also contribute to full activation. For instance, tyrosine residues located in the juxtamembrane domain of PDGFR-β, EGF receptor, and Eph receptor are required for their full catalytic activation (16Ataliotis P. Symes K. Chou M.M., Ho, L. Mercola M. Development. 1995; 121: 3099-3110PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H.

Mutation of tyrosines 579 and 581 to phenylalanine in the juxtamembrane domain of PDGFR-β abolishes its ligand-dependent kinase activation and its ability to associate with the signaling proteins such as Src, PLCγ1, and RasGAP (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To date, the molecular mechanisms responsible for contribution of these tyrosine sites to receptor activation are not well understood. Until recently, it has been thought that activity of Src family kinases is required for the ligand-dependent kinase activation of PDGFR-β, since mutation of Src binding sites, tyrosines 579 and 581, on the PDGFR-β significantly reduces the kinase activity of PDGFR-β (17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A more recent study demonstrated that Src family kinases are not responsible for the loss of kinase activity of PDGFR-β, since this receptor is fully functional and highly autophosphorylated after PDGF stimulation in fibroblast cells obtained from the triple knockout of Src family (Src, Yes, Fyn) kinases (20Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that tyrosine residues located outside the kinase domain of receptor tyrosine kinases also play a crucial role in the ligand-stimulated kinase activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. We report here the identification of a unique and novel tyrosine residue in the carboxyl domain of VEGFR-2 responsible for full autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, its ability to activate VEGFR-2-associated signal transduction molecules, and biological responses in endothelial cells. Our findings suggest that phosphorylation of tyrosine 1212 on VEGFR-2 may serve as a key regulatory mechanism for modulation of kinase activation of VEGFR-2 and thus angiogenesis. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20), anti-PLCγ, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit anti-phospho-MAPK was purchased from New England BioLabs (Boston, MA). Rabbit anti-phospho-PLCγ antibody and phospho-Src antibody were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Rabbit anti-VEGFR-2 antibody was made to amino acids corresponding to the kinase insert or carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 (8Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol.

Anti-Src antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing CKR and mutant receptors including F1173/CKR and F1212/CKR were established by a retroviral system as described previously (14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding for CKR, mutant receptors, Src, and kinase-dead Src (Src/KD) were cloned into retroviral vectors and transfected into 293-GPG cells. Viral supernatants were collected for 7 days, concentrated by centrifugation, and used as previously described (21Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The VEGFR-2 chimera (CKR) was used as a template to construct the mutations. CKR was subcloned into pGEMT cloning vector, and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method (22Horton M. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 77: 61-68Crossref Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis primers for replacement of tyrosine 1173 described previously (14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Upstream and downstream primers for making F1212 were AAATTCCATTTTGACAACACA and TGTGTTGTCAAAATGGAATTT, respectively. To generate E1212/CKR, the same primers were used, but TTT encoding for Phe was replaced with GAA encoding Glu. The resultant mutations were verified by sequencing and were subsequently cloned into pLNCX2 vector by NotI and SalI sites. PAE cells expressing CKR and CKR mutants were grown in semiconfluent culture conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with glutamate, penicillin, and streptomycin and serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were left either resting or stimulated with 40 ng/ml CSF-1 for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with H/S buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4) and lysed in lysis buffer (EB; 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Proteins were immunoprecipitated by using appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with 1.0 ml of EB. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane. For Western blot analysis, the membranes were incubated for 60 min in Block solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes then were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in Block for another 60 min. Membrane was washed three times in Western rinse, incubated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, washed, and developed with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, membranes were stripped by incubating them in a stripping buffer containing 6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min, washed in Western rinse, and reprobed with the antibody of interest. The Src kinase assay was performed as described previously (23Rahimi N. Hung W. Tremblay E. Saulnier R. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from PAE cells expressing wild type CKR or F1212/CKR were prepared, and equal protein amounts from each cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognizes Src, Yes, and Fyn, and half of each immunoprecipitate was assayed for Src kinase activity by incubating with 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4), 5 μg of freshly prepared acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) min, and then 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Serine and threonine phosphorylations were hydrolyzed by incubating the SDS-gel in 1m KOH at 45 °C for 30 min, followed by fixing in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature, and dried at 80 °C under a vacuum and autoradiographed. Cell lysates from PAE cells expressing CKR and F1212/CKR were prepared, and equal protein amounts of each lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with cold lysis buffer and once with cold kinase buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4). In vitro VEGFR-2 kinase activity was determined by incubating immunoprecipitates with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Serine and threonine phosphorylations were hydrolyzed by incubating the SDS-gel in 1 m KOH at 45 °C for 30 min, followed by fixing and drying as described above, and autoradiographed.

Since these receptors are very often expressed in the endothelial cells, it has been difficult to address the activation of specific signaling molecules by the individual receptors. We have recently constructed a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of human CSF-1R/c-fms, fused with the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of murine VEGFR-2 (8Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This model permitted us to dissect the function of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells by selectively stimulating the receptor with CSF-1. Using the chimera system of VEGFR-2, we have shown that tyrosines 799 and 1173 are phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding sites and are required for endothelial cell proliferation (14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have aimed to address the role of other tyrosine residues on VEGFR-2-mediated signal transduction. For this purpose, we have made additional mutations on mouse VEGFR-2 including tyrosines 820, 952, 997, 1212, and 1221. 2R. D. Meyer, V. Dayanir, F. Majnoun, and N. Rahimi, unpublished data. Our initial evaluation of the tyrosine mutant receptors showed that mutation of tyrosine 1212 unexpectedly impaired the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2. This observation prompted us to characterize it further. In the current study, we have focused only on tyrosines 1173 and 1212. As illustrated in Fig.1A, tyrosines 1173 and 1212 are located at the C terminus of VEGFR-2. The tyrosine mutant receptors are named F1173/CKR and F1212/CKR, respectively, and are expressed in PAE cells. PAE cells expressing either an empty vector (pLNCX2), CKR, F1173/CKR, or F1212/CKR were lysed, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis by using an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. As Fig. 1B shows, the wild type and the tyrosine mutant receptors are expressed at similar levels in PAE cells. As expected, cells expressing the empty vector, pLNCX2, were negative for receptor expression (Fig.1B). To analyze the role of tyrosine 1212 on the autophosphorylation of chimeric VEGFR-2 (CKR), we first compared the ability of F1212/CKR to become phosphorylated in response to CSF-1 with wild type CKR and F1173/CKR, which we have previously shown normally phosphorylated in response to CSF-1 stimulation (14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PAE cells expressing these receptors were stimulated with CSF-1 (40 ng/ml) for 10 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated using an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig.2A shows that both wild type CKR and F11173/CKR were autophosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation. In contrast to wild type CKR and F1173/CKR, F1212/CKR was poorly autophosphorylated following CSF-1 stimulation under identical experimental conditions. Note that approximately equal amounts of receptor were present in each group (Fig. 2B). To test the ability of F1212/CKR to become autophosphorylated in vitro, the immunoprecipitated F1212/CKR was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Similarly, the autophosphorylation of F1212/CKR was greatly reduced, whereas a robust autophosphorylation of wild type receptor was evident (Fig. 2C). Next, we analyzed the kinetics of autophosphorylation of F1212/CKR. To this end, cells expressing CKR and F1212/CKR were stimulated with CSF-1 for different times, and kinetics of autophosphorylation of the two receptors were evaluated by immunoprecipitating the receptors with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody and blotting them with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After 5 min of stimulation of cells expressing wild type CKR with CSF-1, a robust autophosphorylation of the receptor was observed and lasted up to 15 min. After 15 min of stimulation, the autophosphorylation of CKR gradually decreased (Fig. 2D). In contrast to enhanced ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of CKR, autophosphorylation of F1212/CKR was rather transient and was less intense. Its maximal autophosphorylation was observed after 5 min of CSF-1 stimulation, and after 30 min of stimulation no significant phosphorylation of receptor was observed (Fig. 2D). To determine whether an increase in concentration of CSF-1 overcomes the reduced autophosphorylation of F1212/CKR, cells expressing F1212/CKR were stimulated with increasing concentrations of CSF-1 ranging from 40–500 ng/ml. The result showed that stimulation with a higher concentration of ligand did not substantially improve F1212/CKR autophosphorylation (data not shown). To test whether mutation of tyrosine 1212 on VEGFR-2/FLK-1 (nonchimeric receptor) also impairs its ligand-dependent autophosphorylation, we also made F1212/VEGFR-2 and expressed it in PAE cells. The result, as demonstrated in Fig. 2F, shows that VEGF stimulation of PAE cells expressing wild type VEGFR-2 induces a robust tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type receptor but not of F1212/VEGFR-2. Altogether, information obtained from both chimeric and nonchimeric VEGFR-2 systems suggests that tyrosine 1212 plays a critical role in ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2. To elucidate the role of tyrosine 1212 in activation of signaling molecules, we evaluated activation of a number of signaling molecules including Src, PLCγ1, and MAPK. We initially tested the ability of F1212/CKR to associate with Src family kinases. To test this possibility, we tested the ability of GST-SH2-Src to bind CKR and F1212/CKR in an in vitro binding assay. To this end, cell lysates were incubated with GST-SH2-Src fusion protein linked to glutathione-Sepharose. The associated proteins were eluted, and the presence of CKR protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. In the cell lysates of CSF-1-stimulated cells expressing CKR, GST-SH2 Src protein formed stable complexes with CKR protein. However, cell lysates of CSF-1-stimulated cells expressing F1212/CKR incubated with GST-SH2 Src protein were negative for F1212/CKR protein (Fig. 3A). To assess Src activation, cells expressing wild type CKR and F1212/CKR were stimulated for 10 and 30 min, and Src family proteins (Src, Fyn and Yes) were immunoprecipitated with a pan anti-Src antibody that recognizes Src, Fyn, and Yes. The immunoprecipitated proteins were either subjected to Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific Src antibody or subjected to an in vitro Src kinase assay using acid-denatured enolase as a substrate. As Fig. 3 (B andD) shows, stimulation of cells expressing wild type CKR with CSF-1 resulted in activation of Src in a time-dependent manner. In contrast to wild type CKR, stimulation of F1212/CKR failed to significantly activate Src in both in vitro kinase assay and Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-Src antibody. To examine the ability of F1212/CKR to activate other signaling proteins, we also examined activation of PLCγ and MAPK. To this end, cells were stimulated with CSF-1 for 10 min and evaluated by subjecting total cell lysates to Western blot analysis by using phosphospecific antibodies that recognize the active form PLCγ and MAPK, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 4(A and C), stimulation of cells expressing CKR and F1173/CKR resulted in significant activation of PLC1γ and MAPK. However, stimulation of PLCγ1 and MAPK by F1212/CKR was greatly reduced. In addition, F1212/CKR failed to stimulate SHC phosphorylation (data not shown). In human VEGFR-2, tyrosine 1175 (corresponding to 1173 on mouse VEGFR-2) is reported to be responsible for PLCγ1 activation (11Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, as we previously reported (Ref. 14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and data presented here), in this system, mutation of tyrosine 1173 to phenylalanine causes no measurable effect on PLCγ1 activation. Collectively, these data suggest that mutation of tyrosine 1212 to phenylalanine abolishes the ability of VEGFR-2 to activate a number of signaling proteins, including Src, PLCγ1, and MAPK. Since mutation of tyrosine 1212 of VEGFR-2 to phenylalanine impairs the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of receptor, it is difficult to analyze the role of tyrosine 1212 on VEGFR-2-mediated signal transduction relay. To overcome this problem, we have replaced tyrosine 1212 with glutamic acid. This type of mutation has been suggested to be a useful approach for characterization of sensitive tyrosine sites on the receptor tyrosine kinases when their mutation to phenylalanine interferes with receptor activation (27Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test whether replacement of tyrosine 1212 with glutamic acid can rescue and preserve the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2, we mutated tyrosine 1212 to phenylalanine and expressed it in a similar manner in PAE cells. As demonstrated in Fig.5A, E1212/CKR, unlike F1212/CKR, is fully autophosphorylated following stimulation of PAE cells expressing E1212/CKR, whereas F1212/CKR failed to undergo ligand-dependent autophosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 5, A andC). To test whether E1212/CKR is also able to activate signaling proteins, we initially evaluated the ability of this receptor to activate Src. As demonstrated in Fig. 5D, E1212/CKR was able to activate Src significantly in a ligand- and time-dependent manner. Indeed, it also appears that E1212/CKR was able to activate Src slightly better than wild type receptor, as is evident by its ability to activate Src (Fig.5D). To test the ability of E1212/CKR to associate with Src, we subjected cell lysates obtained from cells expressing E1212/CKR to an in vitro binding assay using GST-SH2-Src fusion protein. Fig. 5F shows that wild type receptor and E1212/CKR but not F1212 can associate with Src following stimulation of cells with ligand. Collectively, these results suggest that tyrosine 1212 is not involved in association with Src and its activation. We also evaluated the ability of E1212/CKR to activate other signaling proteins, including PLCγ and MAPK. As demonstrated in Fig.6A, E1212/CKR, like wild type receptor, was able to activate PLCγ in a time-dependent manner. Similarly, E1212/CKR was able to activate MAPK in manner similar to CKR stimulation (Fig. 6C).Figure 6Replacement of tyrosine 1212 with glutamic acid (E) preserves the VEGFR-2-dependent activation of PLC γ and MAPK. Serum-starved PAE cells expressing CKR, F1212/CKR, and E1212/CKR were stimulated with CSF-1 for indicated times, and total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-PLCγ1 antibody (A) or anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (C). The same membranes were reprobed with anti- PLCγ1 antibody and anti-MAPK antibody, respectively (B and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recently, it has been suggested that activation of Src may play a critical role in autophosphorylation of some receptor tyrosine kinases, including the EGF receptor, CSF-1 receptor, and PDGFR (15Reith A.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To test whether Src activation is required for full autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, we initially co-expressed wild type Src and kinase-dead Src (Src/KD) in PAE cells. Fig.7A illustrates overexpression of wild type Src or kinase-dead Src (Src/KD) in PAE cells expressing CKR. Overexpression of kinase-dead Src significantly reduced the Src activity in PAE cells; conversely, overexpression of wild-type Src increased Src kinase activation (data not shown). To analyze the effect of overexpression of Src and Src/KD in CKR autophosphorylation, we first stimulated these cells with CSF-1 and evaluated its tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 7B shows that overexpression of Src is not required for overall tyrosine phosphorylation of CKR. To test the role of Src in CKR tyrosine phosphorylation in a more convincing manner, we expressed CKR in a triple knockout (Src, Yes, Fyn) fibroblast cells, SYF. The data showed that stimulation of CKR expressed in SYF cells results in a ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in a similar manner to that of CKR stimulated in PAE cells (Fig.7D). Collectively, the data suggest that Src family kinases are not required for full activation of CKR, and furthermore, the data indicate that the reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of F1212/CKR is not associated with Src activity in target cells. Activation of VEGFR-2 is considered to be an essential requirement for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, which is associated with many human pathological disorders ranging from cancer to diabetes (3Kim K.J., Li, B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar, 4Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4805) Google Scholar, 5Folkman J. D'Amore P Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of activation of VEGFR-2 is largely unknown. In the current study, we have examined the requirement of tyrosine 1212 for VEGFR-2 functions. Our results indicate that the presence of tyrosine 1212 is essential for the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and its association with signaling proteins in endothelial cells. Replacement of tyrosine 1212 with phenylalanine on chimeric VEGFR-2 severely impaired its autophosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation bothin vivo and in vitro. The effect of mutation of tyrosine 1212 on autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 was surprising, since mutation of other tyrosines including 799, 820, 952, 997, 1173, and 1221 did not alter the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 (14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).2 These findings demonstrate that the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 in part requires the presence of tyrosine 1212 for its full activation. In addition to impairment in the autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, mutation of tyrosine 1212 also caused the receptor not to associate with and activate Src kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of other signaling molecules including PLCγ1 and MAPK were also greatly affected. How does tyrosine 1212 influence the kinase activation of VEGFR-2? Initial biochemical analysis of other growth receptors such as PDGFR-β, EGFR, c-kit, c-fms, and Eph suggested that mutation of one or two tyrosine residues at the juxtamembrane domain to phenylalanine interferes with the receptor's kinase activation. The tyrosine mutant receptors at the juxtamembrane domain also failed to activate Src family kinases (15Reith A.D. Ellis C. Maroc N. Pawson T. Bernstein A. Dubreuil P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ataliotis P. Symes K. Chou M.M., Ho, L. Mercola M. Development. 1995; 121: 3099-3110PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on this correlation, it has been suggested that Src family kinases in part might be responsible for full activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (15Reith A.D. Ellis C. Maroc N. Pawson T. Bernstein A. Dubreuil P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ataliotis P. Symes K. Chou M.M., Ho, L. Mercola M. Development. 1995; 121: 3099-3110PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mori S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, a recent finding demonstrating that PDGFR-β is fully functional and autophosphorylated in triple knockout Src (SYF) cells undermines the previous conclusion (20Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, our study demonstrates that ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in Src-deficient cells (SYF) is not impaired, suggesting that Src kinases are not engaged in the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2. The role of tyrosine residues located outside the kinase domain of receptor tyrosine kinases in general and the role of phosphorylation of tyrosine 1212 in VEGFR-2 activation in particular are not clear. One possible explanation is that certain tyrosine residues located outside the catalytic domain of receptor tyrosine kinases play a dual function by both functioning as a docking site for SH2-containing cytoplasmic signaling proteins and participating in autoinhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases. The idea that juxtamembrane and carboxyl domains are involved in autoinhibition of kinase activity of receptor tyrosine kinases is supported by the recent crystal structure of TIE2/Tek and EphB2. For instance, in the unstimulated state, the carboxyl domain of TIE2 occupies its substrate binding sites; however, autophosphorylation of tyrosine sites in the carboxyl domain of TIE2 exposes its phosphotyrosine residues for substrate binding and kinase activation. The juxtamembrane domain of EphB2 may play a similar role in suppression of kinase activation of EphB2 receptor. The phosphorylation at the tyrosine residue appears to relive the repression of receptor by causing dissociation of the juxtamembrane domain from the kinase region (27Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with the above findings, the recent study on the EphB2 receptor also suggests a possible regulatory role for tyrosine phosphorylation sites located outside the kinase domain. Replacement of tyrosine 605 and 611 with phenylalanine on the EphB2 receptor abolishes its kinase activation and its ability to associate with signaling proteins. Remarkably, replacement of the same tyrosine sites with glutamic acid preserves the EphB2 kinase activation (27Zisch A.H. Pazzagli C. Freeman A.L. Schneller M. Hadman M. Smith J.W. Ruoslahti E. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that the replacement of tyrosine 1212 on VEGFR-2 with glutamic acid also maintains the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 for possible involvement of this tyrosine residue in the autoregulation of kinase activation of VEGFR-2. A recent study by Takahashi et al. (11Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) shows that tyrosine 1214 in human VEGFR-2 (corresponding to tyrosine 1212 in mouse VEGFR-2) also is autophosphorylated in vivo (11Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to what we observed with murine VEGFR-2, they found that replacement of tyrosine 1214 in the human VEGFR-2 with phenylalanine did not affect PLCγ1 activation, whereas mutation of 1175 (corresponding to tyrosine 1173 on mouse VEGFR-2) did (11Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The reason for this apparent discrepancy is not clear; however, this could reflect some unanticipated differences between the human and murine VEGFR-2. Alternatively, it could be a reflection of differences between the cell lines used in the two analyses. The mechanism by which PLCγ1 is activated by VEGFR-2 remains elusive, since other tyrosine sites such as 799 and 952 were also reported to be responsible for activation of PLCγ1 (32Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Brock T.A. Waxham M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Ozes O.N. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6059-6062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the primary contribution of tyrosine phosphorylation of 1212 is to regulate the kinase activation of VEGFR-2, whereas autophosphorylation of other tyrosine sites such as 799, 1173, and 957 function for mediating interactions with signaling proteins (11Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 14Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Further studies will reveal how tyrosine 1212 of VEGFR-2 contributes to ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 and whether this tyrosine residue also associates with SH2-containing signaling proteins. In conclusion, we have identified tyrosine 1212 of VEGFR-2 responsible for ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 and its associated signaling proteins. Regulation of angiogenesis is considered to be a promising approach for treatment of many human diseases associated with uncontrolled angiogenesis. This study suggests that targeting the tyrosine 1212 of VEGFR-2 may provide effective therapeutic interventions aimed to curb angiogenesis. We thank Dr. M.

Parasitol. 1996; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Association with the host skeleton or insertion across its membrane is thought to be required to keep the protein in the periphery of the red cell. Soluble exported proteins are expected to be ingested with hemoglobin and delivered to the fv within the parasite (3Gratzer W.B. Dluzewski A.R. Semin.

Ingestion occurs via a specialized organelle called the cytostome, which is a double membrane invagination of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) and PVM (see Fig. 1). The cytostome pinches off to form a large, double membrane vesicle containing hemoglobin that fuses with the fv where hemoglobin is degraded (Fig. 1). The released, toxic-free heme is detoxified by polymerization to hemozoin (6Fitch C.D. Kanjananggulpan P. J. Biol.

This protein has been detected in the red cell as well as the fv, leading to the suggestion that it is ingested from the red cell by the cytostome along with hemoglobin and subsequently delivered to the fv.

Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 14Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This has rendered attractive a general model that both membrane and lumenal components of food vacuole may be delivered to the PV and the red cell from where they are internalized into the fv (5Goldberg D.E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is because (as indicated earlier) soluble proteins in the red cell cytoplasm are not expected to be segregated. Yet whether cytosolic antigens in the red cell can avoid ingestion has never been evaluated. In mammalian cells and yeast, lumenal, resident proteases are thought to be exported from the ER and sorted in the Golgi for transport to the lysosomes and fv, respectively (15Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), but to what extent this model serves in lower eukaryotic pathogens like the malaria parasite is not known. The function of HRPII in heme polymerization has been difficult to evaluate in intact, infected red cells. Although the heme polymerase activity (which is ascribed to the histidine-rich sequences of this protein and other histidine-rich proteins and peptides) has been demonstrated in vitro (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 13Papalexis V. Siomos M.A. Campanale N. Guo X. Kocak G. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a laboratory cell line with a natural deletion in HRPII and HRPIII can still produce hemozoin (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, additional histidine-rich proteins may contribute to hemozoin production. Our understanding has been further limited by the fact that although there is evidence that PfHRPII is delivered to the infected red cell cytosol and the fv as well as the extracellular medium, a detailed characterization quantitating the distribution of the protein and its transport properties has not been undertaken. Analysis of the primary structure of HRPII using Signal P suggests an N-terminal signal sequence and predicted cleavage site. However, the values for both are low, and this raises further questions of whether the protein is efficiently recruited into the ER-Golgi secretory pathway in its transport to diverse cellular destinations. In this study, we have transfected P. falciparum-infected red cells to express PfHRPII tagged with a C-terminal c-Myc epitope under continuous selection. Using high resolution microscopy and biochemical cell fractionation assays, we have characterized the distribution of the native protein and its Myc-tagged counterpart in the parasite and the red cell to understand their functional consequences. The specific questions we asked were the following. (i) Are PfHRPII and PfHRPIImyc exported to the red cell and subsequently endocytosed into the parasite or released across the red cell membrane? (ii) Are PfHRPII and PfHRPIImyc detected within the parasite and the fv? (iii) Are these proteins recruited into the secretory pathway, and do cells expressing HRPIImyc show perturbations in secretory organization, protein export to the red cell and/or the fv? (v) Do the transformed cells show changes in heme polymerization and/or sensitivity to chloroquine? RPMI medium 1640 and A+ human serum were obtained from Invitrogen and Gemini Biological Products (Calabasas, CA), respectively. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cappel, ICN. Monoclonal mouse anti-c-Myc antibodies, 9E10, were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies to PfHRP II (HG12, 87) were obtained from Dr. Diane Taylor. Monoclonal antibodies to PfPlasmepsin I were developed in the Goldberg laboratory (17Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Antibodies to PfBiP and PfERD2 were developed in the Haldar laboratory. P. falciparum strains of 3D7, ACPGFP, and E8 were cultured in vitro by a modification of the method of Trager and Jensen (18Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar) and Haldaret al. (19Haldar K. Ferguson M.A.J. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4969-4974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine stage-specific events (from 6 to 42 h), parasites were synchronized to 4 h of growth using a combination of Percoll purification and sorbitol treatments, cultured to 10% parasitemia, and harvested at the indicated times. Parasite growth was measured by examining Giemsa-stained blood smears and hypoxanthine incorporation (20Akompong T. VanWye J. Ghori N. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) into parasite DNA. Cell counts were determined using a hematocytometer. The plasmid pHCHRP2m was constructed as follows. HRP II open reading frame was PCR-amplified by using primers GCTCGAGATGGTTTCCTTCTCAAAAAATAAAGTATTATCCG and GCAAGCTTAATGGCGTAGGCAATGTGTGGCGGC from P. falciparumFCB total DNA, restricted with BamHI, and cloned intoSmaI-BglII-restricted pBSExp-1 to introduce c-Myc epitope sequence at the 3′ end. The insert was sequenced and then recovered by XhoI digestion to clone into the plasmid pHC1 (a gift from Dr. Alan Cowman, Melbourne, Australia) to obtain pHCHRP2m. The construction of the ACPGFP line has previously been described (21Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Catron D. Ji D.D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ring-infected red cells at a parasitemia of 10% were transfected with Qiagen-purified supercoiled plasmid DNA by electroporation as described by Fidock et al. (22Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad Gene pulser II with settings of 0.31 KV and 950 microfarads. Forty-eight h after transfection, pyrimethamine (Sigma) was added to the culture media and maintained at a concentration of 100 ng/ml for 2 days. The concentration of drug was subsequently reduced to 25 ng/ml and maintained at 25 ng/ml. Parasites were cloned by serial dilution to isolate pyrimethamine-resistant HRPII expressing P. falciparum E8 clone. Infected red cells were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips (20Akompong T. VanWye J. Ghori N. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the cells were permeabilized in 0.01% saponin to release red cell contents. Intact or permeabilized cells were subsequently fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 20 min. The cells were incubated with 0.2% gelatin for 30 min followed by incubation with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies (diluted with PBS containing 0.01% saponin). Isolated fvs were allowed to air dry and then were permeabilized with saponin and probed with primary and secondary antibodies. Epifluorescence images (30 optical sections of 0.2-mm thickness) were collected by DeltaVision microscopy with a 100× oil objective (1.35 NA) attached to a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A series of single optical sections were obtained, and the images were deconvolved on a SGI work station by using SoftWoRx Version 2.5. Saponin permeabilization was carried out by mixing infected erythrocytes with 10 volumes of 0.01% saponin followed by incubating at 4 °C for 10 min (this selectively lyses erythrocyte membrane, tubovesicular membrane (TVN), PVM but is expected to leave intact the parasite plasma membrane). The saponin lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 2,200 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (enriched in the erythrocyte cytosolic content) was collected. The pellet containing isolated parasites was washed three times with cold PBS. Supernatant and pellet fractions were assayed for glutamate dehydrogenase activity (by measuring the change inA 340 as a result of the conversion of NADPH to NADP+ as described by Vander Jagt et al. (23Vander Jagt D.L. Intress C. Heidrich J.E. Mrema J.E. Rieckmann K.H. Heidrich H.G. J. Parasitol. 1982; 68: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) to determine whether the parasite plasma membrane had ruptured or parasites contaminated the supernatant fraction. Hypotonic lysates were prepared by mixing infected cells with 10 volumes of water followed by vigorous vortexing in the presence of protease inhibitors. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant and pellet fractions were collected. The samples obtained after saponin treatment or hypotonic lysis were solubilized in 5 volumes of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 3–5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min and subsequently incubated with either anti-HRPII antibody (1:1000) or anti-C-myc antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. They were then washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were developed with ECL solutions as per the manufacturer's protocol. To release hemozoin from parasites, infected cells were first lysed with 0.01% saponin for 10 min at room temperature to release parasites from red cell ghosts. The parasites were washed 3 times with PBS, resuspended in 2.5% SDS in PBS, and subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded, and the insoluble pellet was washed again in 2.5% SDS in PBS and then dissolved in 20 mm NaOH. The hemozoin content was measured by determining the absorbance at 400 nm and using a standard curve generated with hematin. Food vacuoles were isolated by the method of Goldberg et al. (31Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed 3× with PBS, resuspended in 5 volumes of 5% sorbitol, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 7 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 2200 × g for 10 min and the pellet was treated with saponin and processed as described by Goldberg et al. (31Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The resulting lysate was layered on top of a Percoll gradient. Isolated vacuoles were collected from the bottom fraction. The fv enzyme plasmepsin I was used as a marker for purification. Isolated fv fraction showed 10-fold enrichment with a yield of 30%. Red cells (1 × 109) infected with either 3D7 or E8 (15–20% parasitemia) were washed twice with methionine-free RPMI and incubated in 10 ml of PBS containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose and 500 μCi of [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with PBS at 4 °C. The cells were lysed with 0.01% saponin at room temperature for 10 min and subject to centrifugation at 2200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (red cell cytosol) was saved and processed for SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to film to analyze the pattern of exported proteins in the different lines. 1–2 × 108 cells from E8 or 3D7 cultures were washed in PBS and fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Excess aldehyde was removed, and the cells were incubated with anti-HRPII antibody for 30 min followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. The parasite nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (10 μl/ml). Where indicated, after fixation the cells were permeabilized by treatment with 0.05% saponin for 20 min and subsequently processed for antibody binding. Samples were analyzed on a BD PharMingen FACScan (FACSCALIBUR). Data was analyzed with CELLQuest software, and fluorescence histograms and dot plots were displayed on a four-decade logarithmic scale. E8-infected red cells were fixed in a mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde, 1% tannic acid, and 4% sucrose in a 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1 h. Samples were then block-stained in 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate, dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol, and embedded in Epon 812. Ultrathin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50% methanol and lead citrate and examined in a Zeiss CEM902 electron microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Samples were prepared for FEISEM as described by Chenet al. (25Chen M.M. Shi L. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Before sample application, 5 × 5-mm silica chips (Ted Pella, catalog #16008) were cleaned with ethanol, coated with polylysine, and then rinsed three times with distilled water. One-three nmol of heme polymer were applied onto chips in distilled water. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, heme crystals formed a thin layer on chip surfaces. Chips were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30–60 min. After one quick rinse with 50% ethanol, chips were rinsed consecutively in 50, 70, and 90% ethanol for 3 min each. After critical point drying for 1–2 h, chips were coated with chromium. Silica chips loaded with samples were ready for field emission in-lens scanning electron microscopy (LEO 1550) Plasmodium infection of red cells begins with the intracellular “ring” stage that lasts for the next 24 h. The parasite then matures through a second, morphologically distinct trophozoite stage (24–36 h) to enter the terminal stages of schizogony, where mitosis occurs and daughter merozoites assemble (36–48 h). At the end of schizogony, the infected red cells lyse to release merozoites (into the extracellular medium) that re-invade erythrocytes and thereby maintain the asexual cycle (Fig.1). As previously shown (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 13Papalexis V. Siomos M.A. Campanale N. Guo X. Kocak G. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Howard R.J. Shigehiko U. Aikawa M. Aley S.B. Leech J.H. Lew A.M. Wellems T.E. Rener J. Taylor D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), endogenous PfHRPII is detected in the infected erythrocyte cytoplasm of ring and schizont stages (Fig.2 A). Western blots also indicate that the protein is expressed in 12-h ring stage parasites and largely maintained through the trophozoite stage and in schizonts (Fig.2 B); however, northern blots show that HRPII RNA is present only in ring stages (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that after 24 h, trophozoites and schizonts do not synthesize PfHRPIIde novo, and most of the protein made in rings remains associated with these later stage parasites and are not transported to the extracellular medium. To examine what fraction of the total, cell-associated PfHRPII protein is exported from the parasite, we lysed synchronized, trophozoite-infected red cells (30–33 h; which express maximal levels of HRPII) with 0.01% saponin (Fig. 2 D, i). As shown, 97% was found in the supernatant fraction. This treatment does not release the parasite cytosolic enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (Fig.2 D, ii), confirming that the parasite plasma membrane is intact and is consistent with previous studies that saponin selectively perforates the red cell membrane and the PVM but not the parasite plasma membrane (23Vander Jagt D.L. Intress C. Heidrich J.E. Mrema J.E. Rieckmann K.H. Heidrich H.G. J. Parasitol. 1982; 68: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Crary J.L. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The secretory marker PfBiP is also not released, as expected if the parasite plasma membrane is intact (Fig. 2 D, iii). Together these data show that by the trophozoite stage (30–33 h) the vast majority of HRPII is exported from the parasite to the red cell. A time course of export from the parasite shown in Fig. 2 E,i, indicates that most of the export is achieved by the late ring (24 h) stage. 90% of this exported protein can be detected at schizogony (>36 h). The experimental error (due to variation in cell counts and low levels of cell loss at schizogony) is 10%, suggesting that the levels of exported protein essentially do not change after 24 h of development. That there is no new synthesis of protein after 24 h suggests that PfHRPII exported to the red cells does not undergo bulk endocytic uptake into the parasite throughout trophozoite development, although greater than 80% of the hemoglobin is ingested and digested during this time (Refs. 5Goldberg D.E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 28Akompong T. Ghori N. Haldar K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and data not shown). However, a small but constant amount of HRPII that corresponds to 3% of total trophozoite protein associates with the pellet fraction throughout asexual parasite growth (Fig. 2 E, ii), suggesting that there are mechanisms to retain a minor portion of PfHRPII in the parasite. Because the total levels of cell associated protein remain constant over time, the data in Fig. 2 argue against significant release of HRPII into the extracellular medium until the infected red blood cell ruptures. An early report (26Howard R.J. Shigehiko U. Aikawa M. Aley S.B. Leech J.H. Lew A.M. Wellems T.E. Rener J. Taylor D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) suggests that a histidine-labeled form of HRPII is exported into the extracellular medium. However definitive evidence obtained by combining short pulse times with appropriate chase times and quantitative immunoprecipitations were not provided. This makes it difficult to evaluate how much of the export detected was due to partial cell lysis. Pulse-chase studies are difficult to undertake with PfHRPII because the protein is methionine-poor and, thus, cannot be metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine with any efficiency. To further examine the relationship between the exported and parasite-associated pools of protein, we expressed intrans-PfHRPII tagged at its C terminus with Myc (see Fig.3 A) under thecam promoter using the pHC1 plasmid to establish the transformed E8 line (see “Materials and Methods”). Our unpublished studies suggested that cam is active at the trophozoite stage (data not shown). Western blots (Fig. 3 B) show that the expression of Myc-tagged HRPII protein in transformed E8 cells is detectable in 18-h rings. Low levels of HRPIImyc are also expressed in 12-h rings and can be detected in single cells by immunofluorescence assays (Fig. 3 A, ii) or by loading 2 × 107 or more of parasite material in Western blots (data not shown). Northern analysis (Fig. 3 C) using a 1-kilobase (kb) probe that detects HRPII RNA shows that transformed cells contain higher levels of message in the trophozoite and schizont stages compared with rings. By the (33–36 h) trophozoite stage, 85% of PfHRPIImyc is released by saponin treatment under conditions where parasite glutamate dehydrogenase and BiP are not released (Fig. 3,D and E). There is some reduction in the fraction released when higher levels of transgene are expressed at later times (>40 h). The reasons for this are unclear. However, because high levels of trans gene expression may be harmful to cells, subsequent analyses of transfected cells was restricted to 33-h trophozoites. A comparison of total HRPII protein in parent 3D7 and transformed E8 lines during intraerythrocytic development undertaken in Fig.4 A (where samples were run on the same gels and processed simultaneously) shows that rings may contain lower levels of the transgene product. However, as the parasites develop into trophozoites (up to 33 h), there is 3–4-fold more total HRPII protein in transformed cells; schizonts (>36 h) contain even higher levels. Transformed trophozoites release 3–4-fold more HRPII protein into the saponin supernatant (Fig.4 B). This closely reflects elevated levels of protein expression in these cells and suggests that, like its endogenous counterpart, PfHRPIImyc is primarily exported out of the parasite into red cell cytoplasm and remains there, even when 80% of the hemoglobin is ingested by the parasite. The release of HRPII and HRPIImyc into saponin-sensitive supernatant fractions suggested that they are soluble proteins in the erythrocytic milieu. However, saponin can intercalate with lipids like cholesterol and may, therefore, affect some forms of protein-membrane association. Thus, to determine what fraction of HRPII in 3D7 and E8 cells are soluble, we subjected cells to hypotonic lysis followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. As shown (Fig.4 C), 90 and 80% of HRPII appears to be soluble in the 3D7 and E8 cells, respectively. That 97 and 90% are, respectively, exported argues that the bulk of exported PfHRPII protein in both cell lines is soluble. However, a low fraction 10–20% may have a peripheral association with membranes. In addition, examination of consecutive optical sections through the depth of the infected red cells shows that most of the exported protein is detected in sections at the periphery of the red cell (Fig. 4 D). In contrast in intermediate sections, the signal is not prominent in the red cell. Thus, it is possible that HRPII and HRPIImyc may not freely diffuse through the red cell cytoplasm but may concentrate primarily at the periphery of the red cell and, thus, avoid ingestion along with hemoglobin. As indicated earlier, one previous study has proposed that at the trophozoite stage, HRPII is secreted across the red cell membrane into the extracellular medium (26Howard R.J. Shigehiko U. Aikawa M. Aley S.B. Leech J.H. Lew A.M. Wellems T.E. Rener J. Taylor D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Our present data (Figs. 2 B and 3 B) suggest that although HRPII protein is not quantitatively released from 3D7 or E8 cells, it localizes to the periphery of the red cells; thus, some fraction of the protein could be on the infected red cell surface. To address this we examined both parent and transformed lines for HRPII associated with the infected cell surface by flow cytometry (Fig.4 E). This is a highly sensitive method for protein determination on single cells as well as in a population. Infected erythrocytes can be distinguished from th"

In the course of this reaction, PCMT1 converts the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). Due to the high level of activity of this enzyme, particularly in the brain, it seemed of interest to investigate whether the lack of PCMT1 activity might alter the concentrations of these small molecules. AdoMet and AdoHcy were measured in mice lacking PCMT1 (Pcmt1−/−), as well as in their heterozygous (Pcmt1+/−) and wild type (Pcmt1+/+) littermates. Higher levels of AdoMet and lower levels of AdoHcy were found in the brains of Pcmt1−/−mice, and to a lesser extent in Pcmt1+/− mice, when compared withPcmt1+/+ mice. In addition, these levels appear to be most significantly altered in the hippocampus of the Pcmt1−/−mice. The changes in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio could not be attributed to increases in the activities of methionine adenosyltransferase II orS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in the brain tissue of these mice. Because changes in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio could potentially alter the overall excitatory state of the brain, this effect may play a role in the progressive epilepsy seen in thePcmt1−/− mice. l-Isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1) is a protein repair enzyme that initiates the conversion of abnormald-aspartyl and l-isoaspartyl residues to the normal l-aspartyl form.

Deamidation and Isoaspartate Formation in Peptides and Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 167-192Google Scholar). This spontaneous reaction results in the loss of ammonia (from asparaginyl residues) or water (from aspartyl residues) and the formation of the side chain into an intermediate succinimidyl ring. If this ring is hydrolyzed at the α-carbonyl group, the peptide bond is re-routed through the side chain carbonyl resulting in the formation of anl-isoaspartyl residue. The ring is also susceptible to racemization, allowing for the formation of d-aspartyl andd-isoaspartyl residues, as well. These aberrant residues can cause drastic conformational changes in their proteins, resulting in loss of biological activity (1Linder H. Helliger W. Exp.

However, just as cells have mechanisms to combat other forms of damage, they have at least one to restrict the accumulation of isoaspartyl residues. This mechanism involves the enzyme l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl)O-methyltransferase (PCMT1).1PCMT1 functions by transferring a methyl group from the moleculeS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to either the α-carboxyl group of the l-isoaspartyl residue or the β-carboxyl group of the d-aspartyl residue (7Murray E.D., Jr. Clarke S.

Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting methyl ester is then susceptible to spontaneous hydrolysis leading to the loss of methanol and the re-formation of the succinimidyl ring. If the intermediate ring structure then hydrolyzes at the β-carbonyl, which typically occurs about 30% of the time at physiological pH, the residue returns to the normal l-aspartyl form (10Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 70% of the time, the cyclic imide returns to one of the aberrant forms, which can be re-methylated by PCMT1 until the peptide or protein in which it resides is no longer a substrate for the enzyme. Therefore, one side effect of this repair mechanism may be a potentially large consumption of the methyl donor, AdoMet.When AdoMet donates its methyl group it becomesS-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). The concentration of AdoMet compared with that of AdoHcy is often used as an index for the activity of the AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer system in living organisms (12Baudry M. Chast F. Schwartz J.C. J. Neurochem. 1973; 20: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Hoffman D.R. Cornatzer W.E. Duerre J.A. Can. J.

(Lond.). 1995; 88: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, if the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio were lowered, it might indicate greater AdoMet “consumption” through increased methyltransferase activity. In rat studies, the administration of 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine (l-dopa) results in a significant increase in the activity of catecholamine-O-methyltransferase causing a reduction in the brain concentration of AdoMet, with a concomitant elevation in the level of AdoHcy, thereby lowering the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio (15Fuller R.W. Hemrick-Luecke S.K. Perry K.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1982; 223: 84-89PubMed Google Scholar). However, if 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-l-alanine continues to be administered, the level of AdoMet returns to normal due to the feedback regulation of methionine adenosyltransferase II (MAT II), the enzyme that produces AdoMet in the brain (16Zhao W.Q. Latinwo L. Liu X.X. Lee E.S. Lamango N. Charlton C.G. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 171: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Another enzyme that is important in maintaining a proper AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio isS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). AdoHcy must be kept from accumulating because many methyltransferases have a higher affinity for AdoHcy than AdoMet, making AdoHcy a potent inhibitor of many methylation reactions (17Poulton J.E. Butt V.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Hoffman D.R. Marion D.W. Cornatzer W.E. Duerre J.A. J. Biol.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 63-78Google Scholar).Although the levels of AdoMet and AdoHcy are normally well regulated, there are conditions under which the levels of these small molecules can be altered for prolonged periods, and they are often accompanied by severe physiological complications. For example, deficiencies in folic acid or vitamin B12 can cause a considerable decrease in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio (21Bottiglieri T. Nutr. Rev. 1996; 54: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These deficiencies lead to severe neurological disorders, such as demyelination of the spinal cord characterized by vacuolar myelopathic lesions. It has been suggested that the demyelination is caused by the defect in methylation (21Bottiglieri T. Nutr. Rev. 1996; 54: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by animal studies showing that similar lesions are produced in mice treated with cycloleucine, an inhibitor of methionine adenosyltransferase (21Bottiglieri T. Nutr. Rev. 1996; 54: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the case of deficiencies in glycine N-methyltranferase, a liver enzyme that is believed to serve as an alternate pathway for the conversion of AdoMet to AdoHcy, there is a significant increase in plasma AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios (22Mudd S.H. Cerone R. Schiaffino M.C. Fantasia A.R. Minniti G. Caruso U. Lorini R. Watkins D. Matiaszuk N. Rosenblatt D.S. Schwahn B. Rozen R. LeGros L. Kotb M. Capdevila A. Luka Z. Finkelstein J.D. Tangerman A. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. Wagner C. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2001; 24: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In humans, this condition has been associated with enlargement of the liver and elevation of serum liver transaminases (22Mudd S.H. Cerone R. Schiaffino M.C. Fantasia A.R. Minniti G. Caruso U. Lorini R. Watkins D. Matiaszuk N. Rosenblatt D.S. Schwahn B. Rozen R. LeGros L. Kotb M. Capdevila A. Luka Z. Finkelstein J.D. Tangerman A. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. Wagner C. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2001; 24: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because PCMT1 may have the capacity to use relatively large amounts of AdoMet (as suggested above), it seemed of interest to investigate whether the lack of this methyltransferase results in alterations in the AdoMet and AdoHcy levels in the recently developed PCMT1-deficient mouse.Mice lacking PCMT1 (Pcmt1−/− mice) have been generated independently by two groups in the last 5 years and exhibit the same major phenotype in each case (23Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is the development of progressive epilepsy that leads to an early death at an average of 6 weeks of age. It has been proposed that the severe neurological manifestations of these mice are due to the accumulation of one or more isoaspartyl-damaged proteins (such as tubulin, calmodulin, or synapsin) (23Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H.

Hippocampus. 2001; 11: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another theory proposes that the metabolism of a small molecule or neurotransmitter such asN-acetylaspartylglutamate may be affected by the lack of PCMT1 in these mice (27Kim E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20671-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although both theories are plausible, in this study we explore yet another possibility. Specifically, we ask if the deficiency of PCMT1 causes a change in the overall AdoMet methylation flux and whether this may be contributing to the seizure phenotype seen in the Pcmt1−/− mouse.DISCUSSIONIn rat brain, there is a significant decrease in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio between 1 and 4 weeks of age with a more gradual decrease during maturation (13Hoffman D.R. Cornatzer W.E. Duerre J.A. Can. J. Biochem. 1979; 57: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This trend is consistent with our results fromPcmt1+/+ mice between the ages of 20 and 50 days. Because this time period also appears to be the most critical in the development of fatal seizures in the Pcmt1−/− mice, we were interested in examining the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio inPcmt1−/− mice between these ages. Our results show that these mice, and to a limited extent their Pcmt1+/−littermates, exhibit a progressive elevation in their AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios when compared with Pcmt1+/+ mice. This elevation can either be interpreted as a decrease in the methylation flux or as an increase in AdoMet production and/or AdoHcy metabolism. However, after measuring the activities of the enzymes that regulate AdoMet production and AdoHcy metabolism in the brains of these mice, they were found to be altered in a way that would actually lead to a decrease in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio, not an increase. For example, in the brains of 50-day-old Pcmt1−/− and Pcmt1+/− mice, SAHH activity was either unchanged or slightly lowered, and MAT II activity was significantly reduced, perhaps due to feedback inhibition by the elevated levels of AdoMet. These findings indicate that the increase in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio is most likely a result of a decrease in the consumption of AdoMet as opposed to an increase in its production.One of the objectives of this study was to determine whether there was a direct cause and effect relationship between the lack of PCMT1 and the increase in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio. One way we attempted to accomplish this was to see if the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio was altered in the testes of Pcmt1−/− mice, another tissue in which PCMT1 is highly expressed in Pcmt1+/+ mice. Whereas AdoMet levels were higher in the testes of Pcmt1−/− mice at 40 and 50 days of age, we were unable to find significantly altered AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios for the ages studied here. Another way we attempted to determine whether there was a direct cause and effect relationship was to compare the localization of PCMT1 expression in the Pcmt1+/+ mouse brain with the localization of altered levels of the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio seen in the Pcmt1−/− mouse brain. When comparing the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio from Pcmt1−/− mice toPcmt1+/+ mice, the most significant elevation occurs in the hippocampus and cortex, and the lowest alteration occurs in the region of the thalamus. This correlates well with immunolocalization of the enzyme in rat (35Billingsley M.L. Kim S. Kuhn D.M. Neuroscience. 1985; 15: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Mizobuchi M. Murao K. Takeda R. Kakimoto Y. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Shirasawa T. Endoh R. Zeng Y.X. Sakamoto K. Mori H. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 188: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and mouse brain.3 These data suggest that the lack of the PCMT1 enzyme may be the primary cause of the altered AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios in Pcmt1−/− andPcmt1+/− mice; however, the extent of this effect may be limited to brain tissue.In Fig. 6, we depict a model for the condition of the Pcmt1−/− mouse in which the lack of PCMT1 decreases the overall methylation flux in the brain. This deficit results in a build up of AdoMet, a diminishment of AdoHcy, an accumulation of isoaspartyl-damaged proteins (X-isoAsp), and a potential increase in the methylation of other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase substrates (X-CH3). Any one of these effects could potentially lower the seizure threshold in the Pcmt1−/−mice. The altered AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio could affect the activity of one or more of the many other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, such as those involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, receptor transduction, DNA expression, or phospholipid methylation (55Clarke S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 63-78Google Scholar). For example, in several studies it has been suggested that the transduction of receptor-mediated events could be altered through membrane lipid methylation (42Hirata F. Strittmatter W.J. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In studies where reticulocyte ghosts were incubated with varying concentrations of AdoMet, the number of β-adrenergic receptor sites increased with a paralleled increase in membrane fluidity (43Bhattacharya A. Vonderhaar B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4489-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Aside from altering the activities of other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, it was also possible that higher levels of AdoMet could lead to greater synthesis of polyamines through the action of AdoMet decarboxylase. Polyamines have been shown to have excitatory properties when injected intraventricularly into mice (44Anderson D.J. Crossland J. Shaw G.G. Neuropharmacology. 1975; 14: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45Shaw G.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In these studies, it was demonstrated that even a small amount of spermine could cause extreme hyperexcitability in the mice, and convulsions could be precipitated by the slightest sound or touch.It is also possible that lower AdoHcy levels alone might affect the seizure threshold. For example, AdoHcy has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties in rabbit, rat, and cat (46Fonlupt P. Roche M. Andre A.C. Cronenberger L. Pacheco H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1980; 58: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that AdoHcy administration decreased epileptiform discharges after hippocampal stimulation and decreased the incidence of pentetrazol convulsions. AdoHcy has also been proposed as a candidate ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor based on its capacity to inhibit flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine recognition site of the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A, receptor (47Tsvetnitsky V. Campbell I.C. Gibbons W.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 282: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Probably the most convincing study on the anticonvulsant action of AdoHcy involves the induction of seizures in mice byl-methionine-dl-sulfoximine and the inhibition of these seizures by the co-administration of adenosine and homocysteine thiolactone (48Schatz R.A. Wilens T.E. Tatter S.B. Gregor P. Sellinger O.Z. J. Neurosci. Res. 1983; 10: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In these studies, it was determined that the most effective anticonvulsant action of this treatment occurred when cerebral AdoHcy levels were at their highest.While it is possible that an increase in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio may be responsible for lowering the seizure threshold in these mice, there is no evidence that externally administered AdoMet, which does not appear to be able to cross the plasma membrane (54Zawad J.S. Brown F.C. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), would produce the same effect. In fact, in a study of the use of AdoMet as an antidepressant for patients with chronic epilepsy, it was found that daily intravenous administration of AdoMet had no adverse effect on seizure frequency (49Reynolds E.H. Smith D. Treiman D. Trimble M.R. Advances in Neurology. Raven Press, New York1991: 44-58Google Scholar). On the other hand, the administration of folate, the levels of which are correlated with intracellular AdoMet levels in rat brain (53Ordonez L.A. Wurtman R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 160: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), can greatly aggravate seizure control in epilepsy patients (50Reynolds E.H. Lancet. 1973; 1: 1376-1378Abstract PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and in experimental animals (51Hommes O.R. Hollinger J.L. Jansen N.J.T. Schoofs M. vanderWiel Th. Kok J.C.N. Botez M.I. Reynolds E.H. Folic Acid in Neurology, Psychiatry and Internal Medicine. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1979: 285-316Google Scholar, 52Kaijima M. Riche D. Rousseva S. Moyanova S. Dimov S. Le Gal La Salle G. Exp. Neurol. 1984; 86: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Thus, orally (or intravenously) administered AdoMet would probably not mimic the effect we observe in the Pcmt1−/− mice, which is most likely an intracellular alteration of AdoMet/AdoHcy levels.Up to this point, the study of PCMT1 has usually been associated with aging research due to its firmly established role in protein repair (1Linder H. Helliger W. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1551-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,25Aswad D.W. Paranandi M.V. Schurter B.T. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2000; 21: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Before the generation of the PCMT1-deficient mouse, it was thought that a knockout of this gene in a mammalian system might provide an advanced aging model. Due to the strong expression of the enzyme in the central nervous system, it was also anticipated that the knockout mouse might show signs of advanced neurological aging, such as neuronal degeneration or the formation of neuritic plaques. However, when the mice were finally generated, it was unanticipated how very limited their survival would turn out to be (23Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H. Nakano H. Kawano H. Kuroyanagi H. Yahagi Y. Kobayashi S. Koizumi K. Sakai T. Saito K. Chiba T. Kawamura K. Suzuki K. Watanabe T. Mori H. Shirasawa T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trying to make a connection between the deficiency of the methyltransferase and the development of fatal epilepsy seen in this short-lived mouse has been a challenge, especially considering the diversity and number of potential substrates for the enzyme. Theories involving the damage or alteration of various proteins, peptides, and small molecule substrates have been proposed (23Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H. Nakano H. Kawano H. Kuroyanagi H. Yahagi Y. Kobayashi S. Koizumi K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20671-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, one previously overlooked substrate was the methyltransferase's own cofactor, AdoMet. From the studies mentioned above, we have determined that the levels of AdoMet and AdoHcy are indeed altered by the lack of PCMT1, although we do not yet know if these alterations are causing the seizures seen in thePcmt1−/− mice or if they are secondary to them. However, if the altered levels of these small molecules is influencing the seizure threshold in the Pcmt1−/− mice, there may be ways to rescue this phenotype. If we are able to prolong their lives, perhaps older Pcmt1−/− mice would exhibit phenotypes directly related to the aging of specific protein substrates, and perhaps even provide a model of advanced aging in the nervous system. One of the most common forms of protein damage in vitroand in vivo is deamidation and isoaspartyl formation caused by deprotonation of the peptide-bond nitrogen and its attack on the side chain carbonyl carbon of l-asparaginyl orl-aspartyl residues (1Linder H. Helliger W. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1551-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Tashima G. Hancock W.S. Canova-Davis E. Aswad D.W. Deamidation and Isoaspartate Formation in Peptides and Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 167-192Google Scholar). This spontaneous reaction results in the loss of ammonia (from asparaginyl residues) or water (from aspartyl residues) and the formation of the side chain into an intermediate succinimidyl ring. If this ring is hydrolyzed at the α-carbonyl group, the peptide bond is re-routed through the side chain carbonyl resulting in the formation of anl-isoaspartyl residue. The ring is also susceptible to racemization, allowing for the formation of d-aspartyl andd-isoaspartyl residues, as well. These aberrant residues can cause drastic conformational changes in their proteins, resulting in loss of biological activity (1Linder H. Helliger W. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1551-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), increased propensity to aggregate (2Tashima G. Hancock W.S. Canova-Davis E. Aswad D.W. Deamidation and Isoaspartate Formation in Peptides and Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 167-192Google Scholar), and/or increased immunogenicity (3Mamula M.J. Gee R.J. Elliott J.I. Sette A. Southwood S. Jones P.J. Blier P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22321-22327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that isoaspartyl formation in specific peptides or proteins may be linked to certain disease processes. For example, the presence of isoaspartyl residues in the β-amyloid peptide contributes to its insolubility, and protein isomerization is elevated in β-amyloid peptides and paired helical filaments purified from Alzheimer's disease brains (4Kuo Y.M. Webster S. Emmerling M.R., De Lima N. Roher A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Roher A.E.

Biophys. 2000; 381: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, just as cells have mechanisms to combat other forms of damage, they have at least one to restrict the accumulation of isoaspartyl residues. This mechanism involves the enzyme l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl)O-methyltransferase (PCMT1).1 PCMT1 functions by transferring a methyl group from the moleculeS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to either the α-carboxyl group of the l-isoaspartyl residue or the β-carboxyl group of the d-aspartyl residue (7Murray E.D., Jr. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10722-10732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8McFadden P.N. Clarke S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting methyl ester is then susceptible to spontaneous hydrolysis leading to the loss of methanol and the re-formation of the succinimidyl ring. If the intermediate ring structure then hydrolyzes at the β-carbonyl, which typically occurs about 30% of the time at physiological pH, the residue returns to the normal l-aspartyl form (10Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 70% of the time, the cyclic imide returns to one of the aberrant forms, which can be re-methylated by PCMT1"

Although the optimal temperature for the relaxation activity is between 37 and 45 °C, maximal cleavage occurs between 23 and 30 °C, a temperature range that is more physiologically relevant for fruit flies. The cleavage products require protease treatment to enter the gel, they are stable over time, they are reversible, and they are not observed with a Y332F active site mutant, which further supports the idea that topo IIIβ possesses an endonucleolytic cleavage activity. This cleavage activity appears to be specific for highly unwound, or single strand-containing substrates. Southern blot analysis of the cleavage products demonstrates that the topo IIIβ cleavage activity is concentrated primarily in highly A/T-rich regions. These results suggest that topo IIIβ may function as a reversible endonuclease in vivo by recognizing and cleaving/rejoining DNA structures with single-stranded character.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). These enzymes work by going through two cycles of transesterification. The first one is initiated by the active-site tyrosine to form a phosphodiester bond with the 5′- or 3′-DNA phosphate at the transient break site, and the second one is the reversal in which the 3′- or 5′-hydroxyl at the break reforms the DNA backbone bond, thus regenerating the free tyrosine in the enzyme. The type I enzymes are usually monomers that work by making a reversible single-stranded break in the DNA backbone, whereas type II enzymes are dimeric in structure and thus can introduce a transient double-stranded break. Passage of an intact strand(s) through the broken strand(s) followed by religation of the broken ends completes the topoisomerase reaction cycle and affects the topological transformation in DNA. The type I enzymes are further divided into the IA and IB families, with the Escherichia coli ω protein as the prototypical type IA enzyme (4Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 5Tse-Dinh Y.C. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The first eukaryotic type IA topoisomerase was discovered in yeast through a genetic screen for suppression of recombination among repeated sequences (6Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and more type IA enzymes (the topo III enzymes) subsequently have been identified in other higher eukaryotes (7Kim Y.C.

Prokaryotes likeE. coli and lower eukaryotes such as yeast each possess one topo III enzyme, whereas the metazoans like worms, fruit flies, mice, and humans contain two topo III isoforms, designated topo IIIα and topo IIIβ. Although much is known about topo I and topo II, the precise cellular function of topo III remains to be elucidated. Biochemical and genetic data argue that, unlike topo I and topo II, the topo III enzymes may not contribute significantly to regulating the cellular levels of DNA supercoiling (12Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For example, E. coli topo III is only one-quarter as active as E. coli topo I in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA (13DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Topo III to relax supercoils can be stimulated, however, when plasmid substrates contain a region of single-stranded DNA. This can be accomplished by incubating the reaction at high temperature to partially denature the plasmid, by using a substrate that contains a single-stranded loop, or by using a substrate that is hypernegatively supercoiled (8Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Wilson T.M. Chen A.D. Hsieh T. J. Biol.

Although the precise function of topo III is not yet known, its cellular importance is attested by the wide range of phenotypes presented by various topo III mutants. Both E. coli topB and Saccharomyces cerevisiae top3-null mutants have increased levels of recombination, particularly within repeated DNA sequences (6Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 15Uematsu N. Eda S. Yamamoto K. Mutat.

The hyper-recombination phenotype of topo III mutants suggests that it has a critical role in regulating recombination. An essential function of type IA enzymes in resolving recombination intermediates may account for the chromosome segregation defects observed in bacterialtop1 and top3 mutants (18Zhu Q. Pongpech P. DiGate R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in yeasttop3 mutants (19Gangloff S. de Massy B. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Fabre F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4715-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast topo III has an important function in the intra-S checkpoint and in the repair of lesions caused by a wide range of DNA-damaging agents (22Chakraverty R.K. Kearsey J.M. Oakley T.J. Grenon M. de La Torre Ruiz M.A. Lowndes N.F. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7150-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transgenic mouse studies likewise have demonstrated important functions for the topo III isozymes in mammals. Intriguingly, although the topo IIIβ knockout mouse is viable, it has a shortened lifespan relative to its heterozygous mutant and homozygous wild-type littermates, and the topo IIIα knockout mouse dies in utero (23Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Kwan K.Y. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5717-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Such experiments demonstrate that in all systems studied to date, loss of topo III function cannot be completely compensated by any other topoisomerase in the cell, including another topo III isoform. The topo III enzymes interact genetically, physically, and functionally with members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases (25Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 26Ng S.W. Liu Y. Hasselblatt K.T. Mok S.C. Berkowitz R.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Humans possess five RecQ homologs: RecQL, BLM, WRN, RTS, and RecQ5. Mutations in BLM, WRN, and RTS lead to Bloom's syndrome, Werner's syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively (reviewed in Ref.29Mohaghegh P. Hickson I.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The human topo IIIα and BLM proteins have been shown to interact physically, with BLM helping topo IIIα localize to nuclear PML bodies where they act to prevent sister-chromatid exchange (30Hu P. Beresten S.F. van Brabant A.J., Ye, T.Z. Pandolfi P.P. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Ellis N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RecQ5 also has been shown to interact with topo IIIβ, which interacts with chromosomes specifically during M-phase (27Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Kitao S. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi M. Hanai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, the topo III/RecQ partners have a demonstrated function in stabilizing genomes during mitotic and meiotic growth. Although the interplay between the topo III and RecQ enzyme families provides interesting insight into the biological functions of these enzymes, much remains to be discovered about the basic biochemical properties of the topo III enzyme that are relevant for its in vivo roles. To that end, we describe here a reversible cleavage activity for Drosophila topo IIIβ and discuss the possible role such an activity might reveal about the biological function of the topo III enzyme. Drosophila topo IIIβ was purified according to our published procedure with the following modification (11Wilson T.M. Chen A.D. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the previous procedure involved the fractionation of nuclear extract by column chromatography with Ni (II)-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, single-stranded DNA-agarose, and hydroxyapatite. We eliminated the single-stranded DNA-agarose step from our purification because it invariably incurs a significant loss of topo IIIβ. This is because of the high affinity of topo IIIβ for the single-stranded DNA (data not shown). The resulting protein has a purity comparable with the previous preparation, but an ∼10-fold higher concentration (1 mg/ml). We have prepared an active site mutant of topo IIIβ and purified it using an identical procedure as that for the wild-type enzyme. The site-specific mutagenesis to convert the active site tyrosine at residue 332 to phenylalanine was described previously (32Wilson-Sali T. Hsieh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Standard topo IIIβ reactions were incubated for 1 h in 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) and 1 mmMgCl2 at a temperature and concentration specified in the text. Purification of Drosophila topo I-ND423 also was reported previously (33Shaiu W.L. Hsieh T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4358-4367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard topo I reactions were for 1 h at 30 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 0.15 mg/ml proteinase K. Samples were heated at 45 °C for 15 min before analysis by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis was performed. In the absence of proteinase K treatment, the protein-DNA complexes were resolved by running the samples in buffer containing 0.1% SDS. Samples for Southern blot analysis were purified after topo IIIβ reaction by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended and dialyzed against TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 0.1 mm EDTA) and then digested with restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). The digested material was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and then resuspended in TE buffer. Samples were electrophoresed through a denaturing or non-denaturing agarose gel at a constant voltage of 20 V for 20–30 h. After denaturation and neutralization, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with radiolabeled probes: MAP1, 5′-ATCGTGGCCGGCATCAC-3′ or MAP 3, 5-′GTCGCCATGATCGCGTA-3′. Prior to hybridization, oligonucleotide probes were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (USB) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Unincorporated label was removed by passage of the samples over a BioRad Bio-Spin 6 column. Plasmid A/T content was plotted using MacVector 7.0 software (Kodak). Our earlier experiments showed that at an enzyme/DNA molar ratio of 5:1, topo IIIβ can relax hypernegatively supercoiled DNA to a supercoiling level slightly higher than that of the native plasmid DNA (11Wilson T.M. Chen A.D. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test whether higher enzyme concentrations may affect further relaxation, we titrated topo IIIβ enzyme in the relaxation reactions at enzyme/DNA ratios ranging from 0.1:1 to 100:1 (Fig.1A). The slight shift in mobility from the hypernegatively supercoiled DNA to the negatively supercoiled plasmid indicates similar levels of relaxation by topo IIIβ, as demonstrated previously. Interestingly, at ratios of 25:1 or greater (Fig. 1A, lanes 10–13), the majority of the hypernegatively supercoiled DNA was converted into primarily nicked but also linear species. At the greatest concentration of topo IIIβ tested (100:1, lane 13) nearly all of the substrate had been cleaved, but both the nicked and linear species can be detected in the reactions starting as low as 5:1 (lane 5). The nicked DNA can be distinguished from fully relaxed DNA both by the absence of a ladder of topoisomers (which generally is observed with fully relaxed DNA under these electrophoretic conditions) and by the lack of a change in mobility when electrophoresed in the presence of ethidium bromide (data not shown). No nicking of the DNA was observed at molar ratios of 25:1 or greater when the hypernegatively supercoiled DNA was incubated with a purified active site Y332F mutant of topo IIIβ (data not shown). In contrast, incubation of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA with another type I topoisomerase, Drosophila topo I, at a ratio of 50:1 resulted in full relaxation of the hypernegatively supercoiled DNA (Fig. 1B). One interesting feature of the topo IIIβ reaction is that the nicked and linear cleavage products can be generated by stopping the reaction with proteinase K and either 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, or both (data not shown). When proteinase K is excluded from the stop mix the DNA fails to resolve through the gel, suggesting covalent complex formation between the protein and the DNA (Fig.2A). The DNA in these untreated samples can be resolved as distinct bands, however, if the samples are electrophoresed through an agarose gel containing SDS (Fig.2B, left panel). These are likely the covalent protein-DNA adducts, as demonstrated before for the topo II cleavage reactions (34Lee M.P. Hsieh T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5027-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA complexes can be transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and binding of topo IIIβ to the nicked and linear DNA fragments can be confirmed by Western blot (Fig.2B, right panel). It is interesting to note that in the previous experiment with topo IIIβ the majority of the cleaved material was in the form of nicked DNA, but there does appear to be a significant amount of linear DNA as well. To further investigate this cleavage phenomenon, Drosophila topo IIIβ was incubated with hypernegatively supercoiled DNA at various temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 °C at an enzyme/DNA ratio of 100:1 (Fig.3). Although the appearance of nicked and linear DNA was observed at all temperatures below 50 °C, more extensive cleavage of the substrate occurred at 30, 23, and 15 °C, with the maximal cleavage occurring between 23 and 30 °C. This is in contrast to the relaxation activity of topo IIIβ, which is optimal at 37–45 °C. The distinct banding pattern of the subunit-length DNA fragments in the cleavage reactions is similar to that of a topo II-mediated reaction. This result suggests that topo IIIβ may cleave both strands in a single-stranded bubble in the hypernegatively supercoiled DNA. The protein linkage of the nicked and linear cleavage products suggests that the subunit-length DNA fragments are not generated by an endonuclease. To further rule out the possibility that the DNA cleavage products were generated by a nuclease contaminating the enzyme preparation, we investigated the stability of the products over time as well as whether or not the cleavage events were reversible (Fig.4). Topo IIIβ enzyme was incubated with hypernegatively supercoiled DNA at 23 °C (enzyme/DNA ratio of 100:1). Aliquots were removed and stopped at time points ranging from 1 min to 20 h (Fig.4A, lanes 1–6). The time course reveals that the ladder of cleavage products can be observed within the first minute of incubation and persists 20 h later. Such stability argues against nuclease contamination. Additionally, aliquots were removed after 1 h of incubation and either heated at 70 °C for 10 min or subjected to an increase in either NaCl (to 0.5 or 1 m) or MgCl2 (to 10 mm) concentration and incubated for an additional hour at 23 °C before the reactions were stopped (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–6). Both the heat and salt treatments resulted in a depletion of cleavage products and a concomitant appearance of supercoiled DNA, which migrated at approximately the same mobility as the hypernegatively supercoiled starting material. Such an efficient reversibility illustrates a hallmark of topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage, namely that religation of broken DNA ends can be induced by shifts in either ionic or temperature conditions. The reversibility and the stability over prolonged incubation demonstrate that the cleavage ladder most likely is not generated by a contaminating nuclease but rather that topo IIIβ itself possesses a reversible endonucleolytic cleavage activity. We found previously that Drosophila topo IIIβ can relax hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid but not natively isolated, negatively supercoiled DNA (11Wilson T.M. Chen A.D. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate the substrate specificity for the cleavage activity, topo IIIβ was incubated with seven different hypernegatively supercoiled substrates as well as their corresponding negatively supercoiled parental plasmids (Fig.5, A and B). All seven hypernegatively supercoiled substrates, ranging in size from 3 to 16 kb, could be converted into a ladder of cleavage products, whereas none of the negatively supercoiled plasmids appear to be acted upon by topo IIIβ. This is consistent with previous reports regarding the affinity of topo III for highly unwound substrates. Although the exact structure of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid is unknown, it is predicted to be unwound to such a degree that single-stranded regions are exposed. To test the ability of topo IIIβ to cleave a single-stranded substrate, we incubated the enzyme with M13 single-stranded circular DNA (Fig. 5C). A time course demonstrates that the circle could be converted into linear DNA as well as a smear of smaller cleavage products and that these products persisted after 4 h of incubation. At early time points, a similar cleavage pattern was produced when the single-stranded circle was treated with DNase I, but the DNA was further degraded over time (data not shown). When an aliquot of the topo IIIβ reaction was removed after 1 h and heated at 70 °C for 10 min before the reaction was stopped, the smear condensed to fragments of higher molecular weight (Fig. 5C, lane 6), suggesting partial reversion and religation of the cleavable complexes. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that topo IIIβ is specific for highly unwound or single strand-containing substrates. In order to determine the sites of cleavage for topo IIIβ, we probed the cleavage fragments of two hypernegatively supercoiled substrates, pBR322 and pKK405, using an indirect end-labeling method (Fig. 6). pKK405 was constructed by insertion of a 1.35-kb fragment containing the T4 phage ori(uvsY) origin of replication into pBR322 (35Kreuzer K.N. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3345-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Kreuzer K.N. Alberts B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The hypernegatively supercoiled substrates were reacted with topo IIIβ at 37 °C and at an enzyme/DNA ratio of 25:1 to minimize the number of cleavage events per DNA molecule. The DNA samples were then purified and linearized with BamHI before electrophoresis through a denaturing agarose gel and subjection to Southern blot analysis (Fig. 6A). The strategy for mapping the cleavage sites is shown in Fig.6C. The MAP1 and MAP3 probes annealed within 15–20 base pairs of the BamHI ends, allowing examination of topo IIIβ cleavage along the full length of both strands. The presence of full-length linear DNA on the Southern blot shows that a substantial amount of the plasmid substrate was not cleaved by topo IIIβ and therefore that the reaction conditions were such as to minimize the number of cleavage events per DNA molecule. Although the presence of smears in the denaturing gel suggests that both pBR322 and pKK405 plasmids were cut by topo IIIβ along their full length, both the MAP1 and MAP3 Southern blots demonstrate that the cleavage was concentrated primarily within distinct regions. In these indirect end-labeling experiments, the location of the cleavage sites can be determined simply by measuring the size of the cleavage products. The Southern blots reveal that pBR322 was cut mainly within a DNA-unwinding element, or DUE region, located on the plasmid between the ampicillin-resistance gene and the Col E1 origin of replication, whereas pKK405 was cut both within the DUE region and within the T4 ori(uvsY) insert. The range of cleavage was further refined by digesting the topo III-cut DNA with restriction enzymes closer to these DUE and T4 ori regions and then probing with radiolabeled oligonucleotides specific for these ends (data not shown). The locations of the cleavage sites on the plasmids as determined by these Southern blots are indicated by brackets and numbered in Fig. 6C. A comparison of the cleavage regions determined by the Southern blot analysis to a plot of the base composition of these plasmids reveals that the DUE and T4 ori cleavage sites fall within highly A/T-rich sequences that peak at around an 80% A/T content (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the MAP1 and MAP3 probes reveal cleavage on both strands within the DUE region for pBR322. Additionally, MAP1 reveals cleavage within the DUE for pKK405, whereas MAP3 reveals cleavage within the T4 ori region. There are two possible explanations for the pKK405 results; either there is a preference with regard to the strand that was cleaved, or double-stranded breaks were made in both areas, and only the one closest to the probe was revealed. In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, the samples were run through a non-denaturing agarose gel and blotted with MAP1 and MAP3 as before. The non-denaturing Southern blot confirms that both pBR322 and pKK405 experienced double-stranded breaks within the DUE region, while pKK405 also experienced double-stranded breaks within the T4 ori(uvsY) insert (Fig. 6B). This suggests that in the single-stranded bubble formed within highly A/T-rich regions of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA, topo IIIβ is competent to cleave either one (leading to nicked species) or both strands (leading to linear species) in these bubble regions. In this study, we describe a reversible cleavage activity for the DNA topoisomerase III enzyme, which has an exquisite specificity for hypernegatively supercoiled DNA. Although all type I topoisomerases make transient single-stranded breaks within DNA, we demonstrate thatDrosophila topoisomerase IIIβ, a type I enzyme, can generate extensive but reversible double-stranded breaks within a hypernegatively supercoiled DNA substrate by nicking two complementary strands within close proximity. This double-stranded cleavage activity is observed only with substrates that are more unwound than natively isolated plasmid, most likely because such hypernegatively supercoiled substrates contain single-stranded bubble regions. Southern blot analysis maps the sites of cleavage primarily to regions in the plasmid that are highly A/T-rich. Presumably, these would be the first regions to denature in a plasmid under supercoiling stress. At high enzyme/DNA ratios, the predominant topo IIIβ reaction products at 37 °C are nicked and linear DNA. This activity appears to be unique to topo IIIβ; a similar experiment performed withDrosophila topo I results in full relaxation rather than cleavage. The DNA cleavage reaction by topo IIIβ has a dramatic temperature dependence. Lowering the temperature of the reaction by only 5–10 °C results in formation of an extensive ladder of lower molecular weight cleavage products. The sharp resolution of the bands within the ladder suggests not only that each band is a product of at least four separate single-stranded cleavage events by topo IIIβ but also that there is a sequence preference for each cleavage event. The mechanistic basis for the difference in the optimal temperature for the cleavage versus relaxation activities is as yet unknown. It is interesting to note, however, that the cleavage activity of topo IIIβ occurs optimally at a temperature range (23–30 °C) that is more physiologically relevant for fruit flies than the relaxation activity (37–45 °C). This is in line with the fact that the relaxation activities of both Drosophila topo I and topo II are optimal at 30 °C (37Baase W.A. Wang J.C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4299-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 38Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cleavage products are generated when the reaction is stopped with proteinase K and either EDTA or SDS alone (as well as with both EDTA and SDS). Incubation with proteinase K alone does not result in DNA cleavage (data not shown). This is in contrast to either topo I or topo II, where cleavage must be induced with a strong protein denaturant such as SDS or alkali and requires the presence of a topoisomerase-targeting drug in order to generate extensive cleavage products. This difference suggests that although topo III, like the other topoisomerases, is able to bind DNA and generate reversible breaks, it may differ in terms of the stability of the cleavable complexes it forms with the DNA. The cleavage of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA by topo IIIβ is very efficient. We can readily observe the generation of both nicked and linear DNA beginning at enzyme/DNA molar ratios of 5:1 along with the products of the relaxation reaction. In an interesting contrast, we have shown recently that plasmid-based R-loop and D-loop substrates are refractory to the relaxation activity of topo IIIβ but can be cleaved readily (32Wilson-Sali T. Hsieh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both the hypernegatively supercoiled and R-/D-loop DNAs contain an unwound segment and can be cleaved efficiently by topo IIIβ. These experiments support the idea that topo IIIβ possesses a reversible, structure-specific endonucleolytic activity that shows a preference for substrates containing single-stranded regions. Such a structure-specific activity may have relevance concerning the biological functions of topo III. Topo III-mediated cleavage will generate a nascent 3′-hydroxyl end and, when coupled with a 3′- to 5′-DNA helicase activity like that from a RecQ homolog, can be used to initiate the formation of recombination intermediates. Interestingly, because the recombination intermediates likely have a structure with single-stranded character, cleavage by topo III followed by unwinding through the action of a DNA helicase can reverse or resolve the recombination intermediates. The reversal of the cleavage reaction can ligate the break and regenerate an intact DNA strand. Thereby, topo III and RecQ can function as a team to regulate the process of genetic recombination. The connection of a structure-specific endonuclease activity to recombination and repair is further implicated by the recent observation that Mms4/Mus81 has an overlapping and essential function with Sgs1/Top3 and forms a heterodimeric endonuclease (39Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). MMS4 and MUS81 were among the genes originally obtained through a screen for synthetic lethals ofsgs1 mutation in yeast, and they function together in genetic pathways involving recombination and repair (39Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Mms4/Mus81 heterodimer has a unique endonucleolytic activity that is specific for branched or forked substrates, suggesting a role for rescuing stalled replication forks (40Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Direct biochemical evidence linking Mus81/Eme1, a homolog of Mus81/Mms4 in the fission yeast, to the resolution of Holliday junctions also has been shown recently (41Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates III, J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for a role of topo III/RecQ in processing recombination intermediates and their relationships with other structure-specific enzymes like Mus81/Mms4 and Mus81/Eme1 will be an important area for future investigation."

The mutant was expressed in COS7 and Chinese hamster ovary cells, did not form covalently linked dimers, and was present at the cell surface. There was half as much insulin binding activity at the cell surface in cells expressing the mutant compared with that in cells expressing the wild type receptor. The intracellular processing of the mutant receptor was affected, since its β-subunit migrated more slowly than that of the wild type receptor on SDS-PAGE. The mutant was capable of insulin-dependent autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 in vivo and could be cross-linked into receptor dimers when membrane-bound. The amount of insulin-dependent autophosphorylation of the mutant receptor was half that of the wild type receptor. However, after solubilization the monomeric insulin receptor had minimal autophosphorylation activity, and, unlike the naturally occurring monomeric receptor tyrosine kinases, the solubilized monomeric insulin receptor did not dimerize in response to insulin binding as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation.

Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β chains are linked to the α chains by class II disulfide bonds, which are resistant to reduction; Cys647 is the α chain residue involved in the class II disulfides (2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7108-7115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two α chains are extracellular and are linked by class I disulfide bonds, which are easily reduced by dithiothreitol (3Massague J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6729-6738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least two α chain cysteine residues are involved in the class I disulfide bonds (4Finn F.M. Ridge K.D. Hofmann K. Proc.

In a previous work, we reported that the cysteine residues involved in the class I disulfides between the α chains were Cys524and Cys682 (9Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whereas the involvement of Cys524 in the class I disulfides had been suggested by other investigators (6Schaffer L. Ljungqvist L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Bilan P.J. Yip C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(10Sparrow L.G. McKern N.M. Gorman J.J. Strike P.M. Robinson C.P. Bentley J.D. Ward C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further support was provided by the report that an α-subunit fragment, in which amino acids 469–703 and 718–729 had been deleted, is a monomer and binds insulin (11Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A curious finding of the previous work was that when cells expressing the IRC524S,C682S mutant were incubated with insulin before solubilization of the receptors, most of the receptors dimerized. We became concerned that the dimerization might be caused by formation of disulfide bonds between Cys683 and Cys685. To investigate this possibility, we constructed another insulin receptor by replacing Cys683 and Cys685, in addition to Cys524 and Cys682, with serine. The new receptors did not form covalent dimers, were expressed on the cell surface, and underwent autophosphorylation in response to insulin while membrane-bound. However, in the monomeric state the insulin receptors had decreased insulin-dependent kinase activity. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's F-12), LipofectAMINE, penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Vector plasmid pcDNA3.1His/V5 and V5 antibody were purchased from Invitrogen. Insulin receptor antibodies Ab-1 and Ab-4 were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies against insulin receptor β chain (29B4), insulin receptor α chain (N-20), phosphotyrosine (PY-99), and protein G-plus were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. (Lake Placid NY). [γ-32P]ATP and 125I-insulin were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate and GelCode Blue Stain Reagent were from Pierce. Ethlyene glycol-bis(succinic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (EGS) was purchased from Sigma. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. CHO cells were maintained in F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To transiently express the insulin receptors, subconfluent cells were transfected with plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of DNA to LipofectAMINE was 1:3. TheBamHI/XbaI fragment of pECE-C524S,C682S,C685S, which contains serine mutations at residues 524, 682, and 685 (9Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was inserted in pBluescript KS(+) to make plasmid pJW5. In order to introduce a BstBI site at the C terminus of the β-subunit, a mutagenesis PCR was carried out with T3 primer and primer R1 (CGGTAGGCACTGTTcGaAAGGATTGGAC), and pJW5 as template. The BstBI site is underlined, and the lowercase letters represent the changes from the original bases in the primer R1. In this way, the last amino acid of the human insulin receptor was changed from serine to phenylalanine. The stop codon was changed to glutamic acid. The PCR product was cloned into theBamHI/BstBI site of Litmus28 (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) to make pJW6. The 3.5-kbHindIII/PmlI fragment of peT3 (12Aiyer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14992-14999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (from William J. Rutter, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was cloned into the HindIII/PmlI site of pJW6 to make pJW17, which contains the whole human IR gene. TheHindIII/BstBI fragment from pJW17 was inserted into pcDNA3.1-V5/His (version A) to make pJW64, which encodes the human insulin receptor with a V5/His epitope tag. Mutations of the C terminus of the insulin receptor (Ser to Phe, stop to Glu) and the introduction of the V5/His epitope tag did not affect its basic biological functions (see “Results”). The Ser524mutation was imported from pECE-C524S,C682S,C685S by replacing theHindIII/BamHI region of pJW64 with the corresponding fragment of pECE-C524S,C682S,C685S. To introduce mutations in the region of Cys682 to Cys685, the following primers were used: S682, ATGAGGATTCGGCCGGCGAATcCTGCTCCTGTCCAA; S682,3,5, ATGAGGATTCGGCCGGCGAAaGCaGCTCCTcTCCAA; S683,5, ATGAGGATTCGGCCGGCGAATGCaGCTCCaGTCCAA; and S682,3, ATGAGGATTCGGCCGGCGAAaGCaGCTCCTGTCCAA. The mutated bases are shown in lowercase type. All of the modified regions of the IR cDNA were sequenced to confirm the mutations and verify that no other mutation occurred. The samples in Laemmli sample buffer (reducing or nonreducing depending upon the experiments) were heated at 95 °C for 5 min before subjecting them to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (300 mA for 75 min). The nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% nonfat milk prior to incubation with primary antibody. The primary and secondary antibodies were dissolved in TBST (25 mmTris, 0.02% KCl, 0.8% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0) with 1% nonfat milk. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. CHO cells (70–80% confluent) in 100-mm plates were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid containing the cDNA for different forms of the insulin receptor or LacZ, and 48 h after transfection the cells were incubated in the medium without fetal bovine serum for 4 h. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. 125I-insulin (50 pm) was incubated with the cells for 12 h at 4 °C in the binding buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 0.1% SDS, and counted in a γ-counter. 125I-Insulin binding to crude membranes was done by incubating 30 μg of crude membranes with 50 pm125I-insulin and increasing concentrations of porcine insulin (0–50 nm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 0.1% BSA for 12 h at 4 °C. The membrane proteins were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. No specific binding could be detected from the membranes of COS7 cells transfected with cDNA3.1-LacZ. This was performed as described by Aiyer (12Aiyer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14992-14999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lu and Guidotti (9Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 80 μg of crude membranes from COS7 cells expressing dimeric or monomeric insulin receptors were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100; the solutions were diluted to 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Ti70.1 rotor. The supernatants were collected and incubated with or without 20 nm insulin at 4 °C overnight. The solutions were then layered onto 4.6 ml of linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradients containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 nm insulin or no insulin. The samples were centrifuged for 6 h at 48,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Fractions of 200 μl were collected from the top of the tubes. Equivalent amounts of solubilized dimeric or monomeric insulin receptors were separated under identical conditions except without insulin in the gradient. To locate the insulin receptor, fractions were assayed for their ability to bind 125I-insulin. Catalase and aldolase were loaded on the sucrose gradients with the samples. The location of the two enzymes was determined by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce). Cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm to remove cell debris, 800 μg of cell lysate protein were incubated with appropriate antibodies for 2–4 h, followed by the addition of 10–20 μl of protein G-agarose and incubation for 1–3 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer three times. The immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the bead by Laemmli buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Cells, 48 h after transfection, were incubated in a medium without serum for 2–4 h (as indicated), treated with 100 nm insulin in a medium containing 1% BSA for 5 min, and washed with ice-cold PBS three times followed by processing for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. A plasmid containing the cDNA for IRS-1 (pCMVhis/IRS-1, provided by Dr. M. F. White, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) was co-transfected into CHO cells with the insulin receptor dimer or monomer plasmids. After 48 h, the cells were serum-starved, treated with insulin, and solubilized as described above for measurement of phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the precipitates were examined with anti-IRS1 antibody after SDS-PAGE. 60 μg of crude membranes from COS7 cells expressing dimeric or monomeric insulin receptor were incubated with 5 nm125I-insulin in 100 μl of HEPES buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) and 1% (w/v) BSA overnight in the absence or presence of 1.5 μm unlabeled insulin. The membranes were precipitated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed twice with ice-cold HEPES buffer. The membranes were resuspended in the HEPES buffer with 1 mm EGS and incubated on ice for 1 h (13Chiacchia K.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was stopped by removing EGS and washing the membranes three times by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5% gels. The radioactivity on the gel was analyzed with a Bio-Rad imager. Previously, we identified Cys524 and Cys682 as the residues involved in the class I disulfide bonds between the α chains (9Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The IRC524S,C682S mutant, however, was able to dimerize in the presence of insulin. To overcome this problem, we constructed IR mutants in which Cys524 and Cys682 were both changed to Asp or Arg to prevent monomer-monomer interactions by electrostatic repulsion. We found, however, that the IRC524D,C682D and IRC524R,C682R mutants were a mixture of monomers and dimers when examined by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). This result raised a concern that Cys524 and Cys682 might not be the only cysteine residues participating in class I disulfide bonds. In order to address this question, we made a variety of IR mutants involving Cys524, Cys682, Cys683, and Cys685. Since the two mutants, C524S and C682S,C683S,C685S, are expressed as dimers (2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7108-7115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we focused our attention on the mutants C524S,C682S,C683S, C524S,C682S,C685S, and C524S, C683S,C685S and compared them with C524S,C682S. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, all four mutants were present as dimers and monomers (lanes 2,3, 4, and 5, respectively) when examined by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The result suggested that it may be necessary to mutate all four Cys residues at positions 524, 682, 683, and 685 in order to obtain monomeric insulin receptors. This supposition was shown to be correct; lane 1 of Fig. 1 A shows that in the mutant C524S,C682S,C683S,C685S there was only the monomeric receptor. Notice that in all lanes the proreceptor, composed of the fused and unproteolyzed αβ chain, was visible. Fig. 1 B shows a more detailed analysis of the IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant compared with the wild type IR (IRWT). Under nonreducing conditions, only receptor monomers were present after SDS-PAGE (lane 2), whereas IRWT was dimeric (lanes 1 and 3). Under reducing conditions, only the β subunit and the proreceptor were visible (lanes 4–6); the addition of the epitope tag to the C terminus of the IR made the β subunit migrate more slowly than the native β subunit (lane 4 compared with lane 6). In addition, the β subunit of the mutant IR migrated more slowly than that of the wild type (lane 5compared with lane 4). The difference in mobility was also observed for the mutant β chain expressed in CHO cells (see Fig. 4 A). We conclude that Cys524 and all three Cys residues at positions 682, 683, and 685 are involved in the class I disulfides. In order to determine whether the IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant is present at the cell surface, varying amounts of the plasmids containing the wild type and mutant IR cDNAs were used to transfect CHO cells. After 48 h, the cells were assayed for insulin binding, and the results for the maximum binding are shown in TableI. The cells expressing IRWThad approximately twice the amount of surface IR compared with those expressing IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S.Table INumber of insulin binding sites on intact CHO cells expressing wild type and mutant insulin receptorsBinding sites/cellIRWT1.1 × 106 (3.7 × 104)IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S4.2 × 105 (7.6 × 103)IRC524S8.1 × 105 (1.6 × 104)IRC682S,C683S,C685S1.3 × 106 (4.6 × 104)LacZ3.9 × 104 (5.2 × 102)Not transfected3.9 × 104 (5.8 × 102)CHO cells were transfected with plasmids containing the cDNAs for the wild type and the mutant insulin receptors indicated in Table I.

Open table in a new tab CHO cells were transfected with plasmids containing the cDNAs for the wild type and the mutant insulin receptors indicated in Table I. After serum starvation for 4 h, the cells were incubated with 50 pm125I-insulin overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed with cold binding buffer three times and then solubilized with 0.1% SDS. The radioactivity of the solutions was determined with a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by including 10 μm nonradioactive insulin in the incubation. The results are means of two independent experiments; the deviations are in parentheses. Two possibilities for the lower amount of insulin binding to the cells expressing mutant IR are impairment in transport of the receptor to the cell surface and lower insulin affinity of the receptor. In order to study the latter question, binding of 125I-insulin to crude membranes with the wild type and mutant receptors was analyzed by the method of Scatchard (Fig. 2). For wild type and mutant IRs, the dissociation constants were 5.6 × 10−9m and 5.1 × 10−9m, respectively, and the maximal insulin binding was 1.58 × 10−11 and 1.12 × 10−11mol/μg of membrane, respectively. Interestingly, the plots for both receptors were curvilinear. We conclude that the IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant has a normal affinity for insulin but is defective in its ability to be delivered to the plasma membrane. There is considerable evidence that monomeric receptor tyrosine kinases dimerize in response to ligand binding (for reviews, see Refs. 14Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and 15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). Since the IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant does not form covalent dimers, we determined the size of the receptor in the absence and the presence of insulin by its sedimentation behavior in a sucrose density gradient (9Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Aiyer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14992-14999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude membranes from COS7 cells expressing dimeric or monomeric insulin receptors were incubated with or without 20 nm insulin overnight at 4 °C after solubilization, followed by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 6 h in a linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 nm or no insulin. Fractions were collected and assayed for insulin binding to locate the insulin receptor. The results (Fig.3) clearly show that the IRWTtraveled at the position of the receptor dimer, whereas the mutant had the size of a receptor monomer. Insulin binding caused a slight increase in the sedimentation rate of both IRWT and IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant, indicative of an insulin-dependent change in the shape of the receptors, consistent with the results of Florke et al. (16Florke R.R. Klein H.W. Reinauer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Insulin binding did not induce the dimerization of monomeric insulin receptors under these conditions. To determine whether the monomeric insulin receptor autophosphorylates in response to insulin, we treated intact CHO cells expressing the wild type and the mutant IR with insulin and measured the amount of phosphate bound to the β subunit. The level of expression of receptor dimers and monomers was approximately the same (Fig.4 A). To measure receptor phosphorylation, intact cells were incubated with insulin; then, the cell extracts were either directly separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.4 B) or first immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-V5 antibody, which recognizes the β chain (Fig. 4 C). The results clearly show that the receptor monomer had insulin-dependent phosphorylation and that the total amount of receptor dimer phosphorylation was twice that of the receptor monomer. This result is again compatible with the surface expression of IRWT and IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S (Table I). It is also apparent that the amount of phosphorylation of the receptor monomer in the absence of insulin was significant. This insulin-independent activation of the insulin receptor monomer could be a consequence of the monomeric state or of a structural change of the receptor brought about by the mutations. We tried to answer this question by comparison of insulin-dependent autophosphorylation of the receptor dimers and monomers with that of receptors lacking only one set of disulfide bonds. Insulin receptor dimers are held together by two sets of disulfide bonds, one at position 524 and the other set at positions 682, 683, and 684. Hence, we constructed the mutants IRC524S and IRC82S,C683S,C685S and measured the amount of phosphate incorporated in intact cells by immunoprecipitation with antiphosphotyrosine antibody followed by quantitation with anti-V5 antibody. The results (Fig.5 A) indicate that all of the mutants had considerable phosphorylation of the β chain in the absence of insulin, that there was insulin-dependent phosphorylation in all cases, and that the stimulation by insulin was greatest for the IRWT, followed by IRC524S, IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S, and IRC682S,C683S,C685S in that order. It is also important to notice that the total amount of receptor present in the cell (Fig.5 B) was not proportional to the amount of insulin binding on the cell surface (Table I), indicating that some of the mutants are impaired in their delivery to the plasma membrane. The conclusion is that the cysteine to serine mutations alter the structure of the insulin receptor so that there is some insulin-independent activation of the receptor. To determine whether the insulin receptor monomer has exogenous kinase activity, we asked whether it is capable of phosphorylating IRS-1, a substrate of the insulin receptor kinase (17Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers M.G., Jr. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the cDNA for IRS-1 (17Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers M.G., Jr. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cotransfected with plasmids containing the cDNA for IRWT or IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S into CHO cells. After 48 h, the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1 was assayed. Fig.6 shows that IRS-1 underwent insulin-dependent phosphorylation by both insulin receptor dimer and monomer. The level of phosphorylation by the receptor dimer was approximately twice that by the receptor monomer, as was seen for receptor autophosphorylation. In addition, there was phosphorylation of IRS-1 even in the absence of insulin, confirming the finding that some of the expressed insulin receptor is present in the activated state even in the absence of insulin. In order to determine whether the insulin receptor monomer has kinase activity when it is in the monomeric state, the membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100. Under these conditions, the insulin receptor monomers are monomeric (Fig. 3). As is shown in Fig.7 for receptors expressed in CHO cells, the extent of autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor monomer in the monomeric state was greatly reduced compared with the level obtained when the insulin receptor monomer is in the membrane. The amount of autophosphorylation was approximately one-fourth to one-sixth of that of the insulin receptor dimer. The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows that the amounts of β chain and proreceptor in each of the samples are equivalent. This result suggests that insulin receptor monomers in the monomeric state have reduced kinase activity compared with that of the native insulin receptor dimers as well as compared with that of the insulin receptor monomers that are in the membrane. Presumably, membrane-bound insulin receptor monomers are present at a sufficiently high concentration to form noncovalent dimers. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether membrane-bound receptor monomers could be cross-linked to dimers in the presence of insulin. The membranes from cells expressing dimeric or monomeric insulin receptors were incubated with 125I-insulin overnight in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled insulin. The membranes were then exposed to EGS to bring about insulin-α chain and α chain-α chain cross-linking (13Chiacchia K.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The membranes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions to obtain α chain monomers and dimers, and the gel was analyzed with a Bio-Rad imager. As can be seen in Fig.8, α-chain monomers and dimers bound to125I-insulin (lanes 1 and3) are present in both receptor dimer and monomer lanes. A greater percentage of the α chain can be covalently dimerized in the receptor dimer than in the receptor monomer (62 versus29%), as might be expected since in the dimer the α chains are kept close to one another by the class I disulfide bonds. Nevertheless, even the receptor monomers are capable of forming noncovalent dimers at the concentrations present in the membranes during the overexpression protocol. We conclude that the kinase activity of the receptor monomer in the monomeric state is substantially lower than that of the receptor dimer. The results shown in Fig. 1 clearly indicate that only the insulin receptor in which all four Cys residues, 524, 682, 683 and 685, are mutated to Ser is present exclusively as a monomer. All of the other mutants with only three mutations of these residues are present as a mixture of dimers and monomers, as is the IRC524S,C682Smutant previously described. We conclude that, in addition to Cys524, all three of the vicinal Cys residues in the 682–685 region are involved in the class I disulfides. N-Ethylmaleimide labeling of receptor monomers produced by mild reduction of native insulin receptor with dithiothreitol indicated that at least two cysteine residues are involved in class I disulfides (4Finn F.M. Ridge K.D. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Chiacchia K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1178-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One of them was identified as Cys524 (6Schaffer L. Ljungqvist L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas the other residue(s) could not be identified by labeling but was localized to the triplet at positions 682, 683, and 685 (10Sparrow L.G. McKern N.M. Gorman J.J. Strike P.M. Robinson C.P. Bentley J.D. Ward C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since it is apparent now that only mutation of all four Cys residues produces receptor monomers, it remains unclear why the labeling results were different. Possibly, the vicinity of the cysteine residues at positions 682, 683, and 685 allowed intrachain disulfide bond formation so that only one of the three remained free to react withN-ethylmaleimide. It is also not apparent how receptor monomers are formed in the partial mutants; possibly, the disulfide bonds between Cys682, Cys683, and Cys685 are not between homologous residues. One clear result is the decrease in the surface expression of the IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant compared with IRWT (Table I). Two possible explanations are that the receptor monomer is hindered in its passage from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane by the quality control system and that the receptor is toxic to the cell. The latter possibility is supported in part by the observation that even in the absence of insulin there is partial activation of the receptor monomer (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Since it is evident that the IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685Smutant is a monomer when examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A) and by velocity sedimentation after solubilization by detergent (Fig. 3), the curvilinear Scatchard plot (Fig. 2) of the mutant, resembling that of the IRWT, presents a problem. If the IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant is monomeric in the membrane, the two binding components represent some heterogeneity. If instead the receptor monomer is dimeric in the membrane, the curvilinear plot may represent the same negative cooperativity of the native dimeric receptor (18Levitzki A. Nature. 1981; 289: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Negative cooperativity is not easily understood in light of the structural evidence that only one insulin molecule is bound by an insulin receptor dimer (19Luo R.Z. Beniac D.R. Fernandes A. Yip C.C. Ottensmeyer F.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The importance of dimerization for the activation of monomeric receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. the EGF receptor) has been extensively described (14Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 15Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). Strangely, the insulin receptor exists as a dimer in which the monomers are covalently linked by disulfide bonds. One possibility for this arrangement is that insulin receptor monomers are incapable of dimerization even in the presence of insulin. Another possibility is that the monomer-monomer interactions are sufficiently weak so that at the concentration of native insulin receptor in the membrane, only a small fraction of the receptor monomers dimerize. The second possibility is supported by the evidence that the solubilized IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S mutant is defective in insulin-dependent autophosphorylation (Fig. 7) when it is monomeric (Fig. 3), whereas it is capable of insulin-dependent autophosphorylation and exogenous kinase activity on IRS-1 in cells (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), where it is partially dimeric (Fig. 8). We conclude that insulin receptor monomers are incapable of autophosphorylation in the monomeric state; however, noncovalent dimerization and autophosphorylation can take place in the plasma membrane when the concentration of receptor monomers is sufficiently high. It seems apparent now that the results in our previous paper on the dimerization of the IRC524S,C682S mutant after incubation with insulin (9Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may have been obtained by redistribution of the remaining disulfide bonds to produce disulfide-linked dimers. This is another reason that we believe that all three cysteine residues at positions 682, 683, and 685 are involved in the class I disulfide bonds. The conclusion that the insulin receptor monomer in the monomeric state has negligible kinase activity supports considerable work, all done with dithiothreitol-reduced insulin receptors, by the groups of Pilch and Pessin (20Boni-Schnetzler M. Rubin J.B. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15281-15287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Boni-Schnetzler M. Kaligian A. DelVecchio R. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

The Pilch group showed that receptor monomers could be separated from receptor dimers by sedimentation in a density gradient and that the monomers had reduced autophosphorylation activity compared with the native dimers (20Boni-Schnetzler M. Rubin J.B. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15281-15287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They further demonstrated that insulin receptor monomers could undergo autophosphorylation at a receptor concentration sufficient to allow dimerization (21Boni-Schnetzler M. Kaligian A. DelVecchio R. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6822-6828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the dimerization was not shown, its involvement was suggested by studies on the concentration dependence of insulin receptor autophosphorylation (22Shoelson S.E. Boni-Schnetler M. Pilch P.F. Kahn C.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7740-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the group of Pessin presented studies on insulin receptor monomers that were interpreted as showing that the monomers only had autophosphorylation activity if they formed covalently associated (23Sweet L.J. Morrison B.D. Wilden P.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16730-16738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Morrison B.D. Swanson M.L. Sweet L.J. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or noncovalently associated receptor dimers (25Wilden P.A. Morrison B.D. Pessin J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These studies were not straightforward, however, because the putative size of the insulin receptors was determined by gel filtration, which does not separate monomers and dimers. In any event, the conclusion reached by both groups was that insulin receptor monomers are not as competent to autophosphorylate as are receptor dimers. The conclusions of the earlier work by Pilch and Pessin and of that presented here, that insulin receptor dimers are required for insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation, are supported by the finding that even the soluble insulin receptor kinase domain is activated by dimerization (26Baer K., Al- Hasani H.
