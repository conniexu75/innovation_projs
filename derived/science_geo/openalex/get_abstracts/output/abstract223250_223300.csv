https://openalex.org/W2109134893,"The effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade on the vascular biology of human tumors are not known. Here we show here that a single infusion of the VEGF-specific antibody bevacizumab decreases tumor perfusion, vascular volume, microvascular density, interstitial fluid pressure and the number of viable, circulating endothelial and progenitor cells, and increases the fraction of vessels with pericyte coverage in rectal carcinoma patients. These data indicate that VEGF blockade has a direct and rapid antivascular effect in human tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1995540460,"AKT-GSK3beta signaling is a target of lithium and as such has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Here, we provide evidence that this signaling pathway also has a role in schizophrenia. Specifically, we present convergent evidence for a decrease in AKT1 protein levels and levels of phosphorylation of GSK3beta at Ser9 in the peripheral lymphocytes and brains of individuals with schizophrenia; a significant association between schizophrenia and an AKT1 haplotype associated with lower AKT1 protein levels; and a greater sensitivity to the sensorimotor gating-disruptive effect of amphetamine, conferred by AKT1 deficiency. Our findings support the proposal that alterations in AKT1-GSK3beta signaling contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis and identify AKT1 as a potential schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Consistent with this proposal, we also show that haloperidol induces a stepwise increase in regulatory phosphorylation of AKT1 in the brains of treated mice that could compensate for an impaired function of this signaling pathway in schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2019002861,"Elastic fibers are components of the extracellular matrix and confer resilience1. Once laid down, they are thought to remain stable2, except in the uterine tract where cycles of active remodeling occur3. Loss of elastic fibers underlies connective tissue aging and important diseases including emphysema4,5,6,7. Failure to maintain elastic fibers is explained by a theory of antielastase-elastase imbalance8, but little is known about the role of renewal. Here we show that mice lacking the protein lysyl oxidase–like 1 (LOXL1) do not deposit normal elastic fibers in the uterine tract post partum and develop pelvic organ prolapse, enlarged airspaces of the lung, loose skin and vascular abnormalities with concomitant tropoelastin accumulation. Distinct from the prototypic lysyl oxidase (LOX), LOXL1 localizes specifically to sites of elastogenesis and interacts with fibulin-5. Thus elastin polymer deposition is a crucial aspect of elastic fiber maintenance and is dependent on LOXL1, which serves both as a cross-linking enzyme and an element of the scaffold to ensure spatially defined deposition of elastin."

https://openalex.org/W1972783950,"Transcriptional adaptations to hypoxia are mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, a heterodimer of HIF-α and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator subunits. The HIF-1α and HIF-2α subunits both undergo rapid hypoxia-induced protein stabilization and bind identical target DNA sequences. When coexpressed in similar cell types, discriminating control mechanisms may exist for their regulation, explaining why HIF-1α and HIF-2α do not substitute during embryogenesis. We report that, in a human lung epithelial cell line (A549), HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins were similarly induced by acute hypoxia (4 h, 0.5% O2) at the translational or posttranslational level. However, HIF-1α and HIF-2α were differentially regulated by prolonged hypoxia (12 h, 0.5% O2) since HIF-1α protein stimulation disappeared because of a reduction in its mRNA stability, whereas HIF-2α protein stimulation remained high and stable. Prolonged hypoxia also induced an increase in the quantity of natural antisense HIF-1α (aHIF), whose gene promoter contains several putative hypoxia response elements to which (as we confirm here) the HIF-1α or HIF-2α protein can bind. Finally, transient transfection of A549 cells by dominant-negative HIF-2α, also acting as a dominant-negative for HIF-1α, prevented both the decrease in the HIF-1α protein and the increase in the aHIF transcript. Taken together, these data indicate that, during prolonged hypoxia, HIF-α proteins negatively regulate HIF-1α expression through an increase in aHIF and destabilization of HIF-1α mRNA. This trans-regulation between HIF-1α and HIF-2α during hypoxia likely conveys target gene specificity.

Maintaining oxygen homeostasis is essential to the development, growth, and the preservation of structural integrity of tissues. Lung hypoxia may be the consequence of some environments, e.g. high altitude, or may result from inadequate alveolar ventilation, e.g. chronic obstructive disease or pulmonary edema from acute lung injury or heart failure. Previous studies have reported lung alveolar epithelial cell adaptation to reduced O2 availability through an increase in glucose transport (1Ouiddir A. Planes C. Fernandes I. VanHesse A. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), glycolysis (2Escoubet B. Planes C. Clerici C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In most cell types, activation of genes essential for cell survival is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE, hypoxia response element; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau; aHIF, natural antisense hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; DTT, dithiothreitol; DRB, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-d-ribofuranoside; UTR, untranslated region. -1, a transcriptional complex that binds to the specific hypoxia response element (HRE). HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of the HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits, also known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. HIF-1β is found generally to be constitutively expressed and insensitive to changes in O2 availability, whereas HIF-1α is acutely regulated in response to hypoxia. The predominant mode of HIF-1α regulation occurs post-transcriptionally (5Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).

The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, a component of a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase protein complex, binds to the hydroxylated oxygen-dependent degradation domain of the α-subunit, resulting in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α (11Maxwell P.H.

Under hypoxic conditions, the VHL tumor suppressor protein fails to recognize the HIF-1α subunit, allowing HIF-1 to accumulate (6Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M.

However, using mitochondrial depleted cells and a number of mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors, several groups have demonstrated that mitochondria may also act as the proximal O2 sensor during hypoxia via increased production of reactive oxygen species to stabilize HIF-α proteins (13Agani F.H.

Besides the well established HIF-1, two other members of the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS (PER/ARNT/SIM) superfamily have also been described: HIF-2α, referred also to as endothelial PAS domain protein-1 or HIF-1α-like factor, which bears functional resemblance to HIF-1α regarding hypoxic stabilization and binding to HIF-1β (15Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently HIF-3α (16Heidbreder M. Frohlich F. Johren O. Dendorfer A. Qadri F. Dominiak P. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1541-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HIF-1α protein is ubiquitously expressed, whereas its HIF-2α and HIF-3α homologs have a more restricted pattern of expression (17Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

Despite strong sequence and mechanistic similarities, targeted disruption of their genes in mice results in embryonic lethalities with startling differences in the phenotype (19Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). HIF-1α-null mice exhibit midgestation lethality and severe blood vessel defects, whereas HIF-2α-null mice also exhibit embryonic lethality with abnormal lung maturation and blood vessel defects and sometimes survive post-natally (19Iyer N.V.

These results establish that HIF-1α and HIF-2α perform distinct functions during embryogenesis and indicate that they stimulate different target genes and/or undergo undiscovered differences in their in vivo mechanisms of activation. More recently, specific inactivation of HIF-1α or HIF-2α by short interfering RNAs showed that, in cells expressing both HIF-α isoforms, HIF-2α does not substitute in regulating any of the hypoxia-inducible genes when HIF-1α is inactivated (23Sowter H.M. Raval R. Moore J. Ratcliffe P.J. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6130-6134PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hu C.J. Wang L.Y. Chodosh L.A. Keith B. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 9361-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The presence of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in lung alveolar epithelial cells has been reported in separate studies, suggesting that the two isoforms are coexpressed (25Yu A.Y. Frid M.G. Shimoda L.A. Wiener C.M. Stenmark K. Semenza G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L818-L826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sato M. Tanaka T. Maeno T. Sando Y. Suga T. Maeno Y. Sato H. Nagai R. Kurabayashi M. Am. J.

The hypoxic induction of HIF-2α has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro whatever the cell background (15Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), whereas the induction of HIF-1α is controversial. The HIF-1α protein is rapidly induced by acute exposure hypoxia in ferret lung and in the alveolar epithelial cell line A549 (25Yu A.Y. Frid M.G. Shimoda L.A. Wiener C.M. Stenmark K. Semenza G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L818-L826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but remains undetectable in the lungs of mice exposed to mild hypoxia (28Stroka D.M. Burkhardt T. Desbaillets I. Wenger R.H. Neil D.A. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Candinas D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) or in A549 cells exposed to 12 h of hypoxia (26Sato M. Tanaka T. Maeno T. Sando Y. Suga T. Maeno Y. Sato H. Nagai R. Kurabayashi M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings raise important questions as to what extent HIF-1α and HIF-2α are differentially regulated by the severity and duration of hypoxia in alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, the mechanisms by which alveolar epithelial cells sense hypoxia have not been yet elucidated. The aim of the study was to investigate whether alveolar epithelial cells coexpress HIF-1α and HIF-2α and to determine the mechanisms of their hypoxic induction. Our results indicate that, in lung alveolar epithelial cells, acute hypoxia regulates HIF-1α and HIF-2α at the post-transcriptional level and involves several mechanisms such as production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and probably the inhibition of an enzyme that requires O2 and iron such as prolyl hydroxylase. One of the major findings was that, during sustained hypoxia, HIF-1α protein stimulation disappeared, whereas HIF-2α protein stimulation remained stable. Several lines of evidence suggest that the decrease in the HIF-1α protein was the consequence of negative feedback regulation. The initial rise in HIF-α proteins increased natural antisense HIF-1α (aHIF), which in turn destabilized HIF-1α mRNA and finally decreased HIF-1α protein expression. These results identify a novel posttranscriptional pathway that regulates the level of HIF-1α protein under hypoxic conditions. Cell Culture—A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were cultured as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in Kaighn's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and cultured according to the manufacturer's recommendations in EBM-2 medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.). Exposure to Hypoxia—On the day of the experiment, the medium was replaced with a thin layer of fresh medium (0.15 ml/cm2) with 10% fetal calf serum to decrease the diffusion distance of the ambient gas. Culture dishes were then placed in a humidified airtight incubator with inflow and outflow valves, and the hypoxic gas mixture (0.5% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2) was delivered at 10 liters/min for 25 min. The airtight incubator was kept at 37 °C for 4, 6, or 12 h, whereas normoxic cells were placed at 37 °Cina21% O2, 5%CO2, and 74% N2 humidified incubator until harvest. Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell extracts and nuclear cell extracts were prepared as described previously (1Ouiddir A. Planes C. Fernandes I. VanHesse A. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in 0.42 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The suspension was rotated for 30 min at 4 °C to extract nuclear proteins, which were then dialyzed in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Total cellular protein was prepared by homogenizing lung tissue in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.2 mm Na3VO4. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.45 m. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected as a sample. Nuclear extract and total cellular protein concentrations were determined the method of Bradford (41). For immunoblot assays, 30 μg of samples were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.6) and subsequently probed for HIF-1α or HIF-2α. Mouse anti-human HIF-1α (NB100-123) and rabbit anti-human HIF-2α (NB100-122) polyclonal antibodies (Novus Biological Science) were used at 1:1000 dilution, and mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used at 1:6000 dilution. The anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:2000 dilution, and the signal was analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The abundance of HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins was normalized to β-actin using NIH Image software. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Total RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin nucleic acid purification kits (Clontech). The abundance of HIF-α mRNA was evaluated by ribonuclease protection assay as described previously (4Pham I. Uchida T. Planes C. Ware L.B. Kaner R. Matthay M.A. Clerici C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L1133-L1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled riboprobes were generated using SP6 or T3 RNA polymerase. The templates used yielded protected fragments as follows: 221 bp for HIF-2α (nucleotides 2542–2762; GenBank™/EBI accession number U81984; a gift from Dr. P. J. Ratcliffe, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom), 255 bp for HIF-1α (nucleotides 764–1018; accession number U22431; a gift from Dr. P. J. Ratcliffe), and 187 bp for cyclophilin (nucleotides 437–624; accession number BC032138) (29Suarez F. Lebrun J.J. Lecossier D. Escoubet B. Coureau C. Silve C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 965-970PubMed Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA were co-hybridized overnight with 5 × 105 cpm for HIF-2α, 1 × 106 cpm for HIF-1α, and 5 × 104 for cyclophilin probes in 80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 50 °C. RNase digestion (40 mg/ml RNase A and 2 mg/ml RNase T1; Roche Diagnostics) was performed at 30 °C for 60 min, and then digestion with 12.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, protected fragments were separated by urea-PAGE. Gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid and vacuum-dried before exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR5 film, and the signal was quantitated from the gel using direct radioactivity measurement with an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Cyclophilin expression was used as an internal standard. Results are expressed as the ratio of expression of the mRNA of interest to cyclophilin mRNA. SYBR Green-based Real-time Quantitative PCR—Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 50 min in a volume of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 800 μm dNTPs, 10 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)18 primer, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase RNase H– (Promega). The enzyme was inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. The cDNAs were used for real-time PCR measurements. Semiquantitative determination of aHIF transcript concentrations was performed by real-time RT-PCR with β2-microglobulin as an internal control sequence as described (30Rossignol F. Vache C. Clottes E. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs (4 μl of a 10-fold dilution for β2-microglobulin or 4 μl of undiluted cDNA for aHIF) were added to 16 μl of PCR mixture containing 2 μl of 10× SYBR Green I master mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 5 mm MgCl2, and 600 nm gene-specific primers. A melting curve was used to identify a temperature at which only the amplicon and not primer dimers accounted for the SYBR Green-bound fluorescence. Assays were performed with a thermocycler with continuous fluorescence-monitoring capabilities (LightCycler™, Roche Diagnostics). The relative expression levels were determined by comparison with a serially diluted standard using thermocycler software. All data were normalized to the internal standard β2-microglobulin. Measurements of mRNA Half-life—A549 cells were grown in medium with or without CoCl2 (250 μm) for 4 h. 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB; 65 μm) was then added to block transcription. In the CoCl2-treated cells, supplemental CoCl2 was added with the transcription inhibitor to keep the CoCl2 concentration at 250 μm. Cells were harvested for RNA at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 4.0 h after the addition of the transcription inhibitor. Inhibition of Ongoing Transcription and Ongoing Protein Synthesis—To verify whether ongoing transcription is essential for the hypoxic regulation mechanism of HIF-α mRNA, the medium was replaced with DRB (65 μm)-containing medium. Two hours after this treatment, cells were incubated in gas containing 0.5 or 21% O2 for 6 h. To elucidate the necessity of ongoing protein synthesis for HIF-α mRNA regulation, the medium was replaced with cycloheximide (100 μm)-containing medium and incubated in gas containing 0.5 or 21% O2 for 6 h. Plasmid Construct and Transient Transfection Assay—The dominant-negative HIF-2α mutant expression vector phEP-1-(1–485), which contains the coding sequences corresponding to amino acids 1–485 of the HIF-2α cDNA insert in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), was a gift from Dr. K. Maemura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) (31Maemura K. Hsieh C.M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol.

A549 cells were seeded on 100-mm Petri dishes at 1.0 × 106 cells/plate on the day before transfection and transfected with 2–20 μg of phEP-1-(1–485) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-two hours after transfection, cells were exposed to 0.5 or 21% O2 for 6 h and harvested for RNA analysis. The expression of the dominant-negative HIF-2α mutant was evaluated by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled randomly primed cDNA probe of dominant-negative HIF-2α (phEP-1-(1–485)). HIF-1 DNA Binding—A TransFactor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BD Mercury™, Clontech) for HIF-1 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A549 cell nuclear extracts were incubated in wells coated with the consensus binding sequence of HIF-1 (HRE). Bound HIF-1 and HIF-2 were detected by specific primary antibodies: two mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against human HIF-1α (from the kit) and human HIF-2α (sc-13596, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect the bound primary antibody. The blue enzyme product quantity was proportional to the amount of transcription factor bound to the DNA in the well. These experiments were also performed in the presence of 500 ng of an oligonucleotide sequence containing the putative HRE found in the human aHIF promoter (5′-GTG CTG CGC CCG AGC ACG TAC TGA GGC GTG GCC-3′) (30Rossignol F. Vache C. Clottes E. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or a mismatch of this putative HRE sequence (5′-GTG CTG CGC CCG AGC GCG TAC TGA GGC GCG GCC-3′). Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as the means ± S.D. with n = 3–5 in separate culture and are expressed as the ratio compared with the conditions of the normoxic control. For intergroup comparison, one-way analyses of variance were performed, and the difference was analyzed with Scheffe's test as a post-hoc analysis. To evaluate whether HIF-α mRNA regulation is dependent on ongoing transcription or ongoing protein synthesis, two-way analyses of variance were performed. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Acute Hypoxia Similarly Regulates HIF-1α and HIF-2α Expression in Alveolar Epithelial Cells—HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins were determined in whole cell and nuclear extracts of A549 cells. During normoxia, HIF-1α was almost undetectable in both whole cell and nuclear extracts, whereas HIF-2α was detectable in whole cell extracts, but not in nuclear extracts. Exposure to hypoxia (0.5% O2) for 4 h induced HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein accumulation in both whole cell and nuclear extracts (Fig. 1A). The hypoxic induction of HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins was dependent on the following: (i) cell density, with a reduced hypoxic response when the cells were cultured at low density (data not shown), and (ii) O2 concentration, with the increase seen for O2 concentrations below 3%, with maximal stimulation at 0.5% O2 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the response to graded hypoxia was strikingly similar for HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins. To investigate whether increases in HIF-α protein levels are related to post-transcriptional or post-translational changes, HIF mRNA levels were also evaluated after a 4-h incubation at different O2 concentrations. Four hours of hypoxia did not change HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNA levels (Fig. 1C), suggesting that hypoxia-induced increases in HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins are likely due to translational or post-translational changes. Important insights into the mechanism of oxygen sensing and/or signal transduction underlying HIF-1α activation have been gained using pharmacological interventions that perturb the response to HIF-1α. To compare the regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, we measured the response of each protein to several of these interventions. CoCl2 and iron chelators mimic hypoxia in activation of target genes and induce HIF-1α and HIF-2α at the protein levels (7Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J.

When A549 cells were exposed to CoCl2 or desferrioxamine), a marked and similar increase in HIF-1α and HIF-2α was observed, and this effect was dependent on the concentration of hypoxia-mimetic compounds (Fig. 2A). Because mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are reported to be regulators of HIF-1α stabilization (13Agani F.H. Pichiule P. Chavez J.C. LaManna J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35863-35867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Schroedl C. McClintock D.S. Budinger G.R. Chandel N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L922-L931Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we then examined the effects of cytosol and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species inhibitors on HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a precursor of glutathione and a thiol donor, did not prevent the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α or HIF-2α (data not shown). In contrast, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species inhibitors such as rotenone, diphenyleneiodonium, and myxothiazol dramatically reduced hypoxia-induced HIF-1α and HIF-2α accumulation, with a greater effect on HIF-1α than on HIF-2α (Fig. 2B). These results show similar responses of HIF-1α and HIF-2α and suggest that their protein stabilization requires, at least in part, a functional electron transport chain. Effect of Prolonged Hypoxia on HIF-1α and HIF-2α Protein Accumulation in A549 Cells—To evaluate the kinetics of hypoxic induction of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in A549 cells, cells were exposed to hypoxia (0.5% O2) or CoCl2 (250 μm) from 4 to 12 h. Following the rapid induction of the HIF-1α protein observed at 4 h of hypoxia, HIF-1α protein levels diminished after 6 h and fell to base-line levels at 12 h of hypoxia. By contrast, the hypoxic induction of the HIF-2α protein remained unchanged from 4 to 12 h. Comparable results were obtained with CoCl2 treatment (Fig. 3). Interestingly, HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNA changes were also differentially regulated during sustained hypoxia (Fig. 4). Whereas 4 h of hypoxia did not affect either HIF-1α or HIF-2α mRNA levels, prolonged hypoxia induced dramatic and opposite changes in HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNA levels: HIF-1α mRNA levels dramatically decreased from 6 to 12 h of hypoxia, whereas HIF-2α mRNA levels significantly increased at the same time points. Comparable results were obtained with CoCl2 treatment (Fig. 4). To determine whether the differential regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNAs by hypoxia is specific for A549 cells, we also evaluated the effect of hypoxia on human lung microvascular endothelial cells, which express both HIF-1α and HIF-2α. In human lung microvascular endothelial cells, prolonged hypoxia also down-regulated HIF-1α mRNA levels, but did not change HIF-2α mRNA levels compared with control conditions (data n"

Molecular analysis of this process in Arabidopsis thaliana indicates that environmental control is exerted through the photoperiod and vernalization pathways, whereas endogenous signals regulate the autonomous and gibberellin pathways. The vernalization and autonomous pathways converge on the negative regulation of FLC3,4, a gene encoding a MADS-box protein that inhibits flowering3,4. We cloned FVE, a component of the autonomous pathway that encodes AtMSI4, a putative retinoblastoma-associated protein. FVE interacted with retinoblastoma protein in immunoprecipitation assays, and FLC chromatin was enriched in acetylated histones in fve mutants. We conclude that FVE participates in a protein complex repressing FLC transcription through a histone deacetylation mechanism. Our data provide genetic evidence of a new developmental function of these conserved proteins and identify a new genetic mechanism in the regulation of flowering."

Recently, we showed that ATX is identical to lysophospholipase D, which converts lysophosphatidylcholine to a potent bioactive phospholipid mediator, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), raising the possibility that autocrine or paracrine production of LPA by ATX contributes to tumor cell motility. Here we demonstrate that LPA and ATX mediate cell motility-stimulating activity through the LPA receptor, LPA1. In fibroblasts isolated from lpa1-/- mice, but not from wild-type or lpa2-/-, cell motility stimulated with LPA and ATX was completely absent. In the lpa1-/- cells, LPA-stimulated lamellipodia formation was markedly diminished with a concomitant decrease in Rac1 activation. LPA stimulated the motility of multiple human cancer cell lines expressing LPA1, and the motility was attenuated by an LPA1-selective antagonist, Ki16425. The present study suggests that ATX and LPA1 represent potential targets for cancer therapy.

The present study suggests that ATX and LPA1 represent potential targets for cancer therapy. Cell migration is an important cellular function for many physiological processes, such as embryonic morphogenesis, wound healing, immune-cell trafficking, and brain development (1Singer S.J. Kupfer A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition to physiological functions, cancer cells use migration mechanisms that are similar to those that occur in non-neoplastic cells (2Friedl P. Wolf K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). The principles of cell migration were initially investigated in non-neoplastic fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and myoblasts, and additional studies on tumor cells identified the same basic mechanisms. Understanding more about the cellular and molecular basis of different cell migration/invasion mechanisms will help us to explain how cancer cells disseminate and should lead to new treatment strategies.Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; ATX, autotaxin; OMPT, 1-oleoyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerophosphothionate; PTX, pertussis toxin; MSF, mouse skin fibroblast; GAPDH, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase; Edg, endothelial cell differentiation gene; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; ATX, autotaxin; OMPT, 1-oleoyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerophosphothionate; PTX, pertussis toxin; MSF, mouse skin fibroblast; GAPDH, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase; Edg, endothelial cell differentiation gene; GST, glutathione S-transferase. (1- or 2-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate) is a naturally occurring phospholipid. It evokes a variety of biological responses, including platelet aggregation, smooth-muscle contraction, neurite retraction, and cell proliferation (3Moolenaar W.H. Exp.

LPA stimulates cell migration in many cell types in vitro, including fibroblasts, gliomas, T lymphomas, and colorectal cancer cells (5Manning T.J. Parker J.C. Sontheimer H. Cell Motil.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). A role for LPA signaling in cancer cell migration received further support from the identification of autotaxin (ATX), a protein previously implicated in neoplastic invasion and metastasis (9Stracke M.L. Clair T. Liotta L.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as a major biosynthetic enzyme for LPA. ATX was found to be identical to lysophospholipase D, an LPA-producing enzyme in blood that converts lysophosphatidylcholine to LPA (10Umezu G.M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K.

ATX also shows properties of a nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase, which might also explain its bioactivities. It has been shown that LPA- and ATX-stimulated cell motility is attenuated by treating cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) (8Mills G.B. Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev.

LPA elicits most of the cellular events via signal transduction cascades downstream of its specific GPCRs, LPA1/Edg-2, LPA2/Edg-4, LPA3/Edg-7, which belong to the Edg (endothelial cell differentiation gene) family, and LPA4/GPR23, a non-Edg family LPA receptor (4Contos J.J.

Several experiments have demonstrated that these GPCRs can mediate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, phospholipase C activation, and calcium mobilization through PTX-sensitive (Gi/o) and -insensitive G proteins (G12/13 and Gq/11/14) (4Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, the LPA receptor subtype involved in LPA-induced cell motility remained to be identified.In this study, we explored the role of each LPA receptor in LPA- and ATX-induced cell migration. Our results clearly indicate that LPA- and ATX-induced cell motility is driven by LPA1 activation. We also suggest a crucial role of Rac1 activation in LPA1-mediated cell migration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—1-oleoyl-LPA (18:1) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant ATX/lysophospholipase D protein was prepared as described previously (10Umezu G.M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—Mouse skin fibroblast (MSF) cells were prepared from skin of newborn mice generated by wild-type or knock-out (lpa1-/- single, lpa2-/- single, and lpa1-/-lpa2-/- double) intercrosses as described previously (20Contos J.J.

MSF cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells from the first to the fifth passages were used for all experiments. All cancer cell lines used in this study were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum as described previously (21Yamori T. Matsunaga A. Sato S. Yamazaki K. Komi A. Ishizu K. Mita I. Edatsugi H. Matsuba Y. Takezawa K. Nakanishi O. Kohno H. Nakajima Y. Komatsu H. Andoh T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4042-4049PubMed Google Scholar).Chemotaxis Assay—Cell migration was measured in a modified Boyden chamber as described previously (10Umezu G.M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In brief, polycarbonate filters with 5-μm (MSF cells) or 8-μm pores (carcinoma cell lines) (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) were coated with 0.001% of fibronectin (Sigma). Cells (1 × 105 cells in 200 μl/well) were loaded into upper chambers and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow migration. The cell migration to the bottom side of the filter was evaluated by measuring optical densities at 590 nm. For PTX and Ki16425 treatment, cells were preincubated with 10 ng ml-1 of PTX for 24 h and 1 μm Ki16425 for 30 min, respectively.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA from cells was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippongene, Toyama, Japan) and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in PCR reaction were as follows. LPA1 (mouse)-forward gaggaatcgggacaccatgat; LPA1 (mouse)-reverse acatccagcaataacaagaccaatc; LPA1 (human)-forward aatcgggataccatgatgagtctt; LPA1 (human)-reverse ccaggagtccagcagatgataaa; LPA2 (mouse)-forward gaccacactcagcctagtcaagac; LPA2 (mouse)-reverse cttacagtccaggccatcca; LPA2 (human)-forward cgctcagcctggtcaagact; LPA2 (human)-reverse ttgcaggactcacagcctaaac; LPA3 (mouse)-forward gctcccatgaagctaatgaagaca; LPA3 (mouse)-reverse aggccgtccagcagcaga; LPA3 (human)-forward aggacacccatgaagctaatgaa; LPA3 (human)-reverse gccgtcgaggagcagaac.

GAPDH (mouse/human)-forward gccaaggtcatccatgacaact; GAPDH (mouse/human)-reverse gaggggccatccacagtctt. PCR reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The transcript number of mouse GAPDH was quantified, and each sample was normalized on the basis of GAPDH content.Intracellular Calcium Mobilization—A-2058 cells were incubated with 5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Dojin, Tokyo, Japan) in calcium ringer buffer (150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following stimulation with LPA, cytosolic calcium was measured by monitoring fluorescence intensity at an emission wavelength of 500 nm and excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm using a CAF-110 (JACS, Tokyo, Japan).Fluorescence Microscopy—MSF cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, grown in the presence of serum to subconfluence, and starved for 24 h by replacing the medium with serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Then the cells were treated with 1 μm LPA in serum-free medium for 3 h and stained for F-actin with BODIPY FL phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacture's protocol.Rac1 and RhoA Activity Assays—Measurement of Rac1 and RhoA activities was performed as described previously (22Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells starved for 24 h were stimulated with LPA (1 μm) and lysed for 5 min in ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing GST-αPAK or GST-Rhotekin. The cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min at 4 °C. After the beads had been washed with the cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Rac1 antibody (BD Biosciences) or anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTSTo determine whether LPA receptors are required for LPA-dependent cell motility and, if so, which receptor subtype and signaling cascade are utilized, we generated MSF cells isolated from newborn mice. The MSF cells expressed LPA1, LPA2, and LPA4 with an undetectable level of LPA3 as judged by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). In the Boyden chamber assay, MSF cells migrated in response to LPA and the response was PTX-sensitive (Fig. 1A). We therefore examined LPA-induced cell motility in MSF cells isolated from previously established LPA receptor knock-out mice (20Contos J.J. Ishii I. Fukushima N. Kingsbury M.A. Ye X. Kawamura S. Brown J.H. Chun J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 23Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The migratory response was completely abolished in MSF cells isolated from lpa1-/- mice (Fig. 2A). MSF cells from lpa2-/- mice migrated normally in response to LPA (Fig. 2A). The lpa1-/- MSF cells migrated normally in response to platelet-derived growth factor, a potent inducer of migration for fibroblasts (Fig. 2B), indicating that the lpa1-/- cells have defects in their response to LPA but not migration per se. We also found that ATX stimulated the migration of MSF cells (Fig. 3) in a PTX-sensitive manner (data not shown). The migratory response induced by ATX also disappeared in MSF cells from lpa1-/- mice but not from wild-type or lpa2-/- mice (Fig. 3). These data demonstrated that of the three LPA receptors expressed in the MSF cells, LPA1 is at least essential for LPA-stimulated cell migration. They also show that the motility effects of ATX are mediated by LPA signaling.Fig. 2LPA1 is essential for LPA-induced cell motility in mouse skin fibroblasts.

LPA stimulated cell migration of multiple carcinoma cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), A-2058 (melanoma), A549 (lung cancer), ACHN (renal cancer), SF295 (glioblastoma), and SF539 (glioblastoma) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, these cells were found to express LPA1 endogenously as judged by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4). LPA did not support the migration of MCF7 (breast cancer), HT-29 (colorectal cancer), KM-12 (colorectal cancer), OVCAR-4 (ovarian cancer), OVCAR-8 (ovarian cancer), NCI-H522 (lung cancer), LNCaP (prostate cancer), and HeLa (cervical cancer) cells, and these cells did not appreciably express LPA1 (Fig. 4). There was no obvious correlation between LPA-induced cell motility and expression of the three other LPA receptors, LPA2, LPA3, or LPA4 (Fig. 4). ATX also induced migratory effects in LPA1-expressing cells (Fig. 5) but not in cells that did not express LPA1 (data not shown). Recently, an LPA1-selective antagonist, Ki16425, (Ki values were 0.25 μm for LPA1, 5.60 μm for LPA2, and 0.36 μm for LPA3) were developed (24Ohta H. Sato K. Murata N. Damirin A. Malchinkhuu E. Kon J. Kimura T. Tobo M. Yamazaki Y. Watanabe T. Yagi M. Sato M. Suzuki R. Murooka H. Sakai T. Nishitoba T. Im D.S. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Tomura H. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It has not been tested whether Ki16425 affects the activation of LPA4. We then monitored intracellular calcium mobilization in HeLa cells transiently transfected with human and mouse LPA4 cDNA and found that it was not inhibited by 1 μm Ki16425 (data not shown). Ki16425 inhibited the migratory response of LPA1-expressing cells to both LPA and ATX (Figs. 4 and 5). Because Ki16425 is also a weak antagonist for LPA3, it is possible that LPA3 could be involved in the LPA- or ATX-stimulated cell motility of LPA3-expressing cells. However, carcinoma cell lines expressing LPA3 but not LPA1 (OVCAR-8 and LNCaP) did not migrate in response to LPA (Fig. 4). In addition, OMPT, an LPA3-selective agonist we recently developed (25Hasegawa Y. Erickson J.R. Goddard G.J. Yu S. Liu S. Cheng K.W. Eder A. Bandoh K. Aoki J. Jarosz R. Schrier A.D. Lynch K.R. Mills G.B. Fang X. J. Biol.

OMPT did activate intracellular calcium mobilization more effectively than LPA (Fig. 6B), indicating that OMPT activates LPA3 in A-2058 cells. These results argue against the possibility that LPA3 mediates LPA- or ATX-induced cell motility-stimulating activity. Thus, it can be concluded that LPA and ATX stimulate cell motility through LPA1 but not through other LPA receptors, at least for the range of neoplastic cells examined here.Fig. 4LPA1 is involved in LPA-induced cell motility in multiple carcinoma cell lines. In each cell line, the upper panel shows migratory response to LPA either in the absence (open circles) or presence (filled circles) of an LPA1-selective antagonist, Ki16425 (1 μm), evaluated by the Boyden chamber assay. The lower panel shows expression of each LPA receptor mRNA (lpa1, lpa2, lpa3, and lpa4) measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The LPA-induced migratory responses appear to be parallel with the expression of LPA1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Ki16425 inhibits ATX-induced cell motility of carcinoma cell-expressing LPA1.

Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). LPA signaling stimulates cytoskeletal reorganization in various cell types through activation of Rho GTPases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlined, particularly at receptor level, remained to be solved. We recently showed that LPA-induced stress fiber formation in mouse embryonic meningeal fibroblast cells (MEMFs) requires either LPA1 or LPA2 activation, based on the observation that it was severely affected in MEMFs from lpa1-/-lpa2-/- mice but not in MEMFs from wild-type, lpa1-/-, and lpa2-/- mice (20Contos J.J.

In the present study, we tried to confirm the same effect in MSF cells derived from each LPA receptor knock-out mouse. However, we could not evaluate this in the MSF cells because abundant stress fibers were formed even in the absence of LPA. By contrast, we found that LPA-induced lamellipodia formation in MSF cells requires only LPA1 expression. In wild-type and lpa2-/- cells, LPA increased the number of cells with ruffling membranes (lamellipodia formation). In contrast, LPA did not affect the lamellipodia formation in lpa1-/- and lpa1-/-lpa2-/- MSF cells (Fig. 7, A and B).Fig. 7LPA induces lamellipodia formation through LPA1.

Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Rac1 regulates lamellipodia, whereas RhoA regulates the formation of contractile actin-myosin filaments to form stress fibers (28Etienne M.S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). LPA-stimulated migration of MSF cells was efficiently blocked by pretreatment of the cells with Y-27632 (data not shown), an inhibitor of Rho kinase that inactivates the RhoA pathway. We therefore measured the LPA-induced activation of the two small GTPases, Rac1 and RhoA, in MSF cells. Rac1 and RhoA were measured with GST-PAK and GST-Rhotekin pull-down assays, respectively. When MSF cells from wild-type and lpa2-/- mice were stimulated with 1 μm LPA, a GTP-bound form of Rac1 was dramatically increased (Fig. 8). By contrast, Rac1 activation was almost completely abolished in both lpa1-/- and lpa1-/-lpa2-/- MSF cells (Fig. 8). Although RhoA activation in response to LPA was obvious in wild-type and lpa2-/- MSF cells, it appeared to be reduced in lpa1-/- MSF cells and markedly reduced in lpa1-/--lpa2-/- MSF cells (Fig. 8). These results indicate that LPA1 has a major role in both Rac1 and RhoA activation induced by LPA stimulation (Fig. 9). The Rac1 activation is predominantly dependent on LPA1, whereas RhoA activation is less dependent on LPA1. LPA2 does contribute to the activation of RhoA in the absence of LPA1 expression. In addition, RhoA can be activated to some extent (Fig. 8) in the absence of LPA1 and LPA2, indicating the presence of other LPA receptors and/or indirect mechanisms of RhoA activation (Fig. 9).Fig. 8LPA-induced activation of Rac1 and RhoA in MSF cells. MSF cells were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with 1 μm LPA. Activated RhoA and Rac1 were isolated using GST-PAK (Rac1, upper panel) or GST-Rhotekin (RhoA, lower panel) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Rac1 and RhoA bound to the beads were detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 9Model for LPA- or ATX-induced cell motility. ATX activates Rac1 and RhoA through Gi and G12/13, respectively, by producing LPA. The activation of Rac1 and RhoA results in membrane ruffling and stress fiber formation, which finally lead to activation of cell motility. The Rac1 activation is predominantly dependent on LPA, whereas RhoA activation is induced by either LPA1 or LPA2 activation. LPA1- and LPA2-independent pathways also contribute partially to RhoA activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONLPA is a multifunctional signaling molecule with diverse activities, including stimulation of cell motility. Recent identification of lysophospholipase D, an LPA-producing enzyme, as ATX, a cell-motility stimulating factor of cancer cells (10Umezu G.M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T.

In this study we showed that among the four LPA receptors identified so far, LPA1 has a crucial role in LPA-induced cell migration of fibroblast cells (Fig. 2) and multiple cancer cells (Fig. 4), based on the observation that inactivation of LPA1 either by gene-targeting technique or by a receptor-selective antagonist resulted in loss of migratory response. In addition, we observed that the migratory response induced by ATX again disappeared in these cells (Figs. 3 and 5). These results clearly show that ATX exerts its function through LPA production and the following LPA1 activation. Both LPA1 and ATX are highly expressed in brain (14Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 29Fuss B. Baba H. Phan T. Tuohy V.K. Macklin W.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 23: 9095-9103Crossref Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that oligodendrocytes express LPA1 and ATX during myelination (30Weiner J.A. Hecht J.H. Chun J. J. Comp.

We also found that LPA1 and ATX are highly enriched within certain regions of developing mouse brain, such as olfactory bulb. 2M. Fukaya, M. Watanabe, J. Aoki, and H. Arai, unpublished result. The colocalization of the two genes suggests that they also function co-operatively in physiological condition.The migratory responses were found to be PTX-sensitive (Fig. 1A). By contrast, in a previous report LPA was found to stimulate cell motility of other cell types, such as lymphoma cells, in a PTX-insensitive manner (6Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A.

A cis-acting element responsive to cold and drought, the C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element (C/DRE), was identified in the Arabidopsis thaliana stress-inducible genes RD29A and COR15a and found in other cold-inducible genes in various plants. C/DRE-binding factor/DRE-binding protein (CBF/DREB) is an essential component of the cold-acclimation response, but the signaling pathways and networks are mostly unknown. Here we used targeted genetic approach to isolate A. thaliana mutants with altered cold-responsive gene expression (acg) and identify ACG1 as a negative regulator of the CBF/DREB pathway. acg1 flowered late and had elevated expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a repressor of flowering encoding a MADS-box protein. We showed that acg1 is a null allele of the autonomous pathway gene FVE. FVE encodes a homolog of the mammalian retinoblastoma-associated protein, a component of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex involved in transcriptional repression. We also showed that plants sense intermittent cold stress through FVE and delay flowering with increasing expression of FLC. Dual roles of FVE in regulating the flowering time and the cold response may have an evolutionary advantage for plants by increasing their survival rates."

We previously demonstrated that amino acid deprivation and other inducers of endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ER stress) up-regulate the expression of VEGF in the retinal-pigmented epithelial cell line ARPE-19. Because homocysteine causes ER stress, we hypothesized that VEGF expression is increased by ambient homocysteine. dl-Homocysteine-induced VEGF expression was investigated in confluent ARPE-19 cultures. Northern analysis showed that homocysteine increased steady state VEGF mRNA levels 4.4-fold. Other thiol-containing compounds, including l-homocysteine thiolactone and DTT, induced VEGF expression 7.9- and 8.8-fold. Transcriptional run-on assays and mRNA decay studies demonstrated that the increase in VEGF mRNA levels was caused by increased transcription rather than mRNA stabilization. VEGF mRNA induction paralleled that of the ER-stress gene GRP78. Homocysteine treatment caused transient phosphorylation of eIF2α and an increase in ATF4 protein level. Overexpression of a dominant-negative ATF4 abolished the VEGF response to homocysteine treatment and to amino acid deprivation. VEGF mRNA expression by ATF4–/– MEF did not respond to homocysteine treatment and the response was restored with expression of wild-type ATF4. These studies indicate that expression of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF is increased by homocysteine and other thiol-containing reductive compounds via ATF4-dependent activation of VEGF transcription.

VEGF has a distinct role in physiologic angiogenesis and is thus essential for normal embryogenesis (2Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Keller G.A. Rangell L. Wright B.D. Radtke F. Aguet M. Ferrara N. Development. 1999; 126: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of VEGF expression is involved in many angiogenesis-driven pathologies including diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of morbidity among diabetic patients and the leading cause of new blindness for persons of working age (3Pulido J.S. The Present Problem and the Future.12. Ophthalmology Clinics of North America, W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia1999: 564Google Scholar). DR is characterized by loss of retinal capillaries leading to progressive retinal ischemia, increased retinal vascular permeability, and new retinal vessel growth. During proliferative stages of DR plasma and vitreous levels of VEGF are elevated in diabetic patients (4Aiello L.P. Wong J.S. Kidney Int. Suppl. 2000; 77: S113-S119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Many different cell types in the eye produce VEGF, including retinal pigment epithelium, endothelial cells, pericytes, glial cells, and ganglion cells (5Aiello L.P. Northrup J.M. Keyt B.A. Takagi H. Iwamoto M.A. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1995; 113: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). An understanding of the stimuli that up-regulate VEGF expression in the diabetic retina is essential to development of effective treatments for DR. Several theories have been proposed to explain the VEGF-driven neovascularization of the retina. Oxygen tension markedly affects VEGF expression, increasing VEGF transcription and stabilizing VEGF mRNA (6Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF expression is increased by advanced glycation end products (AGE) (7Lu M. Kuroki M. Amano S. Tolentino M.

Thus, factors other than hypoxia may influence retinal VEGF expression and play a role in triggering the vascular complications associated with diabetes. Although controversial (12Agardh E.

However, a mechanism by which elevated homocysteine could contribute to development of retinal neovascularization is obscure. Moore et al. (19Moore P. El-sherbeny A. Roon P. Schoenlein P.V.

Eye Res. 2001; 73: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) demonstrated that intraocular injection of homocysteine in mice stimulated N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and apoptotic cell death in the retinal ganglion cell layer in a manner that resembled early diabetic degenerative processes. However, these authors did not examine the effect of homocysteine on retinal VEGF expression, permeability or neovascularization. Another effect of homocysteine is perturbation of protein disulfide formation and protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (20Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin.

Investig. 2001; 107: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) showed that the altered gene expression in homocysteine-treated cells was due to activation the ER stress response pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR represents a set of signaling cascades by which conditions within the ER are communicated to the protein translation machinery and to the nucleus in order to balance the folding capacity of the ER with the protein processing demand (25Talloczy Z. Jiang W. Virgin H.W.t. Leib D.A. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Eskelinen E.L. Levine B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). These cascades are activated when the function of the ER is perturbed, or when the substrate protein burden on the ER outstrips the processing capacity. One branch of the UPR is initiated by activation of PERK, an eIF2α kinase. Phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits GDP/GTP exchange and thus the re-formation of ternary translation initiation complexes, thereby slowing global protein translation. Decreased initiation paradoxically leads to increased expression of ATF4. The structure of ATF4 mRNA includes a number of short upstream open reading frames (uORF) that precede the functional coding sequence. Phosphorylation of eIF2α creates conditions that favor downstream re-initiation and synthesis of ATF4 in ER-stressed and nutrient-deprived cells (26Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Ultimately, ATF4 induces the expression of numerous genes, including genes involved in amino acid import, metabolism, and assimilation (27Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M.

In this study, we demonstrate that homocysteine is a novel inducer of VEGF expression in a human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) and that homocysteine increases VEGF expression due to ATF4-dependent activation of VEGF transcription. Cell Culture—ARPE-19 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, low glucose formulation) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) obtained from homozygous and heterozygous ATF4 knockout mice (28Masuoka H.C. Townes T.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM (high glucose formulation) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine, and 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol. For Northern blotting experiments, cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and grown to confluence. One day prior to treatment, cells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and fed with fresh medium. dl-Homocysteine, d-homocysteine thiolactone, l-homocysteine thiolactone, or dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma) were prepared fresh in DMEM and sterilized by filtration before added to the cell cultures. Reduced d- and l-homocysteine were generated as previously described (29Chambers J.C. Ueland P.M. Wright M. Dore C.J. Refsum H. Kooner J.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, d- and l-homocysteine thiolactone were incubated in 5 n NaOH for 5 min at 20 °C, the solutions were then neutralized with HCl, diluted in DMEM, and administered to the cell cultures. For ELISA experiments, 105 cells per well were plated in 6-well plates, grown to confluence, fed with fresh medium 1 day prior to rinse with DPBS (2×), and fed with fresh medium (3 ml per well) containing dl-homocysteine or normal medium. For mRNA decay experiments, cells were treated with homocysteine for 3 h, followed by a dose of 5 μg/μl actinomycin D (actD) (Sigma) and then incubated for various times as described in the figure legends. For experiments utilizing adenoviral vectors, subconfluent cultures of ARPE-19 cells were treated with either ATF4 wild-type (Wt), ATF4 mutant (DN), or the empty AdEasy vector (empty). Twenty hours postinfection, the percentage of cells infected was determined from the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Anoxic conditions were created by sealing cell cultures within plastic bags along with a filter paper bag containing finely divided iron (Anaerocult®, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Upon addition of water, an oxidative reaction produces an oxygen-free environment confirmed by a colorimetric indicator strip (Anaerotest®, Merck). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blotting was performed as previously described (30Abcouwer S.F. Schwarz C. Meguid R.A. J. Biol.

Total RNA was isolated by the one-step acid-phenol guanidinium procedure (31Chomcynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar) utilizing RNA-Stat60™ Reagent (TelTest, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by an additional acid-phenol, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 volumes of 3 m sodium acetate. Total RNA (12 μg/lane) was fractionated on 0.2 m formaldehyde/1.0% (w/v) agarose gels and transferred overnight onto a 0.45 micron Magna nylon membrane (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) in 10× SSC. The RNA was cross-linked using a CL-1000 UV cross-linker (UVP, Upland, CA) before hybridization. Specific probes were generated by labeling the cDNA fragments with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled DNA probe for 6–8 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 7% (v/v) SDS, 0.25 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, as described elsewhere (32Kevil C.G. Walsh L. Laroux F.S. Kalogeris T. Grisham M.B. Alexander J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Blotting results were quantified by overnight exposure to a phosphor screen followed by analysis using a STORM™ phosphorimager and Image Quant™ software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For each sample, hybridization to 18 S rRNA was used to normalize results for mRNAs. Fold-inductions were determined by dividing normalized mRNA band intensity volumes for experimental samples to that of control (untreated or time 0) samples. RNA decay analysis was performed using the single compartmental model (see Ref. 33Hargrove J.L. Hulsey M.G. Beale E.G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar for review of this model and its application to mRNA decay curves). mRNA half-life was calculated as ln(2)/k, where k is the decay constant estimated by analysis of kinetic data. Decay constants used to calculate half-lives of VEGF mRNAs were estimated by fitting semi-log plots of (corrected, normalized mRNA concentration) versus time (30Abcouwer S.F. Schwarz C. Meguid R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28645-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA using a RNA PCR reagent kit GeneAmp ® Gold RNA PCR Reagent kit. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; 40 cycles, followed by a 4-min 72 °C incubation performed in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR products were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis using 3.3% Synergel® (Diversified Biotech, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Products were photographed under UV light using the GENEGNOME® imaging system (Synergene, Cambridge, UK). Forward and reverse primers used for the amplification of the edited segment of XBP-1 mRNA were 5′-GAAGCCAAGGGGAATGAAGTGAGG-3′ and 5′-CATGGGGAGATGTTCTGGAGGGG-3′, respectively. Nuclear Run-on Assay—Triplicate 15 cm plates were treated as described in the figure legend. 3 h post-treatment cells were mechanically removed from flasks by scraping in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), gently vortexed, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted and washed once with cold lysis buffer. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 130 μl of RNase free water along with 1 μl of Rnasin and 150 μl of 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 20 μm ATP, 1 mm CTP, 1 mm GTP, and 1 mm UTP). Transcription was initiated by addition of 10 μl of 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]ATP. Nuclei were then incubated in a 30 °C water bath for 30 min. The reaction was then terminated by addition of 50 μl of DNase I buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 3.0 m NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 12 mm CaCl2) and ∼600 units of DNase I followed by incubation for 10 min at 30 °C. Protein digestion was then carried out at 42 °C for 30 min with the addition of 20 μl (5% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.125 m EDTA), 10 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (200 μg/sample). Following digestion, the nuclear RNA was extracted with the RNeasy® system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled nuclear RNA was captured by immobilized, in vitro transcribed chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, GAPDH, and VEGF antisense RNAs. The DNA templates were derived by PCR using the following primers to amplify fragments of cDNAs with the addition of T7 promoter sequences (underlined): VEGF (5′-GCCACCACACCATCACCATCG-3′) and (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCTTTCTGTCCGTCTGACCTGGG-3′), GAPDH (5′-TCAACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGGG-3′) and (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAAAGGTGGAGGAGTGGGTGTCG-3′), and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (5′-ACATTTTGAGGCATTTCAGTCAGTTGC-3′) and (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGTCAGCGGCATCAGCACCTTGTCG-3′). 1 μg of each template DNA was then used to synthesize unlabeled antisense RNA probes using MAXIscript™ in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was then blotted onto nylon membrane as described previously (35Kane K.K. Hawkins D.E. Pulsipher G.D. Denniston D.J. Krehbiel C.R. Thomas M.G. Petersen M.K. Hallford D.M. Remmenga M.D. Roberts A.J. Keisler D.H. J. Animal Sci. 2004; 82: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for 30 min in 5 ml of ULTRAhyb® (Ambion) at 68 °C. Hybridization with the labeled nuclear RNA (1–3 × 106 cpm/ml) was then carried out for 24 h at 68 °C in ULTRAhyb®. Washing of membranes and detection of captured RNA transcripts was performed as described for Northern blotting analysis (above). ELISA—ELISA assays were performed using commercial VEGF ELISA kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Conditioned media was collected from wells, aliquoted, and stored frozen until assayed. Samples were diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer provided with the kit prior to assaying. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the readings were compared with standard curves obtained with human recombinant VEGF165, provided with the kit. ATF4 Adenoviral Vector Construction—Wild-type and DN mutant ATF4 cDNAs were expressed using the AdEasy adenoviral vector system (36He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) provided by Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Institute, Johns Hopkins University). Plasmids containing murine wild-type ATF4 (Wt) cDNA and DN mutant ATF4 (DN) cDNA were kindly provided by Jawed Alam (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center) who generated the ATF4 Wt plasmid (pEFmATF4myc) by inserting the murine ATF4 cDNA into the PmlI site of the pEF/myc/mito vector (Invitrogen), thus removing the mitochondrial targeting sequence (37He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These authors constructed the ATF4ΔRK (DN) plasmid (pEF/mATF4M) by PCR-generated overlap extension to create seven amino acid substitutions within the DNA-binding domain (292RYRQKKR298 to 292GYLEAAA298). The mutant cDNA was cloned into the PmlI-NotI sites of the pEF/myc/mito vector, again removing the mitochondrial targeting sequence. To clone into the AdEasy system, Wt and DN coding sequences from these vectors were amplified by PCR using a 5′-NotI-containing (underlined) forward primer (5′-AACAACAACGCGGCCGCTGTCGTGAACACCATGACCGAG-3′) and a 5′-HindIII-containing (underlined) reverse primer (5′-GTTGTTGTTAAGCTTTAGACTATGCGGCCCCATTCAG-3′). The PCR reaction was carried out with Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 95 °C 1 min, 55 °C 2 min, 72 °C 1 min, for 35 cycles followed by a 7-min 72 °C incubation. The PCR products were cloned into the pAdTrack-CMV adenoviral shuttle vector encoding kanamycin resistance and containing a second expression cassette encoding GFP. The shuttle vectors were then linearized with the restriction enzyme PmeI and electroporated into DH5α electrocompetent cells along with the adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. Clones containing recombinant plasmids pAE-ATF4-Wt and pAE-ATF4-DN, formed by homologous recombination, were subsequently selected for kanamycin resistance and identified by plasmid size in conjunction with endonuclease analysis. At this stage the coding sequences and insertion points of pAE-ATF4-Wt and pAE-ATF4-DN cDNAs were confirmed by the University of New Mexico School of Medicine DNA Sequencing Facility. Recombinant adenoviral vectors were generated by transfecting the 293 packaging cell line with PacI-linearized pAE-ATF4-Wt and pAE-ATF4-DN. Transfected cultures were maintained until the percentage of cells exhibiting green fluorescence approached 100%. Viruses were obtained by freeze/thaw lysis of the cells in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by clarification of the lysates by centrifugation at 6,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Lysates were used to infect large scale cultures of 293 cells for production of viral stock as described above. Western Blot Analysis of ATF4 Production—Cells were grown to confluence in 12-well plates. ATF4 virus was serially diluted from 1:20 to 1:160 in serum-free medium to determine the protein expression of the virus in the ARPE-19 cell line. 24 h following addition of the virus, cells were scraped from the dishes and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% SDC, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Protein contents of cleared lysates were determined with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of proteins (40 μg) were loaded into each lane and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gel. The protein bands were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with antibodies specific for ATF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphorylated eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or β-actin (Sigma). Proteins were detected with ECL™ chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then scanned and viewed by MultiGenius Bioimaging System® (Cambridge, UK). Response of VEGF, GADD153, and GRP78 mRNA Expression in ARPE-19 Cells to Homocysteine and other Thiol Compounds—To test the hypothesis that expression of VEGF mRNA is responsive to homocysteine and reductive stress, confluent ARPE-19 cells were cultured for 4 h in the following: 1) normal medium; 2) medium containing 10 mm dl-homocysteine; 3) medium containing 10 mm l-cysteine; 4) medium containing 10 mml-homocysteine thiolactone (the intramolecular ring counterpart to homocysteine); and 5) medium containing 5 mm DTT (a reducing agent known to cause ER stress). Total RNA was isolated, and normalized mRNA contents for each sample were compared with that of the untreated control (Fig. 1A). The ARPE-19 cells contained detectable amounts of a single mRNA species corresponding to VEGF. The amounts of VEGF mRNA relative to 18 S rRNA were increased 4.4-fold by dl-homocysteine, 7.9-fold by l-homocysteine thiolactone, and 8.8-fold by DTT. Cysteine caused an apparent 1.8-fold increase in VEGF mRNA content that was not statistically significant. To differentiate between the d- and l-isomers of homocysteine, d- and l-homocysteine thiolactone were hydrolyzed to produce d- and l-homocysteine, and cells were treated with 10 mm of each compound. Both d- and l-homocysteine were equally capable of inducing VEGF expression (data not shown), suggesting that the effect did not depend upon the cellular metabolism of homocysteine. The expression of ER stress-responsive genes was also examined to determine if these treatments caused activation of the UPR. The expression of GADD153 was also up-regulated 4.5-fold by dl-homocysteine, 1.9-fold by l-homocysteine thiolactone, and 3.8-fold by DTT. l-cysteine did not significantly upregulate GADD153 expression compared with the control. In addition, GRP78 was up-regulated 7.3-fold by dl-homocysteine, 3.3-fold by l-homocysteine thiolactone, and 4.8-fold by DTT. l-Cysteine did not significantly affect GRP78 mRNA expression. These results are in good agreement with past studies demonstrating the effect of homocysteine on these genes (22Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29659-29665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 959-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of thiol-containing compounds to activate an ER stress response was further evaluated by measuring the splicing of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) mRNA. Upon activation of the UPR, the ER transmembrane protein IRE1 acquires an endonuclease activity that subsequently excises a 26-base pair segment from XBP-1 mRNA, thereby, upon ligation, creating the open reading frame that encodes the transcription factor (38Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis with primers flanking the splicing site served as an extremely sensitive measure of UPR activation. Fig. 1B shows that a large fraction of XBP-1 mRNA is spliced in cells treated with dl-homocysteine, l-homocysteine thiolactone, and DTT. No XBP-1 splicing was detected in the control cells. Treatment with 10 mm cysteine caused only a very small amount of XBP-1 splicing that is illustrated by overloading of that PCR sample. The Time and Dose Response of VEGF to Homocysteine—To better define the rapidity of this response, a time course study was carried out with hourly measurements from 1 to 5 h in the presence of medium containing 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mm dl-homocysteine (Fig. 2). The time course for 0.1 mm dl-Hcys showed a 2.0-fold increase in VEGF mRNA content within 1 h of treatment. The response to 0.1 mm dl-Hcys was maximal at 2.0 h with a 3.8-fold induction and decreased rapidly thereafter. The up-regulation of GRP78 mRNA expression correlated closely with the up-regulation of VEGF mRNA during the 0.1 mm time course. The time course seen with 1.0 mm showed"

B., Remaley, A. T., Demosky, S. J., Jr., Stonik, J. A., Cooney, A. M., Comly, M., Dwyer, N. K., Zhang, M., Blanchette-Mackie, J., Santamarina-Fojo, S., and Brewer, H. B., Jr. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 27584-27590). The present study provides evidence that ABCA1 in late endocytic vesicles plays a role in cellular lipid efflux. Late endocytic trafficking was defective in Tangier disease fibroblasts that lack functional ABCA1. Consistent with a late endocytic protein trafficking defect, the hydrophobic amine U18666A retained NPC1 in abnormally tubulated, cholesterol-poor, Tangier disease late endosomes, rather than cholesterol-laden lysosomes, as in wild type fibroblasts. Consistent with a lipid trafficking defect, Tangier disease late endocytic vesicles accumulated both cholesterol and sphingomyelin and were immobilized in a perinuclear localization. The excess cholesterol in Tangier disease late endocytic vesicles retained massive amounts of NPC1, which traffics lysosomal cholesterol to other cellular sites. Exogenous apoA-I abrogated the cholesterol-induced retention of NPC1 in wild type but not in Tangier disease late endosomes. Adenovirally mediated ABCA1-GFP expression in Tangier disease fibroblasts corrected the late endocytic trafficking defects and restored apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. ABCA1-GFP expression in wild type fibroblasts also reduced late endosome-associated NPC1, induced a marked uptake of fluorescent apoA-I into ABCA1-GFP-containing endosomes (that shuttled between late endosomes and the cell surface), and enhanced apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. The combined results of this study suggest that ABCA1 converts pools of late endocytic lipids that retain NPC1 to pools that can associate with endocytosed apoA-I, and be released from the cell as nascent high density lipoprotein. We have previously established that the ABCA1 transporter, which plays a critical role in the lipidation of extracellular apolipoprotein acceptors, traffics between late endocytic vesicles and the cell surface (Neufeld, E.

Cholesterol plays a critical role in the sorting and trafficking of other membrane lipids and proteins and serves to stabilize the structure of membrane domains required for signal transduction (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The maintenance of optimal sterol levels for normal cellular function requires complex homeostatic cellular mechanisms that regulate cholesterol synthesis, intracellular trafficking, uptake, and efflux.

To date, the cellular site(s) of function of the human ABCA1 transporter remain(s) to be determined.

In the present study, we examined the functionality of ABCA1 residing in endocytic vesicles in human Tangier disease fibroblasts that lack a functional ABCA1 transporter. These studies revealed defective lipid and protein trafficking in late endocytic vesicles in Tangier disease fibroblasts that can be corrected by adenovirally mediated expression of GFP-tagged ABCA1. Our present findings suggest that ABCA1 in late endocytic vesicles (late endosomes and lysosomes) can mobilize late endocytic lipids for apoA-I-mediated cellular efflux. The ABCA1 transporter residing in late endocytic vesicles appears to convert pools of late endocytic lipids, which would otherwise associate with NPC1, to pools that can associate with apoA-I to form the nascent HDL particle.

Four different wild type cell lines and five Tangier disease cell lines, including the proband (24Remaley A.T. Rust S. Rosier M. Knapper C. Naudin L. Broccardo C. Peterson K.M. Koch C. Arnould I. Prades C. Duverger N. Funke H. Assman G. Dinger M. Dean M. Chimini G. Santamarina-Fojo S. Fredrickson D.S. Denefle P. Brewer Jr., H.B. PNAS. 1999; 96: 12685-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), were used. All five Tangier disease fibroblasts presented similar cellular phenotypes. Fibroblasts were cultured in AMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin/ml in humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For biochemical analyses, fibroblasts seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in plastic 24-well dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were incubated for 5-7 days in AMEM medium as above. For immunocytochemical analyses, fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells/well in AMEM, 5% LPDS medium in 9.5-cm glass microscope wells (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL). Some wild type and Tangier disease fibroblasts were transiently infected with adenovirus (Adv-ABCA1-GFP) containing the expression plasmid pTRE2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), encoding a chimeric ABCA1-GFP protein (pTRE2-ABCA1-GFP) (18Neufeld E.B. Demosky Jr., S.J. Stonik J.A. Combs C. Remaley A.T. Duverger N. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Isolation and Fluorescent Labeling of Apolipoprotein—Lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (25Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). ApoA-I purified from human plasma (26Brewer H.B. Ronan R. Meng M. Bishop C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was over 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequence analysis. The succinimidyl ester of Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was conjugated to apoA-I, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alexa 568-labeled human apoA-I was purified by gel filtration and then spin-concentrated (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany) to 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Lipid Efflux Assay—Cholesterol efflux was performed as described previously (17Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky Jr., S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Nearly confluent cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol for 32 h, washed, infected with AdvABCA1-GFP for 1 h, and then incubated for 16 h in AMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA (AMEM/BSA) in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml apoA-I or 10 μg/ml Alexa 568-apoA-I. Percentage efflux was calculated by subtracting the radioactive counts of blank media (AMEM/BSA) from the radioactive counts in the presence of apoA-I, and then dividing the result by the sum of the radioactive counts in the medium plus the cell fraction. Transport of Endocytosed Sphingomyelin—The transport of sphingomyelin along the endocytic pathway was assessed as described by Pagano and Chen (27Pagano R.E. Chen C.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild type and Tangier disease fibroblasts maintained in lipoprotein-depleted serum, as described above, were incubated with 5 μm BODIPY-sphingomyelin in Ham's F-12 medium without serum for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, chased in Ham's F-12 medium without serum for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and then incubated in 5% defatted BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed, and then imaged. Immunocytochemical Analyses—Cells in glass chamber slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were immunolabeled, using an indirect procedure, in which all incubations were performed either in blocker solution containing filipin (0.05%) and goat IgG (2.5 mg/ml) or 10% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline containing saponin (0.2%). Primary antibodies used were raised against NPC1 (11Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F.

Secondary Alexa 568-labeled antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution. Fluorescence was viewed with a ×40 (NA 1.3) oil immersion objective on a Zeiss 410 or 510 laser scanning confocal microscope, using a UV laser (Enterprise model Coherent, Inc.), an argon laser, and a HeNe laser, with excitation wavelengths of 364, 488, and 543 or 568 nm, for filipin, enhanced green fluorescent protein, and BODIPY, and Alexa 568 fluorescence, respectively. Time-lapse Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—For live cell imaging, cells prepared in glass chamber slides were maintained at 37 °C in an enclosed chamber using a feedback heater-blower (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Time-lapse images were obtained using a 60× (NA 1.4) oil objective on an Olympus IX-70 microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Orca ER) and a spinning disc confocal head. The optical slice thickness was ∼1 μm. Monochromatic 488 and 568 nm excitation light for GFP and Alexa 568 was provided by argon laser excitation controlled with an acousto-optical tunable filter, and detected using 505-540- and 580-620-nm BP emission filters, respectively. A total of 60 GFP, or DiI, or Alexa 568 images were acquired at a rate of 1/s. For dual color imaging, GFP and Alexa 568 images were obtained sequentially at an acquisition rate determined by their respective intensities. Capture, animation, and export to QuickTime movie were performed using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Downington, PA). Zoom, pseudocoloring, drawing, and text in QuickTime movies were added using Adobe AfterEffects software. Cholesterol Is Retained in Late Endocytic Vesicles in Tangier Disease Fibroblasts—We first examined the distribution of cellular cholesterol, revealed by cholesterol-specific cytochemical staining with filipin (11Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), in wild type and Tangier disease human skin fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Under conditions of cholesterol loading, Tangier disease fibroblasts accumulated cholesterol in perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 1A, c), established previously to represent late endocytic compartments (11Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To determine whether cholesterol in late endocytic vesicles can traffic to the surface, intracellular pools of cholesterol that traffic to the plasma membrane were depleted in living wild type and Tangier disease fibroblasts, using cyclodextrin as an extracellular acceptor (28Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the excess cholesterol retained in perinuclear vesicles in Tangier disease fibroblasts could not be depleted by cyclodextrin (Fig. 1A, d). This finding suggests that trafficking of cholesterol from late endocytic vesicles to the cell surface is perturbed in Tangier disease cells. The Motility of Late Endocytic Vesicles in Tangier Disease Fibroblasts Is Impaired—We have shown above that Tangier disease fibroblasts accumulate cholesterol in late endocytic compartments and have impaired trafficking of cholesterol to the cell surface. Excess cholesterol in late endocytic vesicles has been reported to impair their movement from the perinuclear region toward the cell periphery (29Lebrand C. Corti M. Goodson H. Cosson P. Cavalli V. Mayran N. Faure J. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To determine whether late endosomes in Tangier disease fibroblasts exhibit impaired motility, living wild type and Tangier disease fibroblasts were incubated with DiI-LDL, in order to label late endocytic vesicles, and then monitored by time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy. DiI-LDL-labeled late endocytic vesicles in living Tangier disease fibroblasts remained clustered in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1B) and exhibited impaired movement toward the cell surface (Movie 1, see Supplemental Material). These findings suggest that the cellular cholesterol sequestered in Tangier disease fibroblast late endocytic vesicles impairs their movement toward the cell surface. Cholesterol Retained in Tangier Disease Late Endocytic Vesicles Is Detergent-resistant—We next assessed the ability of detergent to extract cholesterol from late endocytic compartments in lipoprotein-depleted wild type and Tangier disease fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). Cholesterol retained in cells after cold Triton X-100 extraction has been shown to be associated with membrane microdomains enriched with sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids (30Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the majority of the cholesterol that accumulates in late endocytic vesicles in Tangier disease fibroblasts is detergent-resistant and thus appears to be associated with sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin Trafficking Is Perturbed in Tangier Disease Late Endocytic Vesicles—We next examined whether sphingomyelin was also retained in late endocytic compartments in Tangier disease fibroblasts (Fig. 1D). BODIPY-sphingomyelin was incorporated into the plasma membrane of living, lipoprotein-depleted, wild type and Tangier disease fibroblasts, and then allowed to traffic to intracellular compartments. Fluorescent sphingolipids incorporated into the plasma membrane of wild type fibroblasts trafficked to the Golgi, as reported previously (27Pagano R.E. Chen C.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Tangier disease fibroblasts presented a distinctive phenotype. Plasma membrane-derived BODIPY-sphingomyelin was retained in endocytic vesicles as well as in a markedly hypertrophied Golgi (Fig. 1D). Schmitz and co-workers (31Robenek H. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have reported previously that the Golgi is hypertrophied in Tangier disease fibroblasts. Cholesterol Retained in Tangier Disease Late Endocytic Vesicles Recruits NPC1—The sterol-sensing NPC1 protein resides in a distinctive subset of late endosomes (11Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S.

To probe further the functionality of ABCA1 in late endocytic compartments, we examined the effect of lipoprotein depletion on the distribution of cholesterol and NPC1 protein in Tangier disease fibroblasts. Maintenance of wild type fibroblasts in lipoprotein-free medium depletes cholesterol and NPC1 from late endocytic vesicles (32Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Neufeld E.B. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Patel S.

LDL uptake in lipoprotein-depleted wild type fibroblasts enriches the membranes of late endocytic vesicles with cholesterol, which then retains NPC1 (32Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Neufeld E.B. Love D.C.

The excess cholesterol that accumulates in Tangier disease late endocytic vesicles (Fig. 1) might be expected to retain excess NPC1. As shown in Fig. 2, cholesterol retained in late endocytic vesicles of lipoprotein-depleted Tangier disease fibroblasts did indeed retain NPC1. Most interesting, the structure of late endocytic vesicles in ABCA1-mutant Tangier disease fibroblasts is abnormal (Fig. 3). Late endocytic vesicles in Tangier disease fibroblasts often appear to be twisted, interconnected, and often dilated tubular structures.Fig. 3ApoA-I reduces NPC1 in wild type but not in Tangier disease late endocytic compartments. Wild type (A-F) and Tangier disease (G-L) fibroblasts were maintained in LPDS medium for 4-5 days and then incubated for an additional 24 h in LPDS medium containing 50 μg/ml LDL for 24 h. Cells were then incubated in medium containing 0.1% BSA in the absence (A-C and G-I) or presence (D-F and J-L) of 10 μg/ml apoA-I for 24 h, and then fixed and stained with filipin to reveal the cellular distribution of cholesterol (C, F, I, and L) and immunostained for NPC1 (red, A, D, G, and J) and LAMP2 (green, B, E, H, and K) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note the reduction in late endosomal NPC1 in the presence of apoA-I in wild type (D versus A) but not in Tangier disease (J versus G) fibroblasts, as well as the massive accumulation of NPC1 (G and J) and cholesterol (I and L) in Tangier disease late endocytic vesicles (H and K). The tubulated late endocytic vesicles seen in Tangier disease fibroblasts (J-L, arrowheads) are shown enlarged in (J′-L′). Note that the large, late endocytic vesicle, whose lumen is indicated by the asterisk, is marked by LAMP2 (K′) and NPC1 (J′) and is cholesterol-enriched on its surface membrane (L′).

However, for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced fibroblast migration, molecular links between EGF receptor (EGFR) activation and force generation have not been clarified. Herein, we demonstrate that EGF stimulation increases myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, a marker for contractile force, concomitant with protein kinase C (PKC) activity in mouse fibroblasts expressing human EGFR constructs. Interestingly, PKCδ is the most strongly phosphorylated isoform, and the preferential PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin largely prevented EGF-induced phosphorylation of PKC substrates and MARCKS. The pathway through which EGFR activates PKCδ is suggested by the fact that the MEK-1 inhibitor U0126 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 had no effect on PKCδ activation, whereas lack of PLCγ signaling resulted in delayed PKCδ activation. EGF-enhanced MLC phosphorylation was prevented by a specific MLC kinase inhibitor ML-7 and the PKC inhibitors chelerythrine chloride and rottlerin. Further indicating that PKCδ is required, a dominant-negative PKCδ construct or RNAi-mediated PKCδ depletion also prevented MLC phosphorylation. In the absence of PLC signaling, MLC phosphorylation and cell force generation were delayed similarly to PKCδ activation. All of the interventions that blocked PKCδ activation or MLC phosphorylation abrogated EGF-induced cell contractile force generation and motility. Our results suggest that PKCδ activation is responsible for a major part of EGF-induced fibroblast contractile force generation. Hence, we identify here a new pathway helping to govern cell motility, with PLC signaling playing a role in activation of PKCδ to promote the acute phase of EGF-induced MLC activation.

Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). While each process is required for net cell locomotion, it is not necessarily the case that signals downstream of receptor activation must concomitantly be involved in triggering all of the processes. Despite longstanding anecdotal indications, only recently have formal demonstrations emerged that signaling via EGFR actually elicits cell contractile force generation (2Allen F.D. Asnes C.F. Chang P. Elson E.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Wound Repair Regen. 2002; 10: 67-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Haase I. Evans R. Pofahl R. Watt F.M. J.

Because of the central importance of growth factor-induced cell motility in physiological and pathological applications, such as organogenesis, wound repair, and tumor invasion, determination of key pathways involved in connecting EGFR activity to contractile force generation, as well as the other processes underlying motility, is a crucial undertaking. Myosin motors operating on cytoskeletal actin filaments are presumed to be involved in growth factor-induced cell motility in manner similar to the roles they play in integrin-mediated migration (7Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Myosin II is a prominent actor in this context. Myosin II is localized along with actin fibers in the protrusive anterior region and at posterior regions of motile cells, where it is thought to generate contractility, in organizing and breaking cell-substratum adhesion, and/or in reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton (8Conrad A. Jaffredo T. Conrad G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Gough A. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A recent report finds EGF to induce myosin II heavy chain phosphorylation (at least indirectly), with implications for subcellular localization of the active motor and consequent chemotactic cell movement (10Ben-Ya'acov A. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40032-40040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at a regulatory serine 19 of the 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC) subunit of myosin II promotes cell contractility in a variety of cell types responding to diverse stimuli. In addition, serine 19-phosphorylated MLC is enriched near membrane protrusion and retraction areas in motile fibroblast (11Matsumura F. Ono S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The extent of MLC phosphorylation is regulated not only by protein kinases, such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLC kinase (MLCK) and Ca2+/calmodulin-independent Rho-kinase, but also by myosin phosphatase (MLCP) (12Hartshorne D. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13Kamm K. Stull J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 14Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). During haptotactic migration, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK has been shown to mediate MLC phosphorylation through MLCK (15Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A. Gallagher P. deLanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Thus, the final myosin II contractile force generation machinery is engaged during both chemotactic and haptotactic motility. However, key signaling pathways through which EGFR actuates myosin-based contractility have yet to be identified. Possible links between EGFR and myosin-based contractility are suggested by a few prior reports. Although ERK activity is required for MLC phosphorylation in haptotactic cell migration (15Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A. Gallagher P. deLanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), ERK activity promotes the extension of membrane protrusions rather than retraction (16Brahmbhatt A. Klemke R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13016-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A fair inference from these findings is that transcellular contractility is not solely driven by an ERK “master switch.” EGF-induced myosin heavy chain phosphorylation and localization requires a protein kinase C (PKC) intermediary (17Straussman S. Even L. Ravid. S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PKC family of molecules is an attractive candidate for connecting EGFR-elicited signals to myosin-mediated force generation, which is implicated in the contraction of muscle and non-muscle cells (18Bresnick A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). PKC consists of a family of at least 11 isoforms. Specific isoforms of PKC are activated by phospholipids, diacylglycerol (DAG) generated by phospholipase C (PLC) or phospholipase D (PLD) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), fatty acids generated by PLA2, and calcium, depending on isoforms. Based on their structural and biochemical properties these PKC isoforms can be divided into three major groups: (i) the classical PKC (cPKC; α, βI, βII, and γ), which are activated by DAG and are Ca2+-dependent; (ii) the novel PKC (nPKC; δ, ϵ, θ, η, and μ), which are activated by DAG but Ca2+-independent, and (iii) the atypical PKC (aPKC; ζ and λ), which do not respond to either DAG or calcium. Importantly, EGFR triggers PKC activity (19Welsh J. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) at least in part downstream of phospholipase signaling (20Chen P. Xie H. Wells A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that one or more PKC isoform, in the classical or novel groups, contributes to EGFR-mediated cell contractility during motility. A picture of how PKC isoforms are regulated, in addition to final activation by lipid-containing molecules, has recently emerged in which direct phosphorylations play a major role (21Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 22Kikkawa U. Matsuzaki H. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). cPKC and nPKC isoforms contain three conserved serine/threonine phosphorylation motifs of serine or threonine residues in the catalytic domain; a threonine in the activation loop (Thr-505 in PKCδ) and serines in the hydrophobic (Ser-643 in PKCδ) and C-terminal (Ser-662 in PKCδ) regions (21Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). An upstream kinase, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), phosphorylates the activation loop (23Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 24Balendran A. Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which is necessary for the catalytic activity of cPKC isoforms (25Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 26Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The turn motif and hydrophobic sites then undergo autophosphorylation. The regulation of these sites in nPKC isoforms may mirror those of cPKC isoforms (27Cenni V. Doppler H. Sonnenburg E.D. Maraldi N. Newton A.C. Toker A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), though the existence of a heterologous upstream kinase has been inferred (28Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D. Kelly J.J. Frech M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These sequential phosphorylations render cPKC isoforms stable and ready for activation by DAG (29Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, PKCδ differs from cPKC in its regulation by phosphorylation (22Kikkawa U. Matsuzaki H. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A study suggests that phosphorylation of the activation loop Thr-505 is not essential for subsequent activation; the PKCδ-specific acidic Glu-500 may assume at least some of the role of threonine phosphorylation (30Stempka L. Schnolzer M. Radke S. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8886-8892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation at Thr-505 by PDK1 is thought to be required for the stability of the enzyme (24Balendran A. Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The functional consequence of phosphorylation of other sites is also not settled, Li et al. (31Li W. Zhang J. Bottaro D.P. Li W. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24550-24555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the mutation of Ser-643 markedly decreases PKCδ activity but Stempka et al. (30Stempka L. Schnolzer M. Radke S. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8886-8892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that the same mutation has no effect on PKCδ catalytic function. Interestingly, the upstream PDK1 appears itself dependent on phospholipids, PIP3 in particular, for activation (32Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present model, PI 3-kinase generates PIP3 after activation by receptors with tyrosine kinase, such as EGFR. These investigations, even with the uncertainties, point to many PKC isoforms as potential downstream effectors of growth factor receptor signaling. In this present contribution, we show that EGFR signaling leads to MLC phosphorylation at serine 19 and consequently to cell contractile force generation and motility in fibroblasts. The pathway to myosin activation required activity of the novel PKCδ isoform. Moreover, we find that there appear to be two distinct phases of PKCδ activation, with PLCγ signaling required only for the acute phase. We have thus identified a novel pathway connection downstream of EGFR activation to one of the crucial biophysical processes underlying cell migration. Reagents and Antibodies—Rottlerin, selective PKCδ inhibitor (33Gschwendt M. Muller H. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PD153035, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, U0126, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1) inhibitor, and chelerythrine chloride, pan-PKC inhibitor were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Human recombinant EGF was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Type I collagen was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated PKC (pan), phosphorylated (Ser) PKC substrate, phosphorylated MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich protein C kinase substrate) (Ser-152/156), phosphorylated PKCδ (Ser-643), phospho-ERK (p44/42), phospho-Akt (Ser-473; 587F11), and phosphorylated MLC (Ser-19) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against MLC (FL-172), nPKCδ (C-20), and cPKCα (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against α-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich. All cell culture reagents were obtained from CellGro (Herndon, VA) or Invitrogen. Cell Culture—The establishment and maintenance of the NR6 WT, expressing full-length wild-type EGFR, or NR6 c′973, expressing signaling-restricted EGFR lacking all autophosphorylation motifs and fails to activate PLCγ, cell lines have been described (19Welsh J. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 35Wells A. Welsh J. Lazar C. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, these constructs were retrovirally transduced in NR6 cells, Swiss 3T3-derived fibroblasts, which lack endogenous EGFRs (35Wells A. Welsh J. Lazar C. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM)-α with 7.5% fetal calf serum plus 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm MEM, nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and G418 (350 μg/ml) as the growth medium. Subconfluent cells were passaged with a 1:8 split ratio at 3-day intervals using 0.25% trypsin with 0.25 mm EDTA. Cells were quiesced using restricted or no serum conditions without G418 prior to experiments. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The dominant-negative (DN) PKCδ construct (36Murakami M. Horowitz A. Tang S. Ware J.A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20367-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Simons (Dartmouth Medical School). The DN construct was generated by replacing the conserved lysine 376 in the ATP binding domain with tryptophan. For stable expression, DN PKCδ cDNA was subcloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen) hygromycin resistant vector downstream from a cytomegalovirus promoter (CMVp). CMVp was replaced with a mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTVp) for inducible expression (20Chen P. Xie H. Wells A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The empty pCEP4 vector, CMVp of which was replaced with MMTVp, was used as control. The construct was stably transfected into NR6 WT cells by electroporation. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) in electroporation cuvette, and the plasmid was added to a total of 30 μg. The cells were electroporated at 0.300 kV and 950 μF (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad). 48 h after electroporation, cells were selected in the growth medium containing hygromycin B (Calbiochem) (100 μg/ml). Polyclonal cell lines consisting of more than 20 colonies were established. Two independent electroporations and stably transfected cell lines were established and tested. Dexamethasone (2 μm for 24 h) was used to induce MMTV-driven DN PKCδ expression at the same time with quiescence. siRNA Transfections—siRNA duplexes (siRNAs) were synthesized and purified by IDT (Coralville, IA). The siRNA sequence for targeting PKCδ (GenBank™ accession number NM_011103) was PKCδ siRNA (5′-AGUACUUGGCAAAGGCAGCTT-3′). The siRNA sequence for targeting PKCα (GenBank™ accession number NM_011101) was PKCα siRNA (5′-ACAACCUGGACAGAGUGAATT-3′). GFPsiRNA (5′-GACCCGCGCCGAGGUGAAGTT-3′) was used as a negative control (37Hirai I. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25722-25727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transfection of siRNAs was performed using the manufacturer's protocol for LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, 4 μlof20 μm siRNA was mixed with 200 μl of Opti-MEM. 4 μl of LipofectAMINE™ 2000 was diluted in 200 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After the incubation, the diluted LipofectAMINE™ 2000 was combined with the diluted siRNA and then incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Total 400 μl of siRNA- LipofectAMINE™ 2000 complexes was applied to each well of cultured NR6 WT fibroblasts at ∼70% confluence in a 6-well plate. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well tissue culture plastic plates. After 24 h of quiescence in MEMα with 0.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, cells were treated. Cells were lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were probed by primary antibodies before visualizing with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by development with a colorimetric method (Promega) or an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL™; Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, cells were prepared and treated as described above. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate) containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-PKCδ antibody for 4–6 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were incubated with protein G-agarose and centrifuged. The pellets were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Precipitated proteins were subjected to analyze by immunoblotting as described above. Motility Assay—EGF-induced migration was assessed by the ability of the cells to move into an acellular area (38Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 6-well plastic dishes and grown to confluence in MEM-α with 7.5% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h quiescence, an area was denuded by a rubber policeman. Cells were then treated with or without EGF (10 nm) and incubated at 37 °C; inhibitors or diluent alone were added at the same time as EGF. Photographs were taken at 0 and 24 h, and the relative distance traveled by the cells was determined. Isometric Force Measurement—The preparation of three-dimensional fibroblast populated collagen lattices (FPCL) has been described previously (2Allen F.D. Asnes C.F. Chang P. Elson E.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Wound Repair Regen. 2002; 10: 67-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, FPCL containing 7.5 × 105 cells were prepared with modifications of Kolodney and Elson (39Kolodney M. Elson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23850-23855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture of cells and 0.75 mg/ml type I collagen was poured into the annular space of cylindrical Teflon molds (1 ml/mold) and gelled at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. Ring-shaped FPCL gels were removed from the molds and placed in tissue culture medium for ∼40 h, maintaining the original diameter (15 mm) of the FPCL with sterile parallel spacing rods. This configuration established a tensed FPCL at the time of force measurement. Contractile force measurements of the WT NR6 and c'973 fibroblasts were performed with an isometric force transduction system. The system uses force transducers (model 52-9545, Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) and mounts one FPCL per transducer vertically. The mounted tissue was placed in an organ bath containing 50 ml HEPES-buffered, serum-free Dulbecco's MEM (37 °C). Each FPCL was permitted to reach an equilibrium force over a period of 30 to 60 min prior to addition of 10 nm EGF. The contraction force response of the FPCL was monitored by computer data acquisition. The strain level of the FPCL was maintained throughout so as to measure both the initial contractile force and the persistence of contractile force as a function of time. Gel Compaction Assay—NR6 WT fibroblasts were grown in floating collagen type I matrices using a modification of described methods (40Grinnell F. Ho C. Skuta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 918-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from monolayer culture using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in quiescent media (serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Cells were incubated with inhibitors for 30 min prior to matrix preparation. Neutralized collagen solutions (1 mg/ml) containing 106 cells/ml, ± EGF (1 μg/ml) and inhibitors (or diluent alone) were dispensed into 24-well culture plates (0.5 ml solution/well). Collagen solutions were left to polymerize for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and then each matrix was overlaid with 1 ml of quiescent medium ± EGF (1 μg/ml) and inhibitors. The matrices were gently released from the surface and sides of each well using a scalpel and incubated for 24 h. Compaction was determined by weighing the matrices after the incubation period. Data are shown as the percentage of the control matrix weight. Cell viability was assessed following compaction by removal using collagenase digestion. Matrices were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 0.05% trypsin for 10 min followed by collagenase (0.25 mg/ml) for a further 10 min. Fetal bovine serum (20%) was added to quench the collagenase activity and cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Cell viability was not significantly affected (<10%) by ML-7 at 20 mm. Statistical Analyses—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. of separate experiments. Differences between means were determined by Student's t test for unpaired samples, and those at p < 0.05 were considered significant. EGF Induces Phosphorylation of Myosin Light Chain—Exposure of fibroblasts to EGF leads to cell contractility and motility (2Allen F.D. Asnes C.F. Chang P. Elson E.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Wound Repair Regen. 2002; 10: 67-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); both of which are proposed to require actomyosin-based contraction (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). To verify this, we found that EGF leads to phosphorylation of MLC at the activation-specific site serine 19 (Fig. 1). This occurred rapidly in cells expressing the wild type EGFR, but dissipated by more than half over the ensuing 2 h see below). As expected, EGF-induced phosphorylation was blocked by the EGFR-selective inhibitor PD153035 and the MLCK-selective inhibitor ML-7. Similarly, EGFR-mediated compaction and motility was blunted by ML-7 (Fig. 2). While these data were anticipated, they establish directly for the first time that EGF leads to MLC phosphorylation and that motility depends on this contractile mechanism.Fig. 2EGF-induced compaction (A) and motility (B) are dependent on the MLCK. Inhibition of MLCK by ML-7 abrogates cell compaction and motility in the NR6 WT cell line. Cell motility and compaction assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MLCK selective inhibitor ML-7 (20 μm) was added at the same time as EGF (1 μg/ml). A, gel compaction values are shown as the percentage of nontreated gels. The data in the graph are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, with each experiment was performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. B, cell motility was calculated as fold increase over basal traveling distance of nontreated cells. The data in the graph are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, with each experiment was performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test: **, p < 0.01.Vie"
https://openalex.org/W2132839856,"Recently, it has been found that ribosome pausing at stop codons caused by certain nascent peptides induces cleavage of mRNA in Escherichia coli cells (1Sunohara T. Jojima K. Yamamoto Y. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The question we addressed in the present study is whether mRNA cleavage occurs when translation elongation is prevented. We focused on a specific peptide sequence (AS17), derived from SecM, that is known to cause elongation arrest. When the crp-crr fusion gene encoding CRP-AS17-IIAGlc was expressed, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) proteins truncated around the arrest sequence were efficiently produced, and they were tagged by the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) system. Northern blot analysis revealed that both truncated upstream crp and downstream crr mRNAs were generated along with reduced amounts of the full-length crp-crr mRNA. The truncated crp mRNA dramatically decreased in the presence of tmRNA due to rapid degradation. The 3′ ends of truncated crp mRNA correspond well to the C termini of the truncated CRP proteins. We conclude that ribosome stalling by the arrest sequence induces mRNA cleavage near the arrest point, resulting in nonstop mRNAs that are recognized by tmRNA. We propose that the mRNA cleavage induced by ribosome stalling acts in concert with the tmRNA system as a way to ensure quality control of protein synthesis and possibly to regulate the expression of certain genes.

A special bacterial RNA called tmRNA 1The abbreviations used are: tmRNA, transfer-messenger RNA; nt, nucleotides; CRP, cAMP receptor protein; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; DIG, digoxigenin; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: tmRNA, transfer-messenger RNA; nt, nucleotides; CRP, cAMP receptor protein; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; DIG, digoxigenin; ORF, open reading frame. or SsrA RNA is a central player in a unique quality control system during protein synthesis (3Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 4Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When a ribosome translates to the 3′ end of a broken or incomplete mRNA lacking a stop codon (nonstop mRNA), tmRNA charged with alanine enters the A-site of the ribosome to act first as an alanyl-tRNA and then is itself translated. This co-translation reaction (trans-translation) terminates at the stop codon that follows the tmRNA reading frame, releasing both the ribosome and the tagged polypeptide. The tagged polypeptide is recognized and degraded by several ATP-dependent proteases. The rescue of the stalled ribosome and the degradation of aberrant polypeptides that are useless and/or potentially harmful to the cell are two well established biological roles of the tmRNA quality control system (4Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An additional important role of the tmRNA system is to facilitate the degradation of truncated mRNAs by removing stalled ribosomes and thus allowing 3′-to-5′ exonucleases to access the free mRNA 3′ end (6Yamamoto Y. Sunohara T. Jojima K. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the tmRNA quality control system not only degrades aberrant polypeptides once produced but also prevents production of aberrant polypeptides through a rapid elimination of damaged mRNAs.Nonstop mRNAs could be generated either by nuclease cleavages of an mRNA or by incomplete transcription. For example, they are produced as degradation intermediates from mRNAs by 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic digestion (6Yamamoto Y. Sunohara T. Jojima K. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The tmRNA-mediated tagging of LacI typically represents the situation where truncated mRNAs are produced by an incomplete transcription due to transcriptional road block (7Abo T. Inada T. Ogawa K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A ribosome would also reach the 3′ end of an mRNA when a normal stop codon is erroneously translated either in the presence of nonsense suppressor tRNAs (8Ueda K. Yamamoto Y. Ogawa K. Abo T. Inokuchi H. Aiba H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or in the presence of misreading drugs (9Abo T. Ueda K. Sunohara T. Ogawa K. Aiba H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tmRNA system also acts at stop codons to add the degradation tag to full-length proteins when translation termination is prevented by certain nascent polypeptides (10Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3440-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Collier J. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol.

Y.). 2002; 8: 1416-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). During the study on the mechanism of nascent peptide-dependent tagging of the full-length protein at stop codons, we have found that ribosome stalling caused by certain peptides leads to mRNA cleavage around the stop codon, resulting in nonstop mRNAs, and therefore the mRNA cleavage is the cause of trans-translation at stop codons (1Sunohara T. Jojima K. Yamamoto Y. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cleavage of mRNA in response to ribosome stalling at stop codons was also found in ybeL mRNA by Hayes and Sauer (2Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).The findings mentioned above have raised a question of whether the cleavage of mRNA occurs at sense codons when translation elongation is prevented. To answer this particular question, we focused on a specific peptide sequence, derived from SecM, that is known to cause stalling of the ribosome during translation elongation (14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In the present study, we constructed the crp-crr fusion genes in which the coding regions of two proteins (cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and IIAGlc) are connected by a short nucleotide sequence corresponding to the SecM arrest sequence (14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). By using this fusion system, we found that the SecM arrest sequence strongly induces mRNA cleavage, resulting in nonstop mRNAs that are recognized by tmRNA. We also found that the last 5-amino-acid segment of the arrest sequence is sufficient to induce the mRNA cleavage. Neither the bacterial toxin RelE nor the known major endoribonucleases are involved in this cleavage, suggesting that either other endoribonuclease(s) or ribosome itself would be responsible for the mRNA cleavage in response to the ribosome stalling caused by the particular nascent peptides. The mRNA cleavage induced by ribosome stalling could act in concert with the tmRNA system as a way to ensure quality control of protein synthesis and possibly to regulate the expression of certain genes including the secM-secA operon.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedium and Growth Conditions—Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in LB medium (15Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (50 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), and tetracycline (5 μg/ml). Bacterial growth was monitored by determining the optical density at 600 nm.Strains and Plasmids—The Escherichia coli K-12 strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.

Culture samples (1 ml) were centrifuged, and the pellets were suspended in 50 μl of H20. The cell suspensions were mixed with 50 μl of 2× loading buffer (4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue) and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. For Western blotting, the total extracts of indicated amount were subjected to 0.1% SDS-12 or 15% PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore). The membrane was probed with anti-CRP antibodies using ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Mass Spectrometry—The untagged and tagged CRP-GIRAGP proteins were immunopurified from TA501 (W3110 Δcrp ΔssrA) and TA481(W3110 Δcrp ssrADD) cells carrying pJK208. The cells were grown in 20 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 = 0.6. The cell cultures were centrifuged and washed with 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl(pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. The cell pellets were suspended in 600 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. 400 μl of the supernatants was mixed with 10 μl of anti-CRP antibodies conjugated to agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After extensive washing with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with 10 μl of 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). The polyclonal anti-CRP antibodies were cross-linked to protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) with dimethylpimelidate as described (17Harlow E. Lowe D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, the purified untagged and DD-tagged proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The bands were cut out from the gel, and a small piece of each band was treated with 0.1 μg of lysyl endopeptidase (Roche Applied Science) in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 for 12 h at 37 °C. The digested peptides were eluted with 300 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and concentrated to 20 μl. Then, the sample was desalted with ZipTip C18 (Millipore) reverse-phase column, mixed with 1% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS.RNA Analyses—Total RNAs were isolated from cells grown to mid-log phase as described (18Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total RNAs were resolved by 1.5% agarose-gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde and blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The mRNAs were visualized using digoxigenin (DIG) reagents and kits for a nonradioactive nucleic acid labeling and detection system (Roche Applied Science) according to the procedure specified by the manufacturer. The DIG-labeled DNA probes used were 576-bp probe A corresponding to the crp coding region and 507-bp probe B corresponding to the crr coding region. The DIG-labeled RNA marker III (Roche Applied Science) was used to estimate the size of RNA bands. The 3′ end of crp mRNA and the 5′ end of crr mRNA were determined by S1 nuclease assay as described (18Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA fragment corresponding to the junction region between the crp and crr was prepared by PCR from pJK208 encoding CRP-GIRAGP-IIAGlc and digested with Sau3AI and HpaII. The 3′ end of the resulting 102 bp fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dGTP by Klenow enzyme, and the strands were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The lower strand 32P-labeled at its Sau3AI 3′ end was used as a DNA probe (probe C) to determine the 3′ end of crp mRNA. Similarly, a DNA fragment (315 bp) corresponding to the junction region between the crp and crr was prepared by PCR from pJK208 encoding CRP-GIRAGP-IIAGlc, and the strands were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The lower strand 32P-labeled at its 5′ end was used as a DNA probe (probe D) to determine the 5′ end of crr mRNA. The DNA probe and total RNAs were hybridized and treated with increasing amounts of S1 nuclease for 15 min at 37 °C. The resulting products were analyzed on a 7% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. The ends of mRNAs were identified by using the Maxam-Gilbert A+G and C+T ladders of the DNA probe as references.RESULTSThe SecM Translation Arrest Sequence Induces tmRNAmediated Protein Tagging at Sense Codons—A 17-amino-acid segment within SecM protein, FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP (AS17), was identified as an element to cause ribosome stalling (14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). A striking feature of this specific segment is that it can inhibit translation elongation even when present within unrelated sequences. This provides us an opportunity to investigate a link between ribosome stalling during translation elongation and tmRNA tagging of the nascent peptide. We first constructed a plasmid (pJK217) carrying a crp-crr fusion gene encoding CRP-AS17-IIAGlc protein in which CRP and IIAGlc ORFs are connected by a nucleotide sequence corresponding to AS17 (Fig. 1). Another plasmid (pJK216) carrying a fusion gene encoding CRP-AS17 was also constructed in which a stop codon was placed just after the AS17 sequence. We also used plasmids pST602 and pJK107 that express CRP-GP and CRP-GP-IIAGlc, respectively. An advantage of the crp-crr fusion system is that both tmRNA tagging and mRNA cleavage can be easily monitored by Western and Northern analyses, respectively. These plasmids were introduced into three isogenic strains regarding the ssrA allele, and the expression of proteins was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CRP antibodies. It is established that a C-terminal GP sequence causes an efficient tmRNA tagging at a stop codon (12Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Sunohara T. Abo T. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1416-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CRP-AS17 protein is expected to be efficiently tagged by the tmRNA system because this CRP variant possesses a terminal GP sequence. In fact, CRP-AS17 was highly expressed in the absence of tmRNA, whereas it is markedly reduced in the presence of the wild-type tmRNA due to an efficient tagging and proteolysis (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). When a mutant tmRNA-DD encoding a protease-resistant tag sequence was co-expressed, the DD-tagged CRP-AS17 was produced (Fig. 2, lane 9). These results are essentially the same as those observed in the expression of CRP-GP (Fig. 2, lanes 1-3). We showed previously that the conversion of the stop codon after CRP-GP ORF to a sense codon completely eliminated the tmRNA tagging (1Sunohara T. Jojima K. Yamamoto Y. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Thus, CRP-GP-IIAGlc fusion protein encoded by plasmid pJK107 is stably expressed both in the absence and in the presence of tmRNA without tmRNA tagging (Fig. 2, lanes 4-6). Interestingly, the truncated CRP and its tagging occurred efficiently even when the stop codon of CRP-AS17 was converted to a sense codon (Fig. 2, lanes 10-12). Namely, the fusion gene encoding CRP-AS17-IIAGlc produced a truncated protein corresponding to CRP-AS17 along with a small amount of the full-length CRP-AS17-IIAGlc protein (Fig. 2, lane 10). In the presence of the wild-type tmRNA, the truncated protein was no longer observed, whereas a significant amount of DD-tagged protein was detected in the presence of tmRNA-DD (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12). These results imply that the AS17 sequence causes ribosome stalling not only at a stop codon but also at a sense codon by inhibiting translation elongation.Fig. 2Western blot analysis of proteins expressed from the crp-crr fusion genes. Lysates equivalent to the 0.005 A600 unit prepared from TA341 (Δcrp ssrA+), TA501 (Δcrp ΔssrA), or TA481 (Δcrp ssrADD) cells harboring the indicated plasmids were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CRP antibodies. The word peptide represents the amino acid sequence between CRP and IIAGlc ORFs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Pentapeptide (IRAGP) Is Sufficient to Cause tmRNA Tagging—Among the 17-amino-acid SecM arrest sequence, the last hexapeptide GIRAGP seems to be particularly important to inhibit translation elongaton (14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). To examine whether this hexapeptide alone could cause translation arrest and tmRNA tagging at a sense codon, we constructed a fusion gene encoding CRP-GIRAGP-IIAGlc protein and analyzed the expression of proteins by Western blotting using anti-CRP antibodies. A significant amount of truncated CRP was generated in the absence of tmRNA, and it was efficiently tagged by the tmRNA system, indicating that GIRAGP essentially retains the ability to cause the ribosome stalling during translation (Fig. 2, lanes 13-15). A slight increase in the abundance of the full-length CRP-GIRAGP-IIAGlc protein as compared with that of CRP-AS17-IIAGlc is consistent with the results of Nakatogawa and Ito (14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), who showed that several amino acid residues upstream of GIRAGP affect the efficiency of the arrest. We also constructed fusion genes encoding CRP-IRAGP-IIAGlc and CRP-RAGP-IIAGlc proteins, respectively, and tested their expression in the presence and absence of tmRNA. An efficient production of truncated CRP and its tagging was still observed when CRP-IRAGP-IIAGlc (Fig. 2, lanes 16-18) but not CRP-RAGP-IIAGlc (Fig. 2, lanes 19-21) was expressed. No particular amino acid residues corresponding to the consensus arrest sequence originally identified (14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) were found in the immediate N-terminal side of the IRAGP segment in CRP-IRAGP-IIAGlc protein. We conclude that the last pentapeptide (IRAGP) of the SecM arrest sequence is sufficient to cause the ribosome stalling during translation elongation. We also observed that the identity of the amino acid residue following the arrest sequence does not affect the production of truncated CRP and its tagging (data not shown).Identification of the C Terminus of Truncated CRP and Tagging Site—To determine the C terminus of truncated CRP and tagging site, CRP proteins were purified from cells carrying pJK208 by immunoprecipitation using anti-CRP antibodies conjugated to agarose beads. The purified proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 3A). The profile of the purified proteins was essentially the same as that of Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, both truncated untagged and DD-tagged CRP proteins consisted of two bands. Each of these bands was excised from the gel and digested in-gel with lysyl endopeptidase that specifically cleaves the peptide bond after lysine residues. The eluted peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Representative data for the mass spectrum are shown in Fig. 3B. The upper band of untagged proteins gave two specific signals that correspond to those expected for the C-terminal fragments of CRP-GIRAG and CRP-GIRAGP. The last Pro residue was identified as the translation arrest point during translation of SecM (14Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Thus, the truncation of the fusion protein occurs immediately before and after the arrest point. The lower untagged band produced two specific signals corresponding to the expected C-terminal fragments of CRP-G and CRP. This implies that the truncation occurred also before the arrest point. As expected, the DD-tagged bands gave specific signals that correspond to junction peptides containing the C-terminal fragments plus the tag.Fig. 3Mass spectrometry analysis of untagged and tagged CRP proteins generated from the crp-crr fusion gene encoding CRP-GIRAGP-IIAGlc. A, CRP proteins were purified from three isogenic strains carrying pJK208 by immunoprecipitation using anti-CRP agarose beads. Purified proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The bands corresponding to untagged and tagged CRP proteins, generated from ΔssrA (lane 1) and ssrADD (lane 3) cells, respectively, were cut out from the gel, treated with lysyl endopeptidase, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The deduced sequences and molecular masses of the C-terminal fragments, which were identified as specific signals, are shown. The amino acid residues derived from the SecM arrest sequence are shown in bold. The tag sequences derived from tmRNA-DD is underlined. The approximate proportions of the C-terminal fragments in each band are shown in parentheses. B, the MALDI-TOF spectra for the lower bands of CRP proteins purified from ΔssrA (top) and ssrADD (bottom) cells. The specific signals corresponding to the C-terminal fragments are shown by arrows. The signals matched to the other CRP fragments are shown by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Arrest-causing Sequence Induces mRNA Cleavage—We demonstrated previously that the ribosome pausing at stop codons caused by certain nascent peptides generates nonstop mRNAs through mRNA cleavage within the stalled ribosome and that this cleavage is responsible for the trans-translation at stop codons (1Sunohara T. Jojima K. Yamamoto Y. Inada T. Aiba H. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is highly possible that the similar cleavage reaction occurs when translation elongation is inhibited by the SecM arrest sequence. To test this, total RNAs were prepared from cells expressing various fusion proteins both in the presence and in the absence of tmRNA and analyzed by Northern blotting. When a crp-crr fusion gene is normally expressed without mRNA cleavage, a full-length crp-crr transcript of about 1200 nt should be detected. On the other hand, when the SecM arrest sequence induces mRNA cleavage, both upstream crp mRNA and downstream crr mRNA would be produced. Northern blot analysis using a DNA probe specific to the crp mRNA clearly demonstrated that a significant amount of truncated crp mRNA was produced along with a lesser amount of the full-length crp-crr mRNA when the fusion gene encoding CRP-AS17-IIAGlc is expressed in the absence of tmRNA (Fig. 4, lane 1). The short crp mRNA was dramatically reduced in the presence of tmRNA, indicating that tmRNA facilitates degradation of the truncated mRNA (Fig. 4, lane 2). Essentially the same results were obtained when RNAs from genes encoding CRP-GIRAGP-IIAGlc or CRP-IRAGP-IIAGlc were analyzed, although the relative abundance of truncated crp mRNA to the full-length crp-crr mRNA was slightly reduced (Fig. 4, lanes 3-6). On the other hand, only the full-length crp-crr mRNA was produced both in the presence and in the absence of tmRNA when the fusion gene encoding CRP-RAGP-IIAGlc or CRP-GP-IIAGlc was expressed (Fig. 4, lanes 7-10). Thus, the production of the shorter truncated crp mRNA occurs only when the elongation arrest sequence was placed between CRP and IIAGlc ORFs. We conclude that mRNA cleavage"

The prodomain is generally considered to be required for the proper folding of these proteinases and keeping them in latent states. Removal of the prodomain after maturation is critical to these proteinases to express their biological functions (9Kang T. Nagase H. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol.

ADAMTS4 is synthesized as a precursor protein with 837 amino acid residues comprised of a signal peptide, a prodomain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a thrombospondin-1 motif, a cysteine-rich domain, and spacer. The active form of ADAMTS4 is identified with an N terminus of F213ASLS in cartilage tissues or supernatants conditioned by cartilage explants (13Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I.

Moreover, recent evidence from purified enzyme showed that the precursor protein of ADAMTS4 with prodomain fails to cleave aggrecan (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), indicating that removal of the prodomain is critical for its activity. Although the purified proADAMTS4 can be cleaved by recombinant furin in cell-free experiments (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the cellular enzymes responsible for its processing and activation remain unknown. Furin is a ubiquitously expressed proprotein convertase (PC) and has been shown to be responsible for the processing of various proproteins in the secretory pathway, such as BACE, BMP-1, MMP11, MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP, and ADAM19 (9Kang T.

Furin cleaves these substrates at consensus sites of RX(K/R)R or RXnR (n = 0, 2, 4, 6). Because a multibasic motif, 206RPRRAKR212, which contains several potential furin recognition sites, is present in the prodomain of ADAMTS4, furin may activate proADAMTS4 at multiple sites. Here we present evidence that furin interacts with proADAMTS4 and mediates its activation intracellularly. Understanding the intracellular pathways for ADAMTS4 processing may provide novel targets for the development of treatments for osteoarthritis. Reagents—Anti-prodomain antibody of ADAMTS4 was raised against the first 10 residues in prodomain of human ADAMTS4 and affinity purified. Anti-C-terminal antibody (anti-C) of ADAMTS4 was generated against the last 10 residues of human ADAMTS4. BFA, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, goat anti-rabbit, or mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Cy3 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Furin antibody was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (CMK)-based Furin inhibitor was purchased from Bachem Bioscience (Philadelphia, PA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells, and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method, as described previously (20Cherney R.J. Mo R. Meyer D.T. Wang L. Yao W. Wasserman Z.R. Liu R.Q. Covington M.B. Tortorella M.D. Arner E.C. Qian M. Christ D.D. Trzaskos J.M. Newton R.C. Magolda R.L. Decicco C.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 1297-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The furin-deficient Chinese hamster ovary-K1 strain RPE.40 and furin-deficient COS-7 cell strain 7.P15 were cultured as described (9Kang T. Nagase H. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar). RPE.40 and 7.P15 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates for 24 h at 70% confluence before transfection. The cells were then transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 10 h, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 5 μm BB94 or GM6001 with or without CMK or BFA at indicated concentrations were added to the cells for 48 h. The media and cell lysates were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. For all transfection experiments, pcDNA3 or PCR3.1 vector was used to compensate total DNA input. Expression Constructs—Wild-type ADAMTS4 with FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the C terminus was generated by subcloning from pMON37652-ADAMTS4 (4Abbaszade I. Liu R.Q. Yang F. Rosenfeld S.A. Ross O.H.

ADAMTS4 mutants for the multibasic 206RPRRAKR212 region were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by standard procedures using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression vectors for furin were constructed as described previously (11Pei D. Weiss S.J.

A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The vector-based small heparin inhibitory RNA (siRNA) of furin was cloned into U6/PBS according to previously established protocols (23Wang P. Wu Y. Ge X. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11648-11653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 150m M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with anti-FLAG (1 μg) antibody for 2 h. Immune complexes were loaded on protein-A beads for 3 h, washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer at 50 °C for 20 min. The eluted samples were analyzed by Western blotting analysis as described below. Western Blotting—Briefly, transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer and cleared at 12,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant and conditioned media were mixed with 5 × loading buffer (10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 0.3125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% 2-meracaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with indicated antibody, and developed as described (24Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. Faseb J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with indicated plasmids. 24 h later, cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde for 20 min and incubated with PBS/bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. ADAMTS4 was detected using Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and furin was detected by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Coverslips were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Intracellular Processing of ADAMTS4 Zymogen—To examine the intracellular processing of ADAMTS4, full-length wild-type ADAMTS4 with a FLAG tag at the C terminus was expressed in HEK293 cells. ADAMTS4 in cell lysates and media were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-C antibodies (Fig. 1). Both anti-FLAG and anti-C antibodies detected two major bands at 100 and 75 kDa. To determine whether the 100-kDa bands were the proform of ADAMTS4, the extracts were also developed with the anti-prodomain (Pro) antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, only 100-kDa bands could be recognized by anti-Pro antibody, suggesting that the 100-kDa species is the proform of ADAMTS4, whereas the 75-kDa species is the processed enzyme lacking its prodomain. Although the 75-kDa species was detected readily in medium, little of the 100-kDa species was detected, suggesting that the prodomain is cleaved efficiently prior to secretion into the medium. Similar results were obtained for ADAMTS4 transiently or stably transfected into MDCK cells (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that ADAMTS4 is processed autocatalytically, HEK293 cells transfected with ADAMTS4 were treated with a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor BB94. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, BB94 treatment greatly increased the protein level of the processed form of ADAMTS4 both in cells lysates and medium, but had little effect on the protein level of the proform, which is consistent with the recent report that ADAMTS4 has autoproteolytic activity toward its C-terminal spacer domain (15Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis further, a mutant of ADAMTS4 was generated by substituting Ala for the Glu at position 362 (E362A). This mutant has been demonstrated to impair the autoproteolytic activity in vitro (15Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, E362A mutant was efficiently processed when expressed in HEK293 cells. Moreover, compared with the proform, the protein level of the matured form of E362A is much higher than that of wild type and insensitive to broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 1C) or BB94 (data not shown) treatment. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that the intracellular cleavage of prodomain is independent of metalloproteinase activity whereas mature form (p75) is cleaved in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner. Furin-mediated Processing of proADAMTS4—It has been reported that purified furin can cleave the proADAMTS4 in vitro (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To test whether the intracellular removal of ADAMTS4 prodomain was also dependent on the furin-like activity, the ADAMTS4-transfected cells were incubated with CMK, a well known inhibitor for furin (25Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, this inhibitor significantly blocked the processing of ADAMTS4 in HEK293 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, CMK also significantly blocked the processing of ADAMTS4 in SW1353 cells, a chondrosarcoma cell line (Fig. 2B). This result is consistent with a previous report using JJ102 cells (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, when these cells were treated with CMK, the proADAMTS4 was significantly increased in the media, suggesting that the removal of the prodomain is not required for the proper secretion of ADAMS4. Surprisingly, a minor band above the 75-kDa species was also detected when ADAMTS4-transfected HEK293 cells were treated with CMK (Fig. 2A), suggesting that a CMK-insensitive pathway might be responsible for cleaving the ADAMTS4 prodomain in HEK293 cells. We then tested another furin inhibitor, α1PDX, an engineered mutant of α1 proteinase inhibitor that can function as a specific inhibitor for furin and PC5/6 (21Benjannet S. Savaria D. Laslop A. Munzer J.S. Chretien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26210-26218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), to determine the role of furin in processing ADAMTS4. As shown in Fig. 2C, cotransfection with α1PDX efficiently blocked the processing of ADAMTS4 zymogen in SW1353 cells without any effect on its secretion. To demonstrate that furin could directly cleave the prodomain of ADAMTS4 intracellularly, we co-expressed ADAMTS4 with furin in SW1353 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, co-expressed furin cleaved the proADAMTS4 efficiently. We then developed RNA interference strategy with the U6/PBS vector-based system to generate siRNA for furin, which worked well using co-expression assay in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, co-expression with furin siRNA significantly increased the protein level of proADAMTS4. These results demonstrate that endogenous furin indeed contributes to the activation of ADAMTS4 in HEK293 cells. Interestingly, furin siRNA did not block the activation of ADAMTS4 completely, perhaps because of incomplete interference of furin expression by the siRNA technique. Taken together, our data clearly indicate that furin mediates efficient activation of proADAMTS4 in both HEK293 cells and SW1353 cells. Processing of ADAMTS4 at Multiple Alternative Sites for Furin Recognition—It has been well established that furin recognizes the RX(K/R)R motif and cleaves at its C terminus. The furin recognition motif 206RPRRAKR212 in ADAMTS4, on the other hand, contains several potential furin sites. To determine the contribution of these basic residues to ADAMTS4 processing, each of them was replaced by Ala (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, mutations at Arg206, Arg208, and Lys211 had no effect on ADAMTS4 processing in HEK293 cells. In contrast, mutations at Arg209 and Arg212 significantly decreased ADAMTS4 processing. To our surprise, none of these single-point mutations could completely abolish ADAMTS4 processing. By analyzing its sequence further, we found that the 206RPRRAKR212 sequence can be viewed as at least two potential furin recognition sites, 206RPRR209 and 209RAKR212. To test this possibility, four additional mutants, R208A/R209A, R211A/R212A, R3A, and R4A were generated as shown in Fig. 4A. When expressed in HEK293 cells, R211A/R212A, which may contain a putative furin recognition site 206RPRR209, was processed efficiently. R208A/R209A, with a KR212 motif remaining, was still processed moderately, but much less efficiently than Arg206, which possesses the 209RAKR212 motif. In contrast, R3A and R4A completely abolished the processing of ADAMTS4 in both HEK293 and SW1353 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). To further confirm that these alternative sites can be cleaved by furin, these mutants were coexpressed with furin separately in SW1353 cells. As shown in Fig. 4E, both R211A/R212A and R208A/R209A can be efficiently cleaved by furin. Taken together, these data demonstrate that proADAMTS4 can be processed at 206RPRR209, 209RAKR212, or 211KR212 sites between Pro and the catalytic domain. Co-localization of ADAMTS4 with Furin in trans-Golgi Network—The data presented so far suggest that furin accounts for the majority of proprotein convertase activities expressed by the cells to process proADAMTS4. Given the fact that furin is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and localized both in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and at the cell surface (26Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 27Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), it is possible that furin processes ADAMTS4 both intracellularly in the TGN and on the cell surface. To test these possibilities, ADAMTS4-transfected cells were treated with BFA, which blocks protein trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi. As predicted, the secretion of ADAMTS4 was totally inhibited by BFA treatment (Fig. 5A). Moreover, BFA treatment also significantly blocked the activation of ADAMTS4 in a concentration-dependent fashion. This result indicates that the activation of ADAMTS4 does not occur in the endoplasmic reticulum, but mostly in the TGN. To test this further, we investigated cellular colocalization of ADAMTS4 and furin by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5B, ADAMTS4 clearly co-localized with furin in the intracellular compartment, which is consistent with the location of TGN. Interestingly, a similar pattern of colocalization was observed between the furin sites mutant R3A and furin, suggesting that their colocalization is independent of furin recognition sites. To test whether treatments that inhibit the processing of ADAMTS4 could also block their colocalization, the cells were incubated with CMK or BFA, respectively. Neither of them interfered with the co-localization between ADAMTS4 and furin, suggesting that furin co-localizes with ADAMTS4 in the TGN independently of the furin catalytic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation of Furin with the Prodomain of ADAMTS4—Because furin is colocalized with ADAMTS4 in the TGN and efficiently cleaves ADAMTS4, we then asked whether furin could interact with ADAMTS4 in cells. To answer this question, ADAMTS4 was coexpressed with FLAG-tagged furin in HEK293 cells. The cells were lysed and furin-immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, furin could be efficiently immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The proform of ADAMTS4 was also detected in the furin immunoprecipitates with the anti-C-terminal ADAMTS4 antibody (Fig. 6A, top). Compared with the proform, very little mature ADAMTS4 was detected in the furin immunoprecipitates. In the reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments, furin could also be detected in ADAMTS4 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6B). Further experiment showed that the R3A mutant of ADAMTS4 was able to co-immunoprecipitate with furin as efficiently as wild type, suggesting that, like their co-localizations, the interaction between furin and ADAMTS4 is independent of furin recognition sites. Because furin preferred to interact with the proform of ADAMTS4 (Fig. 6A), we hypothesized that furin could bind to the prodomain of ADAMTS4 in cells. To test this hypothesis, two constructs with the prodomain of ADAMTS4 and GFP-FLAG tag were generated, 1-206-GFP and 1-212-GFP. The construct 1-212 contains the dibasic furin sites, and 1-206 has the entire furin site deleted. By immunoprecipitation, we showed that both constructs efficiently interact with furin (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the prodomain of ADAMTS4 is sufficient to interact with furin. Taken together, we conclude that furin interacts directly with and cleaves off the prodomain of ADAMTS4. Processing of ADAMTS4 in Furin-deficient Cells—Our data clearly establish that furin processes ADAMTS4 efficiently in cells. However, it remains to be determined whether furin is the only PC that processes proADAMTS4. To answer this question, 7.P15, a furin-deficient cell line derived from COS-7 (28Inocencio N.M. Sucic J.F. Moehring J.M. Spence M.J. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1344-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was used to study the processing of ADAMTS4. As shown in Fig. 7A, no mature form of ADAMTS4 was detected in 7.P15 cells lysates when it was co-transfected with the control vector. In contrast, ADAMTS4 was efficiently activated by co-expressed furin. These data demonstrate once again that furin is an efficient activator for ADAMTS4. To our surprise, ADAMTS4 was efficiently processed in another furin-deficient cell line, RPE.40 (Fig. 7B), suggesting that PCs other than furin may also contribute to the ADAMTS4 activation. To test whether the processing of ADAMTS4 in this cell line was mediated by other furin-like PCs, ADAMTS4-transfected cells were treated with CMK or BFA, and the activation of ADAMTS4 was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 7C, both CMK and BFA efficiently blocked the processing of ADAMTS4 in RPE.40 cells. These data suggest that the prodomain of ADAMTS4 can be removed by PCs other than furin in certain cells. Aggrecan depletion in arthritic cartilage has been regarded as the principal pathologic feature of osteoarthritis. As one of the key enzymes implicated in pathological degradation of aggrecan (7Arner E.C. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), ADAMTS4 has been under extensive investigation in recent years, mostly on its biochemical properties. We and others have recognized that upstream and downstream regulatory events may be exploited to block the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS4, thus providing additional targets for therapeutical interventions (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To this end, we have analyzed the likely mechanisms that regulate the activation of ADAMTS4 zymogen. We have presented evidence that proADAMTS4 is processed independently of its metalloproteinase activity in HEK293 cells and chondrosarcoma cell SW1353. Consistent with a previous report that furin can efficiently cleave ADAMTS4 in test tubes (14Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), our results showed that furin is a key enzyme that interacts with proADAMTS4 and mediates its efficient processing intracellularly. The Role of Prodomain in ADAMTS4 Activation—The prodomains of MMPs, ADAMs, and ADAMTS are known for their roles in maintaining enzyme latency. Here we demonstrate that the prodomain of ADAMTS4, ∼20 kDa, also serves as a recognition site for furin interaction, independently of the RXKR motif. This finding is consistent with recent reports that furin also binds to the proform of MT1-MMP and integrin (29Mayer G. Boileau G. Bendayan M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that these prodomains also promote the activation of their zymogens by recruiting furin in the TGN. The precise mechanism through which prodomains recruit furin needs further investigation and may be targeted for drug development. Redundancy at the Processing Site—Because the first report on furin-mediated activation of MMP-11 (11Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), similar mechanisms have been reported for other proteolytic enzymes, mostly metalloproteinases with or without transmembrane domains. In general, only one furin recognition site is present between Pro and the catalytic domain in these proteases. It has been well established that the furin consensus site is R/KXnR (n = 0, 2, 4, 6). Through analysis of ADAMTS4 protein sequence, a multiple basic motif 206RPRRAKR212 was found between the prodomain and catalytic domain, similar to the motif (197RPRRMKR203) found in ADAM19, which is processed by means of one of two recognition sites, 197RPRR200 and 200RMKR203 (10Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substitution of 199RR200 by Ala in ADAM19 completely blocks its activation (10Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although ADAMTS4 was cleaved similarly at 206RPRR209 and 209RAKR212, it is worth pointing out that, unlike ADAM19, neither point mutation R209A nor R208A/R209A in ADAMTS4 impaired processing. Further experiments showed that 211KR212 could serve as a third site for ADAMTS4 processing. Thus, ADAMTS4 contains multiple cleavage sites between its prodomain and catalytic domain to regulate its activation by furin. Furin-independent Pathways Involved in ADAMTS4 Activation—Furin is an efficient activator for ADAMTS4 both in vitro and in vivo. Curiously, RPE.40, a cell line deficient in furin, remains competent in supporting ADAMTS4 activation in a CMK-sensitive manner, suggesting an alternative pathway for ADAMTS4 activation. Compared with 7.P15 cells, RPE.40 cells express PC5/6 and PC7, but not furin or PACE4 (30Duguay S.J. Milewski W.M. Young B.D. Nakayama K. Steiner D.F. J. Biol.

On the other hand, it remains possible that other proteolytic enzymes, especially serine proteinases with similar specificity as the PCs, may reside in the trans-Golgi network and mediate the observed processing of ADAMTS4. Further work is needed to identify and verify the enzymes responsible for the observed processing in RPE.40. It is important to point out that, although the furin-independent pathways can not be ruled out as physiologically relevant, furin remains the dominant player in mediating ADAMTS4 activation. Subcellular Compartment for ADAMTS4 Activation—Furin is one of the best studied protein convertases for various precursor proteins, including membrane-anchored protein such as MT3-MMP, MT1-MMP, ADAM19, BACE, and Notch, or secreted proteins, such as MMP11 and BMP-1, in the constitutive secretory pathway (9Kang T.

Furin cycles between cell surface and TGN through a process regulated by its cytoplasmic domain (37Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), indicating that it cleaves its substrate mostly in TGN and potentially on cell membrane. Our data demonstrate that ADAMTS4 is mainly colocalized with furin in TGN, suggesting that furin cleaves proADAMTS4 in the TGN. Therefore, it is most likely that ADAMTS4 prodomain is removed before it is secreted to the surrounding tissues. Consistently, many extracellular matrix proteases, such as MT3-MMP, ADAM19, BMP-1, et al. have been demonstrated to be cleaved in TGN (9Kang T. Nagase H. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kang T. Zhao Y.G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.X. J. Biol.

The observed intracellular processing of ADAMTS4 by furin thus represents a well defined pathway which may be targeted for therapeutical interventions. We thank Dr. Tiebang Kang and Dr. Qing-Xiang Amy Sang for kindly providing us with the furin-deficient cell line and Jing Nie and Dr. Xing Wang for their helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W1973771504,"To investigate double strand break (DSB) repair and signaling in human glioma cells, we stably transfected human U87 (ATM+, p53+) glioma cells with a plasmid having a single I-SceI site within an inactive green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassette, allowing for the detection of homologous recombination repair (HRR) by GFP expression. HRR and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) were also determined by PCR. DSB repair was first detected at 12 h postinfection with an adenovirus expressing I-SceI with repair reaching plateau levels between 24 and 48 h. Within this time frame, NHEJ predominated over HRR in the range of 3-50-fold. To assess the involvement of ATM in DSB repair, we first examined whether ATM was associated with the DSB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that ATM was present at the site of the DSB as early as 18 h postinfection. In cells treated with caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM, HRR was reduced, whereas NHEJ was not. In support of this finding, GFP flow cytometry demonstrated that caffeine reduced HRR by 90% under conditions when ATM kinase activity was inhibited. Dominant-negative ATM expressed from adenovirus inhibited HRR by 45%, also having little to no effect on NHEJ. Furthermore, HRR was inhibited by caffeine in serum-starved cells arrested in G0/G1, suggesting that ATM is also important for HRR outside of the S and G2 cell cycle phases. Altogether, these results demonstrate that HRR contributes substantially to DSB repair in human glioma cells, and, importantly, ATM plays a critical role in regulating HRR but not NHEJ throughout the cell cycle.

Chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; Ad, adenovirus; AT, ataxia telangiectasia; DNA-PK, DNA protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HRR, homologous recombination repair; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; PIKK, phosphoinositide 3′ kinase-like kinase; SSA, single-strand annealing; HA, hemagglutinin A; DN, dominant negative; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. are considered the most toxic of DNA lesions (1Valerie K.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). DSBs can be induced by a variety of insults including ionizing radiation and exposure of cells to radiomimetic drugs. DSBs are one of the most acute threats to cellular homeostasis (3Shiloh Y. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2001; 29: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dasika G.K. Lin S.C. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Lee E.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7883-7899Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and have been shown to lead to loss of chromosomes and rearrangement of genetic material, potentially resulting in malignancy (5Jackson S.P.

Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Under certain circumstances, DSBs have been shown to be potent triggers of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2Norbury C.J. Hickson I.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 4Dasika G.K. Lin S.C. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Lee E.Y.

In order to maintain genomic integrity, eukaryotes have developed intricate systems to identify and repair these lesions (1Valerie K. Povirk L.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5792-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 2Norbury C.J. Hickson I.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The two major DSB repair pathways are nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR). Although NHEJ is the predominant type of repair in mammalian cells, it is usually error-prone. In contrast, HRR uses sister chromatids or DNA repeats as homologous templates ensuring high fidelity repair. Mutations of genes key to HRR lead to predisposition to cancer (7Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 9van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), suggesting that HRR is vital to the repair of at least some DSBs and is key to maintaining genomic integrity (10Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) is a large 350-kDa protein defective in cells from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) (3Shiloh Y. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2001; 29: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lavin M.F. Khanna K.K. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc.

AT is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration, immunodeficiency, sterility, and cancer predisposition (3Shiloh Y. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2001; 29: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). AT cells demonstrate severe radiosensitivity, impaired cell cycle checkpoint control, and a profound defect in all cellular responses to DSBs (4Dasika G.K. Lin S.C. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Lee E.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7883-7899Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 11Lavin M.F. Khanna K.K. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), resulting in highly error-prone DSB repair (14Luo C.M. Tang W. Mekeel K.L. DeFrank J.S. Anne P.R. Powell S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4497-4503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The ATM protein is a serine-threonine kinase and a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) family, which also includes DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ATR (AT and Rad3-related protein) (15Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These proteins are associated with DNA damage surveillance, control of cell cycle checkpoints, and cell growth regulation (13Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 15Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 16Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6135-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In response to DSBs, ATM in effect “raises the alarm” to DNA damage, phosphorylating many downstream effector targets such as p53, H2AX, Mdm-2, Brca1, c-Abl, Chk-2, 53BP1, and SMC-1 (13Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 17Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This swift response acts to halt the cell cycle and stop DNA replication; ATM then facilitates DNA repair or triggers apoptosis based on the severity of the damage (15Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 18Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that ATM binds to DNA in vitro (19Smith G.C. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S.H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In cells of the central nervous system, ATM appears to play an atypical role in that ATM knock-out astrocytes are not radiosensitive and ATM is instead required for apoptosis (25Herzog K.H. Chong M.J. Kapsetaki M. Morgan J.I. McKinnon P.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1089-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), a xanthine derivative and radiosensitizer, leads to inhibition of the G1, intra-S, and G2 cell cycle checkpoint when cells are treated prior to irradiation (26Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lau C.C. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of caffeine resemble some of the defects observed in AT cells (31Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, caffeine inhibits the catalytic activity of the ATM (and ATR) kinase at concentrations (0.2 and 1.1 mm IC50, respectively) that have previously been shown to be radiosensitizing (32Russell K.J. Wiens L.W. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. Plon S.E. Groudine M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1639-1642PubMed Google Scholar, 33Powell S.N. DeFrank J.S. Connell P. Eogan M. Preffer F. Dombkowski D. Tang W. Friend S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1643-1648PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in chicken DT40 cells have shown that ATM is involved in HRR (34Morrison C. Sonoda E. Takao N. Shinohara A. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and Asaad et al. (35Asaad N.A. Zeng Z.C. Guan J. Thacker J. Iliakis G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5788-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggested a role for ATM in HRR based on caffeine inhibition studies in hamster cells. Very recently, it was demonstrated that caffeine mainly affects checkpoint control and DSB repair responses linked to HRR in chicken DT40 cells and radiosensitizes hamster and human fibroblasts primarily by an NHEJ-independent process, possibly HRR (36Iliakis G. Wang Y. Guan J. Wang H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5834-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although ATM is clearly linked to the repair process directly or indirectly through cell cycle regulation, its exact role in DSB repair is unclear. Recent work has suggested a possible regulatory role for ATM in V(D)J recombination and the NHEJ pathway, and the binding of ATM at the site of recombination (37Perkins E.J. Nair A. Cowley D.O. Van Dyke T. Chang Y. Ramsden D.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for the involvement of ATM in HRR independent of its effect on the cell cycle has not been described in human cells. In this report, we use a DSB repair assay based on the rare-cutting endonuclease I-SceI to analyze DSB repair events in human glioma cells. We show that HRR is an important DSB repair pathway in these cells and that ATM binds to the DSB, and using pharmacologic and genetic inhibitors, we demonstrate that ATM specifically regulates HRR but not NHEJ. We also show that ATM acts in this capacity outside of the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Reagents—Caffeine, propidium iodide, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma, and endonuclease I-SceI and restriction enzyme BcgI were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies for Western analysis were as follows: β-actin antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-HA from Roche Applied Science, anti-FLAG from Sigma, and anti-ATM (Ab-3) antibodies from Calbiochem. [3H]Thymidine (1 mCi/ml), [14C]thymidine (100 μCi/ml), and [α-32P]dCTP (7000 Ci/mmol) for random priming of GFP DNA hybridization probe were obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Cell Culture and Adenovirus Treatment—Human malignant glioma U87 (p53+) cells, and the M059K (DNA-PKcs+), M059J (DNA-PKcs-) cell pair (38Anderson C.W. Allalunis-Turner M.J. Radiat.

Cells were transfected with the DR-GFP plasmid (41Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Puromycin-resistant colonies were selected with 5 μg/ml of puromycin, and clonal cell lines were established. The Adβgal and Ad-SceI-NG adenoviruses have been described previously (42Valerie K. Brust D. Farnsworth J. Amir C. Taher M. Hershey C. Feden J. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 43Anglana M. Bacchetti S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4276-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). AdFLAG-ATM(LZ) adenovirus expresses the leucine zipper domain (amino acids 812-1241) of ATM with an amino-terminal FLAG tag and was generated as described (44Holmes M. Rosenberg E. Valerie K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 234: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar) based on work by Morgan et al. (45Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, adenovirus was added to culture medium at a multiplicity of infection of 100 and incubated while rocking for 2 h at 37 °C. Virus was then removed, and fresh medium was applied. Unless otherwise stated, caffeine was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 2 mm immediately after virus infection and remained in the medium for the duration of the experiment. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by 4-20% or 5% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and probed with antibodies at 1:500-1:2000 dilution. Blots were developed using the horseradish peroxidase Western Lightning System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure of membranes to x-ray film. Equal loading of protein in each lane was verified by probing the same blot with antibody to β-actin. When necessary, due to low protein expression, cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody prior to Western blot analysis. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with RNase, stained with 5 μg/ml of propidium iodide, and analyzed for DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer at the Massey Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Facility. Alternatively, to determine the fraction of cells entering S, cells were labeled with 10 nCi/ml [14C]thymidine for 48 h and arrested in G0 by starvation with 0.05% serum for 48 h. Cells were then treated with 5 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine for 4 h, fixed with acetic acid/methanol, and washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and cellular uptake of 14C- and 3H-labeled thymidine was determined on a Packard Topcount™ scintillation counter. Relative [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by normalizing to [14C]thymidine counts. Fluorescence-based DSB Repair Assay—In order to study the involvement of ATM in DSB repair, we established a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based DSB repair system in human glioma cells as described previously for hamster cells (41Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The system utilizes the I-SceI rare-cutting endonuclease from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressed from an adenovirus (Ad-SceI-NG) (43Anglana M. Bacchetti S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8096-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The system employs an inactive GFP expression cassette plasmid (DR-GFP) containing a restriction site for I-SceI in the 5′ copy of two tandem and truncated GFP reporter genes (41Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). We transfected the DR-GFP plasmid into human U87 glioma cells and established a number of stably transfected cell clones by selection with puromycin (5 μg/ml). Upon infection with Ad-SceI-NG, a single site-specific DSB is generated with a number of different scenarios possible; the break can simply religate without any evidence of DNA cleavage, or the ends can be joined by NHEJ and at the same time destroy the I-SceI site, or HRR may use the 3′ internal copy of GFP DNA (iGFP) as a homologous template for repair, resulting in GFP+ cells. The iGFP copy carries a unique restriction site, BcgI, which replaces the I-SceI site when HRR has occurred. Single strand annealing (SSA) repair could also occur, which would not result in GFP+ cells but would transfer the BcgI site to the 5′ copy, with a concomitant loss of DNA between the two GFP copies. NHEJ and HRR/SSA events can thus be detected by a PCR-based assay using GFP primers directed to sites flanking the I-SceI restriction site. PCR products are cleaved with BcgI or in combination with I-SceI to eliminate religation events. Products cleaved by BcgI constitute HRR and SSA, and DNA remaining after cleavage with BcgI and I-SceI represents NHEJ events. GFP Analysis—GFP flow cytometry was performed on live cells on a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (excitation 488 nm, with 525 ± 15-nm bandpass filter) at the Massey Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Facility. Standard flow cytometry was carried out as described (47Rosenberg E. Holmes M. Tenenholz T. Khalil A.A. Valerie K. BioTechniques. 2003; 34 (480): 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). GFP fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss SV11 stereomicroscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a Hamamatsu digital CCD camera C4742-95-12NRB (Hamamatsu Corp., Bridgewater, NJ) and AttoArc2/HB 100 Arc variable intensity microscopy illuminator system (Zeiss) using excitation/emission filters (470/525 nm). Images were captured using AxioVision version 3.1 software and processed with Adobe PhotoShop version 5.0. DNA Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted using DNAeasy® Tissue Kit from Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA). PCRs included 0.2 mm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), 10 pmol of repair primers (top strand, 5′-GAC TTG AAG TCG TGC TG-3′; bottom strand, 5′-TGT CGT GTT ATT GGT CGT GC-3′), synthesized by the Massey Cancer Center Nucleic Acid Core at Virginia Commonwealth University, and 1 unit/reaction TaqDNA Polymerase (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min and then 40 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final elongation step of 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were visualized on an 1% agarose gel and purified by the Qiaquick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). PCR products were digested with BcgI and/or I-SceI restriction enzymes (2 units/reaction) for 4 h at 37 °C. Products were separated on a 1.3% Tris borate, pH 8.3, agarose gel and detected by Southern blotting using a 780-bp hybridization probe isolated from pEGFP-1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) that spans the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-It® Kit II (Stratagene), and unincorporated nucleoside triphosphates were removed by the QIAquick® nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Membranes were exposed to a Bio-Rad phosphoscreen and quantified using QuantityOne® analysis software (Bio-Rad). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was used to study protein-DNA interactions at the DSB after cleavage with I-SceI expressed from adenovirus (48Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested at different times after I-SceI virus infection and proteins cross-linked to DNA by treating with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by quenching with 2 mm glycine. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-ATM antibody and protein A-agarose. The cross-linking was reversed in 1% SDS at 65 °C overnight. DNA was then isolated by standard proteinase K digestion at 55 °C and subsequent phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCR was carried out with ChIP primers directed to the 5′ DNA sequence-flanking site of the I-SceI site. PCR products were detected by Southern blotting on 1.3% agarose gels. Primers used were 5′-GAC TTG AAG TCG TGC TG-3′ (top strand) and 5′-TGT CGT GTT ATT GGT CGT GC-3′ (bottom strand) (synthesized by the Massey Cancer Center Nucleic Acid Core at Virginia Commonwealth University). Expression of HA-I-SceI from Adenovirus—First, to demonstrate expression of the I-SceI endonuclease from the Ad-SceI-NG virus (43Anglana M. Bacchetti S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4276-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), U87 glioma cells were infected and harvested at various times postinfection. I-SceI endonuclease expressed from this Ad has a hemagglutinin A (HA) tag on its amino terminus, permitting Western blot detection of protein expression. In agreement with Anglana and Bacchetti (43Anglana M. Bacchetti S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4276-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we identified a prominent band of HA-I-SceI on a Western blot with an apparent molecular size of 30-35 kDa that appeared as early as 6 h after infection and remained elevated until 48 h postinfection (Fig. 1), demonstrating that HA-I-SceI is produced from the virus at high levels in U87 cells very soon after infection. ATM Is Expressed in Human Glioma Cell Lines—To demonstrate that ATM is expressed in the U87 cells and other glioma cells, ATM was immunoprecipitated from U87 cells and transferred onto a membrane for Western blot analysis. As controls for ATM expression, we included extracts from M059J and M059K cells, a pair of human malignant glioma cell lines established from the same human tumor that differ in DNA-PKcs status and ATM expression (39Chan D.W. Gately D.P. Urban S. Galloway A.M. Lees-Miller S.P. Yen T. Allalunis-Turner J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Expression of ATM was detected in both U87 and M059K cells, whereas ATM was not detected in the M059J cells (Fig. 2). Chan et al. (39Chan D.W. Gately D.P. Urban S. Galloway A.M. Lees-Miller S.P. Yen T. Allalunis-Turner J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ATM is expressed in M059J cells, albeit at very low levels. DSB Repair in DR-GFP-transfected Cells—To facilitate the analysis of DSB repair events, U87 cells were transfected with the DR-GFP plasmid carrying the inactive dual GFP expression cassette with a single I-SceI site, and stable cell clones were selected and established by selecting for cells resistant to puromycin (41Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). We obtained a number of clones that produced GFP+ cells upon infection with Ad-SceI-NG but not with Adβgal virus (not shown). The stable integrant, U87/DR-GFP, appeared to have a single or few copies of DR-GFP integrated in the genome as indicated by a simple banding pattern on a Southern blot (not shown). In order to study HRR events in response to I-SceI cleavage, U87/DR-GFP cells were infected with either Adβgal or Ad-SceI-NG, harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection, and subjected to GFP flow cytometry. In several experiments, we detected a time-dependent increase in GFP+ cells following Ad-SceI-NG infection, with 4.6% GFP+ cells by 48 h and 5.9% by 72 h (Fig. 3). On the other hand, Adβgal-infected cells had very few GFP+ cells among 30,000-50,000 analyzed cells (<0.16%). This result demonstrates that HRR (yielding GFP+ cells) is stimulated in human glioma cells by site-specific cleavage with I-SceI expressed from Ad-SceI-NG in agreement with results using hamster cells (41Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Further study of DSB repair was then carried out by a PCR-based assay, allowing for the parallel determination of NHEJ and HRR (41Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 49Liang F. Han M. Romanienko P.J. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). DSB repair was detected as early as 12 h after infection and reached maximum levels between 24 and 48 h (Fig. 4). As expected, NHEJ was more prominent than HRR with an average ratio of HRR and NHEJ of 1:10.Fig. 4U87 glioma cells carry out HRR and NHEJ. U87/DR-GFP cells were infected with Ad-I-SceI-NG and harvested at the times indicated. Genomic DNA was extracted, and PCR was performed using repair primers. PCR products were digested with I-SceI and BcgI restriction enzymes in vitro and fragments separated by 1.3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Products were visualized by Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled GFP probe and quantified by Quantity One® analysis software (Bio-Rad). A, HRR (HR) and NHEJ repair levels are plotted as a function of time. Repair is quantified as the percentage of total PCR DNA that is digested with BcgI (HRR) and DNA remaining after BcgI + I-SceI digestion (NHEJ). B, PCR/Southern blot data of results shown in A. Repair was detected as early as 12 h after transduction and reached maximum steady-state levels between 24 and 48 h. In this experiment, the average relative ratio of HRR and NHEJ (24-48 h) was 1:10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATM Binds to the I-SceI-induced DSB in Vivo—ATM binds to DNA ends in vitro (19Smith G.C.

https://openalex.org/W2039685662,"β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that is known to participate in two well defined cellular processes, cell-cell adhesion and Wnt-stimulated transcriptional activation. Here we report that β-catenin participates in a third cellular process, the establishment of a bipolar mitotic spindle. During mitosis, β-catenin relocalizes to mitotic spindle poles and to the midbody. Furthermore, biochemical fractionation demonstrates the presence of β-catenin in purified centrosome preparations. Reduction of cellular β-catenin by RNA interference leads to the failure of centrosomes to fully separate, resulting in a marked increase in the frequency of monoastral mitotic spindles. Our results define a new and important function for β-catenin in mitosis and demonstrate that β-catenin is involved in vital biological processes beyond cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that is known to participate in two well defined cellular processes, cell-cell adhesion and Wnt-stimulated transcriptional activation.

Our results define a new and important function for β-catenin in mitosis and demonstrate that β-catenin is involved in vital biological processes beyond cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. The faithful distribution of the genetic material between daughter cells during cell division requires the precise segregation of duplicated chromosomes. This crucial duty is performed by a microtubule-based machine known as the mitotic spindle (1Wittmann T. Hyman A. Desai A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E28-E34Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The dynamic interactions of numerous structural and motor proteins underlie the formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle (1Wittmann T. Hyman A. Desai A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E28-E34Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Compton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, many of the molecules that regulate spindle assembly remain elusive (3Wigge P.A. Jensen O.N. Holmes S. Soues S. Mann M. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein with critical roles in both cell-cell adhesion and transcriptional regulation (4Tepass U. Truong K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 5Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In cooperation with α-catenin, β-catenin links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby establishing a junctional complex that is required for strong cell-cell adhesion (4Tepass U. Truong K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 6Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). β-Catenin also functions in signal transduction as a component of the Wnt/Wingless pathway that is crucial for development (5Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 8Peifer M. Wieschaus E.

The Wnt signal frees β-catenin from a cytoplasmic complex that normally targets it for degradation, thereby allowing the protein to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus (10Moon R.T. Bowerman B.

Defects in the control of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that result in aberrant accumulation of β-catenin are observed in many cancers (13Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that β-catenin has a cellular role in addition to cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. We demonstrate that β-catenin is a component of the mammalian mitotic spindle and that it functions to ensure proper centrosome separation and the subsequent establishment of a bipolar spindle. Materials—The cDNAs for Xenopus β-catenin-myc and β-catenin-GFP (green fluorescent protein) were a gift from Randall Moon (University of Washington) and that for Myc-ΔN-TCF was a gift from Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). Anti-β-catenin mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-β-tubulin-Cy3 directly conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody and anti-γ-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody were from Sigma; anti-γ-tubulin rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Berkeley Antibody Co.; anti-actin goat polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-c-myc mouse monoclonal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Cell Culture and Transfection—L and HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum; NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum; and HeLa cells were grown in MEMα containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate. For Fig. S1C, L or NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with an expression vector encoding Xenopus β-catenin fused to GFP (14Miller J.R. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Generation of Stable HeLa Cell Lines—Xenopus β-catenin with six myc epitopes appended to the C terminus was subcloned into the retroviral vector pLPCX (BD Biosciences). Control or Xenopus β-catenin retrovirus was produced by transfecting a HEK 293 virus-packaging cell line with empty pLPCX vector or pLPCX encoding Xenopus β-catenin, respectively. Recombinant retroviruses were harvested from the media of the transfected HEK 293 cells and used to infect HeLa cells. HeLa cells expressing the viruses were selected and maintained in normal HeLa media additionally containing puromycin (2 μg/ml). Production of Wnt-3A-conditioned Media—Media were harvested from confluent L cells expressing Wnt-3A or a control vector (courtesy of Karl Willert, Stanford University), cleared by centrifugation, and filtered. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Cells shown in Figs. 1 and 3C were grown on coverslips and fixed rapidly according to established protocols (15Berod A. Hartman B.K. Pujol J.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 16Basyuk E. Bertrand E. Journot L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 (E46iii): E46iCrossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 11, for 10 min at room temperature. The same staining pattern was observed with an alternate protocol (17Howell B.J. Hoffman D.B. Fang G. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) involving permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 and fixation at pH 7 (Figs. 3D and S1, A and B). Antibody incubations were as follows: Figs. 1, 3C, and S1, A and B, Zymed Laboratories Inc. anti-β-catenin (1:100), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (1:100), and Cy3-conjugated anti-β-tubulin (1:100); Fig. 3D, Sigma anti-γ-tubulin (1:1000), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (1:100), and Cy3-conjugated anti-β-tubulin (1:100). In all cases, DNA was stained using Hoechst 33342 (1:1000) in phosphate-buffered saline. For Fig. 3D, centrosome number was assessed by γ-tubulin staining as described previously (18Mayor T. Stierhof Y.D. Tanaka K. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Images were obtained using an LSM-410 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40× or 63× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss). All images are single confocal sections with the exception of those in Fig. S1C, which were taken using a Nikon TE300 fluorescence light microscope.Fig. 3Reduction of β-catenin increases the incidence of monoastral spindles. A, immunoblot analysis of lysates from HeLa cells treated with siRNA directed against β-catenin or a control sequence. B and C, HeLa cells were fixed 64 h after siRNA transfection, and the localization of β-catenin (green in merge), β-tubulin (red in merge), and DNA (blue in merge) were examined. Mitotic spindles were visualized by β-tubulin staining. For each condition, the fraction of mitotic cells exhibiting monoastral spindles is shown in B. In C, an example of a monoastral spindle in a β-catenin siRNA-treated cell (top) and a normal, bipolar spindle in a control-treated cell (bottom) are shown. Note that the only β-catenin staining remaining in the β-catenin siRNA-treated cell is seen at the hub of the monoastral spindle. D, monoastral spindles caused by reduction of β-catenin result from unseparated centrosomes.

Centrosomes were isolated according to the method of Mitchison and Kirschner (19Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were subjected to a sequence of rapid washes and then lysed, and the lysate was cleared and filtered. This lysate was centrifuged onto a cushion of 20% Ficoll, to concentrate centrosomes. Crude centrosomal material was collected from the surface of the Ficoll cushion using a Pasteur pipette, assayed by refractometry (Milton Roy Co.) to ensure that the Ficoll concentration was <10%, and then loaded onto a continuous sucrose gradient, ranging from 20 to 62.5% sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 ultracentrifuge rotor at 4 °C. RNA Interference—Double-stranded 21-mer RNA oligonucleotides homologous to sequences in human β-catenin (20Thompson B. Townsley F. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and the luciferase plasmid pGL2 (21Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were purchased as desalted, deprotected, purified duplexes (Dharmacon Research). HeLa cells were transfected with the RNA duplexes using Oligofectamine as described previously (20Thompson B. Townsley F. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and harvested 64 h post-transfection for analysis. Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of each fraction (for analysis of sucrose fractions from the centrosome preparation) or equal amounts of protein from each small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected cell lysate (for analysis of siRNA-mediated reduction of protein levels) were heated in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analyses were performed using anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-γ-tubulin (Berkeley Antibody Co.), anti-plakoglobin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-actin, followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and subsequent chemiluminescence detection. Analysis of Spindle Morphology—HeLa cells were fixed 64 h after transfection with siRNA, and immunofluorescence staining was performed as described above. Mitotic cells were scored as having normal bipolar spindles or monoastral spindles, and the percentage of mitotic cells with monoastral spindles were represented as [(No. of monoastral spindles/total no. of mitotic cells) × 100]. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of the mean of three independent experiments in which >2000 cells were analyzed per experiment. We were prompted to investigate the possibility that β-catenin has an important cellular role in addition to cell adhesion and Wnt signaling while examining the fate of β-catenin released from the cadherin cytoplasmic domain (22Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kaplan D.D. Meigs T.E. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44037-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the process of these studies, we noticed an unusual staining pattern of β-catenin in mitotic cells and decided to examine its distribution more carefully during the cell cycle. During interphase, endogenous β-catenin was seen to localize diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus and at cell-cell junctions (Fig. S1A). However, during M phase, β-catenin localized strikingly to the centrosomal region at the poles of the mitotic spindle and to the spindle midzone during midbody formation (Fig. 1). This staining pattern was observed in mitotic L, NIH 3T3, PtK1, and HeLa cells. β-Catenin first became concentrated at centrosomes during metaphase (Fig. 1A) and remained at the spindle poles during anaphase and early telophase (Fig. 1, B and C). As the cleavage furrow constricted between the two daughter cells, β-catenin also appeared at the midbody (Fig. 1C). By late telophase, β-catenin was no longer seen at the centrosomes, but it remained concentrated at the midbody (Fig. 1D). This staining pattern was not observed when the primary antibody was pre-incubated with purified β-catenin, nor was it observed when the primary antibody or secondary antibody was omitted, nor when a control IgG primary antibody was used (data not shown). Furthermore, when a fusion of β-catenin to GFP (14Miller J.R. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was expressed in L cells and NIH 3T3 cells, the protein localized to the spindle poles and the midbody in live, mitotic cells (Fig. S1C), just as was observed for endogenous β-catenin in fixed cells. Additionally, we were unable to detect any concentration of the β-catenin homolog plakoglobin at mitotic spindle poles or the midbody, indicating that the observed localization is specific for β-catenin (data not shown). This dramatic redistribution of β-catenin during mitosis is suggestive of a function for this protein distinct from its interphase roles. As an independent approach to confirm the association of β-catenin with centrosomes, we isolated centrosomes from L cells and HeLa cells using an established method (19Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of fractions from the final step in the purification procedure revealed that β-catenin was indeed present in this centrosomal preparation, where it co-fractionated with γ-tubulin (Fig. 2, top panel), a core component of the centrosome (24Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The two proteins were concentrated at the position of the sucrose gradient corresponding to a sucrose concentration of 49–57% (Fig. 2, bottom panel), the position where centrosomes have been reported to sediment (19Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To examine the functional consequence of the surprising localization of β-catenin, we reduced the level of β-catenin in HeLa cells using siRNA (Fig. 3A). Examination of mitotic cells in which β-catenin levels were reduced by ∼90% (Fig. 3A) revealed a marked increase in the frequency of monoastral spindles (Fig. 3, B and C). This finding suggests a role for β-catenin in establishing spindle bipolarity. To determine whether this effect was direct or mediated via a transcriptional target of β-catenin, we overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant of TCF (25He T.-C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar) to block β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. This treatment completely abrogated Wnt-3A-stimulated activation of a β-catenin-responsive transcriptional reporter but did not induce formation of monoastral spindles (data not shown). Thus, the effect on spindle morphology appears to result directly from the depletion of β-catenin from centrosomes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that spindle formation might involve cortical or cytoplasmic β-catenin acting in a hitherto undescribed role. Monoastral spindles can result from defects in centrosome duplication or from defects in centrosome separation (26Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). To begin to explore the mechanism through which depletion of β-catenin disrupts bipolar spindle formation, we assessed the number of centrosomes in the monoastral spindles of β-catenin-depleted cells. All of the monoastral spindles examined exhibited two puncta of γ-tubulin staining (Fig. 3D, arrowheads), indicating that the centrosomes had duplicated but were not properly separated. To verify that the observed increase in monoastral mitotic spindles was specifically due to loss of β-catenin, we performed a rescue experiment by reintroducing a form of β-catenin that would be refractory to siRNA. We accomplished this using Xenopus β-catenin, the amino acid sequence of which is 95% identical to human β-catenin but which has two nucleotides in the siRNA target sequence that differ from those in human β-catenin. Because even a single mismatch in the target sequence has been shown to abolish siRNA-mediated gene silencing (27Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar), we reasoned that Xenopus β-catenin should be highly refractory to siRNA directed against human β-catenin. We generated stable HeLa cell lines expressing either myc-tagged Xenopus β-catenin or a control vector (Fig. 4A) and then used siRNA to knock down the endogenous β-catenin without disrupting the ectopically expressed Xenopus β-catenin (Fig. 4A). Examination of the spindle morphology of these cells revealed that treatment with β-catenin siRNA resulted in a clear increase in monoastral mitotic spindles in those cells expressing the control retrovirus but no increase in those cells expressing the Xenopus β-catenin retrovirus (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that introduction of Xenopus β-catenin can rescue the mitotic defect caused by β-catenin siRNA treatment and provide verification that the observed increase in monoastral mitotic spindles is due specifically to the loss of β-catenin. The specificity of this phenotype is further demonstrated by our observations that reduction of plakoglobin levels using siRNA does not result in an increase in monoastral mitotic spindles and that plakoglobin overexpression cannot effectively rescue the monoastral spindle phenotype caused by reduction of cellular β-catenin. 2D. D. Kaplan, A. Kowalczyk, and P. J. Casey, unpublished observations. The identification herein of a novel function for β-catenin in centrosome separation suggests that β-catenin plays a more general role as a molecular scaffold than previously thought. This notion is supported by some interesting observations that have come from genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans suggesting a possible role for homologs of β-catenin in orienting or anchoring the mitotic spindle (28McCartney B.M.

Ahringer J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3984-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as well as by the finding that β-catenin may anchor microtubules at adherens junctions via its interaction with dynein (30Ligon L.A. Karki S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In both cell adhesion and Wnt signaling, β-catenin acts as an adaptor to direct the local formation of functional protein complexes (31Daniels D.L. Spink K.E. Weis W.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 672-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It seems likely that β-catenin is employed in a similar capacity in mitotic spindle formation. A complex assemblage of many structural and motor proteins is required to establish a bipolar mitotic spindle (1Wittmann T. Hyman A. Desai A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E28-E34Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Compton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). β-Catenin may regulate this dynamic process to ensure that components of the mitotic machinery are assembled in the correct place and at the correct time for cell division to proceed efficiently. Clearly, the identification of the binding partners of β-catenin at the centrosomes and midbody will be essential to a complete mechanistic understanding of its role in mitosis. We thank K.

https://openalex.org/W2064264662,"Short DNA segments designated Okazaki fragments are intermediates in eukaryotic DNA replication. Each contains an initiator RNA/DNA primer (iRNA/DNA), which is converted into a 5'-flap and then removed prior to fragment joining. In one model for this process, the flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) removes the iRNA. In the other, the single-stranded binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), coats the flap, inhibits FEN1, but stimulates cleavage by the Dna2p helicase/nuclease. RPA dissociates from the resultant short flap, allowing FEN1 cleavage. To determine the most likely process, we analyzed cleavage of short and long 5'-flaps. FEN1 cleaves 10-nucleotide fixed or equilibrating flaps in an efficient reaction, insensitive to even high levels of RPA or Dna2p. On 30-nucleotide fixed or equilibrating flaps, RPA partially inhibits FEN1. CTG flaps can form foldback structures and were inhibitory to both nucleases, however, addition of a dT(12) to the 5'-end of a CTG flap allowed Dna2p cleavage. The presence of high Dna2p activity, under reaction conditions favoring helicase activity, substantially stimulated FEN1 cleavage of tailed-foldback flaps and also 30-nucleotide unstructured flaps. Our results suggest Dna2p is not used for processing of most flaps. However, Dna2p has a role in a pathway for processing structured flaps, in which it aids FEN1 using both its nuclease and helicase activities."

https://openalex.org/W2022474701,"We quantify cytosolic and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) from four established cell lines using a recently described method for the separation of cytosolic and mitochondrial (mt) dNTPs from as little as 10 million cells in culture (Pontarin, G., Gallinaro, L., Ferraro, P., Reichard, P., and Bianchi, V. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 12159–12164). In cycling cells the concentrations of the phosphates of thymidine, deoxycytidine, and deoxyadenosine (combining mono-, di-, and triphosphates in each case) did not differ significantly between mitochondria and cytosol, whereas deoxyguanosine phosphates were concentrated to mitochondria. We study the source and regulation of the mt dTTP pool as an example of mt dNTPs. We suggest two pathways as sources for mt dTTP: (i) import from the cytosol of thymidine diphosphate by a deoxynucleotide transporter, predominantly in cells involved in DNA replication with an active synthesis of deoxynucleotides and (ii) import of thymidine followed by phosphorylation by the mt thymidine kinase, predominantly in resting cells. Here we demonstrate that the second pathway is regulated by a mt 5′-deoxyribonucleotidase (mdN). We modify the in situ activity of mdN and measure the transfer of radioactivity from [3H]thymidine to mt thymidine phosphates. In cycling cells lacking the cytosolic thymidine kinase, a 30-fold overproduction of mdN decreases the specific radioactivity of mt dTTP to 25%, and an 80% decrease of mdN by RNA interference increases the specific radioactivity 2-fold. These results suggest that mdN modulates the synthesis of mt dTTP by counteracting in a substrate cycle the phosphorylation of thymidine by the mt thymidine kinase.

The synthesis of DNA requires a supply of deoxyribonucleotides. In eukaryotic cells the bulk of DNA is located in the nucleus and replicated once during the S phase, which in cycling cultured cells occupies approximately one-third of the cell cycle. Terminally differentiated cells or resting cells in culture only rarely or never replicate their DNA. In cycling cells the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides occurs mostly during S phase, simultaneously with nuclear DNA replication (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In resting cells the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides is shut down. In addition to nuclear DNA, eukaryotic cells also contain mitochondrial (mt) 1The abbreviations used are: mt, mitochondrial; dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate; TK1, cytosolic thymidine kinase; TK2, mitochondrial thymidine kinase; cdN, cytosolic 5′-deoxyribonucleotidase (formerly dNT-1); mdN, mitochondrial 5′-deoxyribonucleotidase (formerly dNT-2); dTDP, thymidine diphosphate; RNAi, RNA interference. 1The abbreviations used are: mt, mitochondrial; dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate; TK1, cytosolic thymidine kinase; TK2, mitochondrial thymidine kinase; cdN, cytosolic 5′-deoxyribonucleotidase (formerly dNT-1); mdN, mitochondrial 5′-deoxyribonucleotidase (formerly dNT-2); dTDP, thymidine diphosphate; RNAi, RNA interference. DNA that represents ∼5% of the total cellular DNA (2Tang Y. Schon E.A. Wilichowski E. Vazquez-Memije M.E. Davidson E. King M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1471-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For its replication mt DNA requires only a correspondingly small fraction of the total deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) of the cell. Replication is, however, not coordinated with that of nuclear DNA and also requires dNTPs outside the S phase (3Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1977; 11: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This requirement may become particularly critical in resting cells. It is generally believed that special dNTP pools in mitochondria not in equilibrium with cytosolic dNTP pools serve the synthesis of mt DNA. Seminal reports from Clayton's laboratory (4Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2938-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated early that radioactive thymidine was preferentially incorporated into mt DNA in cultured cells that could phosphorylate the nucleoside only inside mitochondria because they lacked a cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1–). This result suggests strongly that thymidine phosphates formed by the mt thymidine kinase (TK2) (6Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Wang L. Munch-Petersen B. Herrström Sjöberg A. Hellman U. Bergman T. Jörnvall H. Eriksson S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) are at least partially sequestered in mitochondria to serve preferentially for mt DNA synthesis. Subsequent work by others argued for a strict separation of mt and cytosolic pools. In HeLa cells whose de novo synthesis of dTMP was blocked by amethopterin, only the size of the cytosolic dTTP pool decreased, whereas mt dTTP actually increased, suggesting a complete separation of the metabolism of the two pools (8Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9305-9308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could, however, not confirm this result and found instead that amethopterin decreases the size of both pools, suggesting a communication between them (9Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Such a communication was further emphasized by our kinetic isotope chase experiments with [3H]thymidine in TK1+ and TK1– cultured cells (9Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that demonstrated a rapid influx of de novo synthesized thymidine phosphates into mitochondria from the cytosol and an equally rapid movement in the opposite direction of nucleotides synthesized inside mitochondria by phosphorylation of thymidine. Our results suggested that although mitochondrial and cytosolic dNTPs do form separate kinetic pools that can be synthesized independently, they are rapidly interconverted. To be able to do these experiments, we devised a novel method for the quantitative separation of mt and cytosolic dNTP pools that made possible separate analyses of the two pools (9Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). With this method that was validated in several independent ways, we can measure the size of mt dNTP pools from as little as 107 cultured cells. mt dNTP pools are fed by two separate potential pathways that transport deoxynucleosides (or deoxynucleotides) from the cytosol into mitochondria, as exemplified for dTTP in Fig. 1: (i) a deoxynucleotide (dTDP) is introduced by a deoxynucleotide transporter (10Lambeth D.O. Mehus J.G. Ivey M.A. Milavetz B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24604-24611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Runswick M.J. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) or (ii) a deoxynucleoside (thymidine) is introduced, probably by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (12Lai Y Tse C.-M. Unadkat J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4490-4497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and phosphorylated by a mt kinase (TK2). The first pathway relies mainly on the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides in cells replicating their nuclear DNA. The second pathway is not related to nuclear DNA replication but relies on the availability of thymidine that can be salvaged from the extracellular milieu. We hypothesized recently from experiments with cycling cells in culture that in dividing cells the vast majority of mt dNTPs enters mitochondria via the first pathway but that in nondividing cells with no de novo synthesis of deoxynucleotides the second pathway becomes important (9Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Genetic mitochondrial diseases affecting enzymes of either pathway attest to the importance of both and support our hypothesis: (i) the deoxynucleotide carrier is involved in Amish microcephaly (13Rosenberg M.J. Agarwala R. Bouffard G. Davis J. Fiermonte G. Hilliard M.S. Koch T. Kalikin L.M. Makalowska I. Morton D.H. Petty E.M. Weber J.L Palmieri F. Kelley R.I. Schaffer A.A. Biesecker L.G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), demonstrating its importance for prenatal brain growth, and (ii) TK2 is involved in mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy, a disease that appears in early childhood (14Saada A. Shaag A. Mandel H. Nevo Y. Eriksson S. Elpeleg O. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). How are the two pathways regulated? In both instances the concentration of the cytosolic metabolites required for transport into mitochondria must be an important factor. For the first pathway the concentration of dTDP is tightly linked to the cell cycle, depending largely on the activity and allosteric regulation of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (15Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In a secondary manner the cytosolic substrate cycle (Fig. 1) between TK1 and a cytosolic 5′-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN (16Bianchi V. Spychala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46195-46198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)) is also a contributing factor (17Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6185-6190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The availability of thymidine for the second pathway is an unknown factor. It is, however, not linked to the cell cycle but to thymidine concentration in the bloodstream. Interestingly, a large increase in thymidine concentration in blood because of the genetic loss of the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase is connected with increased mutations in mt DNA leading to mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (18Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Hirano M. Science. 1999; 283: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 19Nishigaki Y. Marti R. Copeland W.C. Hirano M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is a fair assumption that the mt disease depends on a high concentration of intra-mt thymidine, indicating the importance of the second pathway for mt dNTP pools. The present work concerns the regulation of the second pathway by mdN (formerly dNT2 (16Bianchi V. Spychala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46195-46198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)), an intra-mt 5′-deoxyribonucleotidase with a pronounced specificity for the dephosphorylation of dTMP and dUMP (20Rampazzo C. Gallinaro L. Milanesi E. Frigimelica E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8239-8244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have suggested (Fig. 1) that mdN together with TK2 forms a substrate cycle that regulates the concentration of dTMP (and dUMP) inside mitochondria. We proposed that mdN counteracts the activity of TK2 by dephosphorylating dTMP and thus inside the mitochondria is a guardian against the overproduction of thymidine phosphates. Here we test this hypothesis in cycling cells in culture that either overproduce mdN or have lost a large part of the activity of the enzyme by RNA interference. We analyze the effects of changed mdN activity on cell growth, dNTP pool size, and DNA synthesis and compare in isotope experiments with labeled thymidine the ability of genetically manipulated and control cells to transform the nucleoside to thymidine phosphates. Our results support a role for mdN in the regulation of the mt dTTP pool. Cell Lines and Cell Growth—The established human tumor lines OSTTK1– and HOSTK1+ and the mouse fibroblast lines 3T3TK1– and 3T3TK1+ were as in earlier experiments (9Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). From OSTTK1– we prepared a cell line that could be induced by ponasterone to overproduce mdN by procedures identical to those described for a similar inducible line of 293 cells (21Gallinaro L. Crovatto K. Rampazzo C. Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Milanesi E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35080-35087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After recloning we obtained clone OSTTK1– 20.7, which gave highly reproducible overproduction of mdN after induction with graded amounts of ponasterone. This clone was the one used here for all experiments with overproducing OSTTK1– cells. The original OSTTK1– line was used to prepare a stable cell line with a specific mdN gene silencing response. We chose two separate 19-mers present in the coding sequence of human mdN to design two 64-mer synthetic oligonucleotides (Sigma) as described by Brummelkamp et al. (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar) and cloned them into the pSuper plasmid (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar) for the construction of two targeting vectors. We first tested both plasmids by transient transfection in 293 cells for their ability to interfere with mdN mRNA as determined by real time PCR analysis. The small interfering RNA sequence (R6, GATGTTCAAGTACTGTCCC) gave the best interference and was chosen for construction of a stably transfected cell line. We cloned a zeocin cassette (pSV40/Zeo; Invitrogen) into pSuper and pSuperR6 to give plasmids pSuperZeo and pSuperZeoR6, respectively. We used the two plasmids to prepare stable clones by transfection of OSTTK1– cells with Metafectene (Biontex, Munich, Germany). After a 48-h recovery period, we started selection with 75 μg/ml zeocin during a 2–3-week period replacing the media every 3 days. We picked 30 individual clones in each group and tested them by real time PCR. In 40% of the clones mdN mRNA was in repeated analyses decreased to between 15 and 30% of the controls. We used four clones from each group for our experiments. All of the cells were grown and manipulated as described earlier (9Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol.

They were periodically checked for mycoplasma contamination by a PCR-based procedure (Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany). The amount of cells was determined with a Coulter counter. The distribution of cells in the cell cycle was analyzed by a computerized fluorescence-activated cell sorter from Becton Dickinson (Milano, Italy). All of the quantitative values for pool sizes, protein, radioactive incorporation, and enzyme activities are given per million cells to make possible comparisons between experiments. RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription PCR, and Real Time PCR—We extracted total RNA from 1.5 × 107 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and tested its integrity by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. We treated the RNA for 30 min with DNase I (Dna-free™; Ambion). After inactivation of DNase I, we transcribed the RNA (2.5 μg in 20 μl) with Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)15V primer (V = G + A + C). We diluted the resulting cDNA with water to 0.25 ml and used it as a template for the real time PCR analysis (qPCR Core Kit for SYBR Green; Eurogentec, Belgium) to determine the expression of mdN mRNA in each original clone. We amplified mdN cDNA with primers d2RT5 (GAGGAGTTGAGGCCACTGTTCA) and d2RT6 (ATAAGGGGTGCTGTGGCTGAG). We excluded contamination of RNA by genomic DNA by PCR analysis before reverse transcription. As a standard housekeeping gene with an expression level similar to mdN, we chose hydroxymethyl-bilane synthase, amplified with the primers given in Ref. 23Vandesompele J. De Preter K. Pattyn F. Poppe B. Van Roy N. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Genome Biol. 2002; 3RESEARCH0034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Real time PCR assays were performed on cDNA samples in 96-well optical plates with a GeneAMP 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystem) using the following parameters: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 60 s. The amplification reactions were performed in 25 μl containing 0.2 μm primers and 0.2 mm dNTPs in PCR buffer with 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.6 units of Hot Gold Star enzyme (Eurogentec), SYBR Green at 1:66000 dilution, and 1–8 μl cDNA. The PCR data were captured using Sequence Detector Software. Each assay was done with three different amounts of cDNA in triplicate to obtain standard curves to ensure a similar efficiency of amplification. Hydroxymethyl-bilane synthase and mdN gave equal PCR efficiency. The data were analyzed with the comparative Ct method where the amount of target is normalized to the endogenous reference (24Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). Isotope Experiments with [3H]Thymidine, Separation, and Analyses of dNTP Pools—The procedure for the isotope experiments, separation of cytosolic and mt dTTP pools, and determination of the radioactivity in thymidine phosphates and specific radioactivity of dTTP were detailed earlier (9Pontarin G.

Briefly, we incubated cells for the indicated time periods with labeled thymidine and, after washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, separated cytosolic and mt dTTP by differential centrifugation, combining nuclear and mt fractions for mt dTTP. We extracted thymidine phosphates with 60% methanol and analyzed them by ion exchange chromatography to separate thymidine from thymidine phosphates (dTTP + dTDP + dTMP). The total radioactivity in each compartment was determined. Analytical Methods—We determined the activities of mdN and TK2 by earlier described assays (6Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), respectively, to distinguish the activities of the mt enzymes from similar cytosolic enzymes (cdN and TK1). Specific enzyme activity is defined as units/mg of protein. One unit is 1 μmol of product formed during 1 min. We determined the size of dNTP pools and the specific radioactivity of the dTTP pool in isotope experiments by a DNA-polymerase assay described in detail earlier (17Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6185-6190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, we calculated the unknown amount of the dNTP from the incorporation of an excess of [α-32P]dATP into a synthetic polymer by DNA polymerase using an appropriate standard curve with the dNTP. We calculated the specific radioactivity of dTTP from the incorporation of 3H and 32P into DNA using a standard curve with [3H]dTTP and [α-32P]dATP. We calculated the rate of DNA synthesis, expressed as pmol dTMP/min, from the cpm incorporated from labeled thymidine into DNA during a given time period, divided by the specific radioactivity of the cytosolic dTTP during that period. The statistical significance of differences between controls and RNAi-inhibited cells was assessed by Mann-Whitney U nonparametric tests because of the low number of samples. Size of mt dNTP Pools—Whereas the size of cytosolic dNTP pools of cultured cells has been the subject of many investigations, reliable systematic studies of mt dNTP pools are not available. During previous isotope flow experiments (9Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we measured the sizes of mt dTTP pools in different cell lines employing a new method for their separation from cytosolic dTTP but at that time did not report the values. We now applied this methodology also to the other dNTP pools and here report analyses of all four mt pools from four earlier described cell lines (HOSTK1+, OSTK1–, 3T3TK1+, and 3T3TK1–). The size of cytosolic dNTP pools of cultured cells changes with the growth phase (28Nordenskjöld B.A. Skoog L. Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5360-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Spyrou G. Reichard P. Mutat. Res. 1988; 200: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Bianchi V. Borella S.

We now show that also the size of the mt dTTP pool varies with the growth phase (Fig. 2). Both the cytosolic and the mt dTTP pools of OSTTK1– and HOSTK1+ cells were largest during early growth, when more cells are in S phase, than at the end of the growth curve. For mitochondria, the difference was 2-fold in TK1+ cells and 5-fold in TK1– cells, in the cytosol the differences were smaller. During early growth 3.5% of the total dTTP was in mitochondria in TK1– cells, the corresponding value for TK1+ cells was 1%. Table I reports the pool sizes of all four mt and cytosolic dNTPs from four different cell lines determined in exponentially growing cultures with ∼35% of the cells in S phase. For OSTTK1– and HOSTK1+ cells, the size of the dTTP pool was determined on four separately grown cultures. Table I gives the means of the four measurements with standard deviations to demonstrate the reproducibility of the results. The dTTP pools of the 3T3 cells are the means from two individual cell cultures; all other values are from duplicate analyses of single cultures. In the last column of Table I we give the calculated averages for each dNTP with standard deviations.Table ISize of mt and cytosolic dNTP pools of four cell linesHOS TK1+OST TK1-3T3TK1+3T3TK1-Averagespmol/106 cellspmol/106 cellspmol/106 cellspmol/106 cellspmol/106 cellsMitochondria dTTP0.68 ± 0.261.6 ± 0.220.520.700.88 ± 0.49 dATP0.451.20.450.880.75 ± 0.43 dCTP0.740.890.560.810.75 ± 0.14 dGTP0.270.560.390.370.40 ± 0.12Cytosol dTTP43 ± 937 ± 7192932 ± 10 dATP1130111817.5 ± 9 dCTP1929204227.5 ± 11 dGTP5.86.25.56.25.9 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Among cytosolic dNTPs dGTP was by far the smallest pool, and also the dATP pool was smaller than the two pyrimidine pools (1Reichard P.

This is in accordance with earlier reports. Also among mt dNTPs the dGTP pool was smallest, but the asymmetry between the four pools was not pronounced, with dTTP, dATP, and dCTP having similar pool sizes. Compared with the large variations of the dTTP pool during cell growth (Fig. 2) variations for each mt dNTP were small between cell lines. Table II shows the distribution between mitochondria and cytosol for each dNTP. The average values from the four cell lines (last column in Table II) show that the mt pools amount to between 3 and 7% of the corresponding cytosolic pools. In this comparison purines, and in particular dGTP, are more concentrated in mitochondria than pyrimidines. Nevertheless also in mitochondria dGTP is the smallest pool in absolute terms (Table I). We compare here only the size of the triphosphate pools, which is somewhat misleading because the level of nucleoside phosphorylation differs between the cytosol and mitochondria (see “Discussion”).Table IIRatios between mt and cytosolic dNTPs of the four cell linesHOS TK1+OST TK1-3T3 TK1+3T3 TK1-AveragesdTTP1.64.32.72.42.8 ± 1.1dATP4.14.04.14.94.3 ± 0.4dCTP3.93.12.81.92.9 ± 0.8dGTP4.89.07.16.06.7 ± 1.8 Open table in a new tab Effects of Overproduction of mdN—We had found earlier (21Gallinaro L.

Here we focus our experiments on mt dTTP by changing the experimental protocol in two ways: (i) We used cultured tumor cells devoid of the cytosolic TK1 (OSTTK1– cells) that only phosphorylated [3H]thymidine inside mitochondria by TK2; any formed [3H]dTMP was therefore immediately available for dephosphorylation by mdN in the postulated intra-mt substrate cycle between TK2 and mdN (Fig. 1). (ii) We studied the effects of mdN overproduction on the separated mt and cytosolic dTTP pools. In preliminary experiments we treated inducible OSTTK1– cells with 1–4 μm ponasterone for up to 72 h and determined the effects on cell growth, mdN activity, dNTP pool sizes, and incorporation of radioactive thymidine (data not shown). At high concentrations the inducer had a profound effect on all parameters giving after 4 days a 100-fold increase in mdN activity and a varying decrease in the size of all four dNTP pools. The most sensitive parameter appeared to be the incorporation of [3H]thymidine that decreased already at the earliest time point in cells treated with as little as 1 μm ponasterone. We therefore conducted three experiments with lower concentrations of ponasterone and short induction time. First we show the data from the most detailed experiment. We treated cells for 24 h with 0.8, 1.5, or 2.5 μm ponasterone for 24 h before pulsing the cultures with [3H]thymidine and investigated the effects of mdN overproduction on cell growth, the size of dNTP pools, and the utilization of the radioactive thymidine for dTTP and DNA synthesis. Induction with increasing concentrations of ponasterone gave a linear increase in the specific enzyme act"

In this study, we identified a novel interaction partner of ACTR, the ETS transcription factor ER81 that is also heavily implicated in mammary tumor formation. ACTR and related p160 family members (steroid receptor coactivator-1 and glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1 (GRIP-1)) augment ER81-mediated transcription. Although ACTR and GRIP-1 can acetylate ER81, this posttranslational modification of ER81 is not required for its stimulation by ACTR or GRIP-1. In addition, ACTR collaborates with the p300 coactivator, a joint interaction partner of ACTR and ER81, to stimulate ER81 function and the ability of p300 to acetylate ER81 is indispensable for this collaboration. Furthermore, the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/Neu, an oncoprotein particularly found overexpressed in breast tumors, cooperates with both ACTR and p300 to stimulate ER81-mediated transcription. Thus, oncogenic HER2/Neu and ACTR may synergize to orchestrate mammary tumorigenesis through the dysregulation of the transcription factor ER81 and its target genes.

Not only do SRCs interact with nuclear hormone receptors, they also facilitate the recruitment of other coactivators including the acetyltransferases CBP, p300, and P/CAF and the arginine methyltransferases CARM1 and PRMT1. Additionally, SRCs may acetylate histones on their own, all of which promotes transcription of nuclear hormone receptor target genes (1Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Three homologous members of the SRC coactivator family exist: SRC-1/NCoA-1 (nuclear coactivator-1); SRC-2/NCoA-2/TIF-2 (transcriptional intermediary factor-2)/GRIP-1; and SRC-3/ACTR.

These studies suggest that ACTR overexpression may pleiotropically contribute to tumor formation, especially within the breast, as a cofactor of a variety of different transcription factors. We wondered whether the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors might utilize ACTR as a coactivator, because this group of transcription factors is specifically overexpressed in HER2/Neu-induced mouse mammary tumors (23Trimble M.S.

The PEA3 group of transcription factors is comprised of PEA3/E1AF, ER81/ETV1 and ERM/ETV5 (27de Launoit Y. Chotteau-Lelievre A. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. Netzer S. Brenner C. Huvent I. Baert J.L. Adv.

Interestingly, both PEA3 and ER81 are downstream targets of HER2/Neu (25Benz C.C. O'Hagan R.C. Richter B. Scott G.K. Chang C.H. Xiong X. Chew K. Ljung B.M. Edgerton S. Thor A. Hassell J.A.

In case of ER81, the molecular details of its activation by HER2/Neu have been elucidated and include the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK-activated protein kinase that both phosphorylate and thereby stimulate ER81-mediated transcription (30Bosc D.G.

In addition, HER2/Neu induces the phosphorylation of the coactivator p300 and concomitantly stimulates the acetyltransferase activity of p300 and thus acetylation of ER81 by p300, which is required for maximal transcriptional activity of ER81 (37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Finally, HER2/Neu-induced activation of MAPK can result in the phosphorylation of ACTR, affecting its coactivator activity (38Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Accordingly, HER2/Neu, ACTR, and ER81 might be poised to synergize in the process of transforming normal breast cells to malignant ones.

HA-tagged GRIP-1, GRIP-1ΔAD1, GRIP-1ΔAD2, and GRIP-1ΔAD1+ΔAD2 have been described previously (44Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged ACTR and truncations thereof were cloned into the pCS3+-Myc6 vector, whereas Myc-tagged ER81 constructs were as described previously (37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of ACTR (amino acids 1086–1292) was cloned into pGEX-2T-His6-PL2 to produce a respective GST fusion protein. Acetylation Assays—In vitro, acetylation assays were performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT in the presence of 0.25 μCi of [14C]acetyl coenzyme A (57 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) (37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The enzyme source was the HAT domain of p300 (amino acids 1195–1681) (37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), GRIP-1 (amino acids 1158–1432) (12Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or ACTR (amino acids 1086–1292) fused to GST and purified from bacteria. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. GST Pull-down Assay—GST, GST-ER812–477, or various truncations of ER81 were expressed and purified as described previously (37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 50 μl of lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with Myc6-ACTR (2.5 μg), HA-CARM1 (2.5 μg), or HA-PRMT1 (2.5 μg) expression plasmid were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with approximately equimolar quantities of GST fusion proteins pre-bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in 2.5 mm Tris-HCl, 7.5 mm Na4P2O7, 12.5 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, and 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 7.1, containing protease inhibitor mixture. The beads were washed four times, boiled in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound ACTR was detected by anti-Myc (9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody), and CARM1 or PRMT1 was detected by anti-HA (12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody) Western blotting. Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR—293T cells were transiently transfected with SRC-1 (0.1 μg), GRIP-1 (0.1 μg), ACTR (0.1 μg), p300 (0.1 μg), HER2/Neu-V664E (1 μg), and 0.2 μg of ER81 or various other ETS protein expression plasmids as indicated. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted and employed for the Access RT-PCR kit (Promega) with matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and GAPDH primers (30Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Immunoprecipitation—293T cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged ER812–477 (1.5 μg) and Myc6-ACTR2–1412 (2.5 μg), Myc6-ACTR2–1022 (2.5 μg), or HA-p300 (2.5 μg) expression plasmid. 36 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 0.2 mm DTT and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads (Repligen), and inputs were removed (1–3%). Immunoprecipitations were done using anti-acetyllysine antibodies (rabbit antiserum 06–933, Upstate Biotechnology) or control anti-HA antibody (12CA5) followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitated proteins were removed from protein A beads by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.5% SDS and re-immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc (9E10) antibody. Subsequently, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and revealed by anti-Myc Western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitations—293T cells were transiently transfected with vectors for FLAG3-ER81 (1.5 μg) and 2.5 μg of full-length or various truncations of Myc6-ACTR and lysed in 2.5 mm Tris-HCl, 7.5 mm Na4P2O7, 12.5 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm NaF, and 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 7.1, supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 0.2 mm DTT. Precipitations were then performed with protein A-agarose beads (Repligen) and anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibodies, and coimmunoprecipitated ACTR proteins were detected by anti-Myc (9E10) Western blotting. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, anti-ER81 antibodies (anti-ETV1 C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control anti-GAL4 antibodies (DBD, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used followed by Western blotting with anti-ACTR antibodies (clone AX15, number 5-490, Upstate Biotechnology). Luciferase Assays—CV-1 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (45Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 1 μg of human MMP-1 promoter (-525 to +15) luciferase reporter plasmid was transfected with various combinations of the indicated mammalian expression plasmids. Whole cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity essentially as described previously (46Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1209-1216PubMed Google Scholar). SRCs Are Coactivators of the PEA3 Subfamily of ETS Proteins—To analyze whether the p160 family of SRCs can affect the function of the ETS protein ER81, we studied ER81-mediated gene transcription with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the promoter of the MMP-1 gene, an established target gene of ER81 (30Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 47Fuchs B. Inwards C.Y. Janknecht R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As reported earlier, ER81 alone induces the MMP-1 promoter by 6-fold (Fig. 1A). In contrast, none of the three SRCs (SRC-1, GRIP-1, and ACTR) alone was able to significantly stimulate the MMP-1 promoter, but when coexpressed with ER81, all three p160 coactivators potentiated ER81-mediated transcription by ∼9-fold, suggesting that p160 proteins are bona fide coactivators of ER81. To further prove that p160 proteins are coactivators of ER81, we examined their role in the activation of the endogenous MMP-1 gene (Fig. 1B). No MMP-1 expression was detectable by RT-PCR when ER81 or SRCs were expressed alone; however, SRC-1, GRIP-1, and ACTR were able to elicit MMP-1 mRNA production in the presence of ER81. As a control, GAPDH levels were found to be similar under all of the conditions tested. Also, the degree of MMP-1 activation by SRCs and ER81 was comparable to the one reported previously (37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) for ER81 and the coactivator p300 (Fig. 1B) that physically binds to ER81 and stimulates its function (48Papoutsopoulou S. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7300-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because ACTR is implicated in breast tumorigenesis (7Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar), as is ER81 (27de Launoit Y. Chotteau-Lelievre A. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. Netzer S. Brenner C. Huvent I. Baert J.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because among the three p160 SRCs ACTR seemingly had the greatest impact on the ER81-dependent activation of the endogenous MMP-1 gene, we elected to conduct further experiments primarily with ACTR. We were interested to study whether ACTR specifically coactivates ER81 or also other ETS proteins, particularly the ER81 homologous proteins PEA3 and ERM. As shown in Fig. 1C, the effect of ACTR on the activity of PEA3 and ERM was indistinguishable from ER81. In contrast, the ETS protein ER71, which was previously shown to activate the MMP-1 promoter (49De Haro L. Janknecht R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2972-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was not stimulated by ACTR. Furthermore, two other ETS proteins, the ternary complex factors Elk1 and Sap1a (50Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 51Sharrocks A.D. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), which on their own activated the MMP-1 promoter by ∼5-fold, were barely stimulated by ACTR. Accordingly, ACTR also synergized with PEA3 or ERM but not ER71, Elk1, or Sap1a to induce the endogenous MMP-1 gene (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that ACTR is a cofactor of not only ER81 but also of the related ETS proteins PEA3 and ERM. ER81 Forms Complexes with ACTR—Because ER81-mediated transcription of the MMP-1 gene was enhanced by ACTR, we investigated whether ACTR forms complexes with ER81. To this end, lysates from HeLa cells were challenged with no antibody, anti-GAL4 antibodies, or anti-ER81 antibodies. Resulting immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the presence of any coimmunoprecipitated ACTR probed by anti-ACTR Western blotting. Indeed, ACTR coimmunoprecipitated with ER81 (Fig. 2A), whereas no ACTR was detectable in mock and anti-GAL4 immunoprecipitates, indicating that ER81 and ACTR do interact in vivo. To further ascertain that ER81 interacts with ACTR, pull-down assays were performed with either GST or GST-ER81. As expected, ACTR specifically interacted with GST-ER81 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, two arginine methyltransferases, CARM1 and PRMT1, which bind to SRCs (52Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 53Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), did not interact with GST-ER81. Altogether, these results indicate that ER81 and ACTR can form complexes in vitro and in vivo. A Central Region of ER81 Interacts with the N terminus of ACTR—For localizing the ER81 interaction domain within ACTR, coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed utilizing 293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ER81 and various truncations of Myc-tagged ACTR. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the presence of ACTR was visualized by anti-Myc Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, full-length ACTR (ACTR2–1412), ACTR2–1022, and ACTR2–810 coimmunoprecipitated with ER81, whereas ACTR506–1412 and ACTR810–1412 did not. ACTR2–810 was further divided into ACTR2–457 and ACTR459–810, and both of these molecules did not bind to ER81 (Fig. 3A), indicating that the N-terminal 810 amino acids of ACTR are required for its interaction with ER81. To map the ER81 amino acids interacting with ACTR, GST pull-down assays were performed (Fig. 3B). Whole cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with Myc-tagged ACTR were incubated with GST or ER81 portions fused to GST, and bound ACTR was revealed by anti-Myc Western blotting. Similar to full-length ER81 (ER812–477), the C-terminal half of ER81 (amino acids 249–477) interacted with ACTR, whereas the N-terminal half of ER81 (amino acids 1–249) did not. Subdividing ER81249–477 indicated that ACTR interacted with ER81 amino acids 249–383 but not amino acids 383–477. Thus, a central region of ER81 consisting of parts of its negative regulatory and DNA binding domains but excluding any of its activation domains (see scheme of ER81 in Fig. 3B) interacts with ACTR. Acetylation of ER81 by ACTR—ER81 is functionally regulated through acetylation via the homologous coactivators p300 and CBP as well as another coactivator/acetyltransferase, P/CAF (37Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two members of the SRC family, SRC-1 and ACTR, are known to possess weak intrinsic HAT activity (3Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 39Spencer T.E.

Therefore, it was imperative to assess whether the ability of ACTR to coactivate ER81 also entails acetylation of ER81 by ACTR. First, we assessed whether ACTR could acetylate ER81 in vitro. To this end, because the HAT domain of ACTR resides between residues 1092 and 1292 (3Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), we used GST-ACTR1086–1292 and a similar region of GRIP-1 (amino acids 1158–1432) fused to GST as enzymes to acetylate histones and ER81. As reported previously (3Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), the HAT domain of ACTR selectively acetylated histones H3 and H4 (Fig. 4A). In addition, the HAT domain of ACTR acetylated ER81 (Fig. 4B). Similarly, GST-GRIP-11158–1432 acetylated histones H3 and H4 as well as ER81, which to our knowledge is the first demonstration that GRIP-1 possesses HAT activity. No acetylation of GST by either GRIP-1 or ACTR was observable (data not shown). Thus, ACTR and GRIP-1 are capable of acetylating ER81 in vitro. However, the degree of this in vitro acetylation of ER81 by SRCs was much less than acetylation mediated by p300 (Fig. 4B), indicating that ER81 may only be substoichiometrically and inefficiently acetylated by SRCs. To explore whether ACTR acetylates ER81 in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged ER81 and either full-length ACTR2–1412 or the C-terminal truncation ACTR2–1022. Immunoprecipitations then were done with either control anti-GAL4 antibodies or anti-acetyllysine antibodies, and the presence of any acetylated ER81 in the immunoprecipitates revealed by anti-Myc Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4C, coexpression of ACTR2–1412 and ER81 resulted in in vivo acetylation of ER81, whereas expression of ACTR1–1022 that is devoid of a HAT domain (3Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L.

Again, p300 proved to be significantly more efficient than ACTR in eliciting in vivo acetylation o"

The initial lesions in the switch (S) regions are processed and resolved, leading to a recombination of the two S regions involved. The mechanism involved in the repair and ligation of the broken DNA ends is however still unclear. Here, we describe that switching is less efficient in cells from patients with Mre11 deficiency (Ataxia-Telangiectasia-like disorder, ATLD) and, more importantly, that the switch recombination junctions resulting from the in vivo switching events are aberrant. There was a trend toward an increased usage of microhomology (≥4 bp) at the switch junctions in both ATLD and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) patients. However, the DNA ends were not joined as “perfectly” as those from Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) patients and 1–2 bp mutations or insertions were often observed. In switch junctions from ATLD patients, there were fewer base substitutions due to transitions and, most strikingly, the substitutions that occurred most often in controls, C → T transitions, never occurred at, or close to, the junctions derived from the ATLD patients. In switch junctions from NBS patients, all base substitutions were observed at the G/C nucleotides, and transitions were preferred. These data suggest that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex (Mre11 complex) is involved in the nonhomologous end joining pathway in CSR and that Mre11, Nbs1, and protein mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) might have both common and independent roles in this process.

Inst. 2001; 93: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). There are two general types of repair: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). The former includes gene conversion, break-induced replication, and single-strand annealing. The latter, which is also composed of several pathways, requires a set of proteins, including the DNA end-binding proteins Ku70 and Ku80, DNA ligase IV and its associated XRCC4 protein, and possibly, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex. Programmed changes in the genomic structure are essential for development of the immune system. During the early stages of T and B lymphocyte differentiation, V(D)J recombination takes place in order to assemble variable (V) exons of the T cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes respectively, giving rise to a large repertoire of lymphocytes. The V(D)J recombination is a site-specific event and is initiated by the lymphoid-specific RAG1 and RAG2 proteins (3Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 4Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). After activation of the B cells, their Ig genes undergo two types of DNA modification, class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), which further diversify the immune response. In CSR, the constant (C) region encoding gene of the μ heavy chain is replaced by a downstream CH gene, resulting in a change from IgM to IgG, IgE, or IgA production, without changing the specificity of the antibody. SHM, on the other hand, leads to accumulation of mutations in the V genes and, when coupled with selection, results in an increased affinity for the antigen. Recent studies have shown that in parallel to the crucial role of RAG proteins in V(D)J recombination, both CSR and SHM are initiated by a single differentiation-specific factor, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (5Muramatsu M.

Depending on which way the initial dU/dG mismatch is resolved, it will result in introduction of mutations in the V region genes (SHM) or recombination of the two switch (S) regions (CSR). These later stages, which include repair and ligation of the broken DNA ends, are still not well understood.

The Mre11 complex is a multisubunit nuclease composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1(p95)/Xrs2 (Nbs1 is the mammalian equivalent of Xrs2 in yeast).

We have previously shown that in cells from A-T patients, the switch recombination junctions are aberrant, with a significantly increased usage of microhomologies at the junctions and an altered pattern of SHM-like mutations in the Sμ region, where mutations are mainly due to transitions and biased to A or T nucleotides. The frequency and pattern of mutations in the V region is however largely normal, suggesting a role for ATM in CSR, but not in SHM (19Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Lähdesmäki A. Gregorek H.

We therefore performed a detailed analysis of breakpoints, resulting from in vivo switching from μ to α in cells from ATLD patients. We also studied SHM-like mutations in the Sμ regions in both ATLD and NBS patients. These data may help delineate the DSB repair pathways in CSR and SHM.

The amplification of Sμ-Sα fragments from in vivo switched cells was performed as described before (19Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Lähdesmäki A. Gregorek H. Chrzanowska K.H. Hammarström L. Eur. J.

Briefly, two pairs of Sμ- and Sα-specific primers were used in a nested PCR assay. The number of Sμ-Sα fragments was determined from 10 reactions run in parallel using DNA from each individual and represents random amplification of in vivo switched clones. Patient samples were always run at the same time as the control samples. In controls, only strong and distinct bands were counted as the weak bands might be due to nonspecific amplification. In patients, the amplification normally resulted in fewer and weaker bands, and all the distinct bands were counted. A human IgA1-producing cell line (313) was used to assess the fidelity of the nested PCR reaction and the PCR error rate was 0.9/1,000 nucleotides (41Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Dai S.J. Huang P. Morton H.C. Brandtzaeg P. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 32Google Scholar). The Sμ-Sγ fragments were amplified as described previously (42Pan Q. Rabbani H. Mills F.C. Severinson E. Hammarström L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5849-5859PubMed Google Scholar, 43Pan Q. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2779-2787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A long PCR kit (Expand™ Long Template PCR System kit, Roche Applied Science) was employed to amplify the full-length germline Sμ region. This system utilizes an enzyme mixture containing TaqDNA polymerase and a proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase. The PCR error rate was estimated to be 0.2/1,000 nucleotides (20Pan-Hammarström Q. Dai S.

Sμ-specific primers Hu-SμLs (5′-GGGGACCTGCTCATTTTTATCACA) and Hu-SμLas (5′-GAGGACCCGCAGGACAAAAGAGAA) were chosen from the region flanking the Sμ repetitive sequences. Amplification was first performed in 10 cycles, where each cycle consisted of 92 °C 10 s, 64 °C 30 s, and 68 °C 4 min, and subsequently in 20 cycles, with the same conditions except that the elongation time was extended for 10 s for each new cycle. PCR products (4.4 kb) were gel purified and subsequently used for direct sequencing. The sequencing primer Sμ5 is located 235 bp downstream of the Hu-SμLs primer. The first 500 bp of the sequence was analyzed, covering the region where most of the Sμ-Sα breakpoints were located. Analysis of the Sμ-Sα Junctions—The PCR amplified Sμ-Sα fragments were gel purified, cloned and sequenced as described previously (19Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Lähdesmäki A. Gregorek H. Chrzanowska K.H. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Sμ-Sα breakpoints were determined by aligning the S fragment sequences with both the Sμ (44Sun Z.J. Kitchingman G.R. DNA. Seq. 1991; 1: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and Sα1 (45Islam K.B. Baskin B. Nilsson L. Hammarström L. Sideras P. Smith C.I. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1442-1452PubMed Google Scholar) or Sα2 (41Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Dai S.J. Huang P. Morton H.C. Brandtzaeg P. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 32Google Scholar) sequences. Perfectly matched short homology was defined as successive nucleotides that were shared by both the Sμ and Sα regions at the S junction (without mismatches). The term imperfect repeat was used when mismatches were allowed on either side of the breakpoint. Microhomology includes both the perfectly matched sequence homology and imperfect repeat. Insertion was defined as a nucleotide at the breakpoints that was not identical to either of the S regions. Mutation was defined as a nucleotide change within 15 bp on either side of the S junction. Polymorphisms in the switch regions were excluded from the mutation analysis. Reduced Frequency of Switching in Cells from ATLD Patients—The serum IgM, IgA, IgG, and IgG subclass levels were measured in the four ATLD patients, and no major abnormality was found (Table I and data not shown). However, the level of IgG3 was low in ATLD3 and 4 (0.17 g/liter and <0.05 g/liter, respectively), and the level of IgG2 was in the lower, age-matched, normal control range in ATLD1 and 2. The level of IgG4 was below the detection limit in both ATLD1 and 2. Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood cells from ATLD patients and healthy blood donors (n = 17, where 7 were run in parallel with the ATLD patient samples and 10 were run in parallel with the A-T and NBS patient samples). The DNA samples were subjected to nested PCR in order to amplify in vivo generated μ-α switch fragments. The numbers of μ-α switch fragments was determined from ten PCR reactions run in parallel using DNA from each individual and can be used as an estimation of the in vivo switch frequency (41Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Dai S.J. Huang P. Morton H.C. Brandtzaeg P. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 32Google Scholar). Due to the polyclonal rearrangement at the Sμ/Sα region, different sizes of switch fragments are amplified and visualized. In controls, single or multiple bands were visualized and the intensity of the bands were usually rather strong, whereas in patients, switch fragments could be amplified only in some of the lanes and some of the bands were rather weak. A typical run is shown in Fig. 1A. At least 11 distinct Sμ-Sα fragments were amplified from the control, whereas only few fragments were generated from the ATLD patients (1, 5, 2, and 3, respectively, for ATLD1, -2, -3, and -4). The experiments were repeated independently for additional three times in order to confirm the above finding and also to obtain a sufficient number of switch junctions for further analysis. As shown in Table I and Fig. 1B, the average numbers of μ-α switch fragments generated from each ATLD patient from four experiments ranged from 4.0 to 5.3 with an average of 4.4, which is significantly lower than the corresponding numbers in controls (7 to 15, average 11.8) (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In the NBS patients, the corresponding numbers were 0–8, with an average of 1.8 (Fig. 1B and Ref. 19Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Lähdesmäki A. Gregorek H. Chrzanowska K.H. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the number of clones switching to IgA appears to be reduced in ATLD patients, although not as markedly as in the NBS patients. As the level of IgG3 was lower in ATLD3 and 4, we also estimated the level of switching to IgG3 in all four patients. The number of Sμ-Sγ3 fragments in ATLD1 was comparatively normal (10 versus 12.7 in controls), however the numbers in ATLD2 and -3 were lower than the controls (3 and 6, respectively). We could only amplify one Sμ-Sγ3 fragment from ATLD4 in ten PCR reactions, which correlated to the very low level of IgG3 in this patient. Based on the sequences of the Sμ-Sγ3 fragments from these patients, ATLD3 and 4 carry the G3m(g) allotype markers in their Sγ3 regions, which is known to be associated with a reduced frequency of switching to IgG3 (42Pan Q. Rabbani H. Mills F.C. Severinson E. Hammarström L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5849-5859PubMed Google Scholar, 46Pan Q. Lindersson Y. Sideras P. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2920-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sμ-Sα Recombination Junctions in ATLD Patients—We subsequently cloned and sequenced 48 switch fragments (47 Sμ-Sα and 1 Sμ-Sγ-Sα) from the ATLD patients and 39 switch fragments (all Sμ-Sα) from normal controls, generated in the above PCR reactions. All the switch fragment sequences were unique and therefore represent independent switch recombination events. The sequences of all the Sμ-Sα junctions are available at www.biosci.ki.se/users/qipa/switch-junctions2.pdf. The switch junctions from the 7 controls included are similar to those from our previous experiments (19Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Lähdesmäki A. Gregorek H. Chrzanowska K.H. Hammarström L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in all respects analyzed. The new control data (n = 39) were therefore summarized together with the previous data (n = 115) and used for comparison with the different patient groups. The junctional sequences from the previously investigated A-T and NBS patients were also re-analyzed to ensure that the same standard was applied in all patient groups. Switching to α1 occurred more often than to α2 both in ATLD patients and normal controls. However, the percentage of α1 switching was slightly lower in ATLD patients (57 versus 66%). Nine percent of Sμ-Sα junctions from ATLD patients showed additional intra-switch region recombination in the Sμ sequences. This number was higher than the NBS (7%) and A-T patients (2%) and was lower than the controls (14%); however, there was no significant difference between the respective patient groups and controls. Similar frequency of intra-Sα region recombination was found in Sμ-Sα fragments from ATLD, NBS patients and controls (13, 13, and 11%, respectively), however a much lower rate was again observed in Sμ-Sα fragments from the A-T patients (2%). Thus, ATM, but not the Mre11 complex, is probably involved in CSR-induced internal recombination within the Sμ and Sα regions. The distribution of Sμ-Sα breakpoints in ATLD patients is shifted toward the more 3′ part of Sμ and the 5′-part of Sα1 or Sα2 (Fig. 2); this may reflect a shift toward increased donor/acceptor homology. Indeed, significantly more Sμ breakpoints from ATLD patients (57 versus 33% in controls) were located in the part of Sμ region that shows the highest degree of homology with Sα1 or Sα2 (position 275–760 in Sμ; position 275 was marked with a vertical line in Fig. 2) (χ2 test, p < 0.001). Breakpoints from NBS and A-T patients showed a similar shift toward this part of Sμ region (Fig. 2; χ2 test, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). The distribution of the Sμ-Sα breakpoints therefore suggests an increased dependence on donor/acceptor homology in the switch junctions from all three groups of patients; however, the actual usage of microhomology still depends on the local sequences at the switch junctions. We next analyzed the microhomology usage at the switch junctions. There was a clear trend toward an increased usage of perfectly-matched short sequence homologies (≥4 bp) in both NBS and ATLD patients, although not to a statistically significant degree (Table II and Fig. 3A). However, the DNA ends with sequence homologies from these patients were not joined as “perfectly” as those from A-T patients and 1–2-bp mutations or insertions were often observed at the switch junctions. Thus, when more re"

Here we show the following. 1) uPA expression was effectively stimulated by TGF-β1 in HRA cells. 2) Antisense (AS)-matriptase transfection achieved a marked inhibition of receptor-bound pro-uPA activation without altering expression of uPA and uPA receptor mRNA and proteins, irrespective of whether cells were stimulated with TGF-β1. 3) Tumor cell receptor-bound pro-uPA could be efficiently cleaved by matriptase to generate enzymatically active two-chain uPA. Thus, matriptase can substitute for plasmin in the proteolytic activation of pro-uPA to enzymatically active uPA. 4) The AS-matriptase-treated cells had a decreased ability to invade an extracellular matrix layer, as compared with control cells. 5) When the AS-matriptase-treated cells were injected intraperitoneally into nude mice, the mice developed smaller tumors.

Trans. 2002; 30: 207-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Muehlenweg B. Sperl S. Magdolen V. Schmitt M. Harbeck N. Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 2001; 1: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have indicated that increased levels of uPA correlate with the invasive properties of certain tumor cell types. A specific receptor for uPA, uPAR, forms a complex with both the inactive and active forms of uPA (5Ploug M. Gardsvoll H. Jorgensen T.J. Hansen Lonborg L. Dano K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 177-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-bound uPA can be activated on the cell surface. uPA binding to uPAR could enhance cellular invasiveness. Bikunin is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor and a heavily glycosylated protein (6Kobayashi H. Hum. Cell. 2001; 14: 233-236PubMed Google Scholar). This protein inhibits trypsin and plasmin. In our previous experiments, cellular expression of several proteins known to be involved in invasion and metastasis, including uPA and uPAR, were significantly suppressed by exogenously added bikunin (7Suzuki M.

Furthermore, transfection of highly invasive human ovarian cancer cell line HRA with the bikunin gene reduced the expression of uPA and uPAR and diminished cellular invasiveness (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Current investigations have focused on understanding the molecular mechanism(s) by which bikunin down-regulates uPA and uPAR expression both in vitro and in vivo and controls invasiveness and tumor growth in HRA cells (12Kobayashi H.

We also found that several highly metastatic, transformed cells synthesize lower levels of bikunin compared with non-tumorigenic cells. 2Y. Hirashima and H. Kobayashi, unpublished observations. In addition, we showed that there is a direct correlation between bikunin overexpression and the reduced metastatic potential of primary tumor biopsies and tumor cell lines, as reflected by their in vitro potential to invade through a Matrigel barrier (16Tanaka Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Suzuki M. Yamakawa T. Morishita H. Terao T. Cancer. 2003; 98: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this invading model system, we have also shown that bikunin is part of the negative invasive program, as evaluated by invasion and uPA/uPAR synthesis. For identifying the full repertoire of bikunin-regulated genes, we recently conducted a cDNA microarray hybridization screening, using mRNA from bikunin-treated or bikunin-transfected HRA cells (15Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14640-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A number of bikunin-regulated genes were identified (15Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14640-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This screen identified suppression of several genes, such as CDC-like kinase, LIM domain binding, Ets domain transcription factor, Rho GTPase-activating protein, tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase, hyaluronan-binding protein, matriptase (also known as suppression of tumorigenicity 14, epithin, and membrane-type serine protease-1), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which have been implicated previously in enhancing tumor promotion. These results show that bikunin alters the expression pattern of several genes in HRA cells leading to a block in cell invasion. Interestingly, Northern blot analysis confirmed that matriptase was markedly down-regulated by bikunin. Therefore, matriptase is considered to be an important bikunin target gene (15Suzuki M.

Matriptase, a type II membrane serine protease (17Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), may play important roles in cell migration and tumor cell metastasis (18Lee S.L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. J.

It has a multidomain structure, containing a putative amino-terminal transmembrane region, a sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin (SEA) domain, two complement subcomponents C1r/C1s, urchin embryonic growth factor, and bone morphogenic protein (CUB) domains, four low density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal serine protease domain (20Lin C.Y.

Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Matriptase can convert hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor to its active form, which can activate c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation (18Lee S.L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and enzymatically inactive single-chain uPA (pro-uPA) were identified as substrates of matriptase (18Lee S.L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 19Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The identification of these molecules as putative in vivo substrates suggests that matriptase regulates the functions mediated by PAR2, such as the inflammatory response or cell adhesion, and by uPA, such as tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The expression of this protease is associated with a more invasive phenotype (24Oberst M.D. Johnson M.D. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Singh B. Stewart M. Williams A. al-Nafussi A. Smyth J.F. Gabra H. Sellar G.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1101-1107PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, studies with matriptase suggest that the protease may play important roles in cell migration as well as cancer invasion and metastasis. There are no data indicating whether matriptase can activate receptor-bound pro-uPA on the surface of tumor cells. To clarify how reduced levels of matriptase may confer repressed invasiveness, we transiently transfected HRA cells with antisense (AS)-matriptase, and we compared the properties of the transfected clones to those of parental HRA cells and stable bikunin transfectants. Materials—Purified human bikunin was obtained from Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. (Gotenba, Japan). LipofectAMINE Plus reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. The antibodies against uPA (3689 (recognizes uPA B-chain) and 3471 (reacts with uPA A-chain; interferes with binding of uPA to its receptor)), PAI-1 (379 (recognizes all forms of PAI-1 and its complexes and neutralizes PAI-1 inhibition)), uPAR (3932 (equally reactive with occupied and unoccupied uPAR) and 3936 (interferes with receptor binding)), and plasmin (3641, which does not affect plasmin activity, and 3644, which competitively inhibits plasmin activity), the chromogenic substrate of urokinase, Spectrozyme UK (carbobenzoxy-l-glutamyl-(α-t-butoxyl)-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide diacetate salt), Glu-plasminogen, plasmin, single-chain uPA (pro-uPA), and high molecular weight two-chain uPA were obtained from Dr. R. Hart (American Diagnostics, Greenwich, CT). A monoclonal antibody, M32, is directed against matriptase (25Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Anti-human cathepsins B and L antibodies were purchased from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA) or CosmoBio (Tokyo, Japan). Boyden-type cell invasion chambers (BioCoat Matrigel™ invasion chambers) were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Ultrapure natural human TGF-β1 was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The nude mice (Balb-c, nu/nu) were obtained from SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). Culture media, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Tissue culture plastics were purchased from Costar/Corning (Cambridge, MA) and Falcon (BD Biosciences). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Tris base, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and ammonium persulfate were commercially obtained from Sigma. Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane were from Bio-Rad. X-ray film was purchased from Eastman Kodak. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and carrier-free Na125I were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. MTT assay kit was purchased from Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA. All other chemicals were analytical grade. Cell Culture—The ovarian cancer cell line, HRA, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a5%CO2 atmosphere with constant humidity (10Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 7790-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For all experiments in which TGF-β1 was added, cells were incubated in the serum-free medium. Total RNA isolations were done using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The protein concentrations in the supernatants of cell extracts were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Preparation of Conditioned Medium and Cell Lysate—For the preparation of conditioned medium, subconfluent cultures of ovarian cancer cell clones were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. The conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged to remove cell debris, filtered, lyophilized, concentrated, and stored at –80 °C until needed. In general, the supernatants concentrated 10-fold were used for zymography and Western blot. The cell monolayers treated with or without various agents for indicated times were washed with PBS. 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 15 min and scraped with a rubber policeman. Cell extracts were then centrifuged at 3,000 × g to remove cell debris. All samples were stored at –80 °C until use. In parallel, cells treated in the same condition in different dishes were harvested and counted using a hemocytometer. Northern Blot Hybridization with cDNA Probes—Northern blot hybridization was carried out as described previously (9Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1.2% agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon or nitrocellulose membranes using standard molecular biological techniques. Hybridization was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming to specific activities of 0.4–0.9 × 109 cpm/μg. The following cDNA sequences were used as probes: the full-length matriptase cDNA (pcDNA3/matriptase) ligated into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (26Cho E.G.

Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Filters were reprobed with the cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to correct for the amount of RNA loaded onto the filters (9Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Kobayashi H. Hirashima Y. Sun G.W. Fujie M. Shibata K. Tamotsu S. Miura K. Sugino D. Tanaka Y. Kondo S. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed on Kodak BioMax MS-1 film at –70 °C. Filters were quantitated by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Rad model 620Video Densitometer with one-dimensional Analyst software package for Macintosh. Bikunin Transfection—The bikunin expression vector pCMV-bikunin-IRES-bsr (bik+) and the control vector pCMV-luciferase-IRES-bsr encoding luciferase (luc+) were transfected into HRA cells by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bik+ clones (clones 1–5) with inducible bikunin protein expression were confirmed by immunocytochemical staining and Western blot analysis. Bik+ clone 1 produces the highest concentration of bikunin protein, and clone 1 was mainly used throughout this study. Uninduced parental HRA cells or Luc+ cells were used as a control (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antisense Matriptase Oligodeoxynucleotides and Cell Transfection— Antisense 18-base phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides, corresponding to the human matriptase mRNA, were synthesized and consisted of the antisense sequences of 5′-AGC TGC TCA TCC TAG GCA-3′ (AS-matriptase) (15Suzuki M.

Oligonucleotides mixed with Lipofectin reagent were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the oligonucleotides-liposome complexes were then added to cells and washed twice with medium (31Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4387) Google Scholar). After 4 h, fresh normal growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. The AS-matriptase clones were used for ECM invasion and in vivo metastatic experiments, as described below. Antisense uPA cDNA Transfection—A 1020-bp PstI and EcoRI digest cDNA fragment of uPA was blunt-ended and cloned in antisense orientation in a HindIII cut phβAPr-1-neo eukaryotic expression vector (32Mohanam S. Jasti S.L. Kondraganti S.R. Chandrasekar N. Kin Y. Fuller G.N. Lakka S.S. Kyritsis A.P. Dinh D.H. Olivero W.C. Gujrati M. Yung W.K.A. Rao J.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2519-2526PubMed Google Scholar). The HRA cells were transfected with antisense uPA cDNA-containing vector (AS-uPA) or empty vector, using Lipofectin, as described (33Morrissey D. O'Connell J. Lynch D. O'Sullivan G.C. Shanahan F. Collins J.K. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Haeckel C. Krueger S. Roessner A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. uPA cDNA Transfection—The HRA cells were transfected with the expression plasmid pcUKLTR6, containing a human full-length uPA cDNA construct, and the plasmid pSVneo, encoding the neomycin resistance gene (33Morrissey D. O'Connell J. Lynch D. O'Sullivan G.C. Shanahan F. Collins J.K. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jarrard D.F. Hansen N.M. Patai B. Rukstalis D.B. Invasion Metastasis. 1995; 15: 34-45PubMed Google Scholar). The uPA expression plasmid contains a 1300-bp SmaI-SmaI fragment containing the enhancer-promoter element and the start of transcription from the Harvey sarcoma virus 5′-long terminal repeat. A separate transfection with expression plasmid pSVneo was performed in the HRA cell line to serve as a control. Cell Surface Receptor Binding—Pro-uPA and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP)-treated high molecular weight (HMW)-uPA (150 μg/100 μl) were each radiolabeled with 1 mCi of Na125I in the presence of 10 μg of chloramine T and 0.15 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), and after adding 83 μg of sodium metabisulfite were purified on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with 0.2% BSA in PBS (33Morrissey D. O'Connell J. Lynch D. O'Sullivan G.C. Shanahan F. Collins J.K. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activities were typically 3.0–4.1 μCi/μg. For binding studies, 200-μl aliquots of 5 × 105 acid-treated cells in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA plus 0.2% sodium azide) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-DFP-uPA in the presence or absence of an excess (up to 1000-fold) of HMW-uPA. After 2 h at 4 °C, the cells were washed by centrifugation twice with cold binding buffer and counted. For displacement assays, 200-μl aliquots of 5 × 105 cells in binding buffer were treated with 1.0 nm125I-DFP-uPA and differing concentrations of competitors (HMW-uPA, LMW-uPA, and amino-terminal fragment (ATF)). After 2 h, the cells were washed, and the bound radiolabel was quantitated by dissolving cells in NaOH. Specific binding was quantified using a multiwell γ-counter. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cultured cells were harvested and washed with binding buffer. Because uPAR is trypsin-sensitive, cells were treated with hyaluronidase and used for further experiments. A single cell suspension (106/ml) was incubated with affinity-purified antibodies or isotype control antibodies on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with binding buffer, and 2 μl of the primary antibody (3689 (uPA), 379 (PAI-1), and 3932 (uPAR)) and 3 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody (Dako) were added for 1 h on ice, respectively. Cells were analyzed in a FACScan (BD Biosciences). At least 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample in all experiments. Quantitation of uPA Level, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay— The amount of uPA was measured in the cell-conditioned medium and in the cell lysate using the Imubind uPA ELISA kit from American Diagnostics Inc. Lower detection levels were set at 10 pg/ml. The uPA assay measured all forms of uPA and its complexes. Measurement of uPA Amidolytic Activity—The amidolytic activity of plasma membrane-bound uPA was monitored by the release of p-nitroaniline from Spectrozyme UK, measured by the rate of change in light absorbance at 405 nm as described (36Higazi A.A. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. The amidolytic activity induced by the binding of pro-uPA to its receptor was determined on cell surfaces. Confluent cultures of cells grown in 96-well tissue culture plates were washed twice with PBS, incubated for 5 min with glycine buffer (pH 3), to elute endogenous uPA, and washed two additional times. The cells incubated with 10 nm scuPA for 3 h at 4 °C were washed and then incubated with PBS containing 300 μm Spectrozyme UK and 1 μm Glu-plasminogen in the presence and the absence of 10 μg/ml anti-plasmin antibodies (3641 or 3644) or nonimmune IgG for 2 h at 37 °C, and the A405 was determined. Western Blot Analysis—Conditioned media and centrifuged cell lysates (50 μg) from each cell line were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 2% BSA. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: monoclonal anti-uPA (3471 plus 3689) (each 1:500), anti-matriptase antibody (1:2000), anticathepsin B antibody (1:200), and anti-cathepsin L antibody (1:500). This was followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) at a dilution of 1:50,000 for 1 h. Detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Zymographic Analysis—Plasminogen activator activities were qualitatively analyzed by fibrin zymography or casein film fibrinolysis assay. SDS-PAGE zymographic analysis was performed using copolymerized plasminogen-rich fibrinogen. Equal volumes (20 μl) of 10× concentrated conditioned medium were mixed with 4× nonreducing buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% SDS, 4% sucrose, and 0.4% Coomassie Blue) for 30 min at 25 °C. Each sample was then subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated in buffer containing 2.5% Triton X-100 (twice for 30 min at room temperature), rinsed in distilled water, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 15 mm CaCl2. Cleavage of Receptor-bound Pro-uPA—Unstimulated and TGF-β1-stimulated cells were washed twice with PBS containing BSA and 1000 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml of Trasylol (pH 7.4), followed by two washes in PBS/BSA. Subsequently, 1.0 × 107 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/BSA in the presence of 5 nm125I-pro-uPA and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed in PBS/BSA and then incubated for 80 min at 37 °C in PBS/BSA. The reaction was stopped by washing with cold PBS twice and then treated with 50 mm glycine HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 3.0 (acidic buffer). The supernatants were obtained by centrifugation and immediately adjusted to pH 7.4. The supernatants were concentrated, dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol, and then boiled for 3 min. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane and visualized using a PhosphorImager. MTT Assay for Cell Proliferation—Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. The following day, the medium was changed to regular medium. Viable cells were measured using the quantitative colorimetric MTT assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.

A novel interaction of proteins is demonstrated in this report. Yeast two-hybrid screening using PRC1 (protein-regulating cytokinesis 1) cDNA, a human mitotic spindle-associated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrate, which is involved in cytokinesis, as bait was performed. Data show that the PRC1 bait bound to MgcRacGAP, which is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Rho family GTPases also involved in cytokinesis. In addition, the two proteins showed similar localization during the M phase. PRC1 was shown to bind to the COOH-terminal GAP-conserved domain of MgcRacGAP and to inhibit its GAP activity toward Cdc42. This binding and/or inhibition of MgcRacGAP GAP activity was found to depend on further binding of PRC1 to the basic region (125–285 amino acids) of MgcRacGAP. Furthermore, the basic region was phosphorylated with Aurora B kinase, and this phosphorylation prevented the inhibition of GAP activity by PRC1. Cells overexpressing a phosphorylation mimic mutant of MgcRacGAP exhibited an abnormality of spindle morphology in the metaphase. Cdc42 showed high activity and was localized to the mitotic spindles and centrosomes during the metaphase. We propose that PRC1 down-regulates the GAP activity of MgcRac-GAP during the metaphase and thereby contributes to the correct formation of the spindle.

Cytoskeletons, such as those comprising actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, help shape different cells, modulate cell motility, and organize various intracellular components in all eukaryotes. During the M phase, the dynamics of these cytoskeletons are one of the crucial factors for cells for accurate mitosis and cytokinesis. For example, the actin cytoskeleton, with myosin II, transiently constitutes the device called the contractile ring that divides the cytoplasm between two daughter cells (2Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the microtubule cytoskeleton forms large arrays termed mitotic spindles that segregate condensed chromosomes and forms the central spindle during the anaphase for successful cytokinesis (1Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. Cell. 1996; 84: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Mammalian Rho family small GTPases (including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) are required for many actin cytoskeleton-dependent cellular processes, including cytokinesis, and RhoA has been suggested to play a crucial role in the regulation of cell cleavage in mammalian cells (3O'Connell C.B.

Active RhoA activates downstream effectors, such as ROCK/ROK/Rho kinase, citron kinase, and mDia/formin, which then promote actin polymerization and F-actin organization, stimulate myosin II activity, and promote the assembly and contraction of actomyosin filaments (3O'Connell C.B.

Based on the results of studies involving a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42, it has also been suggested that Cdc42 is involved in the M phase (12Dutartre H. Davoust J. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 367-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mitotic events in which Cdc42 is involved have not yet been determined. Recent data suggest that Rho family GTPases not only control actin cytoskeleton remodeling but also regulate microtubule cytoskeleton stabilization (13Daub H. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Sobel A.

Rho family GTPases cycle between GDP-bound forms (inactive) and GTP-bound forms (active), and upstream factors that regulate this cycle comprise two classes of proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PRC1, protein-regulating cytokinesis 1; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; B.R., basic region; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; GAPD, GAP domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PRC1, protein-regulating cytokinesis 1; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; B.R., basic region; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; GAPD, GAP domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (16Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). These regulatory factors have been reported to be proteins involved in cytokinesis, ECT2, acting as a RhoGEF, and MgcRacGAP, acting as a RhoGAP. These proteins are localized to the midbody during cytokinesis and are therefore involved in this process (4Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Funct. 2001; 26: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Probably, the ECT2 GEF activity is required for Rho GTPase activation and ring formation, whereas the MgcRacGAP GAP activity induces Rho GTPase inactivation and ring disappearance. Moreover, studies have shown that the ECT2 GEF activity is regulated through its phosphorylation during mitosis, which results in an increase in activity, and by the NH2-terminal region of ECT2 itself, which acts as an inhibitor (4Kimura K.

J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In regards to MgcRac-GAP, although its GAP activity toward RhoA may be essential for completion of cytokinesis, it has been reported that the in vitro targets of MgcRacGAP are Cdc42 and Rac1 and that MgcRacGAP exhibited no (or very weak) GAP activity toward RhoA (20Toure A.

Kaneko A. Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent study (22Minoshima Y. Kawashima T. Hirose K. Tonozuka Y. Kawajiri A. Bao Y.C. Deng X. Tatsuka M. Narumiya S. May W.S. Nosaka T. Semba K. Inoue T. Satoh T. Inagaki M. Kitamura T. Dev.

In turn MgcRacGAP was seen to act as a RhoGAP (22Minoshima Y. Kawashima T. Hirose K. Tonozuka Y. Kawajiri A. Bao Y.C. Deng X. Tatsuka M. Narumiya S. May W.S. Nosaka T. Semba K. Inoue T. Satoh T.

However, how GAP activity of MgcRacGAP toward Cdc42 or Rac1 is regulated while cells are undergoing mitosis remains unclear. PRC1 (protein-regulating cytokinesis 1), which is a human mitotic spindle-associated CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) substrate, has also been known to be involved in central spindle formation and cytokinesis like MgcRacGAP and Aurora B (2Glotzer M.

However, PRC1 the one or more functions during early mitosis remain unknown (e.g. the significance of PRC1 being localized to the mitotic spindle in the metaphase). In this regard, on comparison of the cellular localization of PRC1 and MgcRac-GAP, these proteins showed similar patterns during the M phase, including the metaphase (18Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Jiang W. Jimenez G. Wells N.J. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. Hunter T.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar); accordingly, there is the possibility that these two proteins associate with each other during early mitosis. Here, we report that MgcRacGAP was identified as a protein that interacts with PRC1 on yeast two-hybrid screening, as well as a novel regulatory mechanism of MgcRacGAP GAP activity by PRC1. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening System—Bait for two-hybrid screening was obtained by cloning of the complete coding sequence of human PRC1 by RT-PCR and subcloning into the pGBT9 vector, which yielded a fusion with the GAL4-DNA binding domain. A mouse lymphoma cDNA library, cloned into pACT (Clontech), was screened for PRC1-binding proteins in a S. cerevisiae reporter strain, Y190. Yeast cultures and two-hybrid procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Library plasmids from transformed yeast colonies were recovered using Escherichia coli HB101 as the recipient strain and selected on M9 minimum medium. cDNA inserts from clones interacting specifically with PRC1 were sequenced with an ABI PRISM 3100 automated sequencer, and a BLAST algorithm was used to search for homology with known GenBank™ sequences. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Human PRC1, MgcRacGAP, Cdc42, and Aurora B cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. GST fusion and hexa-His fusion proteins were expressed in a baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and TALON™ Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech), respectively. GST-Cdc42 was expressed in E. coli (DH5α) using a pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). The deletion constructs of MgcRacGAP (ΔMyo-, ΔCys-, and ΔGAP-) were prepared by PCR as described previously (21Kawashima T. Hirose K. Satoh T. Kaneko A. Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as GST fusion proteins in Sf-9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. ΔB.R.-MgcRacGAP was prepared by PvuII digestion of MgcRacGAP cDNA, separation of the fragments, and self-ligation of the large fragment. The MgcRacGAP GAP domain (GST-GAPD; C-terminal 275 amino acids) was constructed by PCR and expressed in E. coli (DH5α) using the pGEX vector. The kinase-deficient mutant Aurora B (K106M) and Ala and Asp mutants of MgcRacGAP were constructed by PCR mutation. The MgcRacGAP basic regions (GST-B.R.) were prepared by PvuII digestion of MgcRacGAP cDNA and separation of the fragments, and expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3)pLys) using the pGEX vector. Cell Culture, Cell Cycle Synchronization, and Transfection—HeLa S3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum. HeLa S3 cells were synchronized in the S phase by a double-thymidine block method, as described previously (4Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17233-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To arrest cells in the prometaphase, nocodazole (30 ng/ml, final concentration) was added 6 h after the release of cells from the double-thymidine block, and mitotic cells were collected by the shakeoff procedure 6 h later. The collected cells were then released from the nocodazole arrest into a fresh medium. At 0, 45, 90, and 180 min after release, cells were harvested and subjected to analyses. In indicated experiments (Figs. 1, 2, 5, and 6), cells were transfected with each plasmid using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) during the second thymidine block.Fig. 2Interaction between PRC1 and MgcRacGAP.A, binding of PRC1 and MgcRacGAP in vitro.

Alexa Fluor™ 594-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes; 1/100 dilution), or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Dako; 1/100 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope LSC101 (Olympus). In Vitro Binding Assays—The purified GST wild-type or mutant MgcRacGAPs were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with purified His-PRC1 in 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA in a final volume of 50 μl, and then pulled down using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed four times with the above buffer containing 0.2 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and the retained proteins were eluted with an SDS-PAGE sample buffer then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with monoclonal anti-penta-His antibodies (Qiagen), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Dako), and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, to obtain the phosphorylated form of a purified GST-MgcRac-GAP, the phosphorylation reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C with the purified His wild-type or kinase-deficient Aurora B (K106M) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm ATP, in a final volume of 50 μl. Immunoprecipitation—Synchronized HeLa S3 cells were lysed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm DTT, 1× Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1% Nonidet P-40. The lysates were diluted with an equal volume of the same buffer without NaCl and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-PRC1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatants were further incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the retained proteins were eluted with an SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, probing sequentially with monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) and polyclonal anti-PRC1 antibodies. In Vitro GTP Hydrolysis Assays—GTPase activity was measured by means of a nitrocellulose filtration assay, as described previously (28Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of GST-Cdc42 were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 10-7m [γ-32P]GTP (250 μCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Science Products) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 40 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, in a total volume of 50 μl, and the exchange reaction was stopped with the addition of MgCl2 (10 mm, final concentration). An 8-μl sample of the GST-Cdc42 [γ-32P]GTP complex was added to 12 μl of an exchange buffer (1 mm non-labeled GTP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 50 or 100 nm purified GST-MgcRac-GAP GAP domain (GST-GAPD), GST-MgcRacGAP wild-type or a mutant (ΔB.R.- or 5D), or Aurora B-phosphorylated GST-MgcRacGAP alone or together with several concentrations of GST-PRC1. Then the mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 25 °C. Samples (3/4 vol.) were then removed and filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell), which were washed twice with an ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2), and the remaining amounts of [γ-32P]GTP on the filters were measured by scintillation counting. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—The purified GST wild-type or mutant MgcRacGAPs were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with purified GST-Aurora B in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 4.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 mm non-labeled ATP, in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were then stopped with the addition of an SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphate incorporation was determined by autoradiography. GTP-Cdc42 Pull-down Assays—Synchronized HeLa S3 cells were lysed in 200 μl of a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1× Protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were added to 400 μl of a binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and 1× Protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free). Cell lysates containing 800 μg of total protein were incubated with 20 μg of the GST-CRIB fusion conjugated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was then washed three times with 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT, and the retained proteins were eluted with an SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, probing with monoclonal anti-Cdc42 antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories). MgcRacGAP Is a Novel Binding Partner of PRC1—To identify the proteins binding to PRC1, we screened a mouse lymphoma cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system with the full-length human PRC1 coding sequence as bait. Among the 1.8 × 106 clones screened, twelve positive ones were identified, three of which were coded for MgcRacGAP, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases (20Toure A. Dorseuil O.

Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because MgcRacGAP, like PRC1, has been reported to be involved in cytokinesis (18Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we studied its interaction with PRC1 in detail. First, we examined the cellular localization of endogenous PRC1 and GFP-tagged MgcRacGAP by means of fluorescence microscopy in cells synchronized in the M phase (Fig. 1). Endogenous MgcRacGAP could not be detected, because we failed to produce antibodies against human MgcRacGAP. However, there is no difference exists between the localization that this GFP fusion protein showed here and that of endogenous MgcRacGAP reported previously (18Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Endogenous PRC1 and GFP-MgcRacGAP were localized in the nucleus during the interphase. During the metaphase, both proteins accumulated in the mitotic spindle, but during the anaphase and telophase, both were concentrated in the central region between the separating chromosomes. As the cells underwent cytokinesis, GFP-MgcRacGAP was concentrated in the midbody. According to previous studies, PRC1 should only be localized in the midbody (23Jiang W. Jimenez G. Wells N.J. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. Hunter T. Fukunaga R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mollinari C. Kleman J.P. Jiang W. Schoehn G. Hunter T. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), but in our study, it was found in not only the midbody but also the intercellular bridge; this may have been due to differences in antibodies used. In any case, we found that these two proteins showed similar localizations during the M phase. Next, full-length human PRC1 and MgcRacGAP were expressed as hexa-His or GST fusion proteins in a baculovirus expression system and GST pull-down assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, His-PRC1 was co-precipitated with GST-MgcRacGAP (left panel) and His-MgcRacGAP with GST-PRC1 (right panel). To determine whether or not these proteins interacted in cells, HeLa S3 cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding 3× FLAG-MgcRacGAP and were synchronized in the M phase. The immunoprecipitates from the transfected cell lysates using anti-PRC1 polyclonal antibodies were examined by Western blotting. The anti-PRC1 antibodies specifically co-immunoprecipitated both endogenous PRC1 and 3×FLAG-MgcRacGAP, showing a specific association between the two proteins (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that PRC1 and MgcRacGAP associate both in vitro and in cells. PRC1 Inhibits MgcRacGAP GAP Activity Toward Cdc42 in Vitro—The PRC1 binding region in MgcRacGAP was then studied. As shown in Fig. 3A, MgcRacGAP comprises three conserved domains (an N-terminal myosin-like coiled-coil domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and a C-terminal GAP-conserved domain) (21Kawashima T.

Secreted proteins unable to fold may aggregate or they may be subject to ER-associated protein degradation. To examine the fate of aberrant forms of a well characterized, disulfide-bonded secreted protein, we expressed bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor in yeast. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is a single domain, 58-amino acid polypeptide containing three disulfide bonds, and yeast cells secrete the wild type protein. In contrast, the Y35L mutant, which folds rapidly but is unstable, remains soluble and is not secreted. Surprisingly, the proteolysis of Y35L is unaffected in yeast containing mutations in genes encoding factors required for ER-associated protein degradation and is stable if artificially retained in the ER. Rather, Y35L is diverted from the Golgi to the vacuole and degraded. Because only the mutant protein is quantitatively proteolyzed these data suggest that a post-ER quality control check-point diverts unstable proteins to the vacuole for degradation.

Missense mutations or small in-frame deletions or insertions might not only affect protein function but might compromise the ability of a protein to fold into its native conformation. On occasion, non-native proteins exhibit gain-of-function conformations and are cytotoxic. In fact, defects in protein folding leading to toxic protein conformations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including antitrypsin deficiency, Alzheimer's disease, and the prion-related diseases (1Ma J.

The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER can also induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), an intracellular signaling pathway that leads to ER expansion and induces the expression of chaperones and other factors required for protein biogenesis and transport (20Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 21Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Consequently, the UPR, like ERAD, reduces ER stress when the concentration of aberrant, secreted proteins rises. The rate-limiting step in protein secretion is folding in the lumen of the ER, and the efficiencies of disulfide bond formation and protein folding are linked (22Bardwell J.C. Mol.

To begin to address this question, we expressed wild type and mutant forms of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) in yeast. BPTI is a 58-amino acid polypeptide and the native structure contains three disulfide bonds, formed by C14–C38, C5–C55, and C30–C51, and distinct disulfide-bonded intermediates in the folding pathway are N* (C5–C55, C14–C38), N′ (C30–C51, C14–C38), and NSH,SH (C30–C51, C5–C55). Two of the most highly populated intermediates are N* and N′, and the conversion of N′ to NSH,SH represents the rate-limiting step during BPTI folding in vitro (33Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 497-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In native BPTI a Tyr at position 35 is buried and immobile (35Wlodawer A. Nachman J. Gilliland G.L. Gallagher W. Woodward C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 36Wagner G. Bruhwiler D. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the final conformation of Y35L BPTI is not radically altered, some of the normally buried contacts become solvent-exposed and the protein is unstable relative to wild type BPTI (37Naderi H.M.

Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14075-14081Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The conformation of C5A BPTI, in which a disulfide bond in the final and intermediate states cannot form, is also thought to be quite unstable because the C5–C51 bond is buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein. Not surprisingly, significant conformational deviations between wild type and C5A BPTI have been noted (38van Mierlo C.P. Darby N.J. Neuhaus D. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 353-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The fates of Y35L and C5A BPTI in the yeast secretory pathway were examined previously, and although neither mutant protein was secreted, Y35L was degraded and C5A accumulated (27Kowalski J.M.

In this study, we set out to investigate whether mutant BPTI derivatives were handled by ERAD and/or aggregated. We found that Y35L escaped ERAD and was degraded in the yeast vacuole. These data suggest a “second line” of protein quality control in the yeast secretory pathway. Yeast and Molecular Methods—The yeast strains used for this study are listed in Table I. Plasmids for the constitutive expression of wild type, Y35L, and C5A BPTI were described previously (43Parekh R. Forrester K. Wittrup D. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and DNA inserts corresponding to these genes and promoter elements in YE112-GPD-BPTI (27Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were subcloned into PRS426 (44Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). When the resulting plasmids are introduced into yeast cells, BPTI is expressed from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. The N terminus of the protein contains a synthetic prepro sequence derived from prepro-α factor but lacks the core oligosaccharyl consensus sites (“G” BPTI). The proregion is cleaved in the Golgi by the Kex2p protease, and an added glutamate-alanine C-terminal to the existing cleavage site improves Kex2p processing. Similar levels of BPTI expression and secretion in yeast are evident if the bona fide prepro-α factor sequence is fused to BPTI or if the synthetic prepro sequence contains the glycosylation site (data not shown). The individual BPTI expression vectors were transformed into the desired strains using lithium acetate (45Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformants were selected for growth on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil but containing glucose at a final concentration of 2%. Cells expressing BPTI were grown to mid-log phase and glycerol stocks were made and stored at -70 °C. All experiments were performed using cells freshly broken-out onto solid selective medium.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceRSY 801Mata, ura 3-52 leu2-3,112 ade 2-101Ref. 15Brodsky J.L.

The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. At the indicated times, 1.6 OD values of cells were collected and harvested. The supernatant (∼500 μl) from this centrifugation step, which represents the secreted pool of BPTI, was concentrated using Centricon 3 microconcentrators (Amicon) to a final volume of 15 μl and assayed as described below. The pellet, which represented intracellular material, was resuspended in 100 μl of Stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm ammonium acetate, 500 mm iodoacetamide, 20 mm sodium azide, 0.45 mm cycloheximide, 5 mm EDTA) and 100 μl of Cell Extract buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mm ammonium acetate, 500 mm iodoacetamide, 20 mm sodium azide, 20 mm EDTA, 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.45 mm cycloheximide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 3 μg/ml leupeptin) was added. A total of 1.5 g of zirconia/silica beads (0.5 mm diameter, Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) and 20 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid were added and the cells were disrupted with one 60-s burst in a mini-Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) followed by cooling on ice for 60 s. Two 500-μl washes with Wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 10% trichloroacetic acid) were combined with the original lysate. Each wash included a 60-s burst in the mini-Bead Beater with cooling on ice for 60 s between bursts. This mixture was centrifuged (16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was aspirated, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of Resuspension buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 11, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3% SDS). The samples were heated at 72 °C for 5 min before 160 μl of Dilution buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 1.25% Triton X-100) and 4 μlofa0.5 m stock of iodoacetamide were added. The solution was mixed vigorously, 10 μl of Omnisorb (Calbiochem) was added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatant, which represented clarified, cellular lysate, was used for gel samples. NuPage 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added to the lysate, and to the concentrated extracellular material (see above), to a final dilution of 1× LDS sample buffer and supplemented with a final concentration of 0.06 m dithiothreitol and the samples were heated at 72 °C for 10 min. Proteins in the samples were resolved on 4–12% bis-Tris NuPage gradient gels (Invitrogen) using NuPage SDS-MES running buffer (Invitrogen). The resolved proteins were transferred to PROTRAN nitrocellulose membranes (pore size = 0.2 μm; Bioscience) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and sodium azide at a final concentration of 5 mm. The filters were then incubated with polyclonal anti-BPTI antiserum (8371T) diluted 1:1,000 in TBS-T, 5% nonfat dry milk, 5 mm sodium azide for 16 h at 4 °C. Filters were washed three times for 10 min with TBS-T and then incubated at room temperature with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG; Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5,000 in TBS-T, 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. The filters were washed three times for 10 min with TBS-T and then treated with the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce Chemical), exposed to x-ray film, and where indicated data were quantified using films exposed in the linear range and the Image Gauge software (Fuji Film). Sucrose Density Gradient Analysis—A total volume of 100 ml of exponentially growing cells (OD 0.5–0.8) were pelleted, washed, and concentrated to 0.5 ml in STED10 buffer (10% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and split into two microcentrifuge tubes, which were subsequently placed on ice. Zirconia/silica beads were added to the meniscus and the samples were lysed using a 60-s burst in a mini-Bead Beater (as above) for 2 min. An additional 500 μl of STED10 containing protease inhibitors was added and the resulting solution was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 0.3 ml of the extract was layered onto a 30–70% linear sucrose gradient, which was formed by layering 2.2 ml of STED buffer with decreasing amounts of sucrose (from the bottom): STED70 (70% (w/v) sucrose in STED buffer), STED60, STED50, STED40, and STED30. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Fractions of 800 μl were collected from the top (Fraction 1) to the bottom (Fraction 13) of the gradient and the pellet at the bottom of the tube was resuspended in the remaining 800 μl of STED30 and represented aggregated material (Fraction 14). A total of 600 μl of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mm ammonium acetate, 500 mm iodoacetamide, 20 mm sodium azide, 20 mm EDTA, 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.45 mm cycloheximide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 3 μg/ml leupeptin) was added to each of the fractions and the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the resultant pellet, containing precipitated protein, was resuspended in 10 μl of trichloroacetic acid resuspension buffer (3% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 11, 10 mm dithiothreitol). This sample was incubated at 72 °C for 5 min before 40 μl of BPTI dilution buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 1.25% Triton X-100) and 1 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetamide were added. Samples were prepared and proteins were separated on 4–12% bis-Tris gradient gels as described above. Indirect Immunofluoresence—The cellular distribution of BPTI and intracellular proteins in yeast were visualized using a protocol supplied by the laboratory of M. Snyder. 2J. Vogel and M. Snyder, Yale University, personal communication. Yeast were grown to mid-log phase at 26 °C, a 1/10th the volume of 37% formaldehyde was added, and the cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The cells were harvested, washed twice with 1.5 ml of Solution A (1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.0) and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of Solution A containing 1 μl/ml of 2 mg/ml Z100T zymolase (made in double-distilled water (ddH2O)). The mixture was incubated for 30–40 min at 37 °C. Polylysine slides were prepared during this incubation; in brief, 0.5 mg/ml polylysine (Sigma) resuspended in ddH2O was added to each well of a 25 × 75-mm Teflon-coated immunofluorescence slide (Polysciences Inc.), incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and the slides were washed with ddH2O and air dried for 20 min. The yeast cells, which had been incubating, were harvested and washed 1–2 times with 100 μl of solution A. The final cell pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of Solution A and 30 μl were added to a slide well and allowed to adhere for 30 min. Unbound cells were aspirated and the wells were rinsed gently with PBS, 0.1% BSA and twice with PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% BSA. Each sample was incubated with the primary antibody (BPTI, 1:50; and Vma2p, 1:25, each in PBS, 0.1% BSA) for 2 h at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were incubated for 5 min and washed one time each with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, PBS containing 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Alexa secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit, 488; goat anti-mouse, 594; Molecular Probes), which had been diluted 1:500 in PBS, 0.1% BSA, were added to the cells for 1–2 h. Finally, the cells were washed for 5 min with PBS, 0.1% BSA, twice with PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and once with PBS, 0.1% BSA. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma) was incubated with each sample for 5 min and the cells were washed once with PBS, 0.1% BSA and then mounted in 4 μl of mount solution (70% glycerol/PBS containing 2% n-propyl gallate). The samples were sealed with a coverslip and clear nail polish, allowed to dry, and immunofluoresence was either assessed immediately or the samples were stored at -20 °C in the dark for several months. Cell fluorescence was visualized on an Olympus BX60 microscope fitted with a Hamamamatsu digital camera and images were analyzed using QED Imaging software (Pittsburgh, PA). Concanavalin A Immunoprecipitation—A total of 300 μl of concanavalin A buffer (500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm NaN3) and 20 μl of concanavalin beads (added from a 1:1 stock in concanavalin A buffer) were added to 15 μl of cellular lysate, prepared as described in the cycloheximide chase protocol (see above). This mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads and those proteins bound were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with concanavalin A buffer and 1× LDS sample buffer, 0.06 m dithiothreitol buffer was added to the pellet at a 1:1 bead:sample buffer ratio. The samples were heated to 72 °C for 10 min, and proteins were separated on 4–12% bis-Tris NuPage gels and analyzed by Western blotting as described above for the cycloheximide chase protocol. Y35L BPTI Degradation Is Independent of BiP, Calnexin, and Proteasome Function—Previous studies indicated that wild type BPTI is secreted from yeast but the Y35L mutant is degraded intracellularly (28Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Mso J. Wittrup K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19453-19458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether Y35L BPTI was degraded via the ERAD pathway, wild type and Y35L BPTI-expressing plasmids were transformed into cells containing the kar2-1 allele in the gene encoding BiP (KAR2 (46Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar)), into a strain lacking calnexin (cne1Δ (47Parlati F. Dominguez M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol.

As an additional control, yeast were transformed with a URA-marked 2-μ vector, PRS426 (44Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), lacking an insert. Cycloheximide chase experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (4–12% acrylamide) were used to resolve the ER-resident, immature BPTI, which contains a proregion, from mature BPTI, which results from Kex2 protease-mediated removal of the proregion in the Golgi. The mature and proregion-containing BPTI species were detected by immunoblot analysis of cellular extracts using anti-BPTI antiserum. A signal was absent when immunoblotted extracts from yeast transformed with the vector control were probed with anti-BPTI antiserum (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, we noted a time-dependent decrease in the amount of the immature (“pro”) ER-resident form of the wild type and Y35L proteins, regardless of which strain was examined. In these experiments the level of the mature form either decreased or remained constant, suggesting that the immature form is “chased” into the mature species, which in the case of wild type BPTI is then secreted (Ref. 27Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; see below), and/or that a variable population of the mature protein is stable. To differentiate between these possibilities, total yeast protein was radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, cell extracts and extracellular fluid/media were isolated (see “Experimental Procedures”), and BPTI was detected by immunoprecipitation and radiography as previously described (27Kowalski J.M.

https://openalex.org/W1965440944,"We studied the mechanism of intra-mitochondrial death initiator caspase-9 activation by a redox response, in which hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused a subtle decrease in the inner membrane potential (Δψm) with little evidence of cytochrome c release. Initiation of the intra-mitochondrial autocleavage of procaspase-9 preceded the onset of caspase cascade induction in the cytosol. Purified mitochondria demonstrated procaspase-9 processing and releasing abilities when exposed to H2O2. Bcl-2 overexpression caused accumulation of the active form caspase-9 in the mitochondria, rendering the cells resistant to the redox stress. Intriguingly, disulfide-bonded dimers of autoprocessed caspase-9 were generated in the mitochondria in the pre-apoptotic phase. Using a substrate-analog inhibitor, dimer formation of procaspase-9 was also detectable inside the mitochondria. Furthermore, thiol reductant thioredoxin blocked the caspase-9 activation step and the cell death induction. Thus, redox stress-responsive thiol-disulfide converting reactions in the mitochondrion seemed to mediate procaspase-9 assembly that allows autoprocessing. This study offers an explanation for the recent observation that Apaf-1-null cells can execute apoptosis, which can be blocked by Bcl-2, and supports the proposition that the cytochrome c-Apaf-1-procaspase-9 complex functions in the caspase amplification rather than in its initiation.

When the ROS production dominates cellular ROS-reducing functions, oxidative stress develops (1Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses.

Based on the above notions, we examined the mitochondrial caspase-9 activation in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 0.2 mm) in human leukemic U937 cells as well as in vitro with mitochondria purified from the cell culture and mouse liver. Although multiple kinase cascades were activated by H2O2 in the culture (2Kurata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), caspase-9-dependent cell death was induced without newly caused transcription or translation, allowing us to focus on the structurally prepared mechanism. Results indicate that procaspase-9 existing in the mitochondria initiates its autoprocessing in the pre-apoptotic phase, in which homodimerization with trans-molecular disulfide, S-S, linkage is involved. In vitro experiments indicated that mitochondria can activate and release caspase-9 in response to H2O2 as low as 0.2-2 μm by which neither PT nor release of cytochrome c was induced. The mitochondrial redox control system may serve as a sensitive pathway to the cytoplasmic death cascade unless cytochrome c is released by a dramatic structural change in the inner or outer membrane.

Cell Res. 2002; 276: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were refed with fresh medium and equilibrated for 1 h before the experiments (2Kurata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Caspase inhibitors, LEHD-CHO and IETD-CHO (Calbiochem), were dissolved in Me2SO, and added to the cultures at 100 μm. Endotoxin-free, recombinant human thioredoxin (TRX) (Calbiochem) was used at 5 μg/ml. Western Blotting—For sample preparation, cells (106) were washed in ice-cold STEE (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA), lysed in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled immediately (2Kurata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Separating gel was prepared with 9, 11, 13, or 15% acrylamide. Typically, 100 μg of proteins was loaded in each slot. Biotinylated SDS-PAGE standards (broad range, Bio-Rad) were used for size determination. For the two-dimensional electrophoresis, samples were dissolved in the loading buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The first dimension 1.0-mm thick gel strip (10% constant gel or 15-20% gradient gel) was equilibrated with 2-ME-containing sample buffer and embedded with 1% agarose on top of the second dimension gel (1.5-mm thick). Protein transfer and immunodetection were performed as described previously (36Okada Y. Osada M. Kurata S. Sato S. Aisaki K. Kageyama Y. Kihara K. Ikawa Y. Katoh I. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Human-specific (#9502) and mouse-specific (#9504) anti-caspase-9 antibodies reactive with the sequences around the cleavage sites and an anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody (#9542) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-caspase-3 (H277, sc-7148), anti-cytochrome c (H104, sc-7159), anti-Bcl-2 (C-2, sc-7382), anti-Bcl-XL/S (L-19, sc-1041), and anti-IκBα (C-21, sc-371) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-JNK2 antibody (sc-7345) was cross-reactive with JNK1. An anti-β-actin antibody (AC-15, Sigma) and an anti-Apaf-1 antibody (559863, BD Biosciences) were also used. Blotting membrane was exposed to instant film (FP-3000B, Fuji) with an ECL Mini Camera (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Staining and Flow Cytometry—For microscopic observation, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (ICN Biomedicals) as described (2Kurata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitation of Δψm in isolated mitochondria was performed as described (37Zamzami N. Metivier D. Kroemer G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 208-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with rhodamine 123 (Sigma). Cells stained with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) (Aldrich) and biotinylated annexin V/streptavidin-allophycocyanin (APC) (BD Biosciences) were analyzed for Δψm alterations and apoptosis induction using FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). Cell Fractionation—To obtain mitochondria and cytosol fractions from H2O2-treated cell cultures, washed cells (107) were disrupted with 40 strokes in loosely fitted Dounce homogenizer in 3 volumes of isolation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose) supplemented with protease inhibitors, including PMSF (0.5 mm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), l-1-chloro-3-(4- tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone hydrochloride, Nα- tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (0.1 mm), and E-64 (1 μg/ml). For -2-ME/+2-ME two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, DTT was omitted from the buffer. After two-cycle clarification at 2500 × g for 5 min, supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min to obtain cytosol and mitochondrial fractions. The cytosol fraction was concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration with Vivaspin 2 (MWCO 5000, Vivascience). In Vitro Experiments with Purified Mitochondria—Mitochondria for in vitro experiments were purified as described (38Susin S.A. Larochette N. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 205-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 or units/Bcl-2 cells (5 × 108) were collected, washed, and disrupted in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer in a buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitors without l-1- tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and E-64. Mouse liver was minced and homogenized in the same way. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets containing mitochondria were re-suspended and subjected to sedimentation through a Percoll step gradient (18, 30, and 60%) at 9,000 × g, for 15 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial fraction formed on the 60% cushion was taken and diluted in the buffer for sedimentation. Protease inhibitors were eliminated from the Percoll gradient centrifugation and the subsequent procedures. Purified mitochondria (wet material, 5 mg) were suspended in 1 ml of buffer (200 mm mannitol, 50 mm sucrose, 1.0% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) without an inhibitor. After adding succinate (5 mm), the suspension (200 μl) was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of H2O2. After incubation, a 1/2 aliquot was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain supernatant and pellet fractions. Supernatant was concentrated as described above. The other portion was immediately examined for Δψm with rhodamine 123 using a Hitachi fluorometer as described previously (37Zamzami N. Metivier D. Kroemer G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 208-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase Enzyme Activity Assay—Semi-quantification of caspase-9 and caspase-3 enzyme activities was performed with colorimetric substrates, Ac-LEHD-pNA, and Ac-DEVD-pNA (Calbiochem), respectively. Cytosol fractions and supernatants of the H2O2-treated mitochondria were adjusted to the assay buffer containing Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.6), DTT (10 mm), PMSF (0.5 mm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), and incubated with either of the substrates (0.2 mm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Buffer exchange was performed by repeated membrane filtration and dilution. Mitochondria were disrupted with 0.1% Tween 20 prior to the assay. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Cell Death Induction by Caspase-9 Activation—Under the culture conditions with 0.2 mm H2O2, cells with morphological features of apoptosis became detectable by nuclear staining in 3.5 h (Fig. 1A). Apoptotic cells exhibiting nuclear condensation and fragmentation occupied 60% of the culture at 7 h (Fig. 1, A and B), and all cells died within 12 h. In the Western blot analysis, 47-kDa procaspase-9 was dominantly found in the whole lysates of cells incubated with H2O2 for up to 3 h (Fig. 2A). In the samples prepared at 3.5 h, the band of 35-kDa caspase-9 was substantially intensified, indicating induction of the procaspase-9 autoprocessing at Asp-315 (25Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The 370-kDa caspase-9 molecules due to the cleavage at Asp-330 by caspase-3 (25Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) was detectable less efficiently only in the later samples (5 and 7 h), reflecting amplification of the caspase cascade.Fig. 2Caspase-9 induction in the absence of cytosolic translocation of cytochrome c. A, procaspase-9 processing detected by Western blotting with whole cell lysates from U937 and U/p53 cultures. Time courses from 0 to 7 h and from 2.5 to 4.5 h are shown. Positions of procaspase-9 and caspase-9 are marked with arrows. Sizes of the proform and mature forms of capase-9 as well as those of protein standards are denoted in kilodaltons in parentheses. B, inhibition of the H2O2-caused caspase-9 activation by LEHD-CHO. U937 cells pre-treated either with LEHD-CHO or with IETD-CHO were exposed to H2O2 for the periods (h) indicated. C, caspase-3 activation detected by the cleavage of PARP and a decrease in procaspase-3. PARP (116 kDa) and its cleavage products (89 and 24 kDa) are indicated with arrows. D, retention of cytochrome c in the mitochondria during cell death by 0.2 mm H2O2. It shows Western blots with the mitochondrial and cytosol fractions obtained in the time course (in h). Control experiment with 2 mm H2O2 indicates the release of cytochrome c. E, analysis for a p53-stabilizing effect. U/p53 cells incubated with H2O2 (0.2 mm), actinomycin D (5 nm), bleomycin (0.06 units/ml), or etoposide (500 nm) were examined for p53 by Western blotting. Cultures with H2O2 were examined through the time course (h) indicated, and those with a drug at 16 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) U/p53 cells constitutively expressing wild type tumor suppressor p53 underwent apoptosis similarly (Fig. 1B). Although the procaspase-9 cleavage began ∼30 min earlier in these cells (Fig. 2A), no other result suggested a mechanistic difference between U937 and U/p53 cells in H2O2-induced cell death. In contrast to actinomycin D (5 nm), bleomycin (0.06 unit/ml), and etoposide (500 nm), with which the p53 protein accumulation was evident at 16 h (Fig. 2E), H2O2 at 0.2 mm did not exert a p53-stabilizing effect either at the onset or during the progression of apoptosis. Despite the general assumption that H2O2 would cause chromosomal damage to stabilize p53 for induction of genes encoding mitochondrially localized proteins (4Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) and enzymes affecting redox conditions (39Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar), neither DNA damage nor a p53 function was found essential for the death induction under the oxidative conditions. If thioredoxin (TRX), a small molecular weight thiol-reducing protein, which cells can take up from the medium, was added to the culture 1 h before the H2O2 input, only 10% of the cells were found apoptotic at 7 h (Fig. 1B). TRX suppressed the H2O2-induced cell death effectively as reported (40Andoh T. Chock P.B. Chiueh C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9655-9660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A membrane-permeable caspase-9 inhibitor, LEHD-CHO, effectively protected cells from apoptosis by H2O2, allowing at least 80% of the cells to survive for 7 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-CHO exerted little effect on the cell death. The procaspase-9 processing induced by H2O2 was certainly inhibited by LEHD-CHO, but not by IETD-CHO (Fig. 2B). In the experiment with TNF-α, where ∼60% of the cells became apoptotic within 5 h, IETD-CHO decreased the dying cell ratio to 10%, but LEHD-CHO did not affect it significantly (Fig. 1C). Consistently, the 8-kDa cleavage product from BID was detectable in the cells exposed to TNF-α, but not those exposed to H2O2 (data not shown). The cleavage of 116-kDa PARP to the 89- and 24-kDa peptides by caspases-3 (41Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar) was readily detectable at 3.5 h (Fig. 2C), indicating activation of the entire apoptosis cascade. An obvious decrease in procaspase-3 was found at 5 and 7 h, whereas the amount of β-actin was not altered significantly (Fig. 2C, right). Thus, the apoptosis induction was dependent on initiator caspase-9 by which the downstream caspases were induced abruptly. Apoptosis in the Absence of PT and Release of Cytochrome c—To determine whether the death induction depended on the loss of Δψm, flow cytometry was performed with annexin V-conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) and 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) (Fig. 1D). A majority of untreated U937 cells were found in the annexin V-negative, DiOC6(3)-positive (death-negative/Δψmnormal) population (93%). After 5 h of the H2O2 treatment, the death-negative cell count decreased to 54%. A newly generated fraction consisting of 25% of the cells displayed an annexin V-positive, DiOC6(3)-hyposensitive (death-positive/Δψmhypo) feature corresponding to an ∼100-fold increase in the emission from APC-annexin V and 50% decrease in the emission from DiOC6(3). After 7 h, the death-positive population reached a total of 58% (Fig. 1D), in which only a small fraction (6% of the culture) displayed Δψmlow corresponding to a DiOC6(3) intensity decreased by one order of magnitude. The plots showed that the death-positive/Δψmlow cells arose from the death-positive/Δψmhypo population, suggesting that the large decrease in Δψm occurred as a result cell death. After subcellular fractionation (Fig. 2D, 0.2 mm H2O2), an intense band of 15-kDa cytochrome c remained n in the mitochondrial fractions throughout the time course. The faint band in the cytosol fractions did not change during the time course to 7 h. However, if a 10-fold increased concentration of H2O2, 2 mm, was applied to the culture, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol was evident (Fig. 2D). Thus, cell death by the moderately oxidative culture conditions with 0.2 mm H2O2 occurred without apparent translocation of cytochrome c. Initiation of the Procaspase-9 Processing in the Mitochondria—Cultures incubated with 0.2 mm H2O2 for 1 or 2 h were examined for mitochondrial and cytosolic procaspase-9 status in the pre-apoptotic phase (Fig. 3A). Approximately 20% of the procaspase-9 molecules existing in the cells were contained in the mitochondria (Fig. 3A, lane 0 h). After incubation with H2O2 for 1 or 2 h, the level of 35-kDa caspase-9 was obviously elevated in the mitochondria (lanes 1 and 2 h), but not in the cytosol fraction, indicating that the caspase-9 priming reaction in the mitochondria preceded the cytoplasmic caspase induction. In the Western blotting with the total cell lysates (Fig. 2A), 35-kDa caspase-9 in the mitochondria (at 1 and 2 h) may have been overwhelmed by the dominantly existing procaspase-9 in the cytosol. Retention of cytochrome c and presence of endogenously expressed Bcl-2 in the mitochondria were confirmed. Apaf-1 was found poorly associated with the mitochondria (Fig. 3A). By a colorimetric assay with Ac-LEHD-pNA, a synthetic substrate cleavable by caspase-9, a gradual increase in the enzyme activity was detectable in the mitochondrial fractions obtained at 1, 2, and 5 h after the H2O2 input (Fig. 3C). The caspase activity appeared to decrease in the mitochondria obtained at 7 h, probably reflecting the loss of structural integrity as indicated by Δψmlow in the late phase (Fig. 1D). The cytosol fractions at 1 and 2 h did not show an increase in the substrate-cleaving ac"
https://openalex.org/W1971552363,"The sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), as well as SREBP-1a and SREBP-2, inhibit transcription of the gene encoding the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK-C). There are two SREBP regulatory elements (SREs) in the PEPCK-C gene promoter (-322 to -313 and -590 to -581). The SRE at -590 overlaps an Sp1 site on the opposite strand of the DNA. These SREs bound SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c with low affinity but the addition of purified upstream stimulatory activity enhanced the binding of SREBP-1 to both of these sites. Mutating these SREs increased both unstimulated (5-fold) and protein kinase A-stimulated transcription (8-27-fold) from the PEPCK-C gene promoter; this was lost when both SREs were mutated. The SRE at -590 differs by a single base pair from the SRE in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene (T in the PEPCK-C gene promoter at -582, compared with an A in the SRE of the gene for the LDL receptor promoter). Introduction of the LDL receptor SRE into the PEPCK-C gene promoter increased SREBP-1c binding and caused a 10-fold enhancement of basal transcription from the promoter, rather than an inhibition as observed with the SRE in the PEPCK-C gene promoter. The T/A change does not alter the binding of Sp1 to its site on the opposite strand of the DNA. Sp1 bound to the promoter independently of SREBP-1c but competed with SREBP-1c for binding. Sp1 does not bind to the SRE at -322. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, using rat hepatocytes, demonstrated that SREBP-1 and Sp1 were associated in vivo with putative regulatory regions corresponding to the SREs in the PEPCK-C gene promoter. We propose that insulin represses transcription of the gene for PEPCK-C by inducing SREBP-1c production in the liver, which interferes with the stimulatory effect of Sp1 at -590 of the PEPCK-C gene promoter.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1630-1638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SREBP-1c thus regulates both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, most likely via a reciprocal response to the hormones that control the genes involved in lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. SREBPs are members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcriptional regulatory proteins, having a unique dual binding specificity. They can bind to SREBP regulatory elements (SRE) (3Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to an E-box motif (8Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of SREBP-1, SREBP-1a and -1c, which are produced from a single gene on human chromosome 17p11.2, and differ only in their first exon (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 is produced from a separate gene on human chromosome 22q13 (see Ref. 10Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar for review). SREBPs are synthesized as precursors and inserted into the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope through a two-pass transmembrane segment, resulting in the amino and carboxyl tails facing the cytoplasm (11Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The mature form of SREBP-1 is generated by proteolytic cleavage within the plane of the bilayer; this cleavage responds to the concentration of sterols or insulin (11Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 12Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and results in the nuclear translocation of the mature transcription factor. The two isoforms of SREBP-1 are produced from two promoters on the SREBP-1 gene, each of which generates an mRNA with a different first exon that codes for one of the specific amino termini of 1a or 1c. These alternate exons are attached to the rest of the mRNA during splicing, yielding two isoforms of SREBP-1. Our previous findings demonstrated an interaction between SREBP-1c and CBP. The latter is a transcriptional co-activator involved in coordinating the stimulatory effect of cAMP on PEPCK-C gene transcription (1Chakravarty K. Leahy P. Becard D. Hakimi P. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34816-34823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c blocks the stimulation of PKA-induced transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter, whereas the dominant negative form of SREBP-1c overcomes this inhibition. Both E1A and NF1c, which interact with CBP, have been shown to inhibit PEPCK-C gene transcription; dominant-negative SREBP-1c also overcomes this inhibition (1Chakravarty K. Leahy P. Becard D.

Previous studies have shown that CBP is required for the sterol/SREBP-1-regulated increase in transcription from the promoters of the HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase genes in transient transfection assays (13Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17865-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). E1A blocked this induction of transcription by SREBP-1c, but it could be overcome by the coexpression of CBP and SREBP-1c. SREBP-1c binds to the promoter of the target gene and then to the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1-451) of CBP (13Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17865-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our findings suggested a similar interaction between SREBP-1c, the PEPCK-C gene promoter, and CBP (1Chakravarty K. Leahy P. Becard D. Hakimi P. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

In the current paper we have identified the binding sites of SREBP-1 in the PEPCK-C gene promoter and have shown that SREBP-1c requires a protein(s) present in USA for binding to the SRE in the gene promoter. Sp1, a ubiquitous transcription factor, prevents SREBP-1 from binding to the SRE in the PEPCK-C gene promoter at -590. When the levels of SREBP-1 increases in the liver, as would be expected in the presence of insulin, it displaces Sp1 from its site on the promoter, thereby inhibiting transcription. However, when the SRE in the PEPCK-C gene promoter is mutated to the SRE sequence present in the LDL receptor promoter, both Sp1 and SREBP-1c bind to the SRE resulting in a stimulation of transcription, not an inhibition.

Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Vector Construction—The plasmid p2000luc was generated by ligating the XbaI/BglII fragment of the PEPCK-C gene promoter into pGL2-basic (Promega) (which contains the luciferase structural gene) that had been digested with NheI and BglII. The plasmid was isolated with Plasmid Mini or Qiafilter Midi Kits (Qiagen, Inc.), and checked for purity by electrophoresis using an 0.8% agarose gel, followed by ethidium bromide staining and visualization with UV light. The cDNA encoding the mature form of SREBP-1a (first 490 amino acids of the NH2 terminus) was cloned into the pRSET-B expression vector (16Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Studies—HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown to 60% confluence in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 50% F-12 nutrient mixture (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 and 10% fetal calf serum) and antibiotics (50 units of penicillin and 50 μg of streptomycin per ml) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in 6-well plates for 24 h before transfection. WT-IR cells were passaged at 33 °C in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 μm dexamethasone. After transfection, the cells were transferred to 37 °C, with culture conditions as described above. The cells (1 × 105 cells in 2 ml of medium/well) were then transfected with plasmid DNA (1 μg of plasmid DNA to 4.5 μl of FuGENE-6 transfection reagent per 35-mm well). After 24 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed by addition of 300 μl of 1× lysis buffer. The insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes for 6 min at 12,000 × g and the supernatant was separated from the pellet for the measurement of the protein concentration and luciferase activity. For luciferase activity, 10 μl of the cell lysate was used to measure the integrated light units over 10 s, using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and a luminometer (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA), as recommended by the manufacturer. This assay was routinely carried out in triplicate. The protein content of the extracts was determined by the dc-Bio-Rad protein assay method, using several concentrations of bovine serum albumin in cell lysis buffer as a standard. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The SREs at -322 and -590 were mutated using the following oligonucleotides: for -322 the sequence was 5′-GGCGTCCCGGCCAGCCCTGTCCTTGACCTTTGTTGTGTAATTAAGGCAAGAGCCTATAGTTTGCATCAGC-3′; for -590 the sequence was 5′-GGAATGAAGCTTACTTTTTTTTTTTCCTCTGC-3′ (the mutated bases are in bold). These sites were mutated in combination or individually to generate single mutant vectors or double mutant vectors using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit. To generate -322sre and -590sre the PEPCK-C core SRE sequence at -322 and -590 was replaced by the consensus SRE sequence (5′-ATCACCCCAC-3′) found in the LDL receptor gene promoter. The plasmids resulting from the above mutations were isolated, and their sequence confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing, performed by the Case Western Reserve University Molecular Biology Core Laboratory. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Bacterial stocks containing the plasmids encoding the desired recombinant protein were inoculated in 20 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin or 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and shaken vigorously overnight at 37 °C. One liter of LB media was then inoculated with the 20 ml of bacterial culture and grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to culture and it was further shaken for 4 h. The cells were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 20 min, and then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 30% glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 ml/20 g wet weight Escherichia coli cells of protease inhibitor mixture for His-tagged protein). Lysozyme, 1 mg/ml, was added to the resuspended cells and the sample was placed on ice for 30 min. The cells were then sonicated using 10-s bursts at 200-300 W with a 10-s cooling period between bursts. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. To the supernatant, a 1:4 ratio of 50% Ni-NTA slurry was added and the mixture incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the Ni-NTA/protein slurry was centrifuged at 750-800 × g for 5 min, a wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 30% glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was added, and this step was repeated 8 times using the wash buffer. The pellet was re-suspended in elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 30% glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at room temperature for 25 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 750-800 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and the supernatant was collected and dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of the dialysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 30% glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol); the buffer was changed at least once during this period. The purity of the protein was determined by electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were stored at -70 °C until use. Fluorescent EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay)—Oligonucleotides that were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and/or PAGE were annealed with the specific complementary strand representing the putative SREs in the PEPCK-C gene promoter. These include the following fragments; -167 (-175 to -149) consisting of 5′-56-FAM/CAATCATTATCTCCCCAAAGTTTATTG/36-FAM-3′; -322 (-330 to -306) consisting of 5′-56-FAM/CCTTGACCCCCACCTGACAATTAA-G/36-FAM-3′; -345 (-351/-328) consisting of 5′-56-FAM/GAGGCGTCCCGGCCAGCCCTGTCC/36-FAM-3′; -535 (-543/-519) consisting of 5′-56-FAM/GGGGTGTGTTACCCCACTAGGTGTC/36-FAM-3′; and -590 (-597/-573) consisting of 5′-56-FAM/GCTTACAATCACCCCTCCCTCTGCA/36-FAM-3′. The 590sre oligonucleotide had the same sequence as -590 except for a change in one base pair (bold A) and consisted of 5′-56-FAM/GCTTACAATCACCCCACCCTCTGCA/36-FAM-3′; this segment of DNA corresponded to the SRE-1 in the LDL receptor. An unlabeled oligonucleotide, which corresponds to an Sp1 binding site, had the sequence 5′-ACCCCCGGCCCGCCCCGCCGTCG-3′. The reaction mixture (10 μl) for the EMSA contained 5 μl of a 5× binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.25 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC)), 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC), and 1 pmol of the doubly tagged fluorescent oligonucleotide with or without competitor. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 20 min and the product of the reaction was resolved by electrophoresis using a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was scanned and resolved wet, using a Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager® scanner (Amersham Biosciences). The image was analyzed by ImageQuant® Solutions software for Windows 2000. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP Assay)—Rats (200 g body weight) were fasted overnight and then fed a diet high in carbohydrates for 7 days. The animals were then killed, their livers removed, and primary hepatocytes prepared as described by Berry and Friend (17Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar) and modified by Leffert (18Leffert H.L. Koch K.S. Moran T. Williams M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ChIP assay was performed essentially as described by Boyd et al. (19Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), as modified by Massillon et al. (20Massillon D. Arinze I.J. Xu C. Bone F. J. Biol.

After plating for 1 day, formaldehyde was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and the cells were incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 min. To quench the formaldehyde-induced cross-linking, glycine was then added to a final concentration of 125 mm. The cells were incubated for an additional 5 min at room temperature, the medium was decanted, and cells were rinsed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The rest of the procedure was conducted on ice. The cells were centrifuged (5 min at 3,000 rpm) and then washed with 10 ml of 1× TBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6), centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded. At this point, the cells can be kept on ice for several hours; alternatively they may be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for subsequent analysis. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) and the cells were lysed by 5-8 passages through a 21-gauge needle to shear the DNA; they were then incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was transferred to a 15-ml Falcon conical tube and chromatin was further sheared by sonication (power settings of 7 and a 60% duty cycle, three 10-s pulses, while cooling on ice between rounds of sonication). The sonicated extracts were first centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, then the supernatant was centrifuged again at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of the supernatant fraction was saved for the measurement of total input of chromatin (chromatin input fraction). Thirty μl of Protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz, Sc-2002) slurry, 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 2.5 μg of preimmune serum was added to the supernatant and incubated for 50 min at 4 °C while mixing by rotation. The samples were then centrifuged at 7,500 rpm for 2 min, primary antibodies against SREBP-1 or Sp1 were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated overnight, with rotation, at a temperature of 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and Protein G PLUS-agarose beads (30-μl bed volume) and 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA was added. The samples were then incubated while rotating for 60 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 7,500 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. A 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant was kept for sizing the DNA and the rest was discarded. The immunoprecipitated complex (beads) was resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 2 min at 7,500 rpm at 4 °C. This washing procedure was repeated twice. The supernatant from the last wash was discarded and the wash was repeated twice with 1 ml of RIPA-500 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). The supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of a LiCl detergent solution (0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) was added to the beads. The beads were washed twice using the same conditions as described for the RIPA buffer wash. The supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of 1× TBS was added and the beads were washed as described previously for the RIPA buffer wash. After the washes were completed, the immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted from the beads by the addition of 100 μl of 1% SDS, 1× TE solution (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The complexes were then centrifuged for 3 min and the eluate was transferred to a fresh tube. The beads were washed with 150 μl of 0.67% SDS, 1× TE solution, centrifuged for 3 min, and the supernatant was added to the previous eluate. The protein-DNA cross-linking was reversed by incubating the eluate fraction overnight at 65 °C. The eluate was centrifuged briefly and treated with Proteinase K solution (0.5 m EDTA, 20 mg/ml glycogen, 10 mg/ml Proteinase K, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5) and incubated for 1 h at 45 °C. The DNA from the sample was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, catalog number 28104), and stored in 35 μl of water at -20 °C. The DNA isolated by immunoprecipitation was analyzed by PCR using primers to the two SREs of the PEPCK-C gene promoter at -322 and -590. These were -322 forward, 5′-GACAACCAGCAGCCACTGGCACAC-3′; -322 reverse, 5′-GACCGTGACTGTTGCTGATGC-3′; -590 forward, 5′-GAGCAGGGGTCAGTATGT-3′; and -590 reverse, 5′-GGGAATTCAGCTCTGAGACGTG-3′. These primers were designed to amplify regions of the PEPCK-C gene promoter known to bind SREBP-1 and Sp1. In addition, primers were constructed for a region of the β-actin structural gene (forward, 5′-GAGTGAGCGAGCCGGAGCCAAT-3′; and reverse, 5′-GACGTCCCTGCTTACCTGGT-3′) and to a region of the PEPCK-C gene promoter that does not bind SREBP-1 or Sp1 (forward, 5′-GATCATGGACCTCCAGGTCATTTCG-3′; and reverse, 5′-GACGTCCCTGCTTACCTGGT-3′). These were used as negative controls. The starting chromatin input fraction was diluted 1/1000 and analyzed by PCR simultaneously with the samples. The amplified DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 Are Equally Effective in Inhibiting Transcription from the PEPCK-C Gene Promoter in Hepatoma Cells—SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 are the predominant isoforms of SREBP in the liver, whereas SREBP-1a is present at low levels in this tissue (21Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 influence transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter, expression vectors encoding SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 were transfected individually into HepG2 cells, together with the PEPCK-C gene promoter (-2000 to +73) linked to the luciferase reporter gene; their effect on gene transcription was compared with the effect of SREBP-1c. SREBP-1a reduced PKA-stimulated induction of transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter by 95%, whereas SREBP-2 reduced transcription by about 90% from the level of transcription noted in the absence of transfected SREBP (Fig. 1, top panel). In the presence of PKA, SREBP-1c repressed transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter by 70% from the level of transcription noted in the absence of transfected SREBP-1c (Fig. 1, top panel). As noted previously with SREBP-1c (1Chakravarty K. Leahy P. Becard D. Hakimi P. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34816-34823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 did not inhibit basal transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter (Fig. 1, bottom panel). It is important to note that basal transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter is ∼1% of the PKA stimulated value and is thus already very low. Increasing the concentration of SREBP-1c, SREBP-1a, or SREBP-2 inhibited PKA-stimulated PEPCK-C gene transcription in a dose-dependant manner, without altering basal transcription (data not shown). It is thus likely that all three isoforms of SREBP can effectively inhibit PKA-stimulated transcription from the PEPCK-C gene in the liver. Identifying Regions of the PEPCK-C Gene Promoter Involved in the Transcriptional Effect of SREBP-1c—An analysis of the PEPCK-C gene promoter using MatInspector Professional® (Genomatix) indicated the presence of several putative sites that resemble the consensus SRE present in the promoter of the LDL receptor gene (5′-ATCACCCCAC-3′). These sequences are present in the PEPCK-C gene promoter at -167 to -158, -322 to -313, -345 to -336, -535 to -526, and -590 to -581 on the template strand. Of these five sites, only two (-322 to -313 and -590 to -581) were identified as strong SREBP-1 binding sites in subsequent experiments (see below); these sites are shown in Fig. 2 and their position in the PEPCK-C gene promoter is indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2076523960,"SH2-containing inositol phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) is a physiologically important negative regulator of insulin signaling by hydrolyzing the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase product PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the target tissues of insulin. Targeted disruption of the SHIP2 gene in mice resulted in increased insulin sensitivity without affecting biological systems other than insulin signaling. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which SHIP2 specifically regulates insulin-induced metabolic signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, one of the molecules downstream of PI3-kinase, was inhibited by expression of wild-type SHIP2, whereas it was increased by expression of 5′-phosphatase-defective (ΔIP) SHIP2 in whole cell lysates. The regulatory effect of SHIP2 was mainly seen in the plasma membrane (PM) and low density microsomes but not in the cytosol. In this regard, following insulin stimulation, a proportion of Akt2, and not Akt1, appeared to redistribute from the cytosol to the PM. Thus, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt2 at the PM was predominantly regulated by SHIP2, whereas the phosphorylation of Akt1 was only minimally affected. Interestingly, insulin also elicited a subcellular redistribution of both wild-type and ΔIP-SHIP2 from the cytosol to the PM. The degree of this redistribution was inhibited in part by pretreatment with PI3-kinase inhibitor. Although the expression of a constitutively active form of PI3-kinase myr-p110 also elicited a subcellular redistribution of SHIP2 to the PM, expression of SHIP2 appeared to affect the myr-p110-induced phosphorylation, and not the translocation, of Akt2. Furthermore, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was effectively regulated by SHIP2 in embryonic fibroblasts derived from knockout mice lacking either insulin receptor substrate-1 or insulin receptor substrate-2. These results indicate that insulin specifically stimulates the redistribution of SHIP2 from the cytosol to the PM independent of 5′-phosphatase activity, thereby regulating the insulin-induced translocation and phosphorylation of Akt2 at the PM.

These reports indicate that SHIP2 is a physiologically important negative regulator relatively specific to the insulin signaling.

In this regard, we investigated the impact of SHIP2 expression on the translocation and phosphorylation of Akt induced by the constitutively active form of PI3-kinase, myr-p110 (7Wada T. Sasaoka T.

Furthermore, to clarify whether SHIP2 specifically or non-specifically regulates the metabolic signaling of insulin mediated via IRS-1 and IRS-2, the effect of SHIP2 expression on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was studied in embryonic fibroblasts lacking either IRS-1 or IRS-2 (22Miki H.

Here, we show that SHIP2 negatively regulates the insulin-induced translocation and phosphorylation of Akt2 at the PM mediated via both the IRS-1 and IRS-2 pathway.

The anti-SHIP2 antibodies raised against the C terminus and N terminus were used for the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, respectively. A monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A polyclonal anti-Thr308 phospho-specific Akt antibody and a polyclonal anti-Ser473 phospho-specific Akt antibody were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). A polyclonal anti-Akt antibody and a polyclonal anti-Akt1-specific antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A polyclonal anti-Akt2-specific antibody was from Calbiochem.

All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Construction of Adenoviral Vectors—cDNAs encoding rat WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2 were subcloned into the vector pAxCAwt and transferred to recombinant adenovirus by homologous recombination utilizing an adenovirus expression vector kit (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (7Wada T.

Cell Culture and Infection with Adenovirus—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown and passaged in DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Cells at 2 to 3 days post-confluence were used for differentiation. The differentiation medium contained 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 250 nm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutyl methylxanthine, and 500 nm insulin. After 3 days, the differentiation medium was replaced with postdifferentiation medium containing 10% FCS and 500 nm insulin. After 3 more days, the post-differentiation medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (7Wada T. Sasaoka T. Funaki M. Hori H. Murakami S. Ishiki M. Haruta T. Asano T. Ogawa W.

Embryonic fibroblasts were cultured with α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS. WT-SHIP2, ΔIP-SHIP2, and myr-p110 were transiently expressed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and embryonic fibroblasts by means of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. A multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10–40 pfu/cell was used to infect 3T3-L1 adipocytes and embryonic fibroblasts in DMEM containing 2% FCS, with the virus being left on the cells for 16 h prior to removal. Subsequent experiments were conducted 24 to 48 h after initial addition of the virus. The efficiency of the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of WT-SHIP2, ΔIP-SHIP2, and myr-p110 was ∼95%. Subcellular Fractionation—3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with HES buffer (255 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 ng/ml okadaic acid, pH 7.4) and immediately homogenized by 20 strokes with a motor-driven homogenizer in HES buffer at 4 °C. The homogenates (two 10-cm-diameter dishes per condition) were subjected to subcellular fractionation as described previously to isolate PM, high density microsomes, low density microsomes (LDM), and cytosol (23Heller-Harrison R.A.

The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 41,000 × g for 20 min, yielding a pellet of high density microsomes. The supernatant from this spin was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 90 min, yielding a pellet of LDM. Remaining supernatant was concentrated by Centricon-30 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, Mass.) and used as cytosol. The pellet obtained from the initial spin was resuspended in HES buffer, layered onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a swing rotor for 60 min. A white fluffy band at the interface was collected and resuspended in HES buffer and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min, yielding a pellet of PM. All fractions were adjusted to a final protein concentration of 1 to 3 mg/ml, which was measured by the Bradford method, and stored at –80 °C until use. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—3T3-L1 adipocytes and embryonic fibroblasts grown in 6-well multiplates were serum-starved for 16 h in DMEM. The cells were treated with 17 nm insulin at 37 °C for various periods. They were then lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4, for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates obtained from the same number of cells were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants (100 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitates or whole cell lysates were then separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. The membranes were blocked in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2.5% bovine serum albumin or 5% non-fat milk, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 20 °C. The membranes were then probed with antibodies for 2 h at 20 °C or for 16 h at 4 °C. After the membranes were washed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection using ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) (5Ishihara H.

Structures of SHIP2 Constructs and the Expression in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—SHIP2 is a 140-kDa protein composed of an SH2 domain at the N terminus, a central 5′-phosphatase catalytic domain, and a proline-rich region including the phosphotyrosine binding domain binding consensus at the C terminus. Three amino acids, located within the catalytic domain of SHIP2, that are highly conserved among known 5′-phosphatases were mutated to generate ΔIP-SHIP2 (7Wada T. Sasaoka T. Funaki M. Hori H.

WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2 were transiently expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Endogenous SHIP2 was seen in control 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with LacZ alone. On transfection with either WT-SHIP2 or ΔIP-SHIP2 at an m.o.i. of 40 pfu/cell, we observed similar levels of expression of WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2, which were 5-fold greater than the levels of endogenous SHIP2. Insulin treatment did not affect the expression of WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2 (Fig. 1B).

Treatment with insulin induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 in a time-dependent manner in LacZ-transfected control 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Transfection of WT-SHIP2 decreased insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr308 and Ser473. In contrast, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 was increased by transfection with ΔIP-SHIP2 (Fig. 2, A and B). These results are summarized in Fig. 2, E and F. Following 15 min of insulin treatment, the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 was significantly decreased 30.1 ± 4.9% by the expression of WT-SHIP2 and increased 34.6 ± 5.7% by the expression of ΔIP-SHIP2. Similarly, the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was decreased 27.9 ± 3.4% by the expression of WT-SHIP2 and increased 31.8 ± 4.4% by the expression of ΔIP-SHIP2 following 5 min of insulin stimulation compared with that in control 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with LacZ. To assure equal amounts of protein were loaded among the samples, the cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-Akt antibody (Fig. 2C). Similar expression levels of WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2 were detected on the immunoblotting of the cell lysates with anti-SHIP2 antibody (Fig. 2D). Effect of SHIP2 Expression on Insulin-induced Phosphorylation of Akt at Subcellular Locations—Because it is known that Akt is localized in the cytosol, PM, and LDM fractions (10Calera M.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7201-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of SHIP2 expression on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at subcellular locations (Fig. 3). Insulin induced the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 in the cytosol, PM, and LDM fractions. Although a large amount of Akt resides in the cytosol, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 in the cytosol was not significantly affected by the expression of either WT-SHIP2 or ΔIP-SHIP2. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Akt in the PM and LDM was affected by the expression of SHIP2. Notably, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr308 and Ser473 in the PM fraction was markedly decreased by the expression of WT-SHIP2, whereas it was increased by the expression of ΔIP-SHIP2. Densitometric analysis revealed that insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 was decreased by 47.3 ± 1.2% and 45.7 ± 3.1%, respectively, in WT-SHIP2-expressing cells, whereas it was enhanced by 44.3 ± 5.6% and 45.3 ± 6.6% in ΔIP-SHIP2-expressing cells. Effect of SHIP2 Expression on Insulin-induced Phosphorylation of Akt1 and Akt2 Isoforms—Because Akt1 and Akt2 are the main isoforms expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28312-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of SHIP2 expression on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt1 and Akt2. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt1 antibody, and the precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphospecific Akt antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C, Akt1 is efficiently immunoprecipitated by this procedure, and the Akt2 isoform is not present in the precipitates. Insulin induced phosphorylation of the Akt1 isoform at Thr308 and Ser473 in anti-Akt1 immunoprecipitates, and this phosphorylation was not affected by the expression of either WT-SHIP2 or ΔIP-SHIP2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Because an anti-Akt2 antibody was not available for the immunoprecipitation, we performed an immunodepletion experiment. After the cell lysates were effectively immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt1 antibody, the supernatants were used for the experiment with Akt2. As can be seen in Fig. 4F, only Akt2, not Akt1, is present in the sample obtained by this procedure. Importantly, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt2 at Thr309 and Ser474 was markedly decreased by the expression of WT-SHIP2, whereas it was increased by the expression of ΔIP-SHIP2 (Fig. 4, D and E). These results indicate that SHIP2 regulates the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt2, and not Akt1, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Effect of SHIP2 Expression on the Insulin-induced Subcellular Distribution of Akt Isoforms—It is known that growth factor induces a subcellular relocalization of Akt to the plasma membrane to be phosphorylated (10Calera M.R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6247-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although SHIP2 negatively regulates insulin-induced Akt2 phosphorylation, it is unclear whether SHIP2 affects the phosphorylation of Akt directly or via its translocation to the PM. To address this issue, we next examined the effect of SHIP2 expression on the insulin-induced subcellular redistribution of Akt1 and Akt2. The Akt1 isoform mainly resides in the cytosol fraction, and insulin treatment did not appear to induce apparent subcellular redistribution. In addition, overexpression of neither WT-SHIP2 nor ΔIP-SHIP2 appeared to affect the subcellular localization of Akt1 (Fig. 5A). Thus, the amount of Akt1 in the cytosol did not significantly alter in response to insulin. The Akt2 isoform is also mainly localized in the cytosol fraction in the basal state. Compared with the results obtained with Akt1, insulin efficiently elicited a subcellular redistribution of the Akt2 isoform from the cytosol and LDM to the PM. Importantly, the redistribution was markedly decreased by the expression of WT-SHIP2, whereas it was enhanced by that of ΔIP-SHIP2 (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that SHIP2 appears to regulate the subcellular redistribution of Akt2, and not Akt1, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin-induced Subcellular Redistribution of SHIP2—Our previous study (26Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Wada T. Hori H. Kagawa S. Kobayashi M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2371-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) indicated that the membrane localization of SHIP2 is important for its functioning via the 5′-phosphatase activity. Expression of SHIP2 with the myristoylation signal efficiently inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt in Rat1 fibroblasts (26Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Wada T. Hori H. Kagawa S. Kobayashi M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2371-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Given this, we reasoned that SHIP2 might elicit this function by changing the subcellular localization to efficiently regulate the phosphorylation of Akt in the PM fraction. We examined whether insulin induces the subcellular redistribution of SHIP2 (Fig. 6A). WT-SHIP2 resides largely in the cytosol and partly in the LDM and PM fractions in the basal state. Insulin treatment significantly induced a redistribution of some of the expressed WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2 to the PM fraction. We further assessed the role of PI3-kinase in the insulin-induced redistribution of SHIP2. Pretreatment of the cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 partly, but significantly, inhibited the insulin-induced redistribution of both WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2 to the PM. Densitometric analysis demonstrated that the redistribution of WT-SHIP2 and ΔIP-SHIP2 to the PM was inhibited 41.3 ± 7.2 and 51.7"

To clarify the mechanisms underlying these effects, we established a Cre/loxP conditional expression system for the precisely self-trimmed HCV genome in human liver cells. Passage of hepatocytes expressing replicable full-length HCV (HCR6-Rz) RNA caused up-regulation of anchorage-independent growth after 44 days. In contrast, hepatocytes expressing HCV structural, nonstructural, or all viral proteins showed no significant changes after passage for 44 days. Only cells expressing HCR6-Rz passaged for 44 days displayed acceleration of CDK activity, hyperphosphorylation of Rb, and E2F activation. These results demonstrate that full genome HCV expression up-regulates the CDK-Rb-E2F pathway much more effectively than HCV proteins during passage.

However, exactly how HCV infection could be directly involved in the development of HCC remains unclear because of the lack of an efficient in vitro infection system.

HCV structural protein inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria in mice (6Machida K. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Seike E. Tone S. Shibasaki F. Shimizu M.

Cellular transformation has been shown to be caused by HCV core protein in the presence of the ras gene (7Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Ray R. J.

Commun. 2000; 267: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) proteins reportedly display tumorigenicity in the presence of ras. These results indicate that expression of individual HCV proteins does not cause cellular transformation in vitro. HCV core protein transgenic mice reportedly show induced steatosis and, after 16 months of age, develop HCC (13Moriya K. Fujie H. Shintani Y. Yotsuyanagi H. Tsutsumi T. Ishibashi K. Matsuura Y. Kimura S. Miyamura T. Koike K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1065-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In contrast, HCV structural protein transgenic mice do not display neoplastic or cancerous lesions in the liver by 20 months of age (14Honda A. Arai Y. Hirota N. Sato T. Ikegaki J. Koizumi T. Hatano M. Kohara M. Moriyama T. Imawari M. Shimotohno K. Tokuhisa T. J. Med. Virol. 1999; 59: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, conditional expression of an HCV structural protein region (nucleotides 294–3435) causes hepatic injury in transgenic mice (15Wakita T. Taya C. Katsume A. Kato J. Yonekawa H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Hayashi Y. Koike M. Kohara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but HCC is not observed by at least 16 months of age (data not shown). The frequency of HCC occurrence is reportedly higher in full-length HCV polyprotein transgenic mice than in those with the structural protein only (16Lerat H. Honda M. Beard M.R. Loesch K. Sun J.

However, whether HCV proteins can represent direct triggers of transformation in hepatocytes remains unclear. Cirrhosis and irregular regeneration have been reported as risk factors for HCC (17Shibata M. Morizane T. Uchida T. Yamagami T. Onozuka Y. Nakano M. Mitamura K. Ueno Y. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1773-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). During persistent HCV infection, hepatic injury and regeneration repeatedly occur in the liver. An efficient system of HCV infection is required to clarify the effects of HCV on cell growth. Efficient replication systems have recently been established using HCV replicons and HuH-7 cells (18Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar, 19Blight K.J. McKeating J.A. Marcotrigiano J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3181-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). HuH-7 cells display a point mutation at codon 220 of p53 (20Hsu I.C. Tokiwa T. Bennett W. Metcalf R.A. Welsh J.A. Sun T. Harris C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 987-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and chemosensitivity is decreased compared with other cell lines with wild-type p53 (21Lee T.K. Lau T.C. Ng I.O. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 49: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To clarify how HCV infection modifies hepatocyte growth, we established an expression cassette of replicable full genome HCV, as confirmed in IMY cells and Tupaia belangeri, 2Y. Amako, A. Katsume, K. Tsukiyama-Kohara, K. Satoh, Y. Hayashi, N. Funata, and M. Kohara, submitted for publication. 2Y. Amako, A. Katsume, K. Tsukiyama-Kohara, K. Satoh, Y. Hayashi, N. Funata, and M. Kohara, submitted for publication. and HepG2 cells originating from human hepatoblastoma and exhibiting characteristics of differentiated hepatocytes in that the response to growth factors and p53 functions is retained (22Knowles B.B.

Liver cell lines in which HCV genomes can be conditionally expressed using the Cre/loxP switching system (2Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and precisely self-trimmed at the 5′ and 3′ termini using ribozyme sequences were thus established in this study. HCV-expressing cells were passaged and characterized according to changes in cell growth regulation. cDNA Cloning and Plasmid Construction—Full genome HCV cDNA (nucleotides 1–9611; DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI accession number AY045702) was cloned from the serum of a chronic hepatitis patient (HCV genotype 1b; 50% chimpanzee infectious dose, 104.5 copies/ml; PCR titer, 106.2 copies/ml). Complementary DNA clones with a consensus sequence in more than three clones were utilized for construction of a full-length clone. This was then subcloned under the control of a CAG promoter (24Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) and the Cre/loxP conditional expression cassette using a neomycin resistance gene with a poly(A) signal as a stuffer (see Fig. 1A) (2Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The precise HCV RNA can be exactly excised by the presence of hammerhead ribozyme sequences (25Shimayama T. Nishikawa S. Taira K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3649-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) at the 5′ terminus and the hepatitis D virus ribozyme (26Suh Y.A. Kumar P.K. Nishikawa F. Kayano E. Nakai S. Odai O. Uesugi S. Taira K. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) at the 3′ terminus (see Fig. 1A). Mutant HCR6-Fse was constructed by digestion of the HCR6-Rz clone with FseI (at nucleotide 3379; Takara), deleted using T4 polymerase (Takara). This mutation introduces a stop codon at nucleotide 3606. Mutant HCR6-Age was constructed by digestion of the HCR6-Rz clone with AgeI (at nucleotide 155; Nippon Gene) and NotI (at nucleotide 1967; Takara) and filled in with T4 polymerase (see Fig. 4A). HCR6-CN5 was constructed by removal of the 5′-untranslated region (nucleotides 1–155).Fig. 4Detection of HCV negative-strand RNA, IFN-β, PKR, and 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase mRNAs. HCV negative-strand RNA (A), IFN-β (B), PKR (C), and 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (2′-5′OAS; D) mRNAs were quantified using real-time detection-PCR on days 0, 8, and 44. Copies of each RNA/total RNA (μg) are indicated. The mean of three separate experiments is shown. Error bars indicate S.D.

Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). AxCANCre was prepared by inserting the structural genes of Cre recombinase into adenovirus E1A- and E1B-deleted regions under the control of the CAG promoter. The control adenoviral vector AxCAw1 lacks these inserted genes. The pCAG-PURO-Mer-Cre-Mer vector was constructed from pAN-Mer-Cre-Mer (27Zhang Y. Riesterer C. Ayrall A.M. Sablitzky F. Littlewood T.D. Reth M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and pCAG-PURO, for which the puromycin gene was derived from pBabe-PURO under the control of the CAG promoter (28Tsukiyama-Kohara K.

Cells and Reagents—HepG2 cells were transfected with HCR6-Rz, HCR6-Fse, HCR6-Age, and HCR6-CN5 clones using a modified calcium phosphate method and selected with G418 (800 μg/ml bioactive; Invitrogen). Cell lines Rz2-8, Rz2-18, Rz2-22, Rz24, Fse28, Age8, and CN5-1 were established (Table I). These cells were further transfected with pCAG-PURO-Mer-Cre-Mer DNA and selected with puromycin (1.0 μg/ml). RzM6 and RzM13 were derived from Rz2-18, and RzM24 was derived from Rz24. RzM2-8 and RzM2-9 were derived from Rz2-8 and Rz2-9, respectively. FseM28 and AgeM8 were derived from Fse28 and Age8, respectively. Switching expression was performed by the addition of 4-hydroxitamoxifen (100 nm) for 4 days or by infection of CN5-1 with the AxCANCre virus (multiplicity of infection of 20). For characterization of cell growth speed, 2 × 106 or 4.7 × 106 cells were plated onto 75- or 175-cm2 Falcon tissue culture bottles and passaged every 4 days for 44 days. Cell numbers were counted at every time point of passage, and averages of three experiments were calculated.Table IHCV-expressing HepG2 cell lines established in this studyDNAParentalMCM introducedCore proteinaNanograms of core protein/mg of total protein after 4 days of induction.ng/mgHCR6-RzRz2-18RzM63.5RzM133.0Rz24RzM241.2Rz2-8RzM2-80.6Rz2-9RzM2-90.2HCR6-FseFse28FseM283.0HCR6-AgeAge8AgeM8NDHCR6-CN5CN5-16.7a Nanograms of core protein/mg of total protein after 4 days of induction.

HCV proteins were detected using the originally established anti-core (515) (29Yasui K. Wakita T. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Funahashi S.I. Ichikawa M. Kajita T. Moradpour D. Wands J.R. Kohara M. J.

ATLAS cDNA Array Assay—Using 2–5 μg of total RNA from Rz2-18, RzM6, and M13 cells with or without 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment, 32P-labeled cDNA probes were synthesized; cultured for 0, 12, and 44 days, respectively; and hybridized to filters (ATLAS human cancer cDNA expression array, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After extensive washing, hybridization intensities were quantitated using a Fuji BAS 2000 image intensifier. Values for each regulatory gene were standardized to the average for nine housekeeping genes. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis—Cells (0.5–1 × 106) in the exponential growth phase were trypsinized and stained using propidium iodide (Cycle TEST™ Plus DNA reagent kit, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The population of cells in each cell cycle phase was characterized using Modifit LT software in FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) by counting 10,000 cells. Anchorage-independent Growth Assay—Soft agar dishes were prepared using an underlayer of 0.5% low melting point agarose (FMC Corp.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Rz-Hep, Fse-Hep, Age-Hep, and CN5-Hep cell lines with and without HCV genome expression were passaged, and 103 cells were plated in the same medium containing 0.3% agarose in each well of 6-well Falcon plates. One day after plating, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented. The number of colonies (diameter > 0.1 mm) was determined after 10 days. The results represent the mean of three experiments performed in duplicate. E2F Promoter Assay—E2F activity was detected using the DHFR promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid subcloned into the pGL3 vector (31Ikeda M.A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (100 ng/reaction) was transfected into each cell using a modified calcium phosphate method in a 24-well Falcon plate. Each reaction was standardized by the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (1 ng/reaction). Luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The -fold increase ratio was calculated by division of each relative luciferase activity in cells prior to HCV expression. The results represent the mean of 3 wells from two experiments. CDK Assay—Cells (1 × 107 for CDK4/6 and 2.5 × 106 for CDK2) were lysed as described previously (51Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shultleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 ml of lysis buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) was sonicated twice for 10 s and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were pretreated either with 10 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for CDK4/6 or with 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) for CDK2 at 4 °C for 1 h. Supernatants were reacted with 20 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose precoated with 2 μg of anti-cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (DCS-11, BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.) or with 30 μl of protein A-agarose with rabbit anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 3–6 h. Immune complexes were precipitated and washed four times with lysis buffer B and twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with 25 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 20 μm ATP), 10 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and either 0.5 μg of truncated Rb (QED Bioscience) for CDK4/6 or 1 μg of histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) for CDK2. Reaction products were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film or a Fuji BAS 2000 phospho-imager plate. Stability Assay for p21WAF1/CIP1 and Rb Proteins—The half-lives of the p21WAF1/CIP1 and Rb proteins were characterized after treatment with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for the indicated times at 37 °C as described previously (32Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The p21WAF1/CIP1 and Rb protein expression levels were characterized by Western blotting as described above. Quantitation of 2′–5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase, PKR, IFN, and HCV Negative-strand RNA—Quantitation of 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase, the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent kinase PKR, and HCV negative-strand RNA was performed as described previously (33Takeuchi T. Katsume A. Tanaka T. Abe A. Inoue K. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kawaguchi R. Tanaka S. Kohara M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 636-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The primers and probes for 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase were 5′-CTCAGAAATACCCCAGCCAAATC-3′ (sense primer), 5′-GTGGTGAGAGGACTGAGGAA-3′ (antisense primer), and 5′-CCAGGTCAGCGTCAGATCGGCCTC-3′ (probe); and those for PKR were 5′-CCTGTCCTCTGGTTCTTTTG-3′ (sense primer), 5′-CATGTCAGGAAGGTCAAATCTGGGTG-3′ (antisense primer), and 5′-CTACGTGTGAGTCCCAAAGCAAC-3′ (probe). The primers and probes used for quantitation of HCV negative-strand RNA, IFN, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase will be described elsewhere. 3M. Kohara, K. Tsukiyama-Kohara, M. Kaito, K.

A reporter dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) was covalently attached to the 5′-end, and a quencher dye (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) was joined to the 3′-end of the probe sequence using an amino-linked method. Establishment of Conditional Full Genome HCV-expressing Hepatocytes—The conditional expression system of the full genome HCV cDNA clone (HCR6-Rz) was established using the Cre/loxP system (Fig. 1A). The precise HCV RNA was trimmed using the ribozyme sequence at the 5′ and 3′ termini (Fig. 1, A and C). Infectivity of the HCR6-Rz cDNA clone was observed in susceptible human liver cell lines and animals. 3M. Kohara, K. Tsukiyama-Kohara, M. Kaito, K. Higashi, Y. Amako, K. Inoue, H. Omori, A. Katsume, T. Itoh, T. Wakita, K. Yasui, J. Ohkawa, K. Taira, Y. Matsuura, and S. Watanabe, manuscript in preparation. Four independent HCR6-Rz-expressing HepG2 cell lines (Rz2-8, Rz2-18, Rz2-22, and Rz2-24) were established. HCV expression was induced using Cre recombinase from a modified Mer-Cre-Mer expression cassette (Fig. 1B) (27Zhang Y. Riesterer C. Ayrall A.M. Sablitzky F. Littlewood T.D. Reth M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (100 nm; referred to as tamoxifen below). These tamoxifen-inducible Rz-Hep cells were designated RzM6 and M13 (parental strain Rz2-18), RzM2-8 (parental strain Rz2-8), RzM2-9 (parental strain Rz2-9), and RzM24 (parental strain Rz24) (Table I). In Rz-Hep cells, expression of full-length HCV RNA (9.6 kb) was induced, and full-length HCV RNA was trimmed precisely at the 5′ and 3′ termini by the ribozyme sequence, which was confirmed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1C) and 5′-dA tailing, the 3′-oligo(A) tailing cloning method, and sequencing (data not shown). All HCV protein expression was induced by tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 1D). Cell Growth Properties of HCV-expressing Hepatocytes during Passage—To examine the modification of cell growth properties by HCV, we passaged full genome HCR6-Rz-expressing HepG2 cells (RzM6, RzM13, RzM24, and the respective parental strains) every 4 days for >40 days (Fig. 1, E and F; and Fig. 2, A and B). After tamoxifen treatment on day 8, Cre-mediated transgene recombination occurred (Fig. 1E). The 2.9-kbp DNA fragment on day 0 and the already recombined 1.8-kbp fragment in response to tamoxifen treatment after day 8 (Fig. 1E, 8, 16, 28, and 44 days) were detected with XbaI- and SalI-digested genomic DNA by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and E). HCV protein was persistently expressed in RzM6 cells up to at least 44 days (Fig. 1F), and this expression was quantitated by fluorescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting (data not shown). The cell growth ratio of RzM6 cells was examined for 44 days (Fig. 2B, panel a); it was reduced to ∼50% in 8∼12 days after the onset of HCV expression by tamoxifen (core protein expression of 3.4 ng/mg of total protein) (Fig. 1F) and then unexpectedly recovered to 100% by 20 days and exceeded 100% at 44 days of passage. In contrast, the cell growth of the parental cell line (Rz2-18) did not show any significant change during passage after tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 2B, panel a). RzM24 cells with 1.2 ng/mg core protein expression on day 8 showed suppression of cell growth to 50% on day 8, but recovered to 100% on day 16, which was faster than the recovery seen for RzM6 cells (Fig. 2B, panel b). Suppression of cell growth by HCR6-Rz on day 8 was also observed in RzM13, RzM2-8, and RzM2-9 cells (data not shown). To define the essential HCV genome region for cell growth modification, truncated 5′-untranslated region-to-NS2 protein (HCR6-Fse), E2-to-3′-untranslated region (HCR6-Age), and core-to-NS5 protein (HCR6-CN5) expression cassettes were introduced into HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A). HCV core protein expression levels in FseM28 and CN5-1 cells were 3.0 and 6.7 ng/mg of total protein, respectively (Table I). The expression levels of NS5B in AgeM8 and CN5-1 cells were almost equivalent to that in RzM6 cells as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). The cell growth properties upon persistent expression of the truncated HCV genome were examined in HCR6-Fse-, HCR6-Age-, and HCR6-CN5-expressing HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A) passaged every 4 days for >44 days (Fig. 2B, panels c–e). HCV protein was persistently expressed in these cell lines after 44 days of passage (data not shown). The cell growth ratio decreased in FseM28 cells on day 8 and recovered within 24 days (Fig. 2B, panel c). No significant change was observed in the growth of AgeM8 cells or parental cell lines (Fig. 2B, panel d). Expression of the full-length HCV protein was induced by the Cre adenovirus and compared with that in cells infected with the Swa adenovirus as a control adenovirus and passaged for 44 days (Fig. 2B). The growth of CN5-1 cells did not show any significant change. To further characterize the process of cell growth modification by HCV, we performed FACS analysis (Table II). Passaged cells were analyzed on days 0, 8, and 44, as these time points occurred prior to HCV expression, at the time of the most retarded cell growth, and when the growth ratio had returned to >100% (Fig. 2A), respectively. Expression of HCR6-Rz and HCR6-Fse retarded the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase after 8 days. At 44 days of passage, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase returned to the level seen prior to HCV expression (Table II).

Using microscale high performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and Edman degradation, we have isolated and characterized from immune-challenged Drosophila two novel induced molecules, under the control of the Imd pathway, that correspond to post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides or peptide fragments. The first molecule is a doubly glycosylated form of drosocin, an O-glycosylated peptide that kills Gram-negative organisms. The second molecule represents a truncated form of the pro-domain of the Drosophila attacin C carrying two post-translational modifications and has significant structural similarities to proline-rich antibacterial peptides including drosocin. We have synthesized this peptide and found that it is active against Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, this activity is potentiated when the peptide is used in combination with the Drosophila antimicrobial peptide cecropin A. The synergistic action observed between these two molecules suggests that the truncated post-translationally modified pro-domain of attacin C by itself may play an important role in the antimicrobial defense of Drosophila.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has recently become a recognized genetic tool for studying innate immunity. Drosophila lacks an adaptive immune system and, like other insects, has developed rapid and efficient defense reactions in response to microbial infections. These mechanisms, which involve both humoral and cellular reactions, show evident similarities to the innate immune response observed in vertebrates. An important part of the insect systemic response to a microbial infection is the production of peptides that are directly active against the invasive microorganisms. In Drosophila, seven distinct inducible antimicrobial peptide families have been defined (for reviews, see Refs. 1Meister M. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 248: 17-36PubMed Google Scholar and 2Bulet P. Médecine/science. 1999; 15: 23-29Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These peptides are grouped into three families based either on their main antimicrobial activity in vitro or on the activities reported for related peptides isolated from other insects. The first family corresponds to peptides active preferentially on Gram-negative bacteria: drosocin, cecropin(s), diptericin(s), and attacin(s). The second family corresponds to defensin that is active mainly against Gram-positive bacteria. Finally, the last group of peptides consists of drosomycin and the metchnikowins that are active against fungi. Two distinct signaling pathways (Toll and Immune deficiency or Imd) have been identified, which control the expression of these antimicrobial peptides (reviewed in Refs. 3Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar and 4Hultmark D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The Toll pathway was shown to participate in the defense against infections by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, whereas an infection with Gram-negative bacteria activates the Imd pathway (5Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Molecular and genetic studies allowed the partial characterization of these two pathways, both of which involve members of the Rel family of transcription factors. Recently, it has been shown that peptidoglycan recognition proteins are involved in the recognition of microbes upstream of the Toll and Imd pathways (Refs. 6Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar and 7Gottar M. Gobert V. Michel T. Belvin M. Duyk G. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Royet J.

In addition, the Toll pathway can be jointly activated by another pattern recognition protein, identified as GNBP1 (9Gobert V. Gottar M. Matskevich A.A. Rutschmann S. Royet J. Belvin M. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Science. 2003; 302: 2126-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Recent studies by mass spectrometry have outlined that, in addition to antimicrobial peptides, other peptides are induced and secreted into the hemolymph of experimentally challenged fruit flies. A differential display study by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP, reversed-phase; MS, mass spectrometry; DIM, Drosophila immune-induced molecule; MPAC, maturated pro-domain of attacin C; FIC, fractional inhibitory concentration; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Z, pyroglutamic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP, reversed-phase; MS, mass spectrometry; DIM, Drosophila immune-induced molecule; MPAC, maturated pro-domain of attacin C; FIC, fractional inhibitory concentration; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Z, pyroglutamic acid. mass spectrometry (MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on hemolymph collected from experimentally infected and from non-infected flies led to the detection of at least 24 immune-induced molecules referred to as DIMs for Drosophila immune-induced molecules (10Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Moniatte M. Lagueux M. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11342-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Bulet P. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Kamp R.M. Kyriakidis D. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Proteome and Protein Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 157-174Crossref Google Scholar). The 24 DIMs have molecular masses ranging from 1.5 to 11 kDa. In parallel, mRNAs coding for most of these DIMs were found up-regulated after microbial infection in mRNA-based approaches (12Irving P. Troxler L. Heuer T.S. Belvin M. Kopczynski C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15119-15124Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 13De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12590-12595Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Four of these DIMs correspond to previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, namely DIM-9 and -11 to two glycoforms of drosocin and DIM-17 and -19 to metchnikowin and drosomycin, respectively. Although the primary structures of DIM-1, -2, and -4 have been characterized by Edman degradation (10Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Moniatte M. Lagueux M. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11342-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), tandem MS was required to characterize DIM-13 (14Carte L. Cavusoglu N. Leize E. Charlet M. Bulet P. Van Dorsselaer A. Eur. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 7: 399-408Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In flies mutated in the Imd pathway, the HPLC peaks corresponding to the two glycoforms of drosocin (DIM-9 and -11) and those of DIM-15 and -16 were undetectable, or considerably lower. In contrast, in Toll loss-of-function mutants, only DIM-9, -11, -15, and -16 were induced after an experimental infection, confirming that the Imd pathway regulates their expression. Here we investigated the primary structure and biological function of the Imd pathway-dependent peptides DIM-15 and -16. First, we isolated both DIMs and characterized their primary structures. DIM-15, with a mass detected at m/z 2768.6, corresponds to a doubly glycosylated form of drosocin (DIM-11, -15). DIM-16 (m/z 2972.1) corresponds to a post-translationally truncated version of the pro-domain of yet another antibacterial peptide from Drosophila, attacin C (16Hedengren M. Borge K. Hultmark D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 20: 574-581Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Due to important structural similarities with proline-rich antibacterial peptides from insects, we further synthesized DIM-16 analogs and investigated their antimicrobial activity. Insect Immunization and Hemolymph Collection—Two- to three-day-old Drosophila melanogaster Oregon R adults were experimentally infected with a mixture of two bacteria (Micrococcus luteus as Gram-positive strain and Escherichia coli as Gram-negative strain), and the hemolymph (20 batches of 60 flies) of 24-h challenged flies was collected according to a procedure reported previously (10Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Moniatte M. Lagueux M. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11342-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The acidified hemolymph was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and frozen until HPLC analysis. Isolation and Structural Characterization of DIM-15 and -16 —Three steps of reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC were required to purify DIM-15 and DIM-16. The hemolymph extract (equivalent to 120 flies/run) was loaded to a microbore RP column (Aquapore RP 300 C8, 1 × 100 mm, Brownlee™) equilibrated in 2% acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 2–62% acetonitrile over 60 min at a flow rate of 80 μl/min at 35 °C. The hand-collected fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Fractions containing molecules with either the molecular mass of 2767.6 Da corresponding to DIM-15 or the molecular mass of 2971.1 Da corresponding to DIM-16 were pooled separately, concentrated under vacuum (Speed-Vac, Savant™), and subjected to further purification. Two additional RP-HPLC runs were required to purify DIM-15 and -16. During the second step of purification of DIM-15 and -16, the same column was used, but the fractions were eluted using linear biphasic gradients of acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 80 μl/min and at 35 °C, from 2 to 22% over 10 min and from 22 to 37% over 50 min. The final purification step for DIM-15 was performed on a narrow bore RP column (Delta-Pak HPI C18, 2 × 150 mm, Waters™) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min and at 35 °C with a linear biphasic gradient of acetonitrile (2–10% over 5 min and of 10–35% over 75 min). For the final purification of DIM-16, the same column as for the first step was used, but the fractions were eluted with a linear biphasic gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at 35 °C and at a flow rate of 80 μl/min from 2 to 22% over 10 min and from 22 to 32% over 50 min. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed on a Bruker (Bremen, Germany) BIFLEX III™ mass spectrometer in a linear positive ion mode. Samples were prepared according to the sandwich method (17Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgotodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (432) Google Scholar) following the procedure detailed previously (18Vizioli J. Bulet P. Hoffmann J.A Kafatos F.C. Muller H.M. Dimopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2630-2635Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The spectrometer was calibrated using external standard Drosophila antimicrobial peptides (drosocin, metchnikowin, and drosomycin at 2199.5, 3046.4, and 4890.5 in MH+, respectively). Synthetic DIM-16 was used for internal calibration during the quantitative analysis of the isolated material. Enzymatic Digestions—Purified DIM-16 was treated with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Roche Applied Science) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.1) containing 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 5% glycerol (v/v). The incubation was carried out for 6 h at 50 °C in the presence of 0.5 μg of enzyme. The reaction was stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid, and the reaction products were analyzed by microbore RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS. Purified DIM-16 was subjected to cleavage by chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science). Digestion was performed in 100 mm Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 during 210 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped with trifluoroacetic acid, and the products of digestion were purified by capillary RP-HPLC (Fusica C18, 0.3 × 150 mm, PepMap™) at a flow rate of 4 μl/min and at 30 °C. The fragment of interest, identified by MALDI-TOF MS, was sequenced by Edman degradation. Purified DIM-16 was diluted in 10 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0) and incubated at 25 °C. Aliquots (10 ng/μl) of carboxypeptidase P (Roche Applied Science) were added, and digestion was monitored by MALDI-TOF MS. Enzyme was added during a period of 6 h, reaching a final quantity of 80 ng. Microsequence Analysis—Automated Edman degradation of DIM-15, the decyclicized pro-domain of attacin C and of a fragment resulting from chymotrypsin digestion was performed using a pulse liquid automatic protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Procise cLC, model 492). Peptide Synthesis—The unglycosylated 23-mer (pQRPYTQPLIYYPPPPTPPRIYRA) DIM-16 and two glycosylated analogs (GalNAc, Gal-NAc-Gal) at position Thr-16 were synthesized by conventional solid-phase methods. The assembly was made on a Rainin PS3 automated synthesizer on TentaGel S-Ram-Fmoc resin with an initial load of 0.3 mmol/g (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY). Standard Fmoc chemistry was used throughout with 4 m excess of the acylating amino acids and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole uronium salt activation. The glycoamino acids, Fmoc-Thr(peracetyl-GalNAcα1-O)-OPfp and Fmoc-Thr(Ac4-Gal-β (1,3)-Ac2-GalNAcα1-O)-OPfp, purchased from Oxford Glycosystem and Bachem, respectively, were incorporated in the same manner as the unmodified amino acids, except that they were coupled in 1.5 m excess (to reduce glycoamino acid usage) in the presence of diisopropyl-ethylamine. The resulting glycopeptides as well as unmodified 23-mer peptide were cleaved from the solid support with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of 5% thioanisole and 5% water as scavengers for 2 h. Deacetylation of the sugar hydroxyl group was accomplished by a short treatment with 0.1 m NaOH (19Otvos Jr., L. Urge L. Xiang Z.Q. Krivulka G.R. Nagy L. Szendrei G.I. Ertl H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A second set of unglycosylated DIM-16 was synthesized according to a classical Fmoc chemistry as described previously (20Neimark J. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides were purified by solid-phase extraction and preparative RP-HPLC, and peptide purity and integrity were monitored by MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial Assays—The antimicrobial activity of the synthetic variants of DIM-16 (final concentration range, 0.1–200 μm) was determined against selected bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast using growth inhibition assays according to Hetru and Bulet (21Hetru C. Bulet P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 78: 35-49PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) corresponds to the concentration required for 100% growth inhibition. Synergy among DIM-16 and (i) two Drosophila antimicrobial peptides, namely cecropin A and drosocin and (ii) pyrrhocoricin, an O-glycosylated proline-rich antimicrobial peptide from the bug Pyrrhocoris apterus (22Cociancich S. Dupont A. Hegy G. Lanot R. Holder F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was tested using the checkerboard microtiter assay (23Amsterdam D. Loman V. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine. 4th Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1996: 52-111Google Scholar). To detect a possible reduction of the MIC values of each peptide when used in combination, 2-fold serial dilutions of one peptide were tested against 2-fold serial dilutions of the other peptide. Results were expressed as the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index according to the following formula: FIC = (A)/MICA + (B)/MICB where MICA and MICB are the MICs of peptides A and B tested alone and (A) and (B) are the MICs of the two peptides tested in combination. A FIC index below 1 is taken to indicate synergy; the values at 1, 2, and 4 represent additive activity, no effect, and antagonism, respectively (24Patrzykat A. Zhang L. Mendoza V. Iwama G.K. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1337-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The strains used were from private and public collections (25Silva Jr., P.I. Daffre S. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33464-33470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Purification and Primary Structure Determination of the Pro-domain of Attacin C—Using differential display by MALDI-TOF MS RP HPLC, and Edman sequencing, we have purified and characterized DIM-15 (2767.6 Da) and DIM-16 (2971.1 Da), two peptides that are under the control of the Imd pathway. As first step of purification, 10 runs of micro-RP-HPLC were made on hemolymph collected from a total of 1,200 challenged flies to isolate a sufficient amount of material for structural identification. The fractions containing DIM-15, selected by MALDI-TOF MS measurements, were pooled, and DIM-15 was purified to homogeneity using two additional steps of RP-HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis by MALDI-TOF MS, Edman sequencing of the first 11 residues, and data bank searches in the Drosophila genome allowed us to unambiguously identify DIM-15 as a peptide with the primary structure of drosocin (data not shown). Mass spectrometry indicated a difference of 203 Da between the measured mass and the calculated one. This result, combined with the lack of phenylthiohydantoin-derivative signal at position 7 (a serine residue in drosocin) during the sequencing, indicated that in addition to Thr-11, DIM-15 has a glycosylation site at Ser-7. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the substitution at this site corresponds to an N-acetylhexosamine, as does that of Thr-11 in drosocin (15Bulet P. Dimarcq J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We concluded that DIM-15 is a drosocin variant that carries two carbohydrate moieties, one on Ser-7 and one Thr-11 (sequences of drosocin and DIM-15 are reported in Fig. 4). To purify DIM-16, a similar procedure, combining micro-RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS, was used. The fractions containing DIM-16 (∼2971 Da), selected by MALDI-TOF MS measurement, were pooled, and DIM-16 was purified to homogeneity (as judged by MALDI-TOF MS) using two additional chromatography steps (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1A). A fraction aliquot of the purified molecule was subjected to Edman degradation. Because no phenylthiohydantoin-derivative signal was observed in any of the 15 cycles of sequencing, DIM-16 was suspected to be N-terminally blocked by a pyroglutamic acid. To characterize the nature of the potential N-terminal modification, an aliquot of the native peptide was subjected to pyroglutamate aminopeptidase digestion. The digest products were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS, and the mass spectra of the original and the digested forms were compared. This exercise revealed a mass difference of 111 Da between the native molecule at m/z 2972.38 and the truncated form at m/z 2861.49 (Fig. 1B), indicating the loss of a pyroglutamate residue after digestion. After purification by RP-HPLC, the truncated peptide at m/z 2861.49 was subjected to Edman degradation. The following partial 12-residue sequence was obtained: RPYTQPLIYYPP. To obtain further information on the C-terminal part of DIM-16, an aliquot of the native peptide was subjected to a time course treatment with carboxypeptidase P. The highest mass was detected at m/z 2901.33, corresponding to a loss of 70.38 Da, as compared with the native peptide at m/z 2971.71. This difference is equivalent to that of an alanine residue. The successive mass losses of 156.53, 163.11, and 113.03 Da identified the C-terminal sequence for DIM-16 as (Ile/Leu)-Tyr-Arg-Ala-COOH (Fig. 1C). Based on the mass difference of the full peptide and the combined masses of the N-terminal (Edman degradation) and C-terminal (carboxypeptidase treatment) fragments, we concluded that a few unidentified residues connected these domains. To complete the sequence analysis, DIM-16 was subjected to endopeptidase digestion with chymotrypsin, and the digest was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and capillary RP-HPLC. A fragment at m/z 1777.19 was purified and sequenced by Edman degradation. The following 13-residue sequence was obtained: IYYPPPPX-PPRIY in which an ambiguous signal was observed at position 8 (noted by X). This sequence overlapped five residues (IYYPP) with the N-terminal sequence established by Edman degradation and two residues (IY) with the results of the C-terminal sequencing identifying the amino acid sequence of DIM-16 as ZRPYTQPLIYYPPPPXPPRIYRA where Z stands for pyroglutamic acid and X is a modified residue. This sequence was fed to the FASTA.GENOME data base, which used the Blosum50 scoring matrix (fasta.genome.ad.jp/sit-bin/nph-fasta) and identified DIM-16 as a post-translationally modified and truncated form of the pro-domain (LPQRPYTQPLIYYPPPPTPPRIYRARR) of attacin C, an antimicrobial polypeptide from Drosophila (accession number AF322248 (Ref. 16Hedengren M. Borge K. Hultmark D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 20: 574-581Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar)). For this reason, the purified DIM-16 will be referred to as maturated Pro-domain of Attacin C (MPAC). In view of the sequence of the pro-domain of attacin C, we postulated that X could correspond to a threonine residue decorated by a post-translational substitution. The mass difference (202.33 Da) observed between the calculated mass at m/z 1574.86 for IYYPPPPTPPRIY and the sequenced fragment measured at m/z 1777.19 (see above) could correspond to an N-acetylhexosamine addition to the threonine residue (i.e. 221–18 Da for the loss of a molecule of water). These data lead us to conclude that MPAC corresponds to a 23-residue post-translationally modified form of the pro-domain of attacin C with the sequence ZRPYTQPLIYYPPPPTPPRIYRA and with Thr-16 O-glycosylated (Fig. 1D). As compared with the pro-domain of attacin C, MPAC is (i) lacking N- and C-terminal dipeptides, (ii) bearing a N terminus pyroglutamate, and (iii) carrying an O-glycosylation. The amino acid similarities in general and the presence of a large number of proline residues (35%) in particular, together with the presence of the threonine bearing an O-glycosylation, are strikingly reminiscent of the molecular architecture of the proline-rich antimicrobial peptides from insects and mainly of drosocin from Drosophila (for a review, see Ref. 26Bulet P. Hetru C. Dimarcq J.L. Hoffmann D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, and also, see “Discussion” in the present study). To complete the structural and functional analysis of MPAC, we conducted two additional assays. First, we quantified the peptide amount produced in the hemolymph of flies experimentally infected with bacteria known to be efficient inducers of attacin C synthesis (16Hedengren M. Borge K. Hultmark D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 20: 574-581Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Second, we investigated the potential antimicrobial properties of MPAC using different synthetic variants that included two glycosylated forms and the unsubstituted version. Time Course of Induction and Quantification of MPAC—The level of MPAC in the hemolymph of adult Drosophila was measured by MALDI-TOF MS at different time intervals (from 1 to 48 h) after experimental infection with living M. luteus, E. coli 1106, or Enterobacter cloacae β12. The peak height of a molecule at a molecular mass of 6.8 kDa (data not shown), present in the hemolymph of control, or infected, adult Drosophila at a constant concentration, was used to normalize the MALDI mass spectra. MPAC was not detectable during the first hour following the experimental infection, regardless of the bacterial strain used for the infection. The peptide was detected as early as 3 h after infection with M. luteus and E. coli 1106, but no MPAC signal was observed until 6 h after challenge with E. cloacae β12. After challenge with M. luteus and E. coli 1106, the level of MPAC reached a plateau 6 h after infection, and then the peptide amount slowly decreased. In contrast, after infection with E. cloacae β12, the highest values were observed only 24 h after infection and remained at a rather high level during two additional days (Fig. 2). When the chromatography and the mass spectrometry systems were calibrated with known concentrations of synthetic glycosylated MPAC, the physiological concentration of MPAC circulating in the hemolymph 15 h after challenge was estimated at 5 μm with E. cloacae β12 and 1 μm with M. luteus and E. coli 1106 (data not shown). Antimicrobial Activities of MPAC (Table I)—To study the antimicrobial properties of MPAC, an unglycosylated form and two glycosylated (GalNAc, GalNAc-Gal) versions were chemically synthesized. After purification by RP-HPLC and control of the purity and integrity by MALDI-TOF MS, the antibacterial activity of aqueous solutions (0.1–200 μm, in final concentration) of the different variants was assayed against several microorganisms. Due to the limited amounts of the synthetic glycopeptides, only three strains of the Gram-negative E. coli (D22, D31, and SBS 363), very sensitive to drosocin (27Bulet P. Urge L. Ohresser S. Hetru C. Otvos Jr., L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), were investigated for their susceptibility to MPAC. No growth inhibition was observed for either synthetic MPAC derivative after 24 h of culture at 30 °C in Poor Broth medium at the highest concentration tested (200 μm). However, at a shorter time of culture (17 h), unglycosylated MPAC and MPAC carrying one and two sugars inhibited the bacterial growth by 30–50%, 50–65%, and 65–90%, respectively. Among all the other bacteria (Gram-positive, Gram-negative), yeast cells, and filamentous fungi studied (Table I), none of the strains was affected by unglycosylated MPAC at 200 μm under identical conditions. Due to the particular mode of action, recently proposed for the proline-rich antimicrobial peptides and which proceeds through interaction with intracellular target molecules (28Otvos Jr., L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3016-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), we first examined the synergy between unglycosylated MPAC and a membrane-active antimicrobial peptide, Drosophila cecropin A (CecA). In the presence of CecA at a concentration twice below the MIC value, where the microorganisms are growing, a decrease in the MIC value of MPAC was observed against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested (Table I). The highest decrease was observed with E. cloacae β12, for which 3.1 μm MPAC combined with 0.8 μm (MIC/2) CecA was sufficient to have 100% growth inhibition, whereas at 200 μm, MPAC alone had no effect. No effect on the growth of the enthomopathogen bacteria Serratia marcescens was detected with MPAC when applied in combination with CecA. Among the four Gram-positive bacterial strains tested, only M. luteus and Bacillus megaterium were sensitive to 200 μm MPAC in the presence of CecA. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were still resistant to the combined solutions of CecA and MPAC. Among the two filamentous fungi and the four yeast strains tested, only the growth of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa was affected. In this case, the MPAC MIC decreased to 100 μm in presence of"

Activation of σF depends on the membrane-bound phosphatase SpoIIE, which localizes to the septum, and on the formation of the polar septum itself. SpoIIE is responsible for dephosphorylating and thereby activating the phosphoprotein SpoIIAA, which, in turn, triggers the release of σF from the anti-σF factor SpoIIAB. Paradoxically, however, the presence of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA is insufficient to cause σF activation as SpoIIAA reaches substantial levels in mutants blocked in polar septation. We now describe mutants of SpoIIE, SpoIIAA, and SpoIIAB that break the dependence of σF activation on polar division. Analysis of these mutants indicates that unphosphorylated SpoIIAA must reach a threshold concentration in order to trigger the release of σF from SpoIIAB. Evidence is presented that this threshold is created by the action of SpoIIAB, which can form an alternative, long lived complex with SpoIIAA. We propose that formation of the SpoIIAA-SpoIIAB complex serves as a sink that traps SpoIIAA in an inactive state and that only when unphosphorylated SpoIIAA is in excess to the sink does activation of σF take place.

Cellular differentiation often depends on the establishment of differential gene expression between two progeny cells following asymmetric cell division. An attractive developmental system for studying the establishment of differential gene expression is endospore formation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis (1Piggot P.J. Losick R. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relative: From Genes to Cells. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 483-518Google Scholar). Endospore formation involves the formation of an asymmetrically positioned septum that divides the developing cell (the sporangium) into unequally sized progeny called the forespore (the smaller cell) and the mother cell. The earliest event in establishing differential gene expression is the activation in the forespore of the transcription factor σF, a member of the RNA polymerase sigma factor family of prokaryotic transcription factors (2Fort P.

A key to the rapid activation of σF following polar division is that the transcription factor is synthesized in the predivisional sporangium but is held in an inactive complex by the anti-σF factor SpoIIAB (6Gholamhoseinian A.

Once the polar septum is complete, σF is released from the SpoIIAB-σF complex by the action of the anti-anti-σF factor SpoIIAA. SpoIIAA reacts with the SpoIIAB-σF complex to cause the discharge of the free and active σF (8Duncan L. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The conversion of SpoIIAA to SpoIIAA-P is mediated by SpoIIAB, which in addition to being an anti-σF factor is a protein kinase that phosphorylates SpoIIAA on serine residue 58 (9Min K.T.

For simplicity, we henceforth refer to SpoIIAA and SpoIIAA-P as AA and AA-P, respectively, and SpoIIAB as AB. SpoIIE is an 827-residue-long integral membrane protein with 10 membrane-spanning segments in its N-terminal region (region I) (19Arigoni F. Guerout-Fleury A.M. Barak I. Stragier P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a region (region III) that is homologous to the PP2C family of eukaryotic phosphatases near its C terminus (20Adler E. Donella-Deana A. Arigoni F. Pinna L.A. Stragler P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a 250-amino acid-long central region (region II) that exhibits little or no similarity to other nonorthologous proteins in the data bases. Evidence indicates that region II mediates interactions between SpoIIE molecules and with the cytokinetic protein FtsZ (21Lucet I. Feucht A. Yudkin M.D. Errington J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and also that region II contributes significantly to the activity of σF (22Barak I. Behari J. Olmedo G. Guzman P. Brown D.P. Castro E. Walker D. Westpheling J. Youngman P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1047-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Barak I. Youngman P. J.

The SpoIIE phosphatase localizes to the polar septum (26Arigoni F. Pogliano K. Webb C.D. Stragier P. Losick R. Science. 1995; 270: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and evidence indicates that this localization contributes to, but is not exclusively responsible for, the forespore-specific activation of σF (19Arigoni F. Guerout-Fleury A.M. Barak I. Stragier P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also contributing to the cell-specific activation of σF is the delayed entry of the gene (spoIIAB) for AB into the forespore, which is believed to result in the partial depletion of the anti-σF factor in the forespore due to the proteolytic instability of the protein (27Dworkin J. Losick R. Cell. 2001; 107: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Pan Q. Garsin D.A. Losick R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The activation of σF is known to be almost entirely dependent upon the formation of the polar septum (29Beall B. Lutkenhaus J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 30Levin P.A. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Daniel R.A. Harris E.J. Katis V.L. Wake R.G. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, dephosphorylation of AA-P is not strongly dependent upon septum formation. Mutants blocked in asymmetric division accumulate substantial levels of unphosphorylated AA yet fail to activate σF (24King N. Dreesen O. Stragier P. Pogliano K. Losick R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1156-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Feucht A. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Mol.

These observations led to the view that unphosphorylated AA must reach a threshold concentration before it can activate σF (25Feucht A. Abbotts L. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Feucht A. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for such a threshold has been mysterious. Here we report on the characterization of amino acid substitutions of SpoIIE that block σF activation. We show that certain substitutions lying in region II and hence outside the phosphatase domain of SpoIIE nevertheless strongly impair dephosphorylation of AA-P in vivo. We show that the effects of these substitutions can be reversed by other amino acid changes in SpoIIE, an amino acid change in the catalytic center of the AB kinase, or an amino acid substitution in AA. We show that all of these suppressors act by increasing the level of unphosphorylated AA in the cell. Importantly, amino acid substitutions that greatly increase the level of unphosphorylated AA result in the activation of σF in a manner that does not depend upon septum formation, a finding consistent with the idea that a threshold level of unphosphorylated AA must be reached in order for σF to be activated. Finally, we present evidence consistent with the idea that this threshold is established by the formation of an alternative complex between AA and AB that traps the anti-anti-σF factor in an inactive state. Formation of the AA-AB complex could act as a buffer to prevent activation of σF prior to the formation of the polar septum and in the mother cell after asymmetric division.

The wild type spoIIE gene and mutants of spoIIE were introduced at the amyE locus via double crossover recombination of pKC2, and its derivatives were linearized by XhoI digestion. The entire spoIIE coding sequence and upstream regulatory region were obtained by HincII/BamHI digestion of pNK1 (gift from Nicole King). (pNK1 was constructed by insertion of spoIIE DNA extending from 400 bp upstream of the start codon (to the chromosomal HincII site) to 11 bp downstream from the stop codon into pUK19.) The spoIIE-containing, HincII-BamHI fragment was cloned into pLD30 (36Garsin D.A. Paskowitz D.M. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol.

A wild type spoIIE-gfp fusion was constructed via Campbell integration of pPE1 (24King N. Dreesen O. Stragier P. Pogliano K. Losick R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1156-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of pPE1 was used to introduce the V697A mutation into the coding sequence of spoIIE creating pKC41. A spoIIE-V697A-gfp gene fusion was constructed by Campbell integration of pKC41 followed by screening transformants for a Spo– phenotype. spoIIAA was introduced at the amyE locus via double crossover recombination of pKC33 linearized by XhoI digestion. The entire spoIIAA coding sequence plus 100 nucleotides upstream (including the promoter) was PCR-amplified from PY79 genomic DNA with oligonucleotides that added a HindIII site to the 5′ end and a BamHI site to the 3′ end. The PCR fragment was digested by HindIII and BamHI and ligated into pDG364 (37Karmazyn-Campelli C. Fluss L. Leighton T. Stragier P. Biochimie. 1992; 74: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes to create pKC33. spoIIAB was introduced to the amyE locus via double crossover recombination of pLD28 (36Garsin D.A. Paskowitz D.M. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) linearized with XhoI digestion. Site-directed mutagenesis of pLD28 was used to introduce the R105C mutation into the coding sequence of spoIIAB, creating pKC59. Wild type spoIIAA and spoIIAB-R105C were introduced together at the amyE locus via double crossover recombination of pKC67 linearized with XhoI digestion. The promoter region and entire coding sequence of spoIIAA and spoIIAB-R105C was PCR-amplified from KC332 genomic DNA with oligonucleotides that added a HindIII site to the 5′ end of the PCR fragment and a BamHI site the 3′ end. The PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into pDG364 (37Karmazyn-Campelli C. Fluss L. Leighton T. Stragier P. Biochimie. 1992; 74: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes to create pKC67. amyE::PXyl-spoIIAA-S58A cat was integrated into the chromosome via double crossover recombination of pKC24. pKC24 was created by amplifying the entire coding sequence for spoIIAA-S58A from pLD23 (14Duncan L. Alper S. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with a forward primer (5′-GGCAAGCTTGGGACATAAGGAGGAACTACTAYGAGCCTTGGAATTGAC) that added a HindIII restriction site and an ideal ribosome binding site (38Vellanoweth R.L. Rabinowitz J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) to the 5′ end of the gene and a reverse primer that added a BamHI site just 3′ to the stop codon. The PCR fragment was digested by HindIII and BamHI and cloned into pOR277ΔSal (39Gueiros-Filho F.J. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2544-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. The spectinomycin resistance marker of strains containing amyE::pPE27 (spoIIE-Q483A spc) was changed to tetracycline resistance via double crossover recombination with pPE19. pPE19 is a derivative of pDG1514 (40Guerout-Fleury A.M. Shazand K. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) containing the 5′ end of spoIIE (400 nucleotides upstream to 1068 nucleotides downstream from the start of the coding sequence) on the 5′ side of the tetracycline resistance gene, in the opposite orientation. The tetracycline resistance gene in pPE19 is flanked on the 3′ end by the 3′ end of the amyE gene (“amy back”) derived from the fragment released by EcoRV/BglII digestion of pDG1662 (41Guerout-Fleury A.M. Frandsen N. Stragier P. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). An in-frame deletion of spoIIAA linked to the spectinomycin resistance marker was obtained by transformation of linearized pNK7 (gift from Nicole King) into PY79 to create RL2218. pNK7 was created by ligating the ScaI/BspDI fragment containing an in-frame deletion of spoIIAA from pLD28 (36Garsin D.A. Paskowitz D.M. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) into pLD19 (14Duncan L. Alper S. Losick R. J. Mol.

Selection for Suppressors of spoIIE-S361F and spoIIE-Q483A—The oligosporogenous strains KC308 or KC29 were inoculated into 100 ml of DS medium (42Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), and cultures were incubated with shaking in a 37 °C water bath for 30 h to induce sporulation by nutrient exhaustion. Thirty ml of the culture were incubated in an 80 °C water bath for 20 min to kill cells that failed to develop into mature spores. The heat-treated culture was diluted and plated to determine the number of heat-resistant spores/ml, and ∼100 of the colonies that arose from surviving spores were patched to DS agar plates containing 80 μg/ml X-gal 1The abbreviations used are: X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; IEF, isoelectric focusing. to assay for σF-dependent lacZ expression. The heat-treated culture was diluted into 300 ml of fresh DS medium and incubated in a 37 °C shaking water bath for 30 h. The heat kill, plating, patching, and dilution procedure was repeated for several rounds until the colonies from the surviving spores exhibited σF-dependent lacZ activity on DS agar plates containing X-gal and bred true as sporulation-proficient strains. This took two rounds of enrichment for KC308, which produces ∼104 spores/ml (versus ∼5 × 108 spores/ml for the wild type), and five rounds of enrichment for KC29, which produces ∼2 × 107 spores/ml. Genomic DNA was prepared from several Spo+ suppressor mutants, and the linkage of the mutation to the antibiotic resistance gene associated with either spoIIE or the spoIIA operon were determined by backcrossing into RL2220 for mutations in KC308 and RL2114 for mutations in KC29. The mutated genes were then amplified from the genomic DNA by PCR and sequenced to identify the nucleotide changes. Two independent selections were carried out for each strain. Four mutants were sequenced in the first selection of KC308 suppressors, and 12 were sequenced from the second. The same three mutations in spoIIE (V697A, Q342P, and R502L) were the only mutants identified in both selections. Four mutants were sequenced from the first selection of KC29 suppressors, and 11 were sequenced from the second. Each mutation sequenced was unique with the exception of spoIIEK649T, which was present in two independent colonies, both isolated in the same selection. It is unknown if these two colonies were siblings or mutated independently. Sporulation Conditions Used for Monitoring β-Galactosidase Activity and Carrying Out Immunoblotting Experiments—Cells were induced to sporulate by the resuspension method (43Nicholson W.L. Setlow P. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 391-450Google Scholar). All cultures were grown and sporulated at 37 °C except in experiments with strains harboring the div355 allele. For these experiments, all strains were grown in culture medium at the permissive temperature (28 °C) to an A600 of ∼0.6 and shifted to the restrictive temperature (37 °C) upon resuspension in sporulation salts. One-ml aliquots of each culture were harvested by centrifugation at different time points after the start of sporulation, and the cell pellets were stored at –70 °C until further analysis. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Harwood and Cutting (35Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblot Analysis— Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 0.3 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I) in a volume proportional to the A600 of the culture at the time the samples were harvested (0.1 ml of lysis buffer/1 OD unit) and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min. For IEF, cell lysates were mixed in a 1:1 volume with 2× IEF sample buffer (8 m urea, 2.6% (v/v) ampholytes, pH 5–6 (Pharmalyte; Amersham Biosciences), 2% Triton X-100, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide IEF slab gel containing 8 m urea and 2.6% (v/v) ampholytes, pH 5–6 (Pharmalyte; Amersham Biosciences). The gel was run at 200 V for 30 min followed by 2.5 h at 300 V with 10 mm phosphoric acid as the anolyte and 20 mm NaOH as the catholyte. The protein was electroblotted at 20 V overnight (transfer buffer was 25 mm Tris, 193 mm glycine, 20% methanol) to Immobilin-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). For SDS-PAGE analysis, cell lysates were mixed in a 4:1 volume with 5× SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), separated on an 18% polyacrylamide gel run at 150 V for 2 h, and electroblotted to Immobilin-P membrane at 200 mA for 1 h. For both IEF and SDS-PAGE, Immobilin-P membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.5% Tween 20 and probed with affinity-purified rabbit anti-SpoIIAA (1:5000), rabbit anti-SpoIIAB (1: 10,000), rabbit anti-σF (1:10,000), or rabbit anti-σA (1:10,000) antibodies. Primary antibody was detected using 125I-labeled donkey antirabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and a phosphor-imaging plate (Fuji). Region II of SpoIIE Influences Phosphatase Activity—SpoIIE consists of three domains, an N-terminal region (I) that is composed of multiple membrane-spanning segments (19Arigoni F. Guerout-Fleury A.M. Barak I. Stragier P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a C-terminal region (III) that corresponds to the catalytic center (20Adler E.

https://openalex.org/W2052798139,"Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, is sensitive to penicillins. Yet, an abundant membrane-bound protein of this organism, Tp47, turns over penicillins. It is shown herein that the turnover process is a hydrolytic reaction that results in the corresponding penicilloates, products that have their β-lactam bonds hydrolyzed. This is the reaction of β-lactamases, bona fide resistance enzymes to β-lactam antibiotics. Remarkably, the x-ray structure of Tp47 bears no resemblance to any other β-lactamases or the related penicillin-binding proteins. Furthermore, evidence is presented that the reaction of Tp47 takes place in the absence of the zinc ion and does not involve intermediary acyl enzyme species. Hence, the β-lactamase activity of Tp47 is the fifth known mechanism for turnover of β-lactam antibiotics. Tp47 also exhibits a penicillin binding reaction, in the process of which the enzyme is covalently modified in the active site. The two reactions take place in two different active sites, and the events of the β-lactamase activity are over 2,000-fold more rapid than the penicillin binding reaction. The level of β-lactamase activity is high and is held back only by a strong product-inhibition component to the catalytic process. If natural selection would result in a mutant variant of Tp47 that overcomes product inhibition for the β-lactamase activity, a novel bona fide resistance to penicillins will emerge in Treponema, which will be a disconcerting clinical development. The physiological functions of Tp47 are not known, but it is likely that this is at least a bifunctional enzyme involved in the processing of the Treponema peptidoglycan as a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2086041097,"The sodium- and chloride-dependent γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT-1 is the first identified member of a family of transporters, which maintain low synaptic neurotransmitter levels and thereby enable efficient synaptic transmission. To obtain evidence for the idea that the highly conserved transmembrane domain I (TMD I) participates in the permeation pathway, we have determined the impact of impermeant methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents on cysteine residues engineered into this domain. As a background the essentially insensitive but fully active C74A mutant has been used. Transport activity of mutants with a cysteine introduced cytoplasmic to glycine 63 is largely unaffected and is resistant to the impermeant MTS reagents. Conversely, transport activity in mutants extracellular to glycine 63 is strongly impacted. Nevertheless, transport activity could be measured in all but three mutants: G65C, N66C, and R69C. In each of the six active cysteine mutants the activity is highly sensitive to the impermeant MTS reagents. This sensitivity is potentiated by sodium in L64C, F70C, and Y72C, but is protected in V67C and P71C. GABA protects in L64C, W68C, F70C, and P71C. The non-transportable GABA analogue SKF100330A also protects in L64C, W68C, and P71C as well as V67C, but strikingly potentiates inhibition in F70C. Although cysteine substitution in this region may have perturbed the native structure of GAT-1, our observations, taken together with the recently published accessibility study on the related serotonin transporter (Henry, L. K., Adkins, E. M., Han, Q., and Blakely, R. D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 37052–37063), suggest that the extracellular part of TMD I is conformationally sensitive, lines the permeation pathway, and forms a more extended structure than expected from a membrane-embedded α-helix.

Neurotransmitter transporters located in the plasma membranes of cells surrounding the synapse are essential for the overall process of synaptic transmission. One of the best examples of the importance of these neurotransmitter transporters comes from studies of dopamine transporter knock-out mice; the decay of extracellular dopamine in brain slices of such mice is about 100 times longer than normal (1Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Google Scholar). Most neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters and this process is essential to maintain efficient synaptic transmission (for reviews see Refs. 2Kanner B.I. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 237-249Google Scholar and 3Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Google Scholar).

Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Google Scholar) is a particularly well studied member of this family. The transporter catalyzes electrogenic sodium:chloride:GABA cotransport with a stoichiometry of 2:1:1 (6Keynan S. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 12-17Google Scholar, 7Kavanaugh M.P. Arriza J.L.

Hilgemann D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 429-444Google Scholar). There is still some dispute on this issue, as it has been proposed that during sodium-coupled GABA transport obligatory chlorideout/chloridein exchange takes place (10Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. Boorer K.J. Sarkar H.K. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37414-37422Google Scholar). GAT-1, as well as the other members of the family, is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains linked by hydrophilic loops with the amino and carboxyl termini residing inside the cell (5Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Google Scholar). Studies on the serotonin transporter SERT indicate that the theoretical topological model is correct (11Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Google Scholar). GAT-1 has 15 endogenous cysteine residues of which only 3 are located on extracellular loops. Studies on the related dopamine and serotonin transporters indicate that the residues equivalent to cysteine 164 and 173, located in the second extracellular loop, form a disulfide bond (12Wang J.B. Moriaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Google Scholar, 13Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Google Scholar) and would not react with sulfhydryl reagents. Thus cysteine 74, located in the first extracellular loop, is the only cysteine residue that reacts with impermeant MTS reagents. It appears that modification of this residue causes only modest inhibition of GABA transport even when relatively high concentrations of MTSET are used (14Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Google Scholar). The reagent MTSEA has a definite membrane permeability and can react with cysteine 399, which is located on the intracellular loop connecting transmembrane domains VIII and IX (15Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Google Scholar). The accessibility of cysteine 399 is dependent on the conformation of the transporter (15Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies, in particular on GAT-1 and SERT, but also on other members of the family, have identified a conserved tyrosine residue in TMD III critical for neurotransmitter binding (16Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Google Scholar, 17Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Google Scholar). The highly conserved TMD I contains several amino acid residues critical for function, and they have been implicated to play an important role in the interaction with the neurotransmitter (18Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Google Scholar, 19Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Google Scholar), in the determination of the apparent affinity for sodium (19Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Google Scholar, 20Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5404-5414Google Scholar), and the sodium-dependent conversion of the leak mode of the transporter into the coupled mode (19Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Google Scholar). Moreover, TMD I is relatively hydrophilic. These observations suggest that TMD I may participate in the formation of the permeation pathway through the transporter. To address this question, we have studied the impact of impermeant MTS reagents on cysteine residues introduced into all positions of TMD I in the background of the insensitive C74A mutation. Interestingly, our results show that most of the cysteines engineered into the external half of the domain are accessible to impermeant sulfhydryl reagents and this accessibility is strongly modulated by the presence or absence of transporter ligands. Although cysteine substitution in this region may have perturbed the native structure of GAT-1, the pattern of MTS reactivity taken together with the recently published accessibility study on SERT (21Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Google Scholar), suggest that the extracellular half of TMD I lines the permeation pathway and forms a more extended structure than a membrane-embedded α-helix. Generation and Subcloning of Mutants—Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the C74A-GAT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK- (Stratagene) according to the Kunkel (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zarkour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Google Scholar) method as described (23Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Google Scholar). Briefly, the parent DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut-, ung-). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene, using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Mutants were subcloned into a construct containing GAT-1 in the pOG1 vector using the unique restriction enzymes ClaI and AvrII. The above mutants were also subcloned into a construct containing C399A-GAT-1 in the pOG1 vector using the above two restriction sites. The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the above two restriction sites. Transport—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. HeLa cells plated on 24-well plates were infected with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7-3 (24Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Google Scholar) and transfected with cDNA (pBluescript SK- with wild-type or mutant transporter inserted downstream to the T7 promoter) using the transfection reagent DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate) as described (25Keynan S. Suh H.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Google Scholar). Uptake of [3H]GABA into the cells was assayed 18–20 h post-transfection. The wells were washed twice with a solution containing 150 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2. Each well was then incubated with 0.4 μCi of [3H]GABA (99 Ci/mmol) in a NaCl transport solution (150 mm NaCl, with KPi, MgSO4, and CaCl2 as above). Transport reactions were carried out for 10 min at room temperature, and the assay was terminated by washing the cells twice with ice-cold NaCl transport solution. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Labeling of C74A parent and mutant transporters at the cell surface of the HeLa cells, using NHS-SS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide)ethyl-1,3-dipropionate), SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis were all done as described (26Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Google Scholar). 18–20 h post-transfection, HeLa cells plated in 12-well plates were washed twice with 1 ml/well of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/CM (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 2.7 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4 supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2). All further operations were done on ice. Cells were incubated twice with gentle shaking for 20 min with 0.5 ml of 2.5 mm sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide)ethyl-1,3-dipropionate dissolved in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 9.0, supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 150 mm NaCl, and this was followed by a 20-min incubation with 1 ml/well of phosphate-buffered saline/CM supplemented with 100 mm glycine to quench the unreacted biotinylation reagent. The cells were then lysed using 100 μl/well of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer) supplemented with 1% SDS, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After 30 min, 900 μl/well of lysis buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitors but without SDS, was added. The lysates were sonicated for 5 s using a Microson Ultrasonic cell disrupter on setting 6–8, centrifuged for 10 min, and 100 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce catalog number 20349) were added to each supernatant. After end-over-end shaking for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, 2 times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing the protease inhibitors, and finally with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitors. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads using 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and incubated for 10 min at 85 °C, followed by SDS-PAGE. Total samples were obtained by washing cells expressing wild-type or mutant transporters in 24-well plates twice with 1 ml/well of phosphate-buffered saline/CM, followed by lysis in SDS sample buffer, heating for 10 min at 85 °C, sonication, and centrifugation. As described previously, the biotinylation reagent only modifies proteins at the plasma membrane as judged by the fact that the transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin was present in the total fractions, but depleted in the biotinylated fractions (26Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE (10% gel) the proteins were quantitatively transferred to nitrocellulose, as judged by the recovery of all the prestained marker proteins (New England Biolabs), including the 175-kDa marker on the nitrocellulose (no prestained markers were left on the gel). The GAT-1 proteins were detected using affinity purified antibody to an epitope on the carboxyl-terminal tail of GAT-1 (26Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Google Scholar, 27Mabjeesh N.J. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2563-2568Google Scholar) at a 1:800 dilution, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:40000 dilution, and ECL. 1% Goat serum was present in all antibody, blocking, and washing solutions to minimize the appearance of nonspecific bands. Inhibition Studies with Sulfhydryl Reagents—Before the transport measurements, the cells adhering to 24-well plates were washed with the transport medium containing 150 mm choline chloride instead of NaCl. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of the preincubation medium (the different compositions are indicated in the figure legends). After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport solution. Subsequently they were assayed for [3H]GABA transport at room temperature (22–26 °C), unless indicated otherwise. The hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagents used during the preincubation were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. or from Anatrace, Inc. The concentration of these reagents chosen in the different experiments was optimized according to the experimental conditions or the mutants used. For instance, in Fig. 6, different concentrations were used for the different mutants, because some are more sensitive than others. Statistical evaluation of the MTS sensitivity for different mutants utilized a one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test, where p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results were plotted using normalized data for each mutant, where the untreated activity levels are normalized to 100%. Cysteine Scanning Mutagenesis of TMD I—Cysteines were introduced one at a time into TMD I, which encompasses residues 53–72. This was done in the background of the C74A mutant, because cysteine 74 is the only cysteine in wild-type GAT-1 impacted by impermeant MTS reagents. The activity of the C74A is almost as high as wild-type GAT-1 (Fig. 1). In terms of activity TMD I can be divided in two regions: 1) the internal half, starting at the cytoplasmic side at position 53, up to residue 62, where with the exception of G59C/C74A cysteine replacement has not much of an impact on sodium- and chloride-dependent [3H]GABA transport; and 2) the external half, from position 63 to 72, where transport is strongly impacted with the exception of V67C/C74A, W68C/C74A, and F70C/C74A (Fig. 1). To determine whether the low activity observed in some of the cysteine mutants is because of an intrinsic effect on function or to defective targeting, resulting in reduced numbers of transporter on the plasma membrane, surface biotinylation was performed on these mutants. HeLa cells expressing the C74A parent and mutant transporters derived from it were treated with the impermeant biotinylation reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. Upon solubilization with detergent, the biotinylated proteins were isolated using streptavidin beads. After SDS-PAGE of total (unfractionated) and biotinylated proteins, followed by Western blot analysis using an affinity-purified antibody against GAT-1, the transporter bands were visualized by ECL. As can be seen in Fig. 2, in the total samples of the C74A parent and the mutants, the major band has a mobility of 50–55 kDa and represents the glycosylated form of the transporter, the slower moving bands probably represent dimeric/aggregate forms of the transporter (14Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Google Scholar, 26Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody is seen in the lanes labeled SK, representing samples prepared from cells transfected with the vector alone. In the case of the biotinylated samples, diffuse bands with a lower mobility than that of the 50–55-kDa band are observed. These bands are lacking in cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 2). These bands probably represent mature forms of the transporter. These results fit well with those we have published on the wild-type and a mutant, where all N-linked glycosylation sites have been removed (26Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Google Scholar), which led us to conclude that although glycosylation is a prerequisite for the formation of the mature form, it is not required for targeting to the plasma membrane, at least not in the vaccinia-based expression system (26Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Google Scholar). Scanning of the bands from the biotinylated samples from three different experiments indicates that intensity of the 50–55-kDa bands is not statistically different from that of C74A (one-way ANOVA with post-hoc multiple comparison test, p > 0.05), yielding values (% of C74A values) of 95.9 ± 12.4, 95.2 ± 18.2, 93.0 ± 18.9, 80.9 ± 19.1, 75.3 ± 21.3, and 72.6 ± 1.2 for L64C/C74A, G65C/C74A, N66C/C74A, R69C/C74A, P71C/C74A, and Y72C/C74A, respectively). On the other hand there are significant differences in the intensities of the slower moving bands (excluding the highly aggregated material that run slower than the 175-kDa marker). The values are 17.7 ± 1.4, 43.4 ± 6.6, 23.8 ± 9.2, 22.8 ± 8.8, and 34.1 ± 15.9 (p < 0.05) for L64C/C74A, N66C/C74A, R69C/C74A, P71C/C74A, and Y72C/C74A, respectively. Only in the case of G65C/C74A was the intensity, 77.9 ± 21.7% of C74A, not statistically different (p > 0.05). When comparing the sum of the 50–55-kDa and the slower moving bands, the respective values (% of C74A) are 56.6 ± 5.4, 84.3 ± 16.1, 67.8 ± 7.8, 51.0 ± 6.5, 48.2 ± 7.7, and 56.1 ± 8.2 (p < 0.05 except for G65C/C74A and N66C/C74A). As the deglycosylated GAT-1 has considerable activity in this expression system (14Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Google Scholar), it appears that at best only part of the lowered activity of the mutants (Fig. 1) can be ascribed to targeting defects. Impact of Impermeant MTS Reagents—Even though many of the cysteine mutants in the external half of TMD I exhibit low activity, our assay is sensitive enough to quantitatively detect even a few percent of wild-type activity. This enabled us to study the impact of impermeant MTS reagents on the low activity mutants L64C, P71C, and Y72C, in addition to that on the mutants with higher activity. TMD I can be divided into two groups, corresponding to the internal and external halves, not only with regard to [3H]GABA transport activity (Fig. 1) but also with regard to the impact of the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET on activity (Fig. 3). Whereas none of the cysteine mutants between positions 53 and 62 are sensitive to MTSET, all the mutants with detectable activity in the external half are inhibited by a 5-min preincubation with 0.2 mm MTSET (Fig. 3, black bars). Even though the mutants are in the background of C74A, one possibility to explain this inhibition is that the mutants at one or more of positions 64, 67, 68, 70, 71, and 72 might expose a previously inaccessible endogenous cysteine residue. However, the fact that introduction of an alanine or a serine at these positions does not render the transporters sensitive to MTSET (Fig. 3, open bars), strongly suggests that the introduced cysteines themselves are impacted by the sulfhydryl reagent. Even though the wild-type GAT-1 is almost as insensitive to MTSET as C74A (Fig. 3), we noted that in the wild-type background both W68C and W68S mutants are very sensitive to MTSET (data not shown), in contrast to the results obtained in the C74A background (Fig. 3). Evidently, a mutation at tryptophan 68 can cause the exposure of the endogenous cysteine 74, and it is therefore of critical importance to use the C74A background. Basically the same results are obtained with MTSES (data not shown). This reagent has a similar size as MTSET but is negatively charged, rather than the positively charged MTSET. Only in the case of V67C/C74A is there a difference between the effect of MTSET and MTSES (Fig. 4, A and B). In sodium containing media this mutant is much less sensitive to MTSES. However, the fact that transport by V67C/C74A is sensitive to MTSES in choline argues against the idea that the cysteine at position 67 is modified by MTSES but has no functional impact. The result rather suggests that in sodium containing media, MTSES has difficulties accessing the cysteine. Further support for this idea comes from experiments where V67C/C74A was reacted with MTSES first, followed by MTSET. If MTSES modifies V67C/C74A, that modification should prevent subsequent modification by MTSET. In fact, the ability of MTSET to inhibit after MTSES treatment was not impaired (Fig. 4C). Because of the lack of detectable transport activity, the impact of impermeant MTS reagents cannot be monitored on several of the mutants in the external half of TMD I. Sometimes mutants inactive in transport exhibit partial reactions that can be measured. For instance, we have shown that the cysteine introduced at position 63 is accessible to externally applied MTSET and MTSES, because the G63C/C74A mutant exhibits a large transporter-mediated cation leak current that is sensitive to these impermeant sulfhydryl reagents (19Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Google Scholar). Mutant G65C/C74A exhibits a small leak current, which, however, is not inhibited by either MTSET or MTSES (data not shown). No partial reaction, such as the steady-state sodium-sensitive leak current or the sodium-dependent transient currents (19Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Google Scholar), could be detected in N66C/C74A and R69C/C74A. Therefore we have no data on the external aqueous accessibility of these two positions, although we note that they are occupied by polar amino acid residues, which are likely to have an aqueous accessibility. Effect of Substrate and Coupling Ions on the Aqueous Accessibility of TMD I—The inhibition of all the cysteine mutants by impermeant MTS reagents is dependent on composition of the external medium. This is shown for V67C/C74A in Fig. 4 and for L64C/C74A, W68C/C74A, F70C/C74A, and P71C/C74A in Fig. 5. In the case of Y72C/C74A these experiments were much harder to perform because of its extreme sensitivity to MTSET (half-maximal inhibition at around 5 μm). Even in the case of Y72C/C74A, the sensitivity to MTSET was higher in the presence of sodium than in the presence of lithium or choline (data not shown) but these effects were smaller than observed for the other mutants (Figs. 4 and 5). The most marked effect of sodium on the sensitivity to MTSET (and MTSES, data not shown) is observed in L64C/C74A (Fig. 5). In the presence of sodium, transport by this mutant is very sensitive to MTSET; at 50 μm almost no activity remains and the half-maximal effect is obtained at around 15 μm MTSET (Fig. 5). However, when sodium is replaced by lithium or choline, conditions where no GABA transport occurs, almost no inhibition by MTSET is observed at the concentrations tested. Moreover GABA itself (1 mm) can almost fully protect against the inhibition by MTSET in sodium containing media (Fig. 5). On the other hand, l-aspartate, which is not a substrate, has no protective effect whatsoever (data not shown). In lithium or choline media, no effect of GABA is observed (data not shown), indicative that GABA binding is sodium dependent. Also in the F70C/C74A mutant, sodium potentiates the inhibition by MTSET, although some inhibition is also observed in its absence (Fig. 5). Again, GABA protects but only in sodium medium (data not shown) and the inhibition under these conditions is even less than that observed in the absence of sodium (Fig. 5). In the case of P71C/C74A (Fig. 5) and V67C/C74A (Fig. 4) sodium is protective. In the case of P71C/C74A there is a small protective effect by GABA (Fig. 5) but with V67C/C74A, the substrate has almost no effect (Fig. 4). Finally, in W68C/C74A there is almost no effect of sodium on the sensitivity toward MTSET, but a marked protection is effected by GABA (Fig. 5). In contrast to the marked impact of sodium and GABA, there is almost no effect of the other cosubstrate, chloride, on the sensitivity of the mutants toward impermeant MTS reagents (replacement of chloride by gluconate salts, data not shown). The protection by GABA is also observed at 2–4 °C (Fig. 6). At this temperature the conformational changes of the transporter are slowed down dramatically, as evidenced by the fact that transport activity at 2–4 °C is only around 5% of that at 37 °C (28Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42950-42958Google Scholar). To see comparable inhibition by MTSET at the lower temperature, higher concentrations are needed, consistent with a temperature dependence of the rate of MTSET access or adduct formation. Nevertheless, the ability of GABA to protect is not affected by the lower temperature (Fig. 6). To determine whether the protection by GABA against the inhibition by the impermeant MTS reagents is because of a physical blockade of the access to the cysteines engineered in TMD I, we have examined the effect of SKF100330A on this inhibition (Fig. 7). SKF100330A is a non-transportable hydrophobic GABA analogue, which acts as a high affinity competitive inhibitor of GABA transporter (29Ali F.E. Blondinell W.E. Dandridge P.A. Frazer J.S. Garvey E. Girrard G.R. Kaiser C. Ku T.W. Lafferty J.J. Moonsammy G.I. Oh H.J. Rush J.A. Settler P.E. Stringer D.D. Vinslavsky J.W. Volpe B.W. Yunger L.M. Zishle C.L. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 653-660Google Scholar). In three of the four mutants in which GABA has a clear protective effect, L64C/C74A, W68C/C74A, and P71C/C74A, SKF100330A is also protective (Fig. 7). In V67C/C74A, where the protective effect by GABA is small (Fig. 4), SKF100330A clearly protects (Fig. 7). However, the most striking result is obtained with F70C/C74A where SKF100330A potentiates the effect of MTSET (Fig. 7) even though GABA markedly protects against it (Fig. 5). The effects of SKF100330A are not observed in choline medium (data not shown), indicating that the binding of the GABA analogue is also sodium dependent. Effects of MTSEA—Transport activity of cysteine mutants at positions cytoplasmic to glycine 63 is not impacted by impermeant MTSET (Fig. 3) and MTSES (data not shown). We have therefo"

A previously unknown protein interacting with YY1 was identified and named YY1AP. By using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, the full-length cDNA of YY1AP was cloned and sequenced. The cDNA was 2253 bp in length and encoded an open reading frame of 750 amino acids. The chromosomal gene was made up of 10 exons separated by nine introns and is localized on chromosome 1 (1q21.3). Northern blot analysis revealed that YY1AP is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and cancer cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunostaining of cells further indicated that YY1AP co-localizes with YY1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, YY1AP was shown to be capable of enhancing the transcriptional activation of an YY1 responsive promoter. Subsequent analysis by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed that YY1AP contained two YY1 binding regions. The transactivation region of YY1AP would seem to be localized within the section of amino acids 260-345. It is proposed that YY1AP is a novel co-activator of YY1.

The YY1 protein contains four C-terminal zinc finger domains with the capability of DNA binding, one transcription activation domain at the N terminus, and two repression domains (7Thomas M.J.

It can bind to the specific DNA consensus sequence 5′-CGCCATNTT-3′, which is present in many promoters, and regulates transcription activity by either activation or repression (1Galvin K.M. Shi Y.

Some domains of YY1 are used to mediate interaction with other proteins and regulated transcription activity via YY1 binding to the consensus sequence on promoter (12Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Several studies have revealed that YY1 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms in different cell types (13Bhalla S.S. Robitaille L. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11439-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The modulation that occurs at different promoters is because of the various components of YY1 complex that are present. As an activator, a repressor, or an initiator, the function of YY1 in transcription is context-specific and is regulated by its interactions with various cellular factors and adaptor proteins (5Riggs K.J. Saleque S. Wong K.K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.S. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Bhalla S.S. Robitaille L. Nemer M. J. Biol.

YY1 has been shown to interact physically with a number of cellular and viral proteins to modulate the expression of these genes. Thus, both the promoter context and the cellular environment influence YY1 activation (2Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 4Ficzycz A. Ovsenek N. J. Biol.

As a repressor, YY1 can repress several well characterized promoters such as c-fos, immunoglobulin κ 3′ enhancer, skeletal α-actin, P5 promoter of adeno-associated virus, and murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (1Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene. 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). There are three models to explain the repression function of YY1. First, YY1 acts via activator displacement through an overlapping DNA binding site and prevents another activator binding to DNA. Second, YY1 acts by preventing activator function and interaction with the general transcription machinery. In the third model, it is postulated that YY1 recruits a co-repressor or repression complex to a promoter (1Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene. 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).

Seto E. Gene. 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar): (i) direct activation, through DNA binding and interaction with general transcription factors to activate transcription; (ii) inhibition of repressor activity and/or unmasking of an activation domain, such as in the case where the N-terminal activation domain of YY1 is masked and is then exposed to interact with a second factor; and (iii) recruitment of a co-activator. This third model has gained much attention recently, because YY1 interacts with cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein and P300, both proteins with histone acetyltransferase activity (9Austen M.

Because YY1 binds to a specific DNA sequence, the conformation of chromatin may be changed, allowing other factors to interact with the DNA (9Austen M. Luscher B. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol.

In addition to their histone substrates, P300 and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein can acetylate transcription factors. Transcription factor acetylation and deacetylation are important regulatory functions (27Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Because interaction of YY1 with other factors plays a very important role in regulating the transcriptional activity of YY1, we aimed to discover more YY1-associated proteins to allow the dissection of the complexity of YY1-mediated transcription modulation. In this report, a search for YY1-binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system is described. YY1AP (a novel YY1-associated protein), was identified and shown to be expressed in several tissues as well as various cell lines. Our results indicated that YY1AP co-localizes with YY1 in the nucleus, interacts with YY1 through two distinct YY1 binding domains in vitro and in vivo, and contains a transactivation domain. We proposed that YY1AP is a novel co-activator for activation of YY1. Plasmid Constructions—The plasmid pGAL4DB-YY1 was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment encoding the full-length YY1 into the EcoRI site of pAS2-1 (BD Biosciences). pGAL4AD-YY1AP and the YY1AP deletion constructs (YY1AP1-345, YY1AP345-750, YY1AP475-750, YY1AP608-750, YY1AP345-608, YY1AP345-475, YY1AP475-608), were cloned by inserting DNA fragments of YY1AP between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pACT2 (BD Biosciences). pGEX-YY1 and pCMV-Tag3B-YY1 were cloned in a similar manner into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene), respectively. pCITE-YY1AP and YY1AP deletion mutants were cloned by inserting DNA fragments encoding either full-length or various deletion mutants of YY1AP (see Fig. 4) between the EcoRI and XhoI of pCITE4a(+) (Novagen). pCMV-Tag2B-YY1AP, YY1APΔ475-608, and YY1AP260-475 were constructed similarly by inserting a corresponding DNA fragment between the same sites of pCMV-Tag2B. pGL3-G5E1b was constructed by replacing the GAL binding sequence and TATA box of pE1BCAT into pGL3-basic (Promega). pCDNA-HA-YY1 was constructed to produce a fusion protein, HA-YY1, using the EcoRI site of pCDNA. pSG424-YY1AP and YY1AP deletion mutants (see Fig. 7) were constructed by inserting DNA fragments into the EcoRI site of pSG424.Fig. 7The transactivation domain of YY1AP.

Approximately 8.8 × 106 transformants were screened according to the manufacture's protocol. cDNA encoding proteins that gave a positive signal from the activation domain library were isolated and sequenced. Northern Hybridization and 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—The tissue distribution of YY1AP was analyzed by Northern hybridization in human cancer cell lines (Human Cancer Cell Line MTN Blot; BD Biosciences) and normal human tissues (Human MTN blot and Human MTN blot II; Clontech). A DIG-labeled probe of YY1AP was made using a PCR digoxigenin Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science), and the conditions for hybridization were based on the supplier's protocol. The expression of β-actin was used as an internal control. The β-actin DNA fragment was [α-P32]dCTP-labeled by random priming (Ready.To.Go DNA labeling beads; Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted from C33A cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 5′-RACE 1The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GAL4AD, GAL4 activation domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IP, immunoprecipitation. was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol of the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences). Gene-specific primers GSP1, 5′-ACCGAGTTTCACTCCCCAACTCTGAGTTGT-3′, and NGSP1, 5′GCCTTGATCTGAGTTGATCTCAGTGGTTCC-3′, were used in the reverse transcriptase-PCR reaction. PCR bands ranging from 700 to 1300 bp were cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—In vitro transcription and translation were performed by the Single Tube Protein System3, T7 (Novagen). [35S]Methionine (Amersham Biosciences) was included in the reaction for the purpose of labeling the synthesized proteins. The templates were pCITE-YY1AP and its YY1AP deletion mutants. The protocol of GST pull-down has been described previously (28Huang C.F. Wang Y.C. Tsao D.A. Tung S.F. Lin Y.S. Wu C.W. J. Biol.

Antibody Preparation and Immunostaining—Services to produce the antibodies α-YY1APN (against amino acid 42-60, RFEELLANLLNEQHQIAKE, from the YY1AP N terminus) and α-YY1APC (against amino acid 663-678, ELSPLSATVFPKVEHS, from the YY1AP C terminus) were provided by Research Genetics, Inc. The mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and the rabbit anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody were bought from Upstate, Inc. Mouse anti-YY1 antibody, rabbit anti-YY1 antibody, mouse anti-GAL4 DNA binding domain antibody, mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody, and the preimmune-IgG were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. HeLa cells were plated on a slide chamber for 12 h and then cells were fixed and immunostained with a 1:100 dilution of α-YY1APN antiserum and mouse anti-YY1 monoclonal antibody and finally analyzed by confocal microscopy. Western Immunoblotting and IP—Cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore) by semi-dry transfer. The Western blotting technique was applied using mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody, α-YY1APN, or α-YY1APC to probe the membrane. IP was carried out with 10 μl (0.25 μg/μl) of rabbit anti-YY1 polyclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitation complex was analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—C33A, HeLa, and H1299 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. LipofectAMINE 2000-mediated transfection (for H1299) and LipofectAMINE Plus-mediated transfection (for C33A) were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). The luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacture's protocol (Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system; Promega). Isolation and Identification of a Novel YY1 Interaction Protein—To search for proteins that specifically interact with YY1, a yeast two-hybrid system was established using a full-length YY1 gene (pAS2-1-YY1) as bait to screen a human HeLa S3 MATCHMAKER cDNA library (BD Biosciences). Altogether 167 cDNA clones were detected with the ability to bind to YY1. After BLAST searching (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), four clones were matched to an expressed sequence tag clone, AA451818. To obtain the full-length cDNA, 5′-RACE was performed, and this gave a cDNA of about 2.5 Kb. It consists of a 2253-base pair open reading frame, which encoded a 750-amino acid protein (Fig. 1A). By comparison with the human genome sequence, the cDNA was located on chromosome 1q21.3. It contains 10 exons with nine introns, and this novel YY1-associated protein was named YY1AP. We registered the sequences of mRNA and protein with NCBI (accession number AF466401). To confirm the expression of YY1AP in vivo, Northern hybridization was performed in various cancer cells (Fig. 1B) and normal human tissues (Fig. 1C). YY1AP expression was detected in almost all cells and tissues tested. Among these, testis and skeletal muscle are the two that gave the highest expression. Northern hybridization results also demonstrated that the YY1AP mRNA was about 2500 nucleotides in length, which is consistent with the result of the 5′-RACE. Induction of the peptide-antibodies was carried out to allow the detection of YY1AP protein in vivo to further confirm the presence of such a protein in the cell. Two peptides were synthesized, one equivalent to the YY1AP N-terminal amino acid sequence 42-60 and the other equivalent to the C-terminal amino acid sequence 663-678. The two antisera to these peptides were then used as probes to detect endogenous YY1AP and YY1AP produced by expression constructs. By Western immunoblotting, both in the presence and absence of transfected FLAG-YY1AP (pCMV-Tag2B-YY1AP), a protein signal was found at a position slightly lower than FLAG-YY1AP (Fig. 2A) after electrophoresis for a relatively long time. Thus the endogenous YY1AP protein signal is found at 90 kDa, in agreement with the predicted protein size of 750 amino acids derived from open reading frame. To determine subcellular localization of YY1AP, the antiserum α-YY1APN was used to detect the endogenous YY1AP and observed with a confocal microscope. We found that YY1 and endogenous YY1AP were co-localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Mapping the YY1 Interaction Domain of YY1AP—To characterize the binding of YY1 with YY1AP, we set out to map the YY1 binding domain of YY1AP by yeast two-hybrid interaction assay using GAL4AD-YY1AP and a panel of its deletion constructs. Because the expressions of GAL4AD-YY1AP and GAL4AD-YY1AP1-345 were detrimental to yeast (Fig. 3, rows 1 and 2), we could not use the yeast two-hybrid to map the N-terminal YY1 binding domain of YY1AP. Therefore, a series of C terminus deletion mutants of YY1AP were used in the yeast two-hybrid system to search for the YY1 binding domain on YY1AP. As summarized in Fig. 3, YY1AP345-750 still associates with YY1 (row 3). YY1AP deletion mutants, YY1AP475-750 and YY1AP345-608, still possessed YY1 binding ability (rows 4 and 6). YY1AP475-608 was the smallest deletion mutant and still was able to bind YY1 (row 8). However, removal of two regions, first in YY1AP608-750 and second in YY1AP345-475, resulted in the loss of YY1 binding ability (compare row 4 with row 5, and compare row 6 with row 7). Control experiments (rows 9-12) confirmed the specificity of the YY1 and YY1AP interactions: the introduction of plasmid pGAL4DB-YY1, pGAL4AD-YY1AP1-345, or pGAL4AD-YY1AP345-750 alone into yeast produced no colonies (rows 9, 11, and 12). Similarly, no colonies were observed upon co-transformation of pGAL4DB with pGAL4AD-YY1AP345-750 (row 10). Thus by using the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, the YY1AP amino acid 475-608 segment was identified as having the ability to bind YY1. YY1AP Can Interact with YY1 in Vitro and in Vivo—The interaction of YY1AP and YY1 were further examined using a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4). The binding abilities of the YY1AP deletion mutants with YY1 are summarized in Fig. 4, AII and BII. These show that the full-length of YY1AP and YY1 could bind in vitro (Fig. 4B, lane 1), and a series of deletion mutants were subsequently tested. Consistent with data obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3), YY1AP345-750 (Fig. 4B, lane 3), YY1AP475-750 (lane 4), YY1AP345-608 (lane 6), and YY1AP475-608 (lane 8) all bound to GST-YY1, whereas YY1AP608-750 (lane 5) and YY1AP345-475 (lane 7) failed to be retained under the same experimental conditions. The N-terminal YY1 binding domain on YY1AP can only be mapped using the GST pull-down assay and not by yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4B). The results showed that four deletion constructs of the N-terminal YY1AP, 1-345, 87-345, 173-345, and 1-260 (Fig. 4, A, lanes 1-3 and lane 5 and B, lane 2) were able to bind to GST-YY1 but not YY1AP260-345 (lane 4). Thus it can be assumed the sections 1-260 and 475-608 of the YY1AP protein potentially interact with YY1. The IP approach was used to confirm the interaction in vivo. H1299 cell extract were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against YY1 (or normal IgG) and probed with α-YY1APC. We found that endogenous YY1AP can be detected in the YY1 immunocomplex (Fig. 5A, upper panel, lane 2) but not in normal IgG immunocomplex (lane 3). We also examined the association of YY1AP and YY1 in transient transfected cells. H1299 cells were co-transfected with pCMV-Tag2B-YY1AP (FLAG-tagged YY1AP) and pCMV-Tag3B-YY1 (c-Myc-tagged YY1) and then the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against YY1. FLAG-tagged YY1AP was co-precipitated by anti-YY1 antibody but not by preimmune serum (Fig. 5B, upper panel, compare lane 2 with lane 3). The results of immunoprecipitation with YY1 antibody showed positive precipitation of YY1 (Fig. 5, A and B, lower panel, lane 2). Thus, both the endogenous YY1 IP-Western assay and the transient transfection, IP-Western assays proved that YY1AP possesses the ability to interact with YY1. YY1AP Elevates the Transcription Activation of YY1—To further investigate the role of YY1AP on modulation of YY1-mediated transcription, a YY1 responsive reporter, pSN-Luc (5Riggs K.J. Saleque S. Wong K.K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.S. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. Calame, was used to examine the influence of YY1AP on YY1. Indeed, YY1AP was found to be capable of elevating YY1-dependent transcription activation. In C33A cells (Fig. 6, white column), transfection of YY1 could enhance the transcription activity about 2-fold (Fig. 6, compare lane 2 with lane 1). When the cell was co-transfected with YY1AP and YY1, the transcription activation reaction increased further by about 11-fold (Fig. 6, compare lane 6 with lane 1). The slightly elevated transcription produced by transfection of YY1AP alone (lane 3) is presumed caused by a reaction between YY1AP and endogenous YY1. Deletion of the C-terminal YY1AP-YY1 binding domain 475-608 (YY1APΔ475-608; see lane 7) decreased the activation function of YY1AP to about 6-fold. In contrast, co-transfection of YY1 and YY1AP260-475, a section in between and devoid of the two DNA binding sites, produced no activation effect (Fig. 6, compare lane 8 with lane 2). None of the YY1AP and deletion mutants showed any effect on pRL-CMV, the control reporter (Fig. 6A, Relative activity of renilla). A similar phenomenon was also observed in transfected H1299 (black column). YY1AP260-345 Is the Transactivation Domain of YY1AP—YY1AP has the ability to elevate YY1 activation. Vectors containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain, pSG424, GAL4-YY1AP, and various deletion mutant fusion proteins were prepared and co-transfected into H1299 cells. This method allows an investigation of the binding of GAL4-YY1AP to the GAL4 binding site of pG5E1b-Luc and to study the transactivation domain of YY1AP. The results showed that GAL4-YY1AP could drive the promoter of the pG5E1b-Luc reporter, and transactivation activity was exhibited (Fig. 7A, lane 2). When studied in sections, GAL4-YY1AP1-345 showed an even stronger activity than the full-length YY1AP (Fig. 7A, compare lane 3 with lane 2). This contrasts with GAL4-YY1AP345-750, which is missing N-terminal amino acid 1-345 and shows reduced transactivational activity (lane 4). Another series of N-terminal deletion mutants of GAL4-YY1AP were also transfected and assayed. It was found that the 260-345 segment showed the strongest activity in the luciferase assay (lane 8). Putting these results together, it appears that all the YY1AP deletion mutants containing fragment 260-345 produced increased transactivation activities (lanes 5-8). When tested on the control reporter gene in pRL-CMV, none of the YY1AP constructs, full-length or deletion mutants, showed any effect (Fig. 7B, Relative activity of renilla). Thus it can be concluded that amino acid 260-345 is very likely the section containing the transactivation domain of YY1AP. Overall, these results strongly suggest that YY1AP is a novel transcriptional co-activator of YY1. YY1 is a multi-functional transcription factor, and many promoters contain the YY1 binding sequence. Most of the YY1-associated proteins are co-activators, co-repressors, or transcription factors in themselves. Because of the complexity of the role of YY1 in transcription modification, it has been suggested that co-factors that bind to YY1 may play a crucial part in the regulation mechanism (7Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene. 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We identified a novel nuclear protein YY1AP that could associate with YY1 in vitro and in vivo. The fragment 475-608 of YY1AP was the main YY1 binding site. We found that YY1AP enhanced YY1-mediated transcription activation dependent on the association of YY1AP and YY1. If the YY1 binding region was deleted, the effect was significantly reduced (Fig. 6). In searching for the transactivation domain, a series of deletion constructs were studied. Our data also indicated that the 260-345 region contained the strongest YY1AP transactivation activity (Fig. 7). Because the YY1AP sequence does not contain a typical DNA binding domain, we suggested that YY1AP was recruited by YY1 and in turn regulated the activation of YY1. The activity of YY1AP was displayed via the binding of YY1 to DNA, which resulted in an enhancement of transcription activation. Results indicate that YY1AP is a novel co-activator of YY1. Northern hybridization showed that YY1AP is found widely in various tissues, and these are particularly high concentrations in testis and skeletal muscle. The partial sequence of YY1AP has been reported previously Wang, et al. (30Wang Z.X. Wang H.Y. Wu M.C. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and identified as a liver tumor-specific protein whose mRNA expression were detected in liver tumor but not in normal liver tissues. Our Northern hybridization results, however, identified full-length YY1AP in liver tissue at a relatively low level of expression (Fig. 1B). In this study, two different antisera, α-YY1APN against the N-terminal region of YY1AP and α-YY1APC against the C-terminal region of YY1AP, were produced to be used in Western blotting. The same size of protein was detected with these two antisera (Fig. 2A). YY1AP as a whole is comprised of about 750 amino acids. Because the full-length YY1AP protein was detected in several cell lines (data not shown), we suggest that endogenous full-length YY1AP is an unstable transcriptional co-activator expressed in a wide variety of different cell types. Transcription co-activators can usually be separated into three classes: (i) as adapters that direct activator recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus, (ii) as chromatin-remodeling or chromatin-modifying enzymes (27Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and (iii) as mediators that modify or interact with other transcription factors, inducing a reaction at the promoter. Models of the third kind include the binding of P300 and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein to YY1, both known as co-activators in some systems (9Austen M. Luscher B. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Through YY1, P300 could cause chromatin conformation changes allowing other factors to efficiently interact with DNA. Our results indicated that YY1AP contains a transactivation domain, and when YY1 binds to its specific DNA sequence YY1AP may co-regulate transcription through the transactivation domain and YY1. Actually, YY1 is known to participate in many transcription reactions, and the role it plays varies greatly. This poses the question whether YY1AP participates in all YY1 controlled transcription and what is its specific role. Similarly, another question is whether YY1AP can interact directly with general transcription factors, or, alternatively, does it act through YY1 binding to P300 and causing chromatin to form a looser conformation, thus allowing YY1AP to affect transcription. All these areas need to be further investigated.

https://openalex.org/W2029656613,"BARX2 is a homeobox transcription factor that influences cellular differentiation in various developmental contexts. To begin to identify the gene targets that mediate its effects, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to isolate BARX2 binding sites from the human MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Cloning and sequencing of BARX2-ChIP-derived DNA fragments identified 60 potential BARX2 target loci that were proximal to or within introns of genes involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, growth factor signaling, transcriptional regulation, and RNA metabolism. The sequences of over half of the fragments showed homology with the mouse genome, and several sequences could be mapped to orthologous human and mouse genes. Binding of BARX2 to 21 genomic loci examined was confirmed quantitatively by replicate ChIP assays. A combination of sequence analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed homeodomain binding sites within several fragments that bind to BARX2 in vitro. The majority of BARX2 binding fragments tested (14/19), also affected transcription in luciferase reporter gene assays. Mutation analyses of three fragments showed that their transcriptional activities required the HBS, and suggested that BARX2 regulates gene expression by binding to DNA elements containing paired TAAT motifs that are separated by a poly(T) sequence. Inhibition of BARX2 expression in MCF7 cells led to reduced expression of eight genes associated with BARX2 binding sites, indicating that BARX2 directly regulates their expression. The data suggest that BARX2 can coordinate the expression of a network of genes that influence the growth of MCF7 cells.

A Southwestern screen to identify proteins that bound to a homeobox recognition motif from the chicken Ng-CAM gene, led to the discovery of the murine homeodomain protein, Barx2 (6Jones F.S.

Related binding sites for BARX2 were subsequently identified in the mouse L1cam and Ncam1 genes, and these sites were shown in transgenic mice to be required for the native pattern of gene expression (3Edelman D.B.

Murine Barx2 is expressed in several mesenchymal and epithelial tissues during development including cartilage, skeletal and smooth muscle, the central nervous system, and branching epithelial structures, such as the mammary, lacrimal, and salivary glands (6Jones F.S.

Our recent studies indicate that Barx2 influences cellular processes that control cell adhesion and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton seen in myoblast fusion (10Meech R. Makarenkova H.

Human BARX2 has also been described as a tumor suppressor gene; loss of BARX2 expression correlates with invasiveness in ovarian cancer, and ectopic expression of BARX2 inhibits the invasiveness of an ovarian cancer cell line (11Sellar G.C. Li L. Watt K.P. Nelkin B.D. Rabiasz G.J. Stronach E.A. Miller E.P. Porteous D.J. Smyth J.F. Gabra H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6977-6981PubMed Google Scholar). The role of BARX2 in development and cancer progression prompted us to search for genes that are regulated by BARX2, and to investigate the requirements for binding of BARX2 to genomic regulatory elements. While microarray analysis is useful for the identification of genes regulated by a specific transcription factor, direct target genes cannot be readily distinguished from genes affected by downstream pathways. Additionally, microarray analysis does not identify the DNA elements that are required for regulation of gene expression. Since 4–6-bp motifs such as those recognized by homeodomain factors occur frequently in the genome, bioinformatic approaches may identify an unrealistically large number of potential binding sites without distinguishing those that are functionally relevant. In an effort to reduce this complexity, conventional methods of promoter analysis usually focus on the region proximal to the start of gene transcription, despite the fact that regulatory elements can be scattered throughout the gene locus. Moreover, in vitro methods for identification of transcription factor binding sites, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) that utilize short oligonucleotides to examine protein-DNA interactions, do not take into consideration chromatin structure or the accessibility of transcription factors to binding sites in vivo. In contrast to these methods, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) identifies native transcription factor binding sites in a given cellular context and can potentially reveal target genes that are influenced by binding. In a recent example, Weinmann et al. (12Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), isolated gene promoter fragments bound by E2F by combining ChIP with hybridization to a microarray containing CpG island-enriched genomic DNA. Further analyses showed direct binding of E2F to 14 of these fragments, and identified one promoter fragment that was regulated by E2F in cells. A more recent study identified more than two hundred genomic binding sites for the Drosophila homeodomain factor Engrailed (13Solano P.J. Mugat B. Martin D. Girard F. Huibant J.M. Ferraz C. Jacq B. Demaille J. Maschat F. Development. 2003; 130: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The expression of twelve genes associated with these sites was activated in Drosophila embryos by a fusion protein that linked the Engrailed DNA binding domain to a strong activation domain, providing further evidence that Engrailed binds to these genes in vivo. Moreover, in both of these studies, analyses of the isolated genomic sequences identified novel binding motifs for the factors examined. Using ChIP, the present study identified 60 potential genomic binding sites in MCF7 cells for BARX2. These sites are associated with genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and cytokinesis, cell adhesion, growth factor signaling, and transcription. Binding sites for BARX2 were preferentially located within gene introns, and many of the BARX2 binding fragments were conserved both in sequence and chromosomal location in the human and mouse genomes. In vitro and cellular assays showed that BARX2 regulates gene expression by binding to DNA sequences containing paired TAAT motifs that are separated by a tract of poly(T) residues. Moreover, the expression of eight genes identified by ChIP was reduced after inhibition of BARX2 expression, demonstrating that ChIP can identify bona fide regulatory target genes. Cell Lines—MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). MDA-MD-231 cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The ChIP protocol used in this study was adapted from Weinmann et al., (14Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and from the protocol recommended by Upstate Biotechnologies. MCF7 cells were grown on three 10-cm plates to 85% confluence. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the plates were incubated 10 min at 37 °C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm glycine containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Cells were washed in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 plus protease inhibitors), resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 plus protease inhibitors) and sonicated to shear the DNA into 0.3–3-kb fragments. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the extract was precleared by incubation with blocked protein A-Sepharose (14Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) to reduce nonspecific interactions. The precleared chromatin was split into two samples, one in which 3 μg of anti-BARX2 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and one in which no antibody was added (negative control). Both samples were treated identically in every other respect. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and blocked protein A-Sepharose (14Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) was then added. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed twice in dilution buffer, once in high salt dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), once in LiCl buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm LiCl, pH 8.0) and once in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Following treatment of the samples with RNase A (Roche Applied Science) and proteinase K (Roche Applied Science), cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. The DNA was purified using the Qiagen MinElute kit. In analytical ChIP experiments, purified DNA was used directly for real-time PCR amplification of selected genomic fragments. To clone the purified DNA fragments, T4 DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was used to generate blunt ends, the DNA was ligated to the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected, and DNA was extracted from overnight cultures using the Qiagen spin miniprep kit. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the fragments were sequenced on an ABI model 373 automated DNA sequencer. Real-time PCR—To examine the enrichment of specific BARX2 binding fragments in independent ChIP assays, primers were generated corresponding to regions within each ChIP-derived genomic fragment examined. Primers were synthesized on an ABI DNA/RNA synthesizer, or obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) or GenSet oligos. Sequences of primers are shown in Appendix I (see Supplementary Data). For each PCR assay, similar concentrations of genomic DNA isolated from MCF7 cells by ChIP in the presence or absence of anti-BARX2 antibodies were used. In addition, unfractionated chromatin was used for each set of primers as a positive control to verify the efficiency and specificity of amplification. These experiments were performed using a Roche Lightcycler and the SYBR-Green HotStart Master Kit following manufacturer's instructions. The relative enrichment of each ChIP-derived fragment was determined based on the crossing point (CP) values for each amplification reaction. The CP value is defined as the cycle number where all samples have equivalent fluorescence. The concentration of DNA in the ChIP-derived and negative control samples at the CP was determined using a standard curve. The enrichment of each ChIP-derived fragment was determined from the ratio of these two concentrations. For every fragment analyzed, enrichment was measured in two or three independent immunoprecipitations and mean and S.E. values were determined. A melting curve analysis was performed for each sample after PCR amplification to ensure that a single amplification product was obtained. Computational Analyses—A Unix-based tool kit called Genehuggers was used to analyze the ChIP dataset (www.scripps.edu/services/gh/). Each GeneHuggers program utilizes a common datatype so that the output of one module can be used as input to another module. The BLAST program (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) was used to align sequences from ends of the ChIP fragments with a human genome sequence data base assembled with GeneHuggers tools using an expect value of 1e–90. After conversion of BLAST reports into the GeneHuggers data type, the best hit for each sequence was selected manually. The region between the end sequences was extracted and the complete fragment sequences were again aligned to the human genome using BLAST. Occasionally, BLAST missed part of the clone sequence and a sim4 alignment was performed between the clone and the contig sequence to completely assign the clone sequence. The position of each complete fragment relative to the nearest mRNA feature was determined by querying the UniGene field of each corresponding GenBank™ record. For consistency, UniGene identifiers and conventions for human and mouse genes are used throughout this article. Functional assignments for potential target genes were determined manually. For analyses of cross-species homology, the BARX2-ChIP fragments were compared with the mouse genome assembly using the BLAST algorithm with a word size of 7. The position of each homologous sequence relative to UniGene identifiers was determined as described above. Additional searches of the mouse genome Trace Archive were performed using the Discontiguous MegaBLAST program (16Ma B. Tromp J. Li M. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Matches to unassembled contigs were scored if they were assigned an alignment score of at least 200. The contigs were then compared with the annotated mouse genome assembly using MegaBLAST. Fragments that were located in introns or very proximal to non-hypothetical gene transcripts were examined in more detail for homology to the mouse genome using the BLAST2 program (bl2seq). The gene name was used to query HomoloGene data base to find the corresponding mouse transcript identifier and sequences encompassing the entire gene transcript and 50,000 bases upstream and downstream were extracted from the mouse genome. The most conserved subsequences between the human and mouse sequences were identified using bl2seq with a reduced gap penalty (–0.5), a reduced mismatch penalty (–1), and a word size of 7. Conserved regions that overlapped with the human ChIP clone were then extracted from both human and mouse sequences. The sequences of the ChIP fragments were searched using the MEME program (meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/intro.html) to identify over-represented subsequences (17Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intel. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the regular expression search tool RIGHT (18Edelman G.M. Meech R. Owens G.C. Jones F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used to search the sequences for potential BARX2 binding motifs similar to those identified previously in the mouse Ncam1 and L1cam, and chicken NgCAM genes (3Edelman D.B. Meech R. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21737-21745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), or to the consensus binding motif identified previously by in vitro selection (19Krasner A. Wallace L. Thiagalingam A. Jones C. Lengauer C. Minahan L. Ma Y. Kalikin L. Feinberg A.P. Jabs E.W. Tunnacliffe A. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Gene (Amst). 2000; 250: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). EMSAs—Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized corresponding to HBS elements from each BARX2-ChIP fragment, and to mutant versions in which the core TAAT motifs were disrupted. Double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont) using polynucleotide kinase (New England Bioloabs). Probes were purified by elution from an 8% polyacrylamide gel and their specific activity was determined. All probes were of comparable specific activity. EMSAs used 25,000 cpm of each probe and in vitro translated proteins, as described previously (3Edelman D.B. Meech R. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21737-21745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Relative binding of the protein to the HBS probes was determined by measuring the intensity of the probe/protein complexes using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Construction and Mutagenesis of BARX2-ChIP-Fragment Luciferase Vectors—BARX2-ChIP fragments were excised from the pCRBluntII-TOPO vector using XhoI and SpeI, and inserted into the XhoI and NheI sites of the pGL3basic or pGL3promoter vectors (Promega). In some cases, the fragments were excised with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into the SmaI and XhoI sites of the pGL3 vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on each of the two TAAT motifs (mut1 and mut2, respectively) within the HBS elements of the Bx23, Bx68, and Bx98 fragments. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to both strands were designed such that the mutant bases were located in the middle of the primer with 15 bases of correct sequence on either side. Primers were designed to produce mut1 and mut2 versions of fragments Bx23, Bx68, and Bx98, and also a mut1 + 2 mutation of Bx98. Mutagenesis was performed as described in the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with the following modifications. Primers were annealed and purified by elution from an 8% acrylamide gel. The pGL3promoter and pGL3basic vectors containing each fragment were used as templates. PCR reactions were performed using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. Plasmids were digested with DpnI (New England Biolabs), purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit, ligated using the Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche Applied Science) and repurified. An aliquot of each sample was transformed into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen), and ampicillin-resistant colonies were selected for PCR screening. Colonies were amplified, lysed at 100 °C for 15 min, and used directly for PCR with TaqDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cellular Transfection of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells—For transfections, purified plasmids were obtained by large scale purification using the Ultraclean plasmid prep kit (Mo Bio). MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were placed in 24-well tissue culture plates at an initial density of 1 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 500 ng of the luciferase reporter construct and 300 ng of the LacZ reporter CMVβgal (Clontech) to provide an internal reference for transfection efficiency, using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cellular transfection and assay conditions were otherwise as described previously (6Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.H. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), using the Promega Luciferase assay system. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the data shown were derived from at least three independent experiments. RNAi-mediated Inhibition of BARX2 Expression and RT-PCR Analysis of BARX2 Target Genes—Three RNA interference (RNAi) expression constructs that target the human BARX2 gene were prepared using the pSuper vector (kindly provided by Dr. R. Agami (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar)). Oligonucleotides were generated containing a 19-nt sequence derived from BARX2, separated by a short spacer from the reverse complement of the same sequence, and followed by a transcription termination signal. The resulting transcript is predicted to form a 19-bp stem-loop structure that acts as a small interfering (si) RNA. The sequences were flanked with BamHI and XhoI sites to facilitate cloning. The sequences, designated BARX2si1, -2, and -3, are as follows: BARX2si1, 5′-GATCCCCGATCCTCTCCAAGGAGACCTTCAAGAGAGGTCTCCTTGGAGAGGATCTTTTTGGAAC-3′; BARX2si2, 5′-GATCCCCGAGTCAGAGACGGAACAGCCCTTCAAGAGAGGGCTGTTCCGTCTCTGACTCTTTTTGGAAC-3′; and BARX2si3, 5′-GATCCCAAGGAGACCTGCGATTACTTTTCAAGAGAAAGTAATCGCAGGTCTCCTTGTTTTTAAC-3′. Two of these sequences were selected using publicly available software from the Dharmacon RNAi Design Center and all were screened for possible matches to other transcripts using BLAST to minimize the possibility of off-target effects. Two 100-mm plates of 50% confluent MCF7 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of each of the pSuper expression plasmids, or an equivalent total amount of the empty vector, and 2 μg of the pEYFPN1 expression vector (Clontech), using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were examined for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fluorescence to estimate transfection efficiency, and harvested after 4 days in culture. Transfection efficiency in two separate experiments was 40–50%. RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with DNase, and purified using Qiagen RNAeasy columns. cDNA was prepared using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs). Primers were prepared corresponding to selected BARX2 target gene transcripts and PCR amplification was performed using Qiagen HotStarTaq. Sequences of primers are shown in Appendix I (see Supplementary Data). Limited PCR cycles were used to maintain amplification within the linear range. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels, captured as digital images, and quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). Replicate PCR products amplified from cDNA prepared from BARX2si or control transfected cells were compared with each other. Results were normalized to the housekeeping gene cyclophilin. BARX2 Is Expressed in MCF7, but Not in MDA-MB-231, Breast Cancer Cells—Two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were utilized in this study. MCF7 cells are an estrogen-dependent, non-invasive epithelial-derived cell line, and are a well characterized model for hormone-dependent breast cancer. Both RT-PCR (Fig. 1) and Western analysis (data not shown) indicate that BARX2 and the estrogen receptor α (ESR1) are expressed in MCF7 cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells are estrogen-independent, highly invasive, and do not express BARX2 or ESR1. ChIP Identifies 60 Genomic Binding Sites for BARX2 in MCF7 Breast Cancer Cells—As a first step to identifying regulatory elements in target genes that bind to BARX2, we used ChIP to isolate BARX2 binding sites in MCF7 cells. Briefly, proteins in intact cells were cross-linked to DNA using formaldehyde, cells were lysed, and chromatin was sonicated to produce DNA fragments between 0.3 and 3 kb in size. Protein/DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-BARX2 antibodies, and the DNA was purified and cloned into a plasmid vector. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the 120 cloned fragments were sequenced, and these sequences were mapped to the human genome using the BLAST algorithm. For 82 of the clones, the sequences of their 5′- and 3′-ends mapped within 100 bp to 3 kb of each other, and the intervening sequences were extracted from the human genome. Thirty-eight samples were not examined further because we could not sequence both ends, because one or both end sequences mapped to repetitive elements, or because the end sequences mapped to different chromosomes, suggesting that two fragments had ligated to each other. The genes nearest to the 82 extracted BARX2-ChIP sequences were determined using a bioinformatics program called Gene-Huggers, which extracted UniGene identifiers from the GenBank™ data base. Through the combination of BLAST and GeneHuggers, 60 BARX2-ChIP fragments were mapped in proximity to known or predicted genes (those supported by mRNA sequences, or predicted by expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that overlapped assigned exons, respectively). The remaining BARX2-ChIP fragments were not analyzed further, as no mRNA or EST sequences that would predict a gene was found within a 500-kb distance of the fragment. Table I lists the genomic distribution of the 60 gene-associated BARX2 binding fragments.Table IDistribution of BARX2 binding sites relative to genesGenomic locationNumber of ChIP fragmentsIntronic21< 50 kb upstream15 (5 < 10 kb)< 50 kb downstream7 (2 < 10 kb)> 50 kb from gene17Total60 Open table in a new tab Thirty-five percent (21 of 60) of the BARX2-ChIP fragments were located within gene introns, generally within the first or second intron.

https://openalex.org/W1993347785,"The end-healing and end-sealing steps of the phage T4-induced RNA restriction-repair pathway are performed by two separate enzymes, a bifunctional polynucleotide 5′-kinase/3′-phosphatase and an ATP-dependent RNA ligase. Here we show that a single trifunctional baculovirus enzyme, RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1), catalyzes the identical set of RNA repair reactions. Three enzymatic activities of baculovirus Rnl1 are organized in a modular fashion within a 694-amino acid polypeptide consisting of an autonomous N-terminal RNA-specific ligase domain, Rnl1-(1–385), and a C-terminal kinase-phosphatase domain, Rnl1-(394–694). The ligase domain is itself composed of two functional units. The N-terminal module Rnl1-(1–270) contains essential nucleotidyltransferase motifs I, IV, and V and suffices for both enzyme adenylylation (step 1 of the ligation pathway) and phosphodiester bond formation at a preactivated RNA-adenylate end (step 3). The downstream module extending to residue 385 is required for ligation of a phosphorylated RNA substrate, suggesting that it is involved specifically in the second step of the end-joining pathway, the transfer of AMP from the ligase to the 5′-PO<sub>4</sub> end to form RNA-adenylate. The end-healing domain Rnl1-(394–694) consists of a proximal 5′-kinase module with an essential P-loop motif (<sup>404</sup>GSGKS<sup>408</sup>) and a distal 3′-phosphatase module with an essential acylphosphatase motif (<sup>560</sup>DLDGT<sup>564</sup>). Our findings have implications for the evolution of RNA repair systems and their potential roles in virus-host dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2030067277,"DNA polymerase ϵ (Polϵ), one of the three major eukaryotic replicative polymerases, is comprised of the essential catalytic subunit, called Pol2 in budding yeast, and three accessory subunits, only one of which, Dpb2, is essential. Polϵ is recruited to replication origins during late G1 phase prior to activation of replication. In this work we show that the budding yeast Dpb2 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner during late G1 phase. Phosphorylation results in the appearance of a lower mobility species. The appearance of that species in vivo is dependent upon the Cdc28 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK), which can directly phosphorylate Dpb2 in vitro. Either G1 cyclin (Cln) or B-type cyclin (Clb)-associated CDK is sufficient for phosphorylation. Mapping of phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry using a novel gel-based proteolysis protocol shows that, of the three consensus CDK phosphorylation sites, at least two, Ser-144 and Ser-616, are phosphorylated in vivo. The Cdc28 CDK phosphorylates only Ser-144 in vitro. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that Ser-144 is sufficient for the formation of the lower mobility form of Dpb2 in vivo. In contrast, Ser-616 appears not to be phosphorylated by Cdc28. Finally, inactivation of all three CDK consensus sites in Dpb2 results in a synthetic phenotype with the pol2-11 mutation, leading to decreased spore viability, slow growth, and increased thermosensitivity. We suggest that phosphorylation of Dpb2 during late G1 phase at CDK consensus sites facilitates the interaction with Pol2 or the activity of Polϵ DNA polymerase ϵ (Polϵ), one of the three major eukaryotic replicative polymerases, is comprised of the essential catalytic subunit, called Pol2 in budding yeast, and three accessory subunits, only one of which, Dpb2, is essential.

The Cdc28 CDK phosphorylates only Ser-144 in vitro. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that Ser-144 is sufficient for the formation of the lower mobility form of Dpb2 in vivo. In contrast, Ser-616 appears not to be phosphorylated by Cdc28. Finally, inactivation of all three CDK consensus sites in Dpb2 results in a synthetic phenotype with the pol2-11 mutation, leading to decreased spore viability, slow growth, and increased thermosensitivity. We suggest that phosphorylation of Dpb2 during late G1 phase at CDK consensus sites facilitates the interaction with Pol2 or the activity of Polϵ One of the crucial tasks of the cell division cycle is the faithful duplication of the genetic material once and only once per cell division cycle. Several mechanisms have evolved to ensure the fidelity of replication, including cell cycle-dependent regulation of replication proteins at the levels of the expression, degradation, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and enzyme activity. Posttranslational modification plays a central role in regulating many of these processes. The cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin dependent kinase; Clb, B-type cyclin; Cln, G1 cyclin; HA, hemagglutinin; HU, hydroxyurea; MCM, mini-chromosome maintenance; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology; Pol, polymerase; TAP, tandem affinity purification. 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin dependent kinase; Clb, B-type cyclin; Cln, G1 cyclin; HA, hemagglutinin; HU, hydroxyurea; MCM, mini-chromosome maintenance; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology; Pol, polymerase; TAP, tandem affinity purification. and Cdc7 play prominent roles in the regulation of DNA replication, and many eukaryotic replication proteins are phosphorylated. Genetic and biochemical assays with budding and fission yeasts and Xenopus egg extracts have identified two distinct phases in replication initiation. Assembly of pre-replication complexes (pre-RC) occurs in the absence of CDK activity and involves the association of Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM complex with the origin recognition complex (ORC) at replication origins. Subsequently, S phase-specific forms of the CDK and Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase activities lead to, and are required for, the recruitment of several proteins to replication origins, culminating in the recruitment of DNA polymerases α and ϵ (1Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Google Scholar, 2Masumoto H. Muramatsu S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. Nature. 2002; 415: 651-655Google Scholar, 3Kubota Y. Takase Y. Komori Y. Hashimoto Y. Arata T.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 145-161Google Scholar). In budding yeast, CDC7 and DBF4 (6Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Google Scholar) are essential genes but can be suppressed by a specific mutation in MCM5 (bob-1). This has been taken as evidence that MCM proteins are the only essential targets of Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase. Consistent with that observation, Mcm2, and to lesser extent Mcm4 and Mcm6, can be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by Cdc7-Dbf4. Phosphorylation may increase the affinity of the MCM complex for Cdc45 and its helicase activity (5Masuda T. Mimura S. Takisawa H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 145-161Google Scholar, 7Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 523-534Google Scholar). CDKs, particularly the budding yeast Cdc28, have been shown to phosphorylate a number of DNA replication factors including components of the origin recognition complex, Orc1, Orc2 and Orc6, as well as Cdc6 and MCM proteins (8Henneke G. Koundrioukoff S. Hubscher U. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 252-256Google Scholar, 9Ubersax J.A. Woodbury E.L. Quang P.N. Paraz M. Blethrow J.D. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2003; 425: 859-864Google Scholar). Cdc6 is targeted for degradation via Cdc28-dependent phosphorylation (10Perkins G. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4836-4845Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MCM proteins by Clb-Cdc28 causes nuclear exclusion of the MCM complex (11Labib K. Diffley J.F. Kearsey S.E. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 415-422Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of human Mcm4 by CDK was reported to inhibit the DNA helicase activity of the MCM complex (12Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. Kwon H.J. Yamada K. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24644-24650Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of these proteins individually is not essential for replication, it has been shown in each case to negatively regulate their function. One potential regulatory role for those phosphorylations is to prevent reinitiation (13Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Google Scholar). The only CDK-dependent phosphorylation event known to be essential for the initiation of DNA replication in yeast is the phosphorylation of Sld2/Drc1 (2Masumoto H. Muramatsu S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. Nature. 2002; 415: 651-655Google Scholar). Only the phosphorylated form of Sld2 binds to Dpb11, and, in a strain expressing the non-phosphorylatable form of Sld2 initiation fails, presumably because the Dpb11-mediated loading of DNA polymerases α and ϵ is inefficient. Similarly, CDK-dependent phosphorylation regulates the interaction between the homologous fission yeast proteins Drc1 and Cut5 (14Noguchi E. Shanahan P. Noguchi C. Russell P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 599-605Google Scholar). At least three DNA polymerases (Polα, δ, and ϵ) are required for chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes (15Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 12: 277-285Google Scholar). Polα is involved in the initiation of replication and priming of Okazaki fragments. Polδ is believed to be the main polymerase in leading strand synthesis and lagging strand maturation. Consequently, Polδ may synthesize the bulk of chromosomal DNA. Budding yeast and human Polϵ consist of four subunits (16Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Google Scholar, 17Li Y. Pursell Z.F. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23247-23252Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit and the second largest subunit are encoded by essential genes in both budding yeast (POL2 and DPB2) (18Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Google Scholar, 19Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4601-4605Google Scholar) and fission yeast (cdc20 and dpb2) (20D'Urso G. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12491-12496Google Scholar, 21Feng W. Rodriguez-Menocal L. Tolun G. D'Urso G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3427-3436Google Scholar, 22Sugino A. Ohara T. Sebastian J. Nakashima N. Araki H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 99-110Google Scholar). The two smallest subunits, Dpb3 and Dpb4, are nonessential (23Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4867-4872Google Scholar, 24Ohya T. Maki S. Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3846-3852Google Scholar). Polϵ has been implicated in chromosomal DNA replication by both genetic and biochemical analysis (25Araki H. Ropp P.A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Morrison A. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 733-740Google Scholar, 26Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 496-505Google Scholar). Its association and movement with replication forks has been well documented (27Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Google Scholar, 28Masumoto H. Sugino A. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2809-2817Google Scholar). However, its essential role remains unclear. Although Polϵ apparently functions in DNA replication (29Ohya T. Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Kanbara S. Nakajo K. Nakashima N. Suzuki A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28099-28108Google Scholar), the catalytic domain is not required for DNA replication or viability, suggesting that Polϵ has another essential role (30Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Google Scholar, 31Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Google Scholar, 32Feng W. D'Urso G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4495-4504Google Scholar). A role for Polϵ in sister chromatid cohesion has also been suggested (33Edwards S. Li C.M. Levy D.L. Brown J. Snow P.M. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2733-2748Google Scholar). However, it is clear that Polϵ is recruited to replication complexes as an early event in the initiation of DNA replication and that the intact protein is required for robust replication of chromosomes during S phase. In this work we show that the budding yeast Polϵ subunit, Dpb2, is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Furthermore, phosphorylation in vivo is dependent upon Cdc28, and Dpb2 can be directly phosphorylated by the Cdc28 CDK in vitro. We have identified at least one site of phosphorylation by Cdc28 as well as additional sites of in vivo phosphorylation. Inactivation of three CDK consensus sites in Dpb2, although not lethal, results in a synthetic phenotype with the pol2-11 allele of the catalytic subunit, culminating in decreased spore viability, decreased growth rate, and thermosensitivity. We suggest that phosphorylation of Dpb2 at CDK consensus sites facilitates the interaction with Pol2 or the activity of the Polϵ complex. Yeast Strains—The strains used in this study are based on 15Daub, a bar1Δ ura3Δns derivative of BF264-15D (MATa ade1 his2 leu2-3,112 trp1-1) (34Hadwiger J.A. Wittenberg C. Richardson H.E. de Barros Lopes M. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6255-6259Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated, and their relevant genotypes are as follows: CWY231 (MATa); TAY179 (MATa DPB2-6xmyc::KANMX); TAY181 (MATa pol2::HA-POL2::URA3 DPB2-6xmyc::KANMX); TAY247 (MATα pol2-11); TAY525 (MATa pol2::HA-pol2-16 DPB2-6myc::KANMX); TAY768 (MATa cdc28-13 DPB2-6xmyc::KANMX); TAY771 (MATa cdc7-4 DPB2-6xmyc:: KANMX); TAY774 (MATa cdc28-4 DPB2-6xmyc::KANMX); TAY775 (MATa cdc34-3 DPB2-6xmyc::KANMX); TAY786 (MATa dpb2-CDKIII); TAY854 (MATa dpb2-CDKI+III); TAY857 (MATa dpb2-CDKI-III::URA3); TAY861 (MATa pol2-11 dpb2-CDKI-III::URA3); TAY906 (MATa cdc28:: CUP1-TAP-CDC28::URA3); TAY73 (W303-1a background, MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 ubr1Δ::GAL-UBR1::LEU2 DPB2-6xmyc:: KANMX); and TAY74 (W303-1a, MATa ubr1Δ::GAL-UBR1:: LEU2 mcm2-td::URA3 DPB2-6xmyc::KANMX). Plasmids—CDK consensus phosphorylation sites in DPB2 were mutated by PCR using overlapping primers. YCplac33DPB2 (35Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11791-11795Google Scholar) was used as a template. Mutation of site I (TP to AP) was marked with a PvuI restriction site, and sites II and III (SP to AP) were marked with a HaeII restriction site. Mutated PCR fragments were subcloned into a pRS416-DPB2-3xHA vector for mobility shift assays or into pRS406-DPB2 for integrating the mutated form into the chromosomal locus. Following integration, Ura+ transformants were grown on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, and DPB2-CDK site mutants were identified from the Ura- clones by Southern blotting or PCR-based HaeII and PvuI restriction analysis. For overexpression and biochemical assays, DPB2-3xHA and corresponding CDK site mutants were cloned into a YCp-GAL1 vector. pRS306-CUP1-TAP-CDC28 was generated by replacing the degron cassette of pPW66R (36Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Google Scholar) with a TAP fragment (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar). The TAP fragment for N-terminal tagging was a gift from S. Saitoh. The pKL73 plasmid for generating mcm2-td strains was provided by J. Diffley. Details of plasmids will be provided upon request. Yeast Growth and Synchronization—Yeast cells were grown in either rich medium (YEPD; yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose) or, when selection for plasmid maintenance was needed, in synthetic medium supplemented with the appropriate carbon source. bar1Δ cells were arrested in G1 phase with 50 ng of α-factor per milliliter. The α-factor was removed by centrifugation, and cells were suspended in fresh medium. The BAR1 strains were synchronized with 10 μg of α-factor per milliliter as described (39Labib K. Kearsey S.E. Diffley J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3658-3667Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for flow cytometry as described (40Haase S.B. Reed S.I. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 132-136Google Scholar) and analyzed by a FACScan analyzer (BD Biosciences). Immunoblotting—Preparation of protein extracts, immunoprecipitation, blotting, and antibodies have been described (38Hsiung Y.G. Chang H.C. Pellequer J.L. La Valle R. Lanker S. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2506-2520Google Scholar). For Dpb2p mobility shift assays, 6.5% acrylamide and 0.13% N,N′-methylene bis-acrylamide (pH 8.4) gels were used. In Vivo Labeling of Dpb2—HA-tagged Dpb2 and CDK site mutants were expressed from the GAL1 promoter in YEP-Gal (yeast extract, peptone, and galactose) medium. Preparation of medium and in vivo labeling of proteins with [32P]phosphoric acid were as described (41Warner J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 423-428Google Scholar). Dpb2-HA was immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions (42Lanker S. Valdivieso M.H. Wittenberg C. Science. 1996; 271: 1597-1601Google Scholar), and incorporation of 32P was detected by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Identical cultures were mock treated (no 32P), and Dpb2 was analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Dpb2—Cdc28 was expressed as an N-terminal fusion to the TAP tag (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar) from the CUP1 promoter, bound to IgG-Sepharose, and released by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage. Dpb2-HA substrates were purified by immunoprecipitation from overexpressing yeast strains. They were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, and kinase assays were done essentially as described (43Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1182-1186Google Scholar) with or without added Cdc28. Mass Spectrophotometric Identification of Phosphorylation Sites in Dpb2—Dpb2-HA overexpressed from the GAL1 promoter was immunoprecipitated from cells collected from two liters of culture with anti-HA antibodies coupled to Sepharose beads. The beads were washed sequentially with lysis buffer, water, and radioimmune precipitation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 8 m urea containing 1% SDS. Eluted proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The Dpb2 doublet was visualized by Coomassie staining, and the protein bands were cut from the gel. Each gel slice was split into thirds and subjected to digestion using three separate proteases, trypsin, elastase, and subtilisin to increase the number and variety of peptides generated. The mixture of peptides was separated by multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MudPIT) as described (44MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates III, J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Google Scholar, 45McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Miyamoto D.T. Mitchison T.J. Yates III, J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 219: 245-251Google Scholar). Each potential site of phosphorylation was detected with multiple overlapping peptide identifications and then manually evaluated for quality of identification. Dpb2p Is Phosphorylated in a Cell Cycle-regulated Manner—Analysis of Dpb2 in SDS-polyacrylamide gels reveals two forms of differing mobility. This is true for both the N-terminally and C-terminally tagged proteins as well as untagged Dpb2 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). When Myc-tagged Dpb2p was immunoprecipitated, treated with lambda phosphatase, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the slower migrating form was lost (Fig. 1B). The band persisted if phosphatase inhibitors were included in the digest. Thus, the reduced mobility was due to phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Both the low and high mobility forms were present in an approximately equal ratio in asynchronously growing cells and cells treated with the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), nocodazole, or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, cells arrested in G1 phase with α-factor contained little or none of the lower mobility species. This suggested that Dpb2 phosphorylation might be regulated during the cell cycle. To evaluate that possibility, wild-type cells carrying Myc-tagged Dpb2 were arrested in G1 with α-factor and then released into the cell cycle. Samples were taken at 15-min intervals and analyzed for DNA content and Dpb2 mobility shift (Fig. 1C). Consistent with cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Dpb2, the slower migrating form of Dpb2p appeared at 45 min, coinciding with entry into S phase. Although we did not observe the disappearance of the phosphorylated form, perhaps due to poor synchrony in the second cycle, we found that unbudded G1 phase cells isolated by centrifugal elutriation also contained little or no phosphorylated Dpb2 (data not shown). Thus, Dpb2 appears to be phosphorylated as cells enter S phase, with disappearance of the modified form occurring sometime subsequent to mitosis or cytokinesis. Although Dpb2 appears to be phosphorylated for a significant portion of the cell cycle, we have not observed a complete shift of Dpb2 to the slow migrating form under any conditions. This suggests that phosphorylation might be restricted to a subpopulation of Dpb2. We first considered the possibility that Dpb2 phosphorylation was associated with its capacity to interact with Pol2. To evaluate that possibility, Pol2, tagged with the HA epitope, was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Dpb2-Myc, and the proteins in the immune complexes were evaluated by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Both forms of the Dpb2-Myc protein were detected in immunoprecipitates of HA-tagged Pol2p, demonstrating that the modification is neither required for, nor restricts, incorporation into Polϵ holoenzyme complexes. Furthermore, modification does not require the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase ϵ, because both species can also be found associated with Pol2-16, which is devoid of catalytic domains (30Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Google Scholar). However, under certain conditions we did observe a modest enrichment of the lower mobility species of Dpb2 in immunoprecipitates of Pol2-HA when compared with the whole cell extract from which that immune complex was prepared (Fig. 1A), suggesting that there may be a preference for binding to the phosphorylated form of the protein. Next, we asked whether loading of Dpb2 onto origins of replication was required for Dpb2 phosphorylation. Loading of Polϵ is mediated by Dpb11, whose recruitment requires intact MCM function (28Masumoto H. Sugino A. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2809-2817Google Scholar). Hence, Dpb2 was tagged with a Myc epitope in a strain in which Mcm2 could be eliminated via a thermally inducible degron (36Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Google Scholar, 39Labib K. Kearsey S.E. Diffley J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3658-3667Google Scholar). The mobility of Dpb2-Myc was analyzed by in an mcm2-td strain following release from mating pheromone arrest at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylated low mobility species of Dpb2 accumulated following release from the G1 arrest regardless of the functionality of Mcm2. Thus, Dpb2 phosphorylation is independent of the binding of Pol2 holoenzyme complexes to replication origins; in fact, the possibility remained that phosphorylation of Dpb2 is a prerequisite for the association of Polϵ with replication origins. Dpb2 Phosphorylation Is Dependent upon Cdc28 CDK—We wished to identify the kinase responsible for Dpb2 phosphorylation. Because Dpb2 was modified upon entry into S phase, we concentrated on kinases known to function in S phase progression. The checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53 were eliminated as candidates, because phosphorylation of Dpb2 was unaffected by the deletion of either gene (not shown). To evaluate the role of Cdc7, a kinase required for the initiation of DNA replication and known to phosphorylate a number of replication proteins (6Masai H. Arai K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 287-296Google Scholar), Dpb2 was tagged with a Myc epitope in a temperature-sensitive cdc7-4 mutant strain. Its modification was followed in cells released from α-factor block under either permissive or restrictive conditions (Fig. 2B). At a restrictive temperature, no DNA synthesis was observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, confirming Cdc7 inactivation under these conditions. However, phosphorylated Dpb2 was detected at 30 min. The earlier appearance of this form was likely due to the enhanced rate of cell cycle progression at 37 °C. Thus, Dpb2p is phosphorylated independently of Cdc7 function. Importantly, Dpb2 phosphorylation is observed in cdc7-4 and mcm2-td cells despite the failure of the cells to complete or even initiate chromosomal DNA replication (see “Discussion”). To evaluate the role of the Cdc28 CDK, we performed the same experiment in a strain carrying cdc28-13, a temperature sensitive allele of CDC28 (Fig. 2C). Unlike the cdc7 mutant, when cdc28-13 cells were released from α-factor block at the restrictive temperature, Dpb2p failed to be phosphorylated. In contrast, both species of Dpb2 were detected when cells were maintained at the permissive temperature upon release from the mating pheromone. Thus, phosphorylation of Dpb2 was dependent upon the Cdc28 protein kinase. The Cdc28 CDK exists in a number of distinct complexes. These can be separated into B-type cyclin (Clb) CDK complexes and G1 cyclin (Cln) CDK complexes. Although Cln/CDK complexes are required to progress from the mating pheromone block into a new cell cycle (46Richardson H.E. Wittenberg C. Cross F. Reed S.I. Cell. 1989; 59: 1127-1133Google Scholar), it is the B-type cyclins Clb5 and Clb6 that associate with Cdc28 to drive cells into S phase (47Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Google Scholar, 48Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Google Scholar). Activation of those kinases, but not activation of Cln/CDK, depends upon the activity of the Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which targets the Clb/CDK inhibitor, Sic1, for degradation (48Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Google Scholar). Therefore, to evaluate whether Cln/CDK or Clb/CDK was required for Dpb2 phosphorylation, we evaluated the formation of the lower mobility species of Dpb2 in a cdc34-3 mutant strain released from mating pheromone arrest at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2C). Cells that arrested subsequent to budding, but prior to entry into S phase, accumulated the phosphorylated form of Dpb2. These results suggest that Cln/CDK is sufficient for the phosphorylation of Dpb2p in vivo. The results above indicate that G1 cyclin-associated forms of the Cdc28 CDK are sufficient for formation of the lower mobility phosphorylated species of Dpb2. However, because Cln/CDK is required for cell cycle progression, it is unclear whether the accumulation of the phosphorylated species depends directly upon Cln/CDK or rather is a consequence of cell cycle progression. In addition, we also observe phosphorylation late in the cell cycle when G1 cyclins are not expressed. It is unclear whether that is a consequence of the stability of the phosphorylated species or whether Clb-associated CDK is also sufficient for Dpb2 phosphorylation. To address those questions, we performed the following experiment. First, we evaluated whether phosphorylated Dpb2 persists in cells arrested in S phase using the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, hydroxyurea. Wild-type cells carrying Myc-tagged Dpb2p were pre-synchronized during G1 phase with the mating pheromone and then released in the presence of hydroxyurea. After 3 h to allow synchronization in S phase, Dpb2p was found to be phosphorylated (Fig. 2D, lane A). Because G1 cyclins are absent in hydroxyurea-arrested cells, we can conclude that Dpb2 phosphorylation persists in the absence of Cln/CDK. Next, to determine whether the phosphorylation of Dpb2, apparent in the arrested cells, is dependent upon the CDK, we synchronized temperature-sensitive cdc28-4 mutant cells in the same manner and then, in the presence of hydroxyurea, shifted them to the restrictive temperature to inactivate the cdc28-4 CDK (Fig. 2D, lane B). In that case, the lower mobility species of Dpb2 is lost, indicating that phosphorylation of Dpb2 outside of G1 phase is dependent upon the persistence of Cdc28 activity and, therefore, upon Clb-associated CDK. Finally, the cultures were shifted to 37 °C, and hydroxyurea was removed (Fig. 2D, lane C). Again, no lower mobility species of Dpb2 was observed. In each case, phosphorylation persisted in wild-type cells. Together, these results establish that Cdc28 kinase is required for Dpb2p phosphorylation and that either Cln/Cdc28 or Clb/Cdc28 kinases are sufficient. Dpb2 Is Phosphorylated at a Site Conforming to the CDK Consensus—Analysis of the primary sequence of Dpb2p reveals two sites conforming to the full consensus for CDK phosphorylation, (S/T)PX(K/R) (I and III, Fig. 3A) and an additional site meeting the minimal criteria for a CDK site, (S/T)P (II, Fig. 3A). We considered those sites candidates for phosphorylation by the Cdc28 kinase. To evaluate whether those sites were responsible for the phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift we observed in Dpb2, the serine or threonine residues at these sites were mutated to alanine either individually or in various combinations. The mutant forms of Dpb2 tagged with the HA-epitope were expressed from a plasmid in a wild-type strain and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). That analysis revealed that mutation of Ser-144 (site III) was sufficient to eliminate the lower mobility species of Dpb2-HA, whereas alanine substitution at Thr-272 (site I) or Ser-616 (site II) had no effect on the appearance of that species. We conclude that Dpb2 is phosphorylated in a Cdc28-dependent manner and that at least one site of phosphorylation, Ser-144, leads to an observable mobility shift. Although it was possible that the remaining sites were phosphorylated, phosphorylation at those sites did not result in a change in electrophoretic mobility under the gel conditions used. In an attempt to refine the previous analysis, we analyzed the incorporation of isotopically labeled 32P into Dpb2 in vivo. Cells carrying HA-tagged alleles of either wild-type Dpb2 or Dpb2 in which the putative CDK sites were mutated were grown in 32P-orthophosphate, and the Dpb2-HA immunoprecipitated from those cells was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 3C).

In addition to the genomic RNA of 7.4 kb, a subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) of 2.2 kb, which is identical in sequence to the 3′ one-third of the genomic RNA, is also synthesized in RHDV-infected cells. Numerous RNA viruses make sgRNA for expression of their 3′-proximal genes. A relevant mechanism for viral gene expression is the regulation of sgRNA synthesis by specific promoter elements. In this study, we have investigated in vitro the sgRNA synthesis mechanism using recombinant RHDV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells and synthetic RHDV (–)RNAs of different lengths containing regions located upstream of the subgenomic start site. We report evidences supporting that the sgRNA of RHDV is synthesized in vitro by internal initiation (subgenomic promoter) on (–)RNA templates of genomic length. The deletion mapping of the subgenomic promoter starting from minus-strand genomic length RNA showed that a sequence of 50 nucleotides upstream of the sgRNA start site (+1) is sufficient for full subgenomic promoter activity in an in vitro assay using recombinant RHDV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This study reports the first description of a subgenomic promoter in a member of the Caliciviridae.

This study reports the first description of a subgenomic promoter in a member of the Caliciviridae. Positive-strand RNA viruses are defined by the translatability of their genomic RNAs (gRNA). 1The abbreviations used are: gRNA, genomic RNA; 3Dpol, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; ORF, open reading frame; RHDV, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; sgRNA, subgenomic RNA; ORF, open reading frame; VPg, virus-encoded protein. 1The abbreviations used are: gRNA, genomic RNA; 3Dpol, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; ORF, open reading frame; RHDV, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; sgRNA, subgenomic RNA; ORF, open reading frame; VPg, virus-encoded protein. For some of them, such as picornaviruses and flaviviruses, the gRNA is the only viral mRNA in the infected cells. Nevertheless, there are many other viruses in which one or more subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNA) are also synthesized. SgRNA of positive-strand viruses are 3′-co-terminal and identical to the gRNA for most of their length but have deletions at the 5′ ends (with respect to gRNA) to bring their 5′ ends close to the start codon of downstream (on genomic RNA) ORFs. In these cases, some of the viral genes are translated from the sgRNA species, thus creating the potential for independently regulating the levels of viral proteins in infected cells. SgRNA synthesis has been more studied in plant viruses than in animal viruses, probably because a greater percentage of all of the plant viruses make sgRNA and also because their smaller genomes and highly efficient replication make them more amenable to studies on RNA replication mechanisms, especially using cell-free extracts. Several basic mechanisms for generating subgenomic RNAs have been defined (1Miller W.A. Koev G. Virology. 2000; 273: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The most widely recognized model is internal initiation on longer-than-subgenomic-length (–)strand templates in which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) internally initiates (+)strand sgRNA synthesis. Initiation of RNA synthesis occurs at selected sites called promoters, which have been characterized in several plant viruses (2Miller W.A. Dreher T.W. Hall T.C.

Most of the characterized viral RNA promoters are located at the 3′ end of the RNA templates, and they often have stem-loop structures or consist of short single-stranded regions with unique primary sequences (13Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dreher T.W. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1999; 37: 151-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Kao C.C. Singh P. Ecker D.J. Virology. 2001; 287: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The best characterized cases are the subgenomic promoters for brome mosaic virus and Turnip crinkle virus. The second mechanism is premature termination during (–)strand synthesis from the genomic RNA template, giving a subgenomic-length (–)strand (16Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This would then serve as template for end-to-end (+)strand synthesis.Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a member of the Caliciviridae (17Ohlinger V.F. Haas B. Meyers G. Thiel H-J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Parra F. Prieto M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4013-4015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cubbit D. Bradley D.W. Carter M.J. Chiba S. Estes M.K. Saif L.J. Schaffer F.L. Smith A.W. Studdert M.J. Thiel. H.J. Arch. Virol. 1995; 10: 359-363Google Scholar). The genome of RHDV consists of a single positive-stranded RNA of 7.4 kb (20Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.J. Virology. 1991; 184: 664-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) that has a virus-encoded protein, VPg (21Wirblich C. Thiel H.J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), attached covalently to the 5′end (22Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.J. Virology. 1991; 184: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and is polyadenylated at the 3′ end. Viral particles also encapsidate a VPg-linked polyadenylated subgenomic RNA of approximately 2.2 kb (22Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.J. Virology. 1991; 184: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which is co-terminal with the 3′ end of the viral genome. Progress on the replication of caliciviruses has been negligible (23Clarke I.N. Lambden P.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) compared with the advances made with the picornaviruses. Because of the lack of a cell culture system for most caliciviruses such as RHDV, recombinant DNA technology has been crucial for the production and characterization of viral proteins. The data obtained from the in vitro translation (21Wirblich C. Thiel H.J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli expression studies (24Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved to give rise to mature structural and nonstructural proteins. The extensive sequence similarities between the RdRp of picornaviruses (3Dpol) and the RHDV polyprotein cleavage product p58 (21Wirblich C. Thiel H.J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25König M. Thiel H.J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4492-4497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that this polypeptide might have a similar role in RHDV genome replication. Recently, the structure of the recombinant RdRp from RHDV produced in E. coli has been determined by x-ray crystallography showing a close structural similarity to the RdRps from poliovirus and hepatitis C virus (26Ng K.K. Cherney M.M. López Vázquez A. Machín A. Alonso J.M. Parra F. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the purified recombinant RHDV enzyme also showed RdRp activity acting on synthetic RHDV positive subgenomic RNA in the presence or absence of an oligo(U) primer (27López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Parra F. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Templatesized products were synthesized in the oligo(U)-primed reactions as described for EMCV 3Dpol (29Sankar S. Porter A.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the absence of added primer, RNA products up to twice the length of the template were made, suggesting that the newly made negative-strand RNA was covalently linked to the plus-strand RNA template (27López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the structural and functional similarities found between the Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae, the synthesis of a sgRNA in the Caliciviridae denotes a significant discrepancy concerning their gene expression strategies.In this work, we have intended the study of RHDV sgRNA initiation using synthetic (–)RNAs of genomic length or having varying deletions at their 3′ regions considering that, in addition to their role as templates for (+)strand gRNA production, they might also have internal sequences involved in initiation of sgRNA synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmid pBac-3D—The coding region for RHDV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol) was cloned as a EcoRI-XbaI cassette by PCR amplification of an AST/89 RHDV isolate cDNA. This was done by using oligonucleotide primers 3D5′ (5′-tcacaggatccgccaccatgacatcaaacttcttctgc-3′) and 3D3′ (5′-gtgcgtctagatcactccataacattcac-3′), which also added the indicated restriction enzyme recognition sequences (underlined residues) at both ends of the amplified region. The resulting amplicon was EcoRI-XbaI digested, and the 1.5-kb fragment containing the RHDV RdRp gene (3Dpol) was inserted into EcoRI-XbaI-digested expression vector pBacPAK8 (Invitrogen) to generate the recombinant plasmid pBac-3D.Production of Recombinant RHDV 3Dpol—A recombinant baculovirus containing the RHDV 3Dpol-coding sequence under control of the polyhedrin promoter was made by co-transfection of Sf9 cells with plasmid pBac-3D and the β-galactosidase-containing AcNPV (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus or baculovirus) DNA. The recombinant baculovirus Bac-3D was plaque-purified (30Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Virology. 1978; 84: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and propagated using monolayers of Sf9 cells infected at multiplicities of 0.1–1.0 plaque-forming unit/cell for virus amplification or 1–10 plaque-forming unit/cell for protein expression assays. For screening of the recombinant clones, 1 h after infection, cells were overlaid with 1.5% agarose in Grace's medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (120 μg/ml). Blue plaques could be detected 5–10 days post-infection. Occlusion negative plaques were identified under a microscope and were picked using sterile glass-disposable pipettes to remove the agarose directly over the plaque. The plaques were suspended in fresh medium and used for subsequent plaque assays or for virus amplification.Recombinant baculovirus-infected H5 cells were harvested, concentrated by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) to a final concentration of 1 × 104 H5 cells/μl prior to sonication on ice using a 20-kilocycle sonifier (1-min burst followed by four 30-s bursts with 2-min cooling steps between bursts). The resulting crude cell extract was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was stored at –70 °C after addition of 5% glycerol and RNase inhibitor (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).In Vitro Synthesis of RHDV RNAs—Positive and negative sense gRNA, sgRNA, and a series of 3′-truncated (–)gRNAs or 5′-truncated (+)gRNAs were obtained (Fig. 4) by transcription in vitro of purified PCR fragments to which a modified T7 promoter was added using the appropriate primers (Table I). The PCR fragments used to produce full-length positive (gRNA+) or negative sense genomic RNA (gRNA–) were made using primer pairs RHDV10/RHDV14 and RHDV1/RHDV9, respectively (Table I). The PCR used to produce positive (sgRNA+) or negative sense subgenomic RNA (sgRNA–) were made using RHDV7/RHDV9 and RHDV13/RHDV14 primer pairs, respectively (Table I). The PCR used to produce a series of 5′-truncated (+)gRNAs (Fig. 4, RNA h and RNA i) were made using primer pairs RHDV11/14 and RHDV12/14, and the series of 3′-truncated (–)gRNAs (Fig. 4, RNA a, RNA b, RNA c, RNA d, RNA e, and RNA g) were made using RHDV2/9, RHDV3/9, RHDV4/9, RHDV5/9, RHDV6/9, RHDV7/9, and RHDV8/9 (Table I). The RNA transcripts were made using the large scale RNA production system Ribomax (Promega). The resulting positive and negative transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing agarose gels, and their concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification of RHDV cDNAs for in vitro transcription of positive and negative synthetic RNAsNamePosition in RHDVPrimer sequenceaThe sequences are written from 5′ to 3′.

Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described elsewhere (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay.Preparation of Oligo(U)—Oligo(U) was made by alkali hydrolysis of poly(U) as described previously (33Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The size of the resulting oligo(U) was investigated by end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and electrophoresis on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels.Enzymatic Assays—In vitro RHDV polymerase assays were performed as described previously (27López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reactions were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing appropriate concentrations of 3Dpol (1–10 μl of baculovirus-infected H5 cell-free extract), 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 μm ATP, 10 μm CTP, 10 μm GTP, 5 μm UTP, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 6 μm zinc chloride, 50 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), 25 μmol of [α-32 P]UTP, and 14–28 nm of the appropriate synthetic RNA template or poly(A) template in the absence (–) or presence (+) of oligo(U) primer. After incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, the reaction mixtures were phenolchloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and 20 μg of carrier tRNA. The sediments were dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer, loaded onto 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and analyzed at 60–70 V. The gels were then dried, and the 32P-labeled RNA was detected by autoradiography.RESULTSProduction of Recombinant RHDV 3Dpol Using Baculovirus-infected Insect Cells—Previous functional (27López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Parra F. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and structural (26Ng K.K. Cherney M.M. López Vázquez A. Machín A. Alonso J.M. Parra F. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) studies on RHDV 3Dpol used a recombinant protein produced in E. coli, which nonetheless showed enzymatic activity on homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNA templates. In this work, we have selected insect cells as the host system to produce recombinant 3Dpol. For this purpose, a suitable vector was made (see “Experimental Procedures”) after PCR amplification of the previously identified 3Dpol-coding region. The resulting gene construct included an added ATG initiator codon in an optimized Kozak (34Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) sequence context and was 5′- and 3′-flanked by appropriate restriction enzyme targets to facilitate directional cloning. After digestion using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and XbaI, the amplicon was directly cloned into EcoRI-XbaI-digested pBacPAK8 vector (Invitrogen) yielding the baculovirus transfer vector pBac-3D, which was sequenced to investigate the correct reading frame.A recombinant baculovirus was generated following co-transfection of Sf9 cells with transfer vector pBac-3D and infectious BacPAK6 DNA. Viral DNA recombination resulted in the replacement of polyhedrin gene sequences by the RHDV 3Dpol construct from the pBac-3D transfer vector.Expression of the recombinant RHDV 3Dpol gene cloned in baculovirus Bac-3D was expected to produce a 58-kDa polypeptide in the infected cells. In good agreement to this prediction, the protein pattern of baculovirus-infected cell-free extracts after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining showed a protein product of the expected size, which was increasingly predominant at longer infections times (Fig. 1). It should be mentioned that the recombinant 3Dpol produced in insect cells was expected to be almost identical in amino acid sequence (only an initiator Met was added) to the authentic RHDV polymerase obtained after proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein (24Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wirblich C. Sibilia M. Boniotti B. Rossi C. Thiel H.J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 1SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant RHDV 3Dpol produced in insect cells. The protein pattern was obtained after separation and Coomassie Blue staining of cell-free extract samples from mock infected (lane 1) or Bac-3D-infected H5 (lanes 2–6) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days post-infection respectively. The numbers on the left indicate the protein markers for molecular mass (in kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recombinant RHDV 3Dpol Activity Assay—As a first approach to investigate the biological activity of recombinant RHDV 3Dpol produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells, we used a previously described poly(A)-dependent oligo(U)-primed poly(U) polymerase assay (29Sankar S. Porter A.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts of H5 cells mockinfected or infected with recombinant baculovirus Bac-3D containing equivalent amounts of total soluble protein were assayed for poly(A)-dependent poly(U) polymerase activity in the presence and absence of an oligo(U) primer (Fig. 2). The results indicated that poly(U) polymerase activity was detectable in H5 cells 1 day post-infection and increased with time up to day 3 post-infection (Fig. 2). This observation was consistent with the relative amounts of 3Dpol in the cell extracts, as deduced from the intensity pattern of the protein band observed after SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, lanes 2–6). As described earlier for recombinant RdRp produced in E. coli, the poly(U) polymerase activity found in the infected-H5 extracts was dependent on the presence of an added oligo(U) primer, an omission of which resulted in an almost complete loss of activity (Fig. 2). It should be mentioned that activity levels were not proportional to the volume of cell extract in the assay reaction when samples over 10 μl of H5 extracts were used, indicating the presence of an inhibitory component in the cell extract (data not shown). For this reason, in subsequent analyses using hetero-polymeric RNA templates, 1–10 μl of H5 extracts will be used.Fig. 2Poly(U)-polymerase activity in mock or Bac-3D-infected H5 cell free extracts. Crude extracts were assayed for poly(U)-polymerase activity using a poly(A) template and an oligo(U) primer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubations contained mock-infected H5 (▵) and Bac-3D-infected H5 cells harvested at day 1 (▴), day 2 (□), day 3 (⋄), and day 4 (•) post-infection in the presence of oligo(U) primer or day 4 post-infection in the absence of oligo(U) primer (▪). The reactions were stopped at the indicated times of incubation and assayed for acid-precipitable radioactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RdRp Activity on Heteropolymeric RNA Templates—To investigate whether the recombinant enzyme produced in insect cells exhibited RdRp activity on heteropolymeric RNA templates, synthetic RHDV genomic and subgenomic RNAs of positive and negative polarity were made by in vitro transcription of purified PCR fragments to which a modified T7 minimal promoter sequence was added (see “Experimental Procedures”). The synthetic RHDV genomic and subgenomic RNAs of positive polarity transcribed in vitro where identical in nucleotide sequence with respect to the authentic viral gRNA and sgRNA and differed only in that the synthetic transcripts lacked a covalently linked VPg protein at their 5′ ends and in that the 3′ terminus had a shorter poly(A) tail of only 23 residues. The synthetic RHDV genomic and subgenomic RNAs of negative polarity were complementary to the positive gRNA and sgRNA transcripts for most of their lengths but differed in a few additional residues (<7) added to the 5′-poly(U) as a consequence of the sequence GGGGCGG included in the oligonucleotide used to make the amplicons (Table 1) in order to allow efficient T7 transcription initiation. The size and quantity of the RNA templates used and the labeled RNA products synthesized in the RdRp assays were analyzed by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis.The RHDV RdRp produced in baculovirus-infected H5 cells was able to use (+)- and (–)-single-stranded RNA templates in the absence of added primers. As has been described previously using the bacterially produced RHDV RdRp (27López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A. Parra F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2999-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the major labeled products in the presence of either gRNA or sgRNA of (+) polarity were of twice the length (∼15 and 4.4 kb, respectively) of the input template (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–2). When (–)gRNA was used as template (Fig. 3B, lane 1), the major synthesized product was of the size of sgRNA (2.2 kb). In the presence of (–)sgRNA as the template, the products, if any, were poorly labeled indicating low polymerization efficiency, being the major observed band of twice the length (4.4 kb) of the input template (Fig. 3B, lane 2). These data suggested that the subgenomic RNA of RHDV was synthesized in vitro by internal initiation of replication on a (–)RNA template of genomic length.Fig. 3RHDV RdRp assays using heteropolymeric RNA templates. The reactions were made in the absence of added RNA template (lanes 3) or in the presence of synthetic gRNA (lanes 1) or sgRNA (lanes 2) of positive (panel A) or negative polarity (panel B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Deletion Mapping of a Putative Subgenomic Promoter—To further investigate initiation of sgRNA synthesis on (–)gRNA templates and aiming to map the minimum sequence required for full function of the putative internal promoter, a series of deletion mutants were constructed in which the 3′-terminal sequence of (–)gRNA was progressively deleted (Fig. 4, transcripts a–g), approaching (transcripts a–e), reaching (transcript f), or surpassing (transcripts g) the transcriptional start residue (+1) for sgRNA. A series of (+)transcripts identical in nucleotide sequence to the RHDV sgRNA (Fig. 4, transcript j) or including 100 (transcript i) or 257 (transcript h) 5′-additional genomic residues were also made. The truncated RNA transcripts of positive and negative polarity made by in vitro transcription of appropriate amplicons were used as templates in the absence of added primers in in vitro RHDV RdRp assays.The major labeled products obtained using (+)RNA templates h, i, and j (Fig. 4) were of twice the length of the input RNA (Fig. 5B, lanes h–j), suggesting that de novo initiation, premature termination, or template terminal-labeling have not occurred in these in vitro reactions. Moreover, the presence of double-sized products suggested a template-primed synthesis mechanism (15Kao C.C. Singh P. Ecker D.J. Virology. 2001; 287: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) as described earlier for the RHDV enzyme produced in bacteria (27López Vázquez A. Martín Alonso J.M. Casais R. Boga J.A.

In these reactions, a second slow-moving band of up to twice the size of the RNA template was also present (Fig. 5A, lanes a–d). These results suggested that under the experimental conditions used RHDV RdRp could concomitantly perform a template-primed synthesis, giving rise to the minor double-sized products, and a de novo synthesis"
https://openalex.org/W2025081923,"Mammalian phospholipase D (PLD) has been reported to be a key enzyme for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cellular signaling, however, the regulatory mechanism of PLD is still unclear. In this report, we found that Munc-18-1 is a potent negative regulator of PLD in the basal state and that its inhibition is abolished by EGF stimulation. We investigated PLD-binding proteins obtained from rat brain extract, and identified a 67-kDa protein as Munc-18-1 by peptide-mass finger-printing. The direct association between PLD and Munc-18-1 was confirmed by in vitro binding analysis using the purified proteins, and their binding sites were identified as the phox homology domain of PLD and multiple sites of Munc-18-1. PLD activity was potently inhibited by Munc-18-1 in vitro (IC50 = 2–5 nm), and the cotransfection of COS-7 cells with Munc-18-1 and PLD inhibited basal PLD activity in vivo. In the basal state, Munc-18-1 coprecipitated with PLD and colocalized with PLD2 at the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells. EGF treatment triggered the dissociation of Munc-18-1 from PLD when PLD was activated by EGF. The dissociation of the endogenous interaction between Munc-18-1 and PLD, and the activation of PLD by EGF were also observed in primary cultured chromaffin cells. These results suggest that Munc-18-1 is a potent negative regulator of basal PLD activity and that EGF stimulation abolishes this interaction.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). PA itself has been shown to be an intracellular lipid second messenger and to be involved in multiple physiological events, such as membrane vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, mitogenesis, and respiratory bursts in a large number of cells. These findings suggest that agonist-induced PLD activation may play roles in multiple signaling events (2Jones D. Morgan C. Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys.

To date, two types of mammalian PLD, namely PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned (8Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). They share a sequence homology of around 50% and contain similar regulatory domains, such as the phox homology (PX) and the pleckstrin homology domains (9Colley W.C. Altshuller Y.M. Sue-Ling C.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Branch K.D. Tsirka S.E. Bollag R.J. Bollag W.B. Frohman M.A. Biochem.

Many reports have suggested that PLD activity may be involved in various cellular physiologies (11Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms of PLD activity in its various functions have not been well characterized. Therefore, the identification of novel proteins that interact with PLD may provide clues about its function, not only in terms of the mechanisms that regulate PLD, but also in terms of the functional association between these regulators and specific cellular events. Many reports have suggested that PLD plays a role in the transduction of the intracellular signals initiated by various agonists (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 12Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because the product of PLD, PA, is involved in many cellular signaling events, agonist-induced PLD activation must be tightly controlled. Moreover, PLD is known to be positively regulated by various proteins and signals, for example, by ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), protein kinase C, and EGF (12Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In particular, EGF stimulation increases PLD1 activity and this activation is downstream of PIP2 hydrolyzing phospholipase C and subsequent protein kinase Cα activation (14Han J.M. Kim Y. Lee J.S. Lee C.S. Lee B.D. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3976-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of PLD2 activation by EGF is at present unclear, even though a recent report suggested that ARF4 is a potential mediator (15Kim S.W. Hayashi M. Lo J.F. Yang Y.

Munc-18-1 is a 67-kDa protein, which was originally identified as a major brain protein, which binds to syntaxin, a synaptic vesicle fusion protein (20Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Munc-18-1 is enriched in neurons, whereas Munc-18-2 and Munc-18-3 are expressed ubiquitously (23Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Knockouts of Munc-18-1 have demonstrated that this protein is essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis (24Harrison S.D. Broadie K. van de Goor J. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 25Wu M.N. Littleton J.T. Bhat M.A. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), but the molecular mode of action of Munc-18-1 is not known in detail. Even though Munc-18-1 is an important protein in neuronal exocytosis and its protein-protein interactions may be critical in the fusion event, relatively few of its binding partners have been identified (26Verhage M. de Vries K.J.

Furthermore, it has not been previously reported that Munc-18-1 can dynamically inhibit enzyme activity by direct interaction or that it is involved in cellular signaling events. In this study, we found for the first time that Munc-18-1 is a PLD-interacting molecule, and its inhibitory effect on PLD occurs by direct interaction with the PX domain of PLD. Furthermore, we found that this negative regulation of PLD activity by Munc-18-1 can be overcome by EGF stimulation, which thus offers a novel mechanism for PLD regulation.

Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis of PLD from Rat Brain Extract— Rat brains (3 g) were lysed by homogenization in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% cholic acid). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-PLD antibody immobilized to Protein A-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were washed four times and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Identification of Protein by Peptide Mass Fingerprinting Using Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry—After silver staining, candidate bands were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. A 1-μl aliquot of the total 30 μl of digest was used for peptide mass fingerprinting. Masses of the tryptic peptides were measured using a Bruker Reflex III mass spectrometer, as previously described (17Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Ha S.H. Yoo J.S. Du G. Frohman M.A. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J.

Trypsin autolysis products were used for internal calibration. Delayed ion extraction resulted in peptide masses with a mass accuracy of better than 0.1 Da on average. Mass values were compared against the NCBI data base using Profound (31Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant PLDs from Baculovirus-transfected Sf9 Cells—His6-tagged rat PLD1 and human PLD2 were purified from detergent extracts of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells by chelating-Sepharose affinity column chromatography, as described previously (29Kim J.H.

The full-length cDNA of human PLD2 was deleted (167–206) and ligated into pcDNA 3.1 vector for transfecting into COS-7 cells.

Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). A 1.8-Kb Munc-18-1 insert was obtained by PCR and also digested into fragments containing specific domains. Domains 1, 2-1, and 3-a were digested with BamHI or EcoRI, domain 2-2 was digested with EcoRI or XhoI, and domain 3-b with BamHI or XhoI, as previously reported (32Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). These fragments were ligated into pGEX4T1 vector. The 3.0-kb murine Munc-18-1 insert was ligated into the NcoI or HindIII site of the pRSETB vector for transformation into Escherichia coli to produce His6-tagged Munc-18-1, which was purified by chelating-Sepharose affinity column chromatography using 80 mm imidazole as eluant. The 1.8-kb Munc-18-1 insert was digested and ligated into the EcoRI or HindIII sites of the cytomegalovirus vector for transfecting into COS-7 cells, thus resulting in the FLAG tagging of Munc-18-1.

Inserts of p40phox, FISH, and the SNX1-PX domain were obtained by PCR and digested into fragments containing specific domains by using EcoRI or BamHI, and XhoI or EcoRI. These fragments were then ligated into pGEX4T1 vector. E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with individual expression vectors encoding the GST fusion proteins and purified by standard methods (36Lee C. Kim S.R. Chung J.K. Frohman M.A. Kilimann M.W.

To obtain the soluble GST fusion Munc-18-1, the protein was eluted three times using 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm glutathione, 1 mm dithiothreitol as buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described previously (19Lee S.

Binding Analysis in Vitro—In vitro binding was performed in 300 μl of PLD assay buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, and 80 mm KCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% cholic acid at 4 °C for 2 h. The resulting complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of PLD assay buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% cholic acid, and once with a buffer without detergent. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting using anti-Munc-18 or anti-PLD antibody. PLD Activity Assay in Vitro—PIP2-dependent PLD activity was assayed by measuring choline release from phosphatidylcholine using dipalmitoylphosphatidyl [methyl-3H]choline with minor modifications of a previously described method (38Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out for 20 min at 37 °C in 125 μl of assay mixture containing PLD assay buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, and 80 mm KCl). Oleate-dependent PLD activity was assayed as previously described (29Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (175 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 20 μm sodium oleate, and 0.1 m KCl was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were maintained in growth medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2-controlled (5%) incubator. COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE, as described previously (19Lee S. Kim J.H. Lee C.S. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Heo K. Ihara Y. Goshima Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol.

PLD Activity Assay in Cells—PLD activity was assayed by measuring the formation of PBt (39Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5462-5470PubMed Google Scholar). The intensities of PBt spots in the presence of 1-butanol were measured, and PLD activity was obtained by subtracting the corresponding intensities of spots obtained in the absence of 1-butanol. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (14Han J.M. Kim Y. Lee J.S. Lee C.S. Lee B.D. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Mol. Biol.

Briefly, cells were lysed with PLD assay buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, and 80 mm KCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% cholic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After brief sonication, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (1 mg of protein) were then incubated with anti-PLD antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose for 6 h at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of PLD assay buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% cholic acid and once with a buffer without detergent. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting using anti-Munc-18 or anti-PLD antibody. Immunocytochemical Analysis—COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected. After stimulation with 100 nm EGF for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 min, immunocytochemical analysis was performed as described previously (14Han J.M. Kim Y. Lee J.S. Lee C.S. Lee B.D. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3976-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and then incubated in blocking buffer (1% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100). Subsequently, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with the secondary antibodies, rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were then mounted and examined under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Munc-18-1 Was Identified as a PLD-interacting Protein in Rat Brain Extract—Because the regulation of PLD might occur via direct interaction with other binding partners, the enrichment of PLD in rat brain extract led us perform a coimmunoprecipitation assay to isolate proteins that bind directly with PLD. After the precipitation with anti-PLD antibody from rat brain extract and protein analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, the coprecipitate was found to contain a PLD-binding protein with a relative molecular weight of 67,000 (Fig. 1A). A 67-kDa band in the PLD precipitate was excised from a gel for identification by peptide mass fingerprinting. A peptide mixture of the trypsin-digested p67 was eluted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Fig. 1B shows the peptide mass map of the protein. A search for these masses in a comprehensive sequence data base showed that 6 masses matched the calculated tryptic peptide masses of Munc-18-1 with an accuracy of <0.1 Da (Fig. 1C). These peptides covered 12% of the sequence of Munc-18-1. To further verify the identity of this protein, PLDs were immunoprecipitated from rat brain extract and the presence of Munc-18-1 was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Munc-18 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, Munc-18-1 was specifically precipitated by anti-PLD antibody but not by preimmune serum. Munc-18-1 Interacts Directly with PLD2—To determine whether Munc-18-1 binds directly to PLD, an in vitro binding analysis was performed with the purified proteins. Because PLD2 was precipitated more than PLD1 in the rat brain extract immunoprecipitate, we used purified PLD2 for the in vitro binding analysis. As shown in Fig. 1E, the binding of purified Munc-18-1 increased on increasing the amount of PLD2. This result suggests that the coprecipitated Munc-18-1 by PLD antibody from rat brain extract may have been because of direct interaction with PLD2. PLD1 was also found to interact with Munc-18-1 in a similar manner (data not shown). The PLD2-PX Domain C-terminal Region Contains the Munc-18-1 Interacting Site—To determine the regions of PLD2 that interact with Munc-18-1, fragments of PLD2 were generated as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). The ability of the six GST fusion proteins to bind Munc-18-1 was examined by using an in vitro binding assay with purified His6-Munc-18-1. GST-F1-(1–314) was found to bind to Munc-18-1 most strongly (Fig. 2B). To more precisely map the F1 region required for Munc-18-1 binding, GST fusion proteins of the F1 region serial deletion constructs, and of the PX, the pleckstrin homology, or the F1 region without the PX domain construct, were generated (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2C, F1-2-(1–206) interacted with Munc-18-1, but the shorter fragments showed little interaction. The PX domain (66Liscovitch M. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar–195) itself also interacted with Munc-18-1 but the pleckstrin homology domain or the F1 region, which do not contain the PX domain, had little bindings with Munc-18-1 (Fig. 2D). These results led us to conclude that the C-terminal region of the PLD2-PX domain (167–195) makes a major contribution to Munc-18-1 binding. Multiple Sites of Munc-18-1 Are Involved in the Interaction with PLD2—To determine the regions of Munc-18-1 that interact with PLD2, fragments of Munc-18-1 were generated as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3A) considering the crystal structure of Munc-18-1 (32Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, domain 1 (D1; 4–134), domain 2-2 (D2-2; 480–592), and domain 3-a (D3-a; 246–361) bound to PLD2 but not as well as whole Munc-18-1 bound to PLD2. This result suggests that multiple sites of Munc-18-1 cooperate to produce high affinity binding between Munc-18-1 and PLD2. Munc-18-1 Specifically Interacts with the PLD-PX Domain—To check whether Munc-18-1 binds to the PX domains of other proteins, we tested its interactions with the PX domains of PLD1, PLD2, p40phox, FISH, and SNX1. The sequence alignment of the PLD1-, PLD2-, p40phox-, FISH-, and SNX1-PX domains was performed using the Clustal W software (Fig. 4A). Using a GST pull-down assay, we found that Munc-18-1 does not bind to the PX domains of p40phox, FISH, or SNX1, whereas it clearly interacted with both PX domains of PLD1 and PLD2 (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that Munc-18-1 specifically interacts with the PLD-PX domain. According to the sequence alignment result, the homology between the PLD1-PX domain and the PLD2-PX domain is high (46%) and the homology between PLD-PX domains and other PX domains is relatively low (less than 20%). Especially, the homology between the C-terminal 29 amino acids of PLD-PX domains, which correspond to 167–195 of PLD2, is very high (68%), which supports that Munc-18-1 binds to the C-terminal of the PLD-PX domain. To further confirm the importance of the C-terminal of the PLD-PX domain, we constructed a PLD2 deletion mutant (Δ167–206) according to the result of Fig. 2C and tested the interaction with Munc-18-1 by in vitro binding analysis (Fig. 4C) and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, the PLD2 deletion mutant (Δ167–206) did not interact with Munc-18 either in vitro or in vivo, whereas PLD2 wild type showed a normal interaction. Taken together these results and the result from Fig. 2D strongly support that the C-terminal region (167–195) of the PLD2-PX domain is critically important for Munc-18-1 interaction. Munc-18-1 Inhibits PLD Activity—As Munc-18-1 was found to bind to the PX domain of PLD, and the N-terminal region of PLD has been reported to be important for PLD activity regulation (10Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of Munc-18-1 on PLD activity in vitro and in vivo. As shown in Fig. 5, the in vitro activity of PLD was inhibited specifically by His6-Munc-18-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration required for half-maximal inhibition was determined to be ∼5 nm in a PIP2-dependent PLD activity assay. To exclude the possibility that the inhibition might have resulted from the masking of PIP2 by Munc-18-1, we examined the effect of Munc-18-1 on PLD2 activity in an oleate-dependent activity assay. The inhibition of PLD2 activity by Munc-18-1 was found to be unchanged; ∼2 nm Munc-18-1 was required to inhibit PLD2 activity by 50% (Fig. 5). To test the effect of Munc-18-1 on in vivo PLD activity, PLD1 or PLD2 and Munc-18-1 were cotransfected into COS-7 cells and the effect of Munc-18-1 on basal PLD activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 6, the transfection of increasing amounts of Munc-18-1 DNA resulted in the inhibition of endogenous and overexpressed PLD2 a"
https://openalex.org/W2080592343,"Lysine insertion during coded protein synthesis requires lysyl-tRNALys, which is synthesized by lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS). Two unrelated forms of LysRS are known: LysRS2, which is found in eukaryotes, most bacteria, and a few archaea, and LysRS1, which is found in most archaea and a few bacteria. To compare amino acid recognition between the two forms of LysRS, the effects of l-lysine analogues on aminoacylation were investigated. Both enzymes showed stereospecificity toward the l-enantiomer of lysine and discriminated against noncognate amino acids with different R-groups (arginine, ornithine). Lysine analogues containing substitutions at other positions were generally most effective as inhibitors of LysRS2. For example, the Ki values for aminoacylation of S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine and l-lysinamide were over 180-fold lower with LysRS2 than with LysRS1. Of the other analogues tested, only γ-aminobutyric acid showed a significantly higher Ki for LysRS2 than LysRS1. These data indicate that the lysine-binding site is more open in LysRS2 than in LysRS1, in agreement with previous structural studies. The physiological significance of divergent amino acid recognition was reflected by the in vivo resistance to growth inhibition imparted by LysRS1 against S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine and LysRS2 against γ-aminobutyric acid. These differences in resistance to naturally occurring noncognate amino acids suggest the distribution of LysRS1 and LysRS2 contributes to quality control during protein synthesis. In addition, the specific inhibition of LysRS1 indicates it is a potential drug target.

In addition, the specific inhibition of LysRS1 indicates it is a potential drug target. The fidelity of coded protein synthesis is dependent on the accuracy of two processes: the matching of codons in mRNA with their corresponding anticodons in tRNA and the amino-acylation of these tRNAs with amino acids defined by the anticodon. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis is a highly specific reaction catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; LysRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetase; AEC, S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine. 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; LysRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetase; AEC, S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine. protein family, each member of which is specific for a particular amino acid and tRNA (1Ibba M.

Y.). 2002; 8: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite the remarkable precision aaRSs display in the recognition and selection of the correct amino acid and tRNA, proofreading and editing mechanisms are both required to maintain accuracy at a level consistent with faithful translation of the genetic code (3Ibba M.

Brakier-Gingras L. Translation Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 34-64Google Scholar). Elongation factor Tu, which takes aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosomal decoding site, provides an additional level of quality control by screening for incorrectly aminoacylated tRNAs (5Asahara H. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3499-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 20 aaRS proteins, as for example found in Escherichia coli (6Eriani G. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), are divided into two mutually exclusive structural groups of 10 members each termed class I and class II (7Arnez J.G. Moras D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Cusack S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that in class I synthetases, the active site contains a Rossmann dinucleotide-binding domain, whereas this fold is absent from the active site of class II enzymes, which instead contain a novel anti-parallel β-fold. One result of this difference in active site structure is that class I enzymes bind ATP in an extended conformation and class II in a bent conformation (7Arnez J.G. Moras D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The other major difference between the two aaRS classes is in their binding of tRNA and the site at which the amino acid is subsequently attached to it. With a few exceptions, class I enzymes approach the acceptor stem of tRNA from the minor groove side and acylate the 2′-hydroxyl of the terminal adenosine, whereas class II synthetases approach the major groove side and acylate the 3′-hydroxyl (9Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Cell. 2001; 104: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The assignment of an aaRS specific for a particular amino acid to one or the other structural class is almost completely conserved in all species, reflecting the antiquity of this dichotomy (10Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 591-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The only widespread exception observed to date is LysRS, which is found in both class I and class II (11Ibba M. Morgan S. Curnow A.W. Pridmore D.R. Vothknecht U.C. Gardner W. Lin W. Woese C.R. Söll D. Science. 1997; 278: 1119-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Comparative genomic analysis has established that class I LysRSs are present in most archaea, a few bacteria, but no eukaryotes (12Söll D. Becker H.D. Plateau P. Blanquet S. Ibba M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14224-14228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a result of microbial genome sequencing, over 40 class I LysRSs have now been identified. Despite their comparative rarity, class I LysRSs conform to the canonical archaeal/bacterial division of the universal phylogenetic tree (13Ambrogelly A. Korencic D. Ibba M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4594-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14O'Donoghue P. Luthey-Schulten Z. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 550-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the class I (LysRS1) and class II (LysRS2) proteins are almost never found together, with organisms generally containing one or the other but not both. The only well documented example of the co-existence of LysRS1 and LysRS2 is in the Methanosarcinaceae, where they function together to aminoacylate the specialized tRNAPyl suppressor species (15Polycarpo C. Ambrogelly A. Ruan B. Tumbula-Hansen D. Ataide S.F. Ishitani R. Yokoyama S. Nureki O. Ibba M. Söll D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Functional (16Ibba M. Losey H.C. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Bunjun S. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and structural (17Terada T. Nureki O. Ishitani R. Ambrogelly A. Ibba M. Söll D. Yokoyama S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) characterizations have shown that LysRS1 and LysRS2 are functionally equivalent but structurally unrelated. Consequently, despite their lack of sequence similarity, the class I and II LysRSs are able to recognize the same amino acid and tRNA substrates both in vitro and in vivo, providing an example of functional convergence by divergent enzymes (12Söll D. Becker H.D. Plateau P. Blanquet S. Ibba M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14224-14228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The two classes of LysRS proteins approach their RNA substrates from opposite sides but recognize the same regions of tRNALys, namely the anticodon, acceptor stem, and discriminator base (16Ibba M. Losey H.C. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Bunjun S. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Within these common recognition sites in tRNALys, the relative importance of particular nucleotides varies for the two classes of LysRS (12Söll D. Becker H.D. Plateau P. Blanquet S. Ibba M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14224-14228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results show how the unrelated forms of LysRS perform the same cellular function, in this case tRNALys recognition, using different molecular mechanisms. Variation between LysRS1 and LysRS2 has also been observed for lysine activation. LysRS2 initiates lysyl-tRNA synthesis using only lysine and ATP to generate an enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate, as do all class II and the majority of class I aaRSs, whereas the class I LysRS requires tRNALys binding prior to aminoacyl-adenylate synthesis, a feature shared by only a small sub-group of class I aaRSs (16Ibba M. Losey H.C. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Bunjun S. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Delagoutte B. Moras D. Cavarelli J.

Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 591-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of LysRS1 and LysRS2 complexed with l-lysine reveal that, whereas their active site architectures are fundamentally different, the strategies for recognition of the R-group of l-lysine (but not the remainder of the molecule) are quite similar (17Terada T. Nureki O. Ishitani R. Ambrogelly A. Ibba M. Söll D. Yokoyama S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To compare the amino acid recognition strategies of LysRS1 and LysRS2 in more detail, we have now studied the effects of l-lysine analogues on the aminoacylation reaction in vitro and in vivo. Significant differences in substrate recognition were found, providing both a rationale for the existence of two forms of LysRS and also suggesting a means of developing LysRS1 as a species-specific target for novel anti-infective agents. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Plasmid pKS-lysS (21Chen J. Brevet A. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2699-2705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the template for amplification of the E. coli lysS gene, with primers designed to generate a product flanked by NdeI and SapI sites. PCR was carried out using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the resulting product cloned into the TOPO-TA blunt end (Invitrogen). The gene was sequenced with two times coverage. Subsequently, the gene was excised and inserted into the pTYB1 vector to allow production of a LysRS2-intein fusion protein (IMPACT System, New England Biolabs). Bacillus subtilis strain 168 (encoding B. subtilis LysRS2) and its derivative 157.1 (encoding Borrelia burgdorferi LysRS1 but not B. subtilis LysRS2) have been described previously (22Jester B. Levengood J. Roy H. Ibba M. Devine K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14351-14356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were routinely grown aerobically in LB medium or in Spizizen's minimal medium at 37 °C (23Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1990Google Scholar). Substrates—All lysine analogues and other amino acids were from Sigma except for l-lysine methyl ester and l-lysine ethyl ester (ICN Biomedical), dl-5-hydroxylysine (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and 5′-O-[N-(l-lysyl)-sulfamoyl] adenosine (RNA-TEC, Leuven, Belgium). All substrates tested as inhibitors of aminoacylation, with the exception of d-lysine, were shown by mass spectrometry (Campus Chemical Instrument Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) to lack contamination with lysine. l-[U-14C]lysine and l-[U-3H]lysine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Transcripts corresponding to B. burgdorferi tRNALys1 were prepared as described previously (16Ibba M. Losey H.C. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Bunjun S. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) Lysyl-tRNA Synthetase Purification—The E. coli lysS encoded LysRS2 cloned into the pTYB1 vector was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Transformants were grown at room temperature in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to cell density A600 = 0.6. Expression of lysS was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 16 h at room temperature. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol). The cells were resuspended in column buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor (Hoffmann-La Roche), passed through a French pressure cell, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a chitin affinity bead column (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was eluted from the chitin affinity column in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The fractions containing LysRS2 (judged to be >99% pure by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE) were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore), dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and stored at -80 °C. The concentration of LysRS2 was determined by active site titration as described previously (24Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), except that [14C]tyrosine was replaced with [14C]lysine, and reactions were performed for 10 min. Calculations were based upon half of the sites' reactivity for E. coli LysRS (25Hughes S.J. Tanner J.A. Hindley A.D. Miller A.D. Gould I.R. BMC Biochemistry.http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/3/5Date: 2003Google Scholar). B. burgdorferi LysRS1 was prepared as described previously (16Ibba M. Losey H.C. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Bunjun S. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation Assays—Aminoacylation was performed at 37 °C in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 5 μm tRNA tRNALys, 100 nm (LysRS1) or 10 nm (LysRS2) enzyme and [14C]l-Lys at concentrations varying between 0.2 and 5 times the Km. 10 (LysRS2)- or 20-μl (LysRS1) aliquots were taken every 15-30 s and spotted onto Whatman No. 3MM filter disks presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) containing 0.5% (w/v) 12C-l-Lys. Sample disks were washed three times for 10 min at room temperature in 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) containing 0.5% (w/v) 12C-l-Lys, dried at 80 °C, and the level of [14C]l-Lys-tRNA quantified by the addition of liquid scintillant (Ultima Gold, Packard Corp.) and scintillation counting. Analogues were added as indicated during determination of Ki values and [14C]l-Lys adjusted so that concentrations varied between 0.2 and 5 times the apparent Km. The direct attachment of analogues to in vitro transcribed tRNALys1 was monitored as described earlier (26Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Transcript tRNALys from B. burgdorferi and pure tRNALys from E. coli were radiolabeled by an [α-32P]ATP-PPi exchange reaction catalyzed by the E. coli tRNA-terminal nucleotidyltransferase (27Seth M. Thurlow D.L. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4521-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The aminoacylation reaction was performed in the presence of 0.1 μm B. burgdorferi LysRS1 or 10 nm E. coli LysRS2, 10 mm of lysine or analogues, 2 μm radiolabeled transcript from B. burgdorferi, or a trace of pure 3′-radiolabeled tRNALys from E. coli with 1.3 mg/ml of total tRNA. Following 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, an aliquot was removed and treated with RNase P1. The liberated [α-32P]AMP and aminoacyl-[α-32P]AMP were separated by TLC and visualized as described previously (26Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The levels of tRNA charging are uniformly low (∼10%) as a result of significant loss of activity during the labeling and purification of both E. coli and B. burgdorferi tRNALys (both tRNAs are 80-90% active initially). This problem is, to date, unique to tRNALys as both tRNAPhe 2M. Ibba and H. Roy, unpublished results. and tRNAAla (26Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ki Determination—To determine Ki values for lysine analogues, at least five different concentrations of analogues were first screened in the aminoacylation reaction under standard conditions with 10 or 4.5 μm of [14C]l-Lys for LysRS1 and LysRS2, respectively. Analogue concentrations were then established, at which the initial rate of aminoacylation was decreased by 20-50% when compared with the reaction lacking analogue, and these levels were used for Ki determinations. Concentrations of analogues used to determine the Ki for LysRS1 and LysRS2 were, respectively: 150 or 100 μml-lysine hydroxamate; 650 or 25 μm S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine (AEC); 650 or 50 μml-lysinamide; 400 or 250 μml-lysine methyl ester; 250 or 100 μml-lysine ethyl ester; 650 μm or 1 mmdl-5-hydroxylysine; 2.5 or 5 mml-ornithine; 4 or 40 mmd-lysine; 200 or 500 μml-cadaverine; 20 or 25 nm lysyl-sulfamoyl adenosine; 8 or 40 mml-α-aminobutyric acid; 2 or 200 mml-γ-aminobutyric acid; 2.5 or 30 mml-arginine; 10 or 50 mml-glutamic acid. In all cases, stock solutions of inhibitors were maintained at neutral pH. The Ki values presented represent the average of at least two independent experiments for LysRS1 and three independent experiments for LysRS2 where values deviated by no more than 10% between individual determinations. In Vivo Growth Inhibition—B. subtilis strains 168 and 157.1 were grown aerobically in LB medium until A600 = 1. 1 ml of this culture was then spun down and washed and resuspended in 1 ml of Spizizen's minimal medium. 250 μl of these cells were then inoculated in 25 ml of Spizizen's minimal medium supplemented with 2 mml-lysine or 5 μm of AEC or 400 mml-γ-aminobutyric acid at 37 °C. Inhibition of LysRS1- and LysRS2-catalyzed in Vitro Aminoacylation—The aaRS-catalyzed aminoacylation of tRNA is a two-step reaction. In the first step, an amino acid is activated to form an enzyme-bound aminoacyl adenylate. The second step of the reaction involves binding of this complex by tRNA, whose 3′-end is then esterified with the aminoacyl moiety followed by release of the resulting aminoacyl-tRNA. Although LysRS1 and LysRS2 both utilize this overall reaction mechanism, they show a key difference at the first step; lysyl-adenylate synthesis by LysRS1 requires the presence of tRNA, whereas LysRS2 can perform the reaction in the absence of tRNA. Given this difference between LysRS1 and LysRS2, we chose to compare their ability to recognize lysine and lysyl-adenylate analogues by determining the kinetics of inhibition of steady-state aminoacylation. This approach, rather than measurement of the inhibition of amino acid activation, would then allow more direct comparisons to be made between the two systems. All compounds tested (Fig. 1) were found to act as competitive inhibitors of both LysRS1 and LysRS2, as judged by the observation of significant changes in Km but not kcat when comparing steady-state aminoacylation kinetic parameters with and without the addition of analogues (Table I). The most potent inhibitor of both LysRS1 and LysRS2 was the lysyladenylate analogue lysylsulfamoyl-adenosine, which inhibited both enzymes equally well (Table I). Analogues of l-lysine, rather than the adenylate derivative, were less potent inhibitors with Ki values ranging from low μm (3.9 μm for AEC with LysRS2) to low mm (12 mm for d-lysine with LysRS2). The least effective inhibitors were the noncognate amino acids, whose Ki values varied from 5 mm (l-arginine with LysRS1) to 470 mm (l-γ-aminobutyric acid with LysRS2).Table IKinetic parameters for the inhibition of steady-state aminoacylation by B. burgdorferi LysRS1 and E. coli LysRS2 (lysS encoded)AnalogueKiaKi values were determined from the following formula Km(app) = Km(real) (1 + [inhibitor]/Ki), using the Km values shown and inhibitor concentrations indicated in the text.Ki LysRS1/Ki LysRS2kcat (R)bkcat determined in the presence of inhibitor relative to kcat in the absence of inhibitor.LysRS1LysRS2LysRS1LysRS2μmμml-Lysine hydroxamate360 ± 7086 ± 741.1 ± 0.060.7 ± 0.02S-(2-Aminoethyl)-l-cysteine1140 ± 2303.9 ± 0.42901 ± 0.090.8 ± 0.02l-Lysinamide2120 ± 45017 ± 21801 ± 0.071.1 ± 0.01l-Lysine methyl ester478 ± 10074 ± 761 ± 0.070.8 ± 0.03l-Lysine ethyl ester303 ± 4555 ± 661.1 ± 0.050.8 ± 0.02dl-5-Hydroxylysine1200 ± 140500 ± 5221.2 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.02l-Ornithine8800 ± 13006300 ± 60011.1 ± 0.020.9 ± 0.02d-Lysine6900 ± 250012,000 ± 140011.1 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.04l-Cadaverine320 ± 45260 ± 2810.9 ± 0.031 ± 0.03Lysyl-sulfamoyl adenosine0.025 ± 0.0040.028 ± 0.00311 ± 0.050.9 ± 0.03l-α-Amino butyric acid21,200 ± 530014,200 ± 170011.1 ± 0.091.2 ± 0.02l-γ-Aminobutyric acid8040 ± 2200470,000 ± 51,0000.021 ± 0.071 ± 0.02l-Arginine5060 ± 86064,000 ± 50000.081.1 ± 0.040.9 ± 0.03l-Glutamic acid37,000 ± 7800130,000 ± 13,0000.30.9 ± 0.061.2 ± 0.03KmkcatLysRS1LysRS2LysRS1LysRS2μms−1l-Lysine34 ± 32.6 ± 0.20.06 ± 0.0021.84 ± 0.02a Ki values were determined from the following formula Km(app) = Km(real) (1 + [inhibitor]/Ki), using the Km values shown and inhibitor concentrations indicated in the text.b kcat determined in the presence of inhibitor relative to kcat in the absence of inhibitor.

For other compounds tested, either kinetic parameters were only determined previously in the amino acid activation reaction (5-hydroxylysine, lysine hydroxamate (32Takita T. Ohkubo Y. Shima H.

(Tokyo). 1996; 119: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) or no other data are, to the best of our knowledge, currently available. For LysRS1, although we recently reported (in Ref. 22Jester B. Levengood J. Roy H. Ibba M. Devine K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14351-14356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and accompanying inhibition plots) that AEC acts a competitive inhibitor with a nearly identical Ki to that described here, no other kinetic parameters for the inhibition of aminoacylation have been reported for comparison. Growth Inhibition by Lysine Analogues—Comparison of the kinetics of inhibition of in vitro aminoacylation by LysRS1 and LysRS2 indicated that several compounds preferentially inhibit one form of LysRS rather than the other. Lysine analogues with the strongest preferences were lysinamide and AEC, which showed 180- and 290-fold, respectively, lower Ki values for LysRS2 than LysRS1, and γ-aminobutyric acid, which had a 60-fold lower Ki for LysRS1 than LysRS2 (Table I). To investigate whether these in vitro differences could be correlated with specific in vivo growth phenotypes, two related strains of B. subtilis were employed. 168 is a wild-type strain that employs LysRS2 for lysyl-tRNA synthesis, and 157.1 is a derivative of 168, where the endogenous LysRS2-encoding gene has been replaced by a gene encoding B. burgdorferi LysRS1 (22Jester B. Levengood J. Roy H. Ibba M. Devine K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14351-14356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The growth of these strains in minimal medium was monitored with and without the addition of varying concentrations of AEC, lysinamide, and γ-aminobutyric acid. Addition of lysinamide at concentrations up to 46 mm had no detectable effect on the growth rates of either strain 168 or 157.1 (data not shown). Growth in the presence of 5 μm AEC completely prevented growth of 168 but only resulted in an ∼50% reduction in the growth rate of 157.1 (Fig. 2A). Conversely, the addition of 400 mm γ-aminobutyric acid completely inhibited the growth of 157.1 but only lowered the growth rate of 168 by about 50% (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with data from in vitro steady-state kinetics, confirming the selectivity of AEC and γ-aminobutyric acid as preferential inhibitors of LysRS2 and LysRS1, respectively. Aminoacylation with Noncognate Amino Acids Using LysRS1 and LysRS2—Previous studies of E. coli LysRS2 (lysS-encoded) showed that the enzyme is able to activate, aminoacylate and edit a number of noncognate amino acids (33Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8088-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and we have shown previously (22Jester B. Levengood J. Roy H. Ibba M. Devine K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14351-14356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that AEC is a substrate for aminoacylation by LysRS1. We investigated the ability of LysRS1 and LysRS2 to aminoacylate tRNALys with a number of naturally occurring noncognate amino acids shown above to be competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Of the analogues tested, l-lysine methyl ester, l-lysine ethyl ester, AEC, and, to a lesser extent, l-ornithine were found to be substrates for aminoacylation of tRNALys by LysRS1 (Fig. 3B). LysRS2 displayed a significantly broader substrate spectrum, catalyzing aminoacylation with d-lysine, l-lysine methyl ester, l-lysine ethyl ester, l-ornithine, AEC, l-lysine hydroxamate, l-α-aminobutyric acid, and, to a lesser extent, lysinamide, arginine, and glutamate (Fig. 3A). Active Site Homology Plots—The ability of certain compounds to selectively inhibit B. burgdorferi LysRS1 or E. coli LysRS2 in vitro and B. burgdorferi LysRS1 or B. subtilis LysRS2 in vivo suggests differences between the active site architectures of the two enzymes. To estimate the degree to which this divergent substrate discrimination might be conserved, sequence alignments were constructed from 44 LysRS1 and 137 representative LysRS2 predicted protein sequences using ClustalX (34Chenna R.

https://openalex.org/W2115956104,"The human mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) is a nuclear-encoded 39-kDa protein that recognizes a mtDNA segment within the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene immediately adjacent to and downstream of the 16 S rRNA gene. Binding of mTERF to this site promotes termination of rDNA transcription. Despite the fact that mTERF binds DNA as a monomer, the presence in its sequence of three leucine-zipper motifs suggested the possibility of mTERF establishing intermolecular interactions with proteins of the same or different type. When a mitochondrial lysate from HeLa cells was submitted to gel filtration chromatography, mTERF was eluted in two peaks, as detected by immunoblotting. The first peak, which varied in proportion between 30 and 50%, appeared at the position expected from the molecular mass of the monomer (41 ± 2 kDa), and the gel filtration fractions that contained it exhibited DNA binding activity. Most interestingly, the material in this peak had a strong stimulating activity on in vitro transcription of the mitochondrial rDNA. The second peak eluted at a position corresponding to an estimated molecular mass of 111 ± 5 kDa. No mTERF DNA binding activity could be detected in the corresponding gel filtration fractions. Therefore, we propose that mTERF exists in mitochondria in two forms, an active monomer and an inactive large size complex. The estimated molecular weight of this complex and the fact that purified mTERF can be eluted from a gel filtration column as a complex of the same molecular weight strongly suggest that this inactive complex is a homotrimer of mTERF.

Transcription of the heavy (H)-strand of mitochondrial DNA involves two overlapping transcription units starting at two closely located initiation sites in the D-loop region (1Montoya J.

V., Amsterdam1992: 483-508Google Scholar). One of these transcription units produces an oligo(dT)-cellulose unbound RNA species (u4a) spanning the whole rDNA region, i.e. the genes for the two mitochondrial rRNAs, 12 S and 16 S, the tRNAPhe and the tRNAVal, and ending at the border between the 16 S rRNA and the tRNALeu(UUR) genes (4Christianson T.W. Clayton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6277-6281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The other transcription unit produces a single polycistronic oligo(dT)-cellulose bound RNA molecule (b4), encompassing almost the entire length of the H-strand. The u4a and b4 transcripts are subsequently processed to yield, respectively, the two mature rRNAs, the tRNAPhe and tRNAVal, and the H-strand encoded other tRNAs and mRNAs. The rRNA genes are expressed at a 20-50-fold higher rate relative to the downstream genes (5Gelfand R. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Attardi G. Chomyn A. King M.P. Kruse B. Polosa P.L. Murdter N.N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This differential expression is regulated not only at the level of transcription initiation, but also at the level of termination at the 3′-end of the rDNA transcription unit. A central role in the attenuation phenomenon taking place at this site is played by the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF), 1The abbreviations used are: mTERF, mitochondrial transcription termination factor; HMW, high molecular weight; LMW, low molecular weight. a 39-kDa DNA-binding protein that binds to a 28-base pair region (nucleotides 3229 to 3256) within the tRNALeu(UUR) gene, at a position immediately adjacent to the 16 S rRNA gene. This protein promotes transcription termination at the 3′-end of the 16 S rRNA gene, as shown by an in vitro transcription assay (7Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 8Daga A. Micol V. Hesse D. Aebersold R. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8123-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of mTERF shows some relevant features, namely, three putative leucine-zipper motifs and two basic potential DNA-binding domains. Both types of motifs are essential for binding of mTERF to its DNA target sequence, and, consequently, for promoting transcription termination (9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Despite leucine zippers being typical protein-protein interaction motifs, it has been clearly demonstrated that mTERF binds DNA as a monomer (9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that mTERF acquires DNA binding activity by means of intramolecular leucine-zipper interactions, required to bring the two basic DNA-binding domains together (9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have explored the possibility that mTERF interacts with other proteins of the same or different type when not bound to DNA, and we have found that mTERF exists in HeLa cell mitochondrial lysates in two forms. One is a monomeric form, exhibiting DNA binding and transcription-termination activities, as expected from previous results (9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the other is a novel high molecular weight complex lacking DNA binding activity. The evidence obtained has strongly suggested that the novel complex form of mTERF is a homotrimer. We, therefore, propose that the activity of mTERF is modulated by the transition between an active monomer and an inactive trimer. Preparation of Polyclonal Anti-mTERF Antibody—His-tagged mTERF expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel column chromatography, followed by SDS-PAGE, and electroelution from the mTERF-containing excised band was used for the immunization of a rabbit as described in Ref. 10Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar. The first immunization was carried out by subcutaneous injection of 400 μg of pure His-tagged mTERF dissolved in 0.6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS mixed with 1 volume of Complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). Subsequent immunizations were carried out by subcutaneous injection of 200 μg of pure His-tagged mTERF dissolved in 0.6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS mixed with 1 volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) 3, 7, and 11 weeks after the first immunization. 10-30-ml blood samples were taken prior to each immunization and at week 15, and the animal was exanguinated by cardiac puncture at week 20. The sera obtained were tested for the presence of anti-mTERF antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (10Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antibodies were already detectable 3 weeks after the first inoculation and reached a plateau at week 15. Purification of mTERF from HeLa Cells—mTERF was purified from the S-100 fraction of a HeLa cell mitochondrial Tween 20 lysate (prepared from six 3-liter balloons of HeLa cell suspension cultures grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum to late exponential phase at 37 °C) by heparin chromatography followed by DNA-affinity chromatography (using a DNA affinity resin prepared by ligation of multiple units of a 44-mer double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide carrying the binding site of mTERF (7Kruse B.

Micol V. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 158-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with two minor modifications: (a) the sample was diluted with buffer A without KCl (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm pepstatin A, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20) instead of being dialyzed with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, prior to heparin chromatography, and (b) the final elution from the DNA affinity column was carried out with a step gradient of buffer B (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm pepstatin A, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 0.35, 0.5, 0.8, and 1 m KCl. Gel Filtration Chromatography of S-100 Fraction from a Mitochondrial Lysate—Gel filtration chromatography of the S-100 fraction from a HeLa cell mitochondrial lysate was carried out on a FPLC system (Pharmacia) in the cold room. The column used was a HiPrep® Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia). For each run, the column was equilibrated in running buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 150 or 500 mm KCl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A calibration curve was prepared, following the instructions of the manufacturer of the column, by running blue dextran 2000, cytochrome c (12 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa), all from Amersham Biosciences. The elution of these markers was monitored by UV photometry (280 nm) with the full scale set to 0.05 absorbance units, and the elution volume was measured from the start of the sample application to the apex of the elution peak. The logarithm of molecular weight was plotted against Kav that was calculated for each protein as follows: Kav = Ve - Vo/Vt - Vo, where Ve = elution volume for the protein; Vo = column void volume = elution volume of blue dextran 2000; Vt = total bed volume (120 ml for HiPrep® Sephacryl S-200). Prior to the injection of a sample, a set of three markers (cytochrome c, ovalbumin, and catalase) was injected to test the performance of the column. When the Kav of the markers was consistent with the calibration curve, 1.5-2 ml of S-100 were loaded into the column, and the eluate was collected in 1-ml fractions, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Analysis of the fractions by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using anti-mTERF antiserum as primary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase-linked (Promega) as secondary antibody, and SuperSignal® West Pico (Pierce) as chemiluminescent substrate, allowed the determination of the elution volume of mTERF by autoradiography and quantification of the autoradiogram by densitometry, and the calculation of the Kav of the mTERF as described above. Its molecular weight was finally estimated by interpolation of its Kav in the calibration curve. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Native PAGE of the eluates from the gel-filtration chromatography was run from anode to cathode under acidic conditions, as described in Ref. 13Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 1-147Google Scholar. The gel consisted of a 3.75% acrylamide, 0.7% acetic acid-KOH stacking gel (pH 6.8) and a 8-15% acrylamide, 2% acetic acid-KOH gradient resolving gel (pH 4.3). The running buffer composition was 0.8% acetic acid, 0.35 m β-alanine (pH 4.5). The samples were mixed with 1 volume of sample buffer (3.4% acetic acid, 0.1 m KOH, pH 4.3, 20% glycerol, and 0.005% methyl green), centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × gav and loaded. The run took place at 8 °C at 20 mA until the dye front reached the resolving gel. Then the current was increased to 30 mA, and electrophoresis was continued for 5-10 h. After the run, the gel was silver stained or transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membrane for subsequent immunoblotting. The procedure for immunoblotting of the native gel was essentially identical to that used for SDS-PAGE, except for the fact that the gel was incubated in 0.1% SDS transfer buffer (0.1% SDS, 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris base, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol, pH ∼8.3) for 30 min prior to transfer. In Vitro Transcription and S1 Protection Assays—Transcription-termination experiments were performed in 50× concentrated gel filtration fractions essentially as described previously for S-100 from mitochondrial lysates (8Daga A.

Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and Fig. 1a) as DNA template. S1 protection assays were carried out on the RNA products of the transcription reaction using, as a specific probe, the unlabeled RNA synthesized utilizing BamHI-linearized pBSVM plasmid (containing the MaeI-MaeI fragment of pTER (Fig. 1a)) and T3 RNA polymerase, as described (8Daga A.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 158-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A scheme of the assay is shown in Fig. 1b. Band-shift Assays—Mobility shift assays were carried out using as a probe a 5′-end 32P-labeled version of the same double stranded 44-mer oligodeoxynucleotide used in the DNA affinity purification (7Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A standard band-shift assay reaction mixture contained 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC), previously heated at 90 °C for 5 min, 20 fmol of 5′-end 32P-labeled probe, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs), a variable volume of sample, and buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20) to a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, placed on ice, and immediately loaded and run in a native 10% polyacrylamide gel in the cold room as described (11Fernandez-Silva P. Micol V. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 158-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the run, the gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. In some experiments, especially those involving a subsequent immunoblotting of the shifted bands, the reaction mixture was upscaled to 100 μl. Supershift experiments were carried out as described above, except that 1 μl of anti-mTERF antiserum was included in the reaction mixture. A control in which 1 μl of preimmune serum was added was run in parallel. Gel Filtration Chromatography of the Mitochondrial S-100 Reveals Two Forms of mTERF—The S-100 fraction of a mitochondria lysate is known to contain mTERF, and it has been used in the past as the primary source for the purification of mTERF from HeLa cells (7Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments aimed at identifying high molecular weight (HMW) forms of mTERF involved a sedimentation of the mitochondrial S-100 from HeLa cells through a 15-35% linear glycerol gradient (14Puranam R.S. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), using bovine liver catalase as a sedimentation marker and SDS-PAGE followed by Western blots with anti-mTERF antiserum to detect the presence of mTERF. These experiments indicated the presence of a form of mTERF having a higher sedimentation constant than that of the monomeric form. For further analysis of this potential HMW form of mTERF, the S-100 fraction from HeLa cells was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography using a HiPrep® Sephacryl S-200 column. The presence of mTERF in the chromatography fractions was revealed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using anti-mTERF antiserum. Because mTERF is known to be stable and dissociated from DNA at high salt concentration, gel filtration chromatography was first carried out with a running buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. As shown in Fig. 2, a and b, mTERF was eluted in two peaks, the first encompassing ∼⅔ and the second ∼⅓ of the antibody-reactive material. Gel filtration chromatography of the same mitochondrial S-100 preparation carried out in 0.15 m KCl yielded identical results (data not shown). In contrast, in chromatographic runs of different mitochondrial S-100 preparations a certain variability in the proportion of the two peaks was observed (see below). To estimate the molecular weight of each form, their Kav values were calculated and interpolated on a calibration curve previously performed on the same column, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molecular mass values obtained for the mTERF present in the two peaks were 41 ± 2 and 111 ± 5 kDa (expressed as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments). The estimated molecular weight of the lighter form (LMW) closely matched that of mature mTERF (39,000), but the other peak at 111,000 indicated that mTERF coexists in the mitochondrial lysate as part of a HMW complex. When pooled gel filtration fractions of each mTERF form were submitted to native-PAGE electrophoresis from anode to cathode under acidic conditions, as specified under “Experimental Procedures,” and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-mTERF antibody, a clear difference in migration was observed between the two forms (Fig. 2c). The HMW pool showed a single band, whereas the LMW pool showed two bands, a less intense one migrating exactly as the HMW form, and a second one migrating clearly behind it. The presence of the faster migrating band in the LMW pool is most probably because of a contamination with the HMW form, whereas the slower migrating band is the actual LMW form. The unexpected relative migration of the two mTERF forms by native PAGE electrophoresis is commented upon under “Discussion.” The relative intensity of the HMW and LMW bands is consistent with the relative amount of both forms observed by gel filtration chromatography (compare Fig. 2, c with a). Transcription-termination Activity Assay of Gel Filtration Fractions—The transcription-termination activity of the two forms of mTERF was next determined. For this purpose, the gel filtration fractions of the two mTERF-containing eluate peaks, that in this experiment were of approximately equal size, were divided into 9 pools, concentrated 50-fold, and tested in an in vitro transcription system, followed by an S1 protection assay. As seen in Fig. 3, the monomeric form of mTERF exhibited transcription-termination activity, as expected (9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By contrast, the transcription-termination assay did not provide any information about the activity of the HMW form, because in vitro transcription was almost completely inhibited in the pooled fractions containing this form. Analysis of the run-off transcripts from fractions containing the monomeric form showed that the rate of L-strand transcription remained at the same level as that shown in the control sample (in which no gel filtration eluate was added to the in vitro transcription mixture), whereas the rate of H-strand transcription dramatically increased (Fig. 3). These results suggested that the monomeric form of mTERF may enhance H-strand transcription from the IHR initiation site, in agreement with previous observations (7Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Only the Monomeric Form of mTERF Has DNA Binding Activity—Because the termination activity assays of the HMW form of mTERF revealed complete absence of transcription in the presence of this form, the DNA binding activity of both mTERF forms was investigated. A band-shift assay using a double-stranded 44-mer oligodeoxynucleotide probe containing the mTERF DNA-binding site (7Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), carried out on fractions from another gel filtration chromatography experiment (which again yielded two peaks of mTERF-containing eluate of approximately equal size), resulted in a series of shifted bands (Fig. 4a). Only two of these (indicated by arrows) were present in fractions that contained mTERF. Fractions containing the HMW form exhibited almost exclusively the upper one of the two bands, whereas fractions containing the monomeric form exhibited both bands. As this observation suggested the possibility that both forms of mTERF had specific DNA binding activity, the analysis was refined by a supershift assay carried out on a fraction (number 27) containing both bands (Fig. 4b). The lower one of the two bands almost disappeared when the anti-mTERF antiserum was present in the reaction mixture, being replaced by a slower moving band, whereas the upper band was unaffected. In agreement with this finding, excision of the two shifted bands from another gel fraction (number 26) and analysis by Western blotting of the eluted proteins showed that mTERF was indeed in the lower band, but not in the upper one (Fig. 4c). To confirm the previous observation, after a gel filtration chromatography, pooled fractions containing either the monomeric or the HMW form of mTERF were submitted to heparin chromatography, followed by Western blotting analysis of the flow-through and eluted fractions (Fig. 4d). Heparin binds DNA-binding proteins non-specifically, and is a commonly used first step in the purification of DNA-binding proteins (15Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The monomeric form of mTERF showed the typical behavior of a DNA-binding protein. Although a small proportion was present in the flow-through (most probably because of saturation of the resin, or to the presence of a small amount of HMW-mTERF in the LMW pool), most of the mTERF started to be eluted from the column at 0.5 m KCl. In contrast, when the HMW mTERF-containing pooled fractions were loaded onto the heparin column, all the mTERF was present in the flow-through, and none was detected in the eluates. From the band-shift and supershift assays and from the Western blotting and heparin chromatography experiments, we conclude that only the monomeric form of mTERF has DNA binding activity, and that the protein(s) responsible for the upper one of the doublet of shifted bands in Fig. 4a is unrelated to mTERF. Pure mTERF Is Eluted as a HMW Form from the Gel Filtration Column—mTERF from HeLa cells can be purified to a high degree by heparin chromatography followed by DNA-affinity chromatography (7Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5a, only a pair of low molecular mass contaminants co-purify with the two “34-kDa” mTERF bands (8Daga A. Micol V. Hesse D. Aebersold R. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8123-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) under these conditions. When the 0.8 m KCl eluate from the DNA affinity column was submitted to gel filtration chromatography, mTERF was eluted completely as the previously identified HMW form, whereas the contaminating bands were eluted in the first fractions, totally separated from mTERF. The observation that pure mTERF was eluted completely from a gel filtration column as the HMW form without trace of the monomer form was unexpected, because the DNA affinity chromatography following heparin chromatography was the previously used approach to purify active mTERF. This question is discussed below. mTERF is known to bind to DNA as a monomer (9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that intramolecular interactions between the leucine-zipper motifs were required to bring the two basic domains in close register with the mTERF target DNA sequence. This is in contrast with most leucine-zipper proteins, which use their leucine-zipper domains to interact with other proteins. Many of them, like C/EBP, GCN4, c-Fos, and c-Jun are transcription factors like mTERF, and the formation of homo- or heteropolymers regulates their DNA binding activity (16Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Hurst H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 105-168Google Scholar). It was in this context that we decided to explore whether mTERF can form homopolymeric or heteropolymeric complexes with possible regulatory roles. In the present work, no difference was observed in the separation by gel filtration chromatography of the monomeric form of mTERF and of a complex roughly three times bigger than the monomer, or in their proportion, when high (0.5 m) or low (0.15 m) concentrations of KCl were used during the chromatography. The stability of the HMW form of mTERF at high ionic strength may be indicative of the fact that electrostatic interactions are not essential for the formation of such a structure. In fact, the interaction between leucine-zipper domains is basically maintained by the interaction of the hydrophobic residues at positions a and d of the heptad repeats (the residues of the heptad being designated as a-g (17Hurst H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 105-168Google Scholar, 18Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar)), and the stabilizing role of the electrostatic interactions between residues in positions e and g described in some cases is far from being general (19Lovejoy B. Choe S. Cascio D. McRorie D.W. DeGrado W.F. Eisenberg D. Science. 1993; 259: 1288-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Skolnick J. Holtzer A. Macromolecules. 1985; 18: 1549Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This interpretation is in accordance with the paucity of charged residues in the leucine-zipper domains of mTERF (6 polar residues of 15 at position e, and only 2 of 15 at position g) (9Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription experiments clearly showed the expected transcription-termination activity associated with the monomeric form. Surprisingly, however, transcription of both strands was inhibited in the fractions containing the HMW form. Further work is needed to identify the factor(s) causing this effect. It cannot be ruled out that mTERF itself, in its trimeric form, is responsible for the inhibition of transcription initiation. However, transcription experiments carried out with the DNA affinity purified mTERF (which behaved like a trimer in gel filtration chromatography) showed no effect on transcription initiation. Other proteins present in the gel filtration fractions might be responsible for the effect on initiation of transcription. Another surprising result of the in vitro transcription experiments was that the termination activity observed in the fractions containing the monomer was accompanied by a strikingly increased rate of H-strand transcription from the rDNA initiation site (IHR).

We previously reported that the introduced regulatory region of the γ subunit of chloroplast F1-ATPase can modulate rotation of the γ subunit of the thermophilic bacterial F1-ATPase (Bald, D., Noji, H., Yoshida, M., Hirono-Hara, Y., and Hisabori, T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39505–39507). The attenuated enzyme activity of this chimeric enzyme under oxidizing conditions was characterized by frequent and long pauses of rotation of γ. In this study, we report an inverse regulation of the γ subunit rotation in the newly engineered F1-chimeric complex whose three negatively charged residues Glu210-Asp211-Glu212 adjacent to two cysteine residues of the regulatory region derived from chloroplast F1-ATPase γ were deleted. ATP hydrolysis activity of the mutant complex was stimulated up to 2-fold by the formation of the disulfide bond at the regulatory region by oxidation. We successfully observed inverse redox switching of rotation of γ using this mutant complex. The complex exhibited long and frequent pauses in its γ rotation when reduced, but the rotation rates between pauses remained unaltered. Hence, the suppression or activation of the redox-sensitive F1-ATPase can be explained in terms of the change in the rotation behavior at a single molecule level. These results obtained by the single molecule analysis of the redox regulation provide further insights into the regulation mechanism of the rotary enzyme. In F1-ATPase, the rotation of the central axis subunit γ relative to the surrounding α3β3 subunits is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. We previously reported that the introduced regulatory region of the γ subunit of chloroplast F1-ATPase can modulate rotation of the γ subunit of the thermophilic bacterial F1-ATPase (Bald, D., Noji, H., Yoshida, M., Hirono-Hara, Y., and Hisabori, T.

F0F1-ATP synthase, which resides in the bacterial plasma membranes, mitochondrial inner membranes, and chloroplast thylakoid membranes, synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using a proton gradient across the membranes as an energy source (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of two parts, a membrane-intrinsic F0 part responsible for proton translocation and a membrane-extrinsic F1 part, in which ATP is hydrolyzed or synthesized. The F1 part consists of α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1 subunits (4Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. Ui N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9525-9533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the whole structure is very similar in all F1. As the isolated F1 part catalyzes ATP hydrolysis, it is called F1-ATPase. The α3β3γ subcomplex from F1 is the minimum core complex that maintains the feature of F1 as ATPase (5Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the major part of bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase determined by the x-ray crystal analysis revealed an alternating hexagonal arrangement of three α and three β subunits around the γ subunit, which is located in the central cavity (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). This remarkable finding strongly supported the idea of rotation of the γ subunit relative to the α3β3 hexagon, which had been first proposed by P. D. Boyer from the analysis of catalytic site cooperativity (7Gresser M.J. Myers J.A. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12030-12038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1997, the actual rotation of the γ subunit coupled with ATP hydrolysis was directly visualized under an optical microscope by attaching a fluorescent-labeled actin filament to the γ subunit of the α3β3γ subcomplex (8Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). Thereafter, rotation of the γ subunit was shown in Escherichia coli F1 (9Noji H.

Pohl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the enzymatic activity of chloroplast ATP synthase from higher plants and green algae is highly regulated by several ways, such as activation by a proton gradient across the membranes (13Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), deactivation by a 14-3-3 protein (14Bunney T.D. van Walraven H.S. de Boer A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4249-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and activation by reduction of a disulfide bond on the γ subunit (15Mills J.D. Mitchell P. Schürmann P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 173-177Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Especially, the redox dependent regulation of the enzyme activity is only observed on the chloroplast F1 (CF1). ATPase activity of the isolated CF1 is enhanced when the disulfide bond is cleaved by reduction. In vivo, this reduction is achieved by thioredoxin, which is a major reductant protein in chloroplasts, and is reduced by electrons supplied from the photosystem (17Jacquot J.P. Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The structural basis for this redox regulation is assigned to the special portion of the γ subunit, which consists of 37 amino acid residues (Pro194-Ile230 in the case of spinach CF1) including two cysteine residues (Cys199 and Cys205 in spinach) (18Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This portion resides only in the γ subunit of the redox-sensitive ATP synthase. In case of cyanobacteria, 9 amino acids including 2 critical cysteines are missing in the region and the enzyme is redox-insensitive. Introduction of these 9 amino acid residues from spinach CF1-γ into the cyanobacterial F1-γ caused thiol modulation of the enzyme (19Werner-Grüne S. Gunkel D. Schumann J. Strotmann H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Krenn B.E. Strotmann H. Van Walraven H.S. Scholts M.J. Kraayenhof R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of these two cysteines with serine in the γ subunit of CF0CF1 from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii abolished the redox sensitivity (21Ross S.A. Zhang M.X. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9813-9818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, many enzyme activities are regulated by thioredoxin (17Jacquot J.P. Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 23Balmer Y. Koller A. del Val G. Manieri W. Schürmann P. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although physiological significance of the redox regulation of these enzymes is still ambiguous, thioredoxin may play an important role to switch on a certain set of enzymes involved in the alternation of metabolisms in chloroplasts dependent on light and dark conditions. However, not very much is known regarding the molecular mechanism of redox regulation of the chloroplast enzymes so far. Because of the lack of the three-dimensional structure information of the regulatory region of CF1-γ, we still cannot determine the molecular mechanism of the regulation of CF1. In our previous study, we had introduced the regulatory region of the γ subunit of redox-sensitive CF1-ATPase into the γ subunit of thermophilic bacterial F1-ATPase and obtained the redox-sensitive chimeric complex (24Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This complex was designated α3β3γTCT complex. We then observed the real-time rotation behavior of this chimeric complex at a single molecule level (25Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We succeeded in observing the regulation of rotation of the γ subunit of this chimeric complex by changing redox conditions under the microscope and revealed that the suppressed enzyme activity of the oxidized form complex was characterized by more frequent prolonged pauses during rotation of γ. Recently, a unique resting position of γ in the molecule of the oxidized form CF0CF1 was proposed by electron microscopic analysis of the enzyme prepared from spinach leaves (26Mellwig C. Bottcher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18544-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whether this apparent resting position has a relation with the prolonged pause of the rotation of γ is not known yet. To understand the redox regulation of F1 thoroughly, we attempted the intimate analysis of the regulated rotation of γ. For the purpose, we compared the rotation behavior of two chimeric enzyme complex: the original chimeric complex containing the regulatory region of CF1-γ, which was designated TCT complex in this article, and the mutant chimeric complex whose three negatively charged residues at the regulatory region of CF1-γ were deleted. The latter complex was designated ΔEDE complex here. We had already reported that this deletion of three negatively charged residues (Glu210-Asp211-Glu212) adjacent to the two cysteine residues caused inverse regulation of the enzyme activity in the chimeric complex, which was reconstituted from the α and β subunits of bacterial F1-ATPase and the γ subunit of spinach CF1 (27Konno H. Yodogawa M. Stumpp M.T. Kroth P. Strotmann H. Motohashi K. Amano T. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using this mutant complex containing the ΔEDE mutation, we successfully observed an inverse redox regulation of the rotation behavior of the mutant γ subunit. A comparison of rotation behavior of TCT complex and that of ΔEDE complex provides us the information on the authentic properties of redox regulation without undesirable effects of the reducing and oxidizing reagents for the observation setup for rotation. Materials—Biotin-PEAC5-maleimide was purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Carboxylated polystyrene beads were from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Preparation of the Chimeric Complex—The original α3β3γ chimeric complex designated TCT was generated by the substitution of the central region of γ from thermophilic bacterial F1 with the counterpart of spinach chloroplast F1-γ as described previously (24Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For an efficient biotin labeling, additional two cysteine residues were introduced into the position of Leu109 and Ile249 (the number is for the engineered γ subunit of the TCT-chimeric complex). In addition, we newly constructed the mutant complex (ΔEDE complex) by deletion of three negatively charged residues Glu210-Asp211-Glu212 in the regulatory region of the γ subunit in the TCT complex. Mutation was accomplished by a quick-change method using appropriate primers (28Kirsch R.D. Joly E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Both the TCT and ΔEDE complexes were successfully expressed in E. coli strain JM103 ΔuncB-D, and the proteins were prepared as described previously (25Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The chimeric complex was purified from the E. coli cell extract using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) and then applied to gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (16/30, Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with 100 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The purified proteins were labeled with a 2-fold excess molar ratio of Biotin-PEAC5-maleimide for 1 h at room temperature, and then the excess reagents were removed by gel filtration on a NAP5 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with 10 mm MOPS-KOH and 50 mm KCl, pH 7.0. The TCT complex was reduced by 4 μm thioredoxin-f and 200 μm DTT prior to the following analysis as described previously (24Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ΔEDE complex did not require any pretreatments because it was spontaneously oxidized during the purification steps. The ΔEDE complex then was fully activated. Rotation Assay—To observe redox switching of rotation behavior of the γ subunit of the TCT and ΔEDE complexes at a single molecule level, we employed the reduced form chloroplast thioredoxin-f as reductant as described previously (24Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and DTNB for oxidation instead of the low concentrations of CuCl2 that we employed for our previous study (25Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The appropriate concentrations of DTNB are reported to catalyze the formation of a disulfide bond by modification of the sulfidryl residues and the following rapid disulfide bond exchange (30Bulygin V.V. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31765-31769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To monitor the rotation, the γ subunits of the TCT and ΔEDE complexes were labeled with polystyrene beads as follows. Polystyrene beads were biotinylated as described by Shimabukuro et al. (31Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). 15 μl of the biotinylated complex (100–500 nm) in an assay mixture containing 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 supplemented with 1% (w/v) BSA was infused into a flow-chamber (8Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). After incubation for 2 min at room temperature, unattached complexes to the glass surface were washed out with 50 μl of the assay mixture without BSA. 15 μl of 5 μm streptavidin dissolved in the assay mixture without BSA then was infused into the flow-chamber. After incubation for 2 min, excess streptavidin was washed out with 50 μl of the assay mixture. The biotinylated polystyrene beads suspended in the assay mixture containing 1% (w/v) BSA were infused into the flow-chamber. After incubation for 30 min, unattached beads were washed out with 100 μl of the assay mixture without BSA. Finally, rotation of the γ subunit of the complex was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of the assay mixture with 2 mm ATP. Observation of rotation of the TCT complex was first carried out in the presence of 4 μm thioredoxin-f and 200 μm DTT for 5 min. 100 μl of the assay mixture containing 250 μm DTNB then was infused to oxidize the complex, and the observation was continued for another 5 min. To observe rotation of the ΔEDE complex, the assay was first carried out without any oxidizing reagents because the enzyme was spontaneously oxidized during the purification steps as mentioned. 100 μl of the assay mixture containing 4 μm thioredoxin-f and 200 μm DTT then was infused to reduce the complex, and the observation was continued for another 5 min. Rotation of the polystyrene beads attached to the γ subunit of both chimeric complex was observed with a conventional optical microscope type IX70 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera. The observed images were recorded to a digital video recorder and were analyzed with an image analysis software (8Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—To determine the frequency and the length of the pauses during rotation of the γ subunit, we analyzed the accumulated data as follows. Rotation of the γ subunit of the complex was recorded with the rate of 30 video frames/s. We calculated a displacement of the rotation from the first video frame to the third one, and then the obtained value (revolution per two frames) was plotted. Based on this definition, the displacement value should be 1.0 when the beads show full rotation (360°) within these three frames. Consequently, we defined a behavior of the beads whose displacement was <0.2 as a pause in this study. We then calculated the frequency and the length of the pauses and the rotation rate between the pauses with the original software. For the pause analysis, we used GruGruArrest and, for the rotation rate analysis, we used GruGruMawaru, respectively. ATPase Activity—ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (32Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The assay mixture containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 mm NADH was previously incubated at 25 °C. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 5–10 μg of the purified complex into 2 ml of the reaction mixture. The activity was measured by monitoring the decrease of absorption at 340 nm, and the activity of ATP hydrolysis in the steady state was determined. Redox Regulation of Chimeric Enzymes—In this study, we compared the redox regulation of two redox-sensitive chimeric complexes. Inverse redox regulation of ATPase activity by ΔEDE mutation was first observed using the hybrid enzyme comprised of the α and β subunits of thermophilic bacterial F1 and the recombinant chloroplast γ subunit (27Konno H. Yodogawa M. Stumpp M.T. Kroth P. Strotmann H. Motohashi K. Amano T. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The obtained hybrid enzyme complex containing ΔEDE mutation showed the higher ATPase activity when the regulatory cysteines were oxidized and less active when reduced. Here we introduced this mutation into the TCT complex (Fig. 1A). The desired complex, ΔEDE complex, was expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1B). We then confirmed the formation and reduction of a disulfide bond on the regulatory region of both chimeric complexes by using AMS-labeling method (33Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) after biotin labeling the γ subunit via the two newly introduced cysteine residues (Cys109 and Cys249) to attach polystyrene beads. When the TCT and ΔEDE complexes were fully reduced by thioredoxin-f and DTT, the shifts of the protein bands corresponding to the γ subunit were observed (Fig. 1C). As expected, the ATPase activity of the ΔEDE complex under oxidizing conditions was attenuated to 34% of that under reducing conditions (Fig. 1D), whereas the activity of the TCT complex under reducing conditions was stimulated up to 1.6-fold of that of the oxidized one. The ATPase activity of the oxidized ΔEDE complex was slightly lower than that of the reduced TCT complex, and this result was somewhat different from our previous results obtained by using the hybrid enzyme complex reconstituted from TF1-α and β subunits and the CF1-γ subunit (27Konno H. Yodogawa M. Stumpp M.T. Kroth P. Strotmann H. Motohashi K. Amano T. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, from the comparison of these ATPase activities, we cannot conclude whether the oxidized form ΔEDE complex mimics the reduced form TCT complex or the oxidized form complex. Redox Regulation of Rotation—To monitor the rotation behavior of the γ subunit, we adopted the polystyrene beads instead of the fluorescent-labeled actin filaments. This allowed us to observe the rotation of γ with the conventional microscope even under oxidizing conditions as described previously (25Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We first observed the rotation behavior of the reduced form TCT complex for 5 min and then gently exchanged the buffer in the chamber to the buffer for oxidation. We then observed the behavior of the beads for another 5 min. As shown in Fig. 2A, the beads attached to the TCT complex rotated continuously with the brief pauses under reducing conditions. When oxidized, the beads stopped frequently during rotation and the long pauses emerged. These results were consistent with those of our previous study (25Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the beads attached to the ΔEDE complex rotated smoothly under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2B). After switching to reducing conditions, they stopped frequently. This way we successfully observed inverse regulation of rotation of the ΔEDE complex by switching the redox conditions. The observed redox switching of rotation behavior of the ΔEDE complex was apparently paralleled to that of the TCT complex with the exception of alternating the oxidized state with the reduced state. These results strongly suggest that the long and frequent pauses, which were observed on the rotation of the oxidized form TCT complex or that of the reduced form ΔEDE complex, should be caused by the suppressed state of each of the complexes but not by either oxidizing or reducing conditions themselves. In other words, these results exclude the possibility that oxidizing or reducing conditions induced the special interaction between, for example, beads and glass surface, which may affect the rotation behavior of the enzyme. When we observed the rotation behavior of the both complexes, we noticed that a couple of the beads showed occasional stops after the buffer exchange (Fig. 2, C and D), although the frequency of the pauses caused by this buffer exchange was less evident than that caused by the redox switching. As we found that some of the TF1 complex stopped occasionally after the buffer exchange (data not shown), we concluded that the pauses resulting from buffer exchange were not peculiar to the TCT and ΔEDE complexes. The buffer exchange might induce collision of the beads with steric obstacles on the glass surface. Frequency of the Pauses during Rotation—We next determined the length and the frequency of pauses and the rotation rates of both complexes. Because the original rotation data contained both enzyme movement and Brownian motion of the beads, we calculated the displacement of the beads image from the first video frame to the third one and plotted it (Fig. 2E). In this study, we defined a period whose displacement value was under 0.2 during a three-frame observation as a pausing period, which was shown as black bar on the upper part of Fig. 2E. Based on this definition, we calculated the length and the frequency of the pauses during the whole observation period. Even when we put the enzymes to the suppressed states, they did rotate and did not stop completely over the whole periods. These allowed us to calculate the rotation rate under all of the experimental conditions. The proportion of the pauses during the observation period was calculated for each of the complexes under reduced or oxidized conditions (Fig. 2F). Although a slight increase in the proportion of the pauses was observed only by the buffer exchange for TCT from R1 phase to R2 phase and for ΔEDE from O1 phase to O2 phase, the pause ratios were remarkably increased when the TCT complex was oxidized or when the ΔEDE complex was reduced. In case of the TCT complex, the frequency of the pause longer than 2 min certainly increased especially under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, the frequency of the long pause of the ΔEDE complex increased under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B). A great deal of interest was focused on whether the suppressed chimeric complex took a certain position for pause or not. However, we could not settle this question in this study because the pauses observed in our experiments contained a lot of short pauses, which are also observed even under the active state conditions. With regard to the position of the pause, a unique resting position of the oxidized CF0CF1 was recently suggested by electron microscope analysis of the ATPase complex prepared from spinach leaves (26Mellwig C. Bottcher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18544-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We cannot directly adopt the reported resting position to the pause position during rotation because their resting position was simply characterized by orientation of the γ subunit and position of the stator, which was formed by subunits δ, I, II, and IV. In our case, the observed pause positions must contain three different types: the pause induced by the redox regulation, the pause induced by the buffer exchange, and the pause of ADP inhibition as mentioned below. F1-ATPase occasionally falls into the ADP-inhibited state in the presence of submicromolar ATP (32Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). From the intimate analysis of the rotation of F1-ATPase, Hirono-Hara et al. (34Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) recently reported that the ADP-inhibited states cause the pauses with a lifetime of 1.7 s and the other pauses with a lifetime of 32 s at the concentration of 2 mm ATP (34Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The enzyme trapped in this inhibition state can be easily recovered, and the rotation is re-started when the assay mixture contains high concentrations of ATP. Brief pauses observed in our experiments may be attributed to the ADP-inhibited states of the enzyme as reported previously (34Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When we calculated the proportion of the pause period during our observation, we found that 30–40% of the pauses were observed under all of the experimental conditions (Fig. 2F). These basal values must be due to the ADP inhibition state. Thus, we mainly focused on the pauses longer than 2 min in this study. Rates of Rotation under the Regulated Conditions—As mentioned above, the suppression of the ATPase activity in both the TCT and ΔEDE complexes by the conformational change of the regulatory region should be mainly attributable to long and more frequent pauses. To confirm this assumption, we here analyzed the rotation rates of the beads (Table I). The rotating stage was defined as the period where the beads do not show the pauses based on the definition shown in Fig. 2E. The TCT and ΔEDE complexes showed no remarkable differences in the rotation rates under either the reduced states or the oxidized states. The buffer exchange also had no effect on the rotation rates of the TCT and ΔEDE complexes.Table IRotation rates of TCT and ΔEDE complexes Based on the definition of pause shown in Fig. 2E, a phase with the exception of the pause was regarded as rotating phase and the rotation rates for each phases were calculated. Median and mean values are shown.Redox stateRotation rateMedianAveragerevolution s-1TCTR3.173.46 ± 1.29O3.163.28 ± 1.59R13.764.09 ± 1.37R23.664.10 ± 1.59ΔEDEO3.353.66 ± 1.11R3.393.79 ± 1.31O13.533.89 ± 1.40O23.383.77 ± 1.50 Open table in a new tab These results gave us a clue to determine the mechanism of redox regulation of ATPase. Formation of the disulfide bond on the regulatory region of the γ subunit must induce a conformational change of this subunit. Because we still do not have any information on the structure of the regulatory region of CF1-γ, it is impossible to presume the resultant structure now after this conformational change. However, we can speculate that the conformational change induced by the formation or reduction of this disulfide bond on γ will induce a certain situation, which will disturb the smooth rotation of the γ subunit in the complex. From the torque calculation on the rotation of γ (8Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar), the rotation promoted by ATP hydrolysis is enough strong to break the hydrogen bonds between the γ subunit and the surrounding α and β subunits. In addition, the observed rotation rate itself is significantly decreased by the attached prove, which is huge in comparison to the size of the enzyme molecule. Therefore, the rate-limiting of rotation of the beads must be mainly determined by the size of the beads itself. From this point of view, it is conceivable that the rotation rate of the γ subunit is not affected directly by formation or reduction of the disulfide bridge on γ. Finally, we calculated the averaged rotation rates for 5 min of observation under reducing or oxidizing conditions and compared the values with those for ATPase activity (Fig. 1D and Table II). The averaged rotation rate of the oxidized TCT complex was suppressed to 43% of that of the reduced state. In contrast, the rate of the rotation of the reduced ΔEDE complex was suppressed to 57% of the rate of the oxidized state. The ATPase activity of the oxidized TCT complex was 64% of the reduced state, and that of the reduced ΔEDE complex was 34% of the oxidized state, respectively (Fig. 1D). Hence, the responses of the averaged rotation rates of both the TCT and ΔEDE complexes to the redox switching were roughly consistent with those of ATPase activity of these complexes. Therefore, we conclude that the suppressed enzyme activity of the chimeric complex under either oxidizing or reducing conditions was mainly due to long and frequent pauses during rotation, irrespective of the rotation rate between the pauses.Table IIAveraged rates of the rotation of the TCT and ΔEDE complexes The rates of rotation including pausing periods were calculated as averaged rates of rotation.

Therefore, it is very important to observe the rotation behavior of the single molecule enzyme and its regulation to understand the redox regulation of F1-ATPase at the molecular level. In this study, the ΔEDE complex was a good reference for the observation of the redox regulation of rotation by the regulatory region of chloroplast F1-ATPase. This approach made it possible to compare the pause and the rotation behavior of the single molecule F1 under suppressed and stimulated conditions rather than simple reduced and oxidized conditions. Consequently, we could reveal that the suppression of the enzyme activity by the regulatory region derived from CF1-γ should reflect the long and frequent pauses of rotation but not the change of the rotation rate itself. How the conformational change of the regulatory region can control the frequency of the pause during rotation must be clarified by the structural background in future.

The ability of these progenitor crypt cells to resist apoptosis and ensure restitution during a potentially lethal insult, but retain the ability to remove damaged or altered cells afterward, is necessary for preservation of the crypt-villus unit. We have examined the ability of cAMP to transiently inhibit apoptosis via the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), in T84 cells, an intestinal crypt-like cell line. Using the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP and cholera toxin (CT), cAMP-mediated ERK1/2 activation was first measured by Western blot analysis of the phosphorylated (activated) and total (activated and inactivated) forms of ERK1/2. Cyclic AMP activated ERK1/2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and the effect was inhibited by PD098059, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) did not alter the activation of ERK1/2. CT transiently inhibited both staurosporine and Fas antibody mediated apoptosis as measured by a caspase-3 activation assay and the detection of nucleosomes in an apoptosis based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This inhibitory effect was reversed by the simultaneous addition of PD098059. Our data suggest that in the T84 cell line, cAMP activates ERK1/2 in a PKA independent fashion and a physiological consequence of this activated pathway is the transient inhibition of apoptosis.

Intestinal crypt cells play a unique role in driving proliferation for the entire crypt-villus unit. Apoptosis is a critical process in the intestinal crypt that serves to maintain cellular homeostasis throughout the intestine. In the murine intestinal crypt, apoptosis plays a key regulatory role by the efficient removal of genetically damaged enterocytes, and by preventing the proliferation of aberrant, and possibly tumorigenic, phenotypes (1Potten C.S.

During a potentially damaging insult, exuberant crypt cell apoptosis has the potential to affect gut restitution by altering the proliferative compartment, which is responsible for replenishing damaged epithelium. Therefore, the ability to prevent apoptosis in normal enterocytes after an acute stress while conserving the ability to remove aberrant and potentially tumorigenic cells is central to the orderly maintenance of intestinal cell turnover. Many of the signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis are regulated, in part, by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; CT, cholera toxin; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; ST, enterotoxin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; STS, staurosporine; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PKA, protein kinase A; H-89, N-[2-(bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride. signaling cascades.

With regard to the regulation of apoptosis, ERK1/2 is also emerging as a pathway involved in intestinal epithelial cell survival (3Gauthier R. Laprise P. Cardin E. Harnois C. Plourde A. Reed J.C.

A key factor in the determination of ERK1/2 function is the length of time it is phosphorylated (17Stork P.J. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which is in part determined by the intracellular signals responsible for the activation of its signaling cascade. 3′-5′ cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) can activate ERK1/2, which results in either the initiation or inhibition of apoptosis depending on cell type. ERK1/2 signaling through cAMP has been documented in a variety of cell types (18Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in thyroid follicular cells (19Saavedra A.P.

Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), primary cultured hepatocytes (21Fladmark K.E. Gjertsen B.T. Doskeland S.O. Vintermyr O.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and most recently the T84 intestinal cell line (22Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the intestinal epithelium, cAMP has been implicated indirectly in murine enterocyte survival through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) activation of the EP2 receptor, which signals via cAMP (23Bastien L. Sawyer N. Grygorczyk R. Metters K.M. Adam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11873-11877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice lacking the EP2 receptor are more prone to irradiation induced intestinal apoptosis (24Houchen C.W. Sturmoski M.A. Anant S. Breyer R.M. Stenson W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G490-G498Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and show a reduction in polyp size and number when crossed with the APCΔ176 model of intestinal polyposis (25Sonoshita M.

Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), which also acts through a cAMP-mediated receptor (26Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), has been shown to reduce indomethacin-induced intestinal injury (27Boushey R.P. Yusta B. Drucker D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E937-E947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that cAMP plays a central role in the inhibition of apoptosis in multiple cell types and is implicated in intestinal cell survival. Our goal was to use cholera toxin (CT) as a tool to study the potential survival effects of cAMP and ERK1/2 in an intestinal epithelial cell line. The T84 cell line was chosen based upon the well described kinetics of cAMP-mediated chloride secretion induced by CT in this cell type (28Lencer W.I. Moe S. Rufo P.A. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the previous demonstration of cell survival mechanisms in these cells when exposed to a proapoptotic agent (22Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Abreu M.T. Arnold E.T. Chow J.Y. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47563-47574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, T84 cells share a phenotypic similarity to the undifferentiated cells of the small intestinal crypt, the primary target for the irradiation injury model of intestinal apoptosis in which the inhibition of PGE2 signaling has an effect. We hypothesized that CT/cAMP both activate ERK1/2 and inhibit apoptosis in the T84 cell line. Furthermore, we sought to identify the role of ERK1/2 in the cAMP-mediated survival effect. Cell Culture and Stimulation of cAMP—T84 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), ampicillin (8 mg/liter) and buffered with 44 mm sodium bicarbonate to a final pH of 7.2–7.4. Cells were subcultured into 48-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2, fed every other day, and incubated using the standard conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were confluent at day 8 and used 10 days after subculture. Cells were incubated with either 200 ng/ml CT (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell CA), 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP; Sigma), 100 nm heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) (gift of R. Giannella), or 30 μm H-89 (N-[2-(bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride) (Sigma) for the indicated times prior to apoptosis assays or the analysis of ERK1/2 activation. Detection of cAMP-stimulated ERK1/2 Activation—After incubation with CT, 8-Br-cAMP, and/or H-89, cells were homogenized using TNN buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml protease inhibitors) (12Ding Q. Wang Q. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm on a table top centrifuge, and the protein in the suspension was quantified using the Bradford reagent-based assay (Bio-Rad). 10 μg of protein was electrophoresed on pre-cast 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) in MES/SDS running buffer (50 mm 2-(MES, 50 mm Tris base, 3.5 mm SDS, 1 mm EDTA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) as described previously (30Rudolph J.A. Hawkins J.A. Cohen M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G695-G702Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using the Anti-ACTIVE MAPK® antibody, rabbit (Promega, Madison, WI) specific for phosphorylated/activated ERK1/2 at a 1:5000 dilution followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and visualized by enhanced chemoluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.). To assure equal loading, blots were stripped at 50 °C for 30 min in stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and probed with p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) specific for both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated (total) ERK1/2 at a 1:1000 dilution. Results were quantified using a spot densitometer and expressed as a ratio of active:total ERK1/2 integrated density values. Induction of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was induced in T84 cells using the protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (STS) (Sigma). In pilot experiments we determined that 4 μm STS added to confluent cells resulted in floating cells 4 h after exposure (data not shown). T84 cells were grown to confluence and stimulated with CT or 8-Br-cAMP. 4 μm STS was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. For experiments using the Fas ligand apoptotic pathway, cells were incubated with 500 ng/ml of the activating Fas-Ab clone CH11 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 18 h to induce apoptosis. Nucleosome Detection as a Marker for Apoptosis—After pretreatment and apoptosis induction, experimental and control wells of T84 cells were processed for the DNA Cell Death Detection ELISA (Roche Applied Science) to determine nucleosome formation, according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed, and the homogenates were spun at 4 °C for 30 min to remove large genomic DNA. Supernatant was added to ELISA plates coated with anti-histone antibody and incubated with peroxidase conjugated anti-DNA antibody. Nucleosome detection was based on a colorimetric change in substrate added to the wells after conjugation. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, blank values were subtracted, and average values for each treated well were determined. Caspase-3 Activation Assay—A second, independent assay for the determination of apoptosis was performed. Caspase-3 activation was determined using the Caspase-3 Assay kit (BD Biosciences) according to the multiwell plate protocol in the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, T84 cells were grown to confluence, and cAMP stimulation/apoptosis induction was performed as described above. Cells were washed once and lysed using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4/NaPO4, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100®, 10 mm sodium PPi) for 30 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of lysate was added to a reaction mixture containing 37.5 mm Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, a fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate, in protease assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Previous experiments using recombinant caspase-3 showed maximum fluorogenic detection after 20–30 min incubation and no diminution of signal at greater than 60 min. The fluorescence of cleaved Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was read on a SpectraMax Gemini II fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 380 λ and emission wavelength of 440 λ and SoftPro 3.01 software. All samples were analyzed in triplicate, blank values were subtracted, and average values for each treated well were determined. Statistical Analysis—For apoptosis assays, results are expressed in mean values ± S.E., and p values were determined using a two-tailed student's t test for paired samples assuming normal distribution. Single factor analysis of variance was used where appropriate. Cyclic AMP Activation of ERK1/2 in T84 Cells—To demonstrate the effect of increasing intracellular cAMP levels on ERK1/2 signaling, confluent T84 cells were incubated with CT, and ERK1/2 was detected using a phosphorylated antibody specific for ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A). Cells were harvested beginning at 15 min to account for the lag phase due to CT internalization and activation of adenylate cyclase in non-disrupted T84 cells (28Lencer W.I. Moe S. Rufo P.A. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hypertonic medium was used as a positive control. CT activated ERK1/2 in as little as 1 h, peaked at 3 h, and decreased by 6 h. Unlike CT, 8-Br-cAMP stimulates cAMP-mediated pathways in a more rapid fashion as evidenced by maximum chloride secretion in ∼15 min in T84 cells (31Forte L.R. Thorne P.K. Eber S.L. Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C607-C615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 1B), similar results were obtained, with a peak of activation at 15 min and a decrease in signal thereafter. Cyclic AMP elevation leads to chloride secretion; therefore, one possible explanation for ERK1/2 activation is that it is secondary to chloride secretion and not a direct effect. To test this hypothesis, and to determine whether there was cross-activation of a cGMP-mediated signaling pathway, cells were exposed to ST, a secretagogue that causes chloride secretion via cGMP in T84 cells (31Forte L.R. Thorne P.K. Eber S.L. Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C607-C615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). ST did not lead to ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that the activation of ERK1/2 via cAMP was not secondary to either the secretory state of the cells or cross-activation of cGMP. Specific Activation of ERK1/2 by cAMP; Dose Response and Pharmacologic Inhibition—In the previous experiments, either CT or 8-Br-cAMP (1000 μm) was used to elicit ERK1/2 activation. To determine whether this was solely a consequence of high intracellular concentrations of cAMP, a dose-response relationship was established (Fig. 2). T84 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP for 1 h, and ERK1/2 activation was determined. ERK1/2 was phosphorylated in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal effect at 500–1000 μm and an ED50 of 60 μm. These concentrations are consistent with doses of 8-Br-cAMP used to elicit chloride secretion in T84 cells (31Forte L.R. Thorne P.K. Eber S.L. Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C607-C615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in other cell systems (32Wallace D.P. Rome L.A. Sullivan L.P. Grantham J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1019-F1029PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively high ED50 is likely due to the relatively low lipophilicity of this cAMP nucleotide analog leading to a permeability only slightly higher than cAMP (33Schwede F. Maronde E. Genieser H. Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To determine whether cAMP acts directly upon ERK1/2 or activates the ERK1/2 signaling cascade, the MEK inhibitor PD098059, was co-incubated with 8-Br-cAMP. 20 μm PD098059 completely blocked ERK1/2 activation when 50 μm of 8-Br-cAMP was used and significantly blocked ERK1/2 when 1000 μm 8-Br-cAMP was applied. This suggests that cAMP acts upon the ERK1/2 signaling cascade, prior to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Cyclic AMP Activation of ERK1/2 Is Independent of PKA Activation—In many non-intestinal cell lines, cAMP-mediated ERK1/2 activation occurs via the cAMP-binding protein, protein kinase A (PKA) (18Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 34Cancedda L. Putignano E. Impey S. Maffei L. Ratto G.M. Pizzorusso T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7012-7020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of PKA in cAMP-mediated activation of ERK1/2 in T84 cells was determined using a pharmacological inhibitor of PKA, H-89. PKA activity was first measured in T84 cells using a commercial based assay (Promega) that utilizes the phosphorylation of Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), a synthetic substrate specific for PKA. Addition of increasing doses of H-89 2 h prior to cell harvest showed a dose-dependent effect (data not shown). Incubation of T84 cells with 30 μm H-89 for 2 h suppressed PKA activity by 86% when compared with cells treated with media alone (Fig. 3A). 30 μm H-89 was then added to confluent T84 cells 2 h prior to the addition of 1000 μm 8-Br-cAMP. After 1-h further incubation, cell homogenates were immunostained for both phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2. A representative blot is shown in Fig. 3B. The addition of 30 μm H-89, a dose sufficient to markedly inhibit PKA activity, did not block 8-Br-cAMP mediated ERK1/2 signaling. This data suggest that the cAMP-mediated activation of ERK1/2 is not dependent upon PKA. Cyclic AMP Activation of ERK1/2 Is Dependent upon Confluence—The regulation of MAPKs, such as ERK1/2, is both specific to cell type and dependent upon cellular context, such as the degree of differentiation, the cell cycle state, and/or the presence of cellular contacts. Although T84 cells remain poorly differentiated as they grow in culture (35Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether cAMP activation of ERK1/2 was dependent upon the degree of confluency. T84 cells were uniformly seeded onto 48-well tissue culture plates. Starting at day 1 (30% confluence) and continuing to day 8 (100% confluence), a subset of cells was exposed to media alone or 1000 μm 8-Br-cAMP for 1 h, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was analyzed (Fig. 4). Day 1 lysates showed no increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 signal with exposure to 8-Br-cAMP and less total ERK1/2 per 10 μgof total protein. By day 3, total ERK1/2 staining was similar to subsequent time points suggesting that total ERK1/2 remained at a constant level. The ability of cAMP to activate ERK1/2 increased as the cells became confluent (days 5 and 8), indicating that as T84 cells attain confluence, become more responsive to cAMP. CT Inhibition of STS-mediated Apoptosis—To study the effect of CT on apoptosis, we examined two independent assays of the apoptotic cascade: nucleosome detection and caspase-3 activation. T84 cells were grown to confluence. CT was then added alone or 3 h prior to induction of apoptosis with STS. Fig. 5A demonstrates nucleosome detection in cells treated with media alone and under experimental conditions. Pretreatment with CT tended to decrease basal levels of nucleosome detection when compared with controls, but differences were not significant (p = 0.07). Addition of STS alone resulted in a large increase in nucleosome detection and served as a positive control. When CT was added 3 h prior to the addition of STS, nucleosome detection decreased ∼20% (p = 0.001), suggesting that CT inhibited STS-mediated apoptosis. To verify the inhibitory effects of cAMP on STS-mediated apoptosis, a caspase-3 activity assay was performed (Fig. 5B). Similar to the ELISA analysis, addition of CT alone led to a small, but not significant, decrease in basal caspase-3 activity (p = 0.07). STS alone led to a large increase and served as a positive control. Addition of CT prior to STS inhibited caspase-3 activity by ∼43% (p = 0.002) confirming the anti-apoptotic effect of CT on STS-mediated apoptosis. CT Inhibition of Fas-mediated Apoptosis—To confirm that cAMP protects cells from apoptosis and that cAMP is not interacting directly with STS, Fas-Ab was used as a different proapoptotic agent. Confluent T84 cells were incubated with Fas-Ab for 18 h to induce apoptosis (29Abreu M.T. Arnold E.T. Chow J.Y. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47563-47574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To adjust for the longer induction period of Fas-mediated apoptosis, CT was added 6 h after the addition of Fas-Ab but prior to the activation of caspase-3. Fas-Ab increased both nucleosome formation (p = 0.0001) and caspase-3 activation (p = 0.0001). CT effectively inhibited Fas-Ab mediated nucleosome formation by 27% (p = 0.0001), confirming that cAMP inhibits apoptosis and that this is not limited to the STS pathway (Fig. 6A). Similar results were achieved using the caspase-3 activation assay (Fig. 6B) (p = 0.0001). The inhibition of both STS- and Fas-Ab-mediated apoptosis demonstrates that cAMP interferes with apoptosis prior to the activation of caspase-3 but after the cell is committed to the apoptotic process. CT Inhibition of STS-mediated Apoptosis Is Transient—To determine whether the length of incubation of CT played a significant role in the inhibition of apoptosis, T84 cells were preincubated with CT for varying lengths of time and nucleosome formation was measured (Fig. 7). Consistent with the lag phase of cAMP production, addition of CT at the same time as STS led to no detectable change in nucleosome formation. The inhibitory effect of CT was maximal at 1–6 h preincubation. Thereafter, the inhibitory effect decreased until no effect was seen when CT was preincubated for 24 h. Despite the transient nature of the inhibitory effect on nucleosome formation, incubation with CT produced a sustained increase in cAMP (Fig. 7, top). These results demonstrate that the effect of CT on apoptosis is transient in nature and that the timing of the inhibitory effect is coordinate with ERK1/2 activation. CT Inhibition of Apoptosis Is Reversed by Inhibition of ERK1/2—Previous studies in non-intestinal cell lines have implicated cAMP-mediated ERK1/2 activation as a survival pathway. In addition, the transient response of CT coordinate with the timing of ERK1/2 activation in T84 cells suggested that ERK1/2 was a potential survival pathway. For this reason, the role of ERK1/2 in CT inhibition of apoptosis was examined. Cells were co-incubated with CT and/or 50 μm PD098059, prior to the induction of apoptosis with STS (Fig. 8). Cells incubated with PD098059 prior to STS showed an increase in nucleosome detection, even greater than the effect of STS alone. Cells co-incubated with CT and PD098059 demonstrated reversal of the anti-apoptotic effect of CT when added alone. Lower doses of PD098059 (10 and 20 μm) showed a dose-dependent effect on the reversal of CT-mediated effects (data not shown). These data implicate ERK1/2 as a survival pathway involved in CT-mediated inhibition of apoptosis. Our data extends previous findings that cAMP inhibits apoptosis in T84 cells (22Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) by providing an alternative/additional mechanism, i.e. ERK1/2 activation, a known survival pathway in intestinal cells. The susceptibility of a cell to apoptosis is dependent upon a balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. When a cell is exposed to an apoptotic stimulus and survival is the outcome, it is likely a complex network of responses that involves the initiation of cell survival signal transduction pathways and the production of numerous anti-apoptotic factors. For example, ERK1/2 acts in concert with NF-κB in the survival response of YAMC cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (14Yan F. John S.K. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8668-8675PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the initiation of multiple anti-apoptotic signaling pathways provide redundancy and, at times, synergy to preserve cell survival (14Yan F. John S.K. Polk D.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8668-8675PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yan F. Polk D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50959-50965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In T84 cells, cAMP induces cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 (cIAP-2) (22Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of caspase-3 activation (37Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), and known anti-apoptotic factor. Our data demonstrate the reversal of the cAMP survival effect with the addition of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD098059, and strongly suggests that ERK1/2 is a necessary component that may be acting in concert with cIAP-2 and potentially other anti-apoptotic factors that result in cell survival. A second feature of this survival response is that in T84 cells, STS-mediated apoptosis is only transiently inhibited by CT. This effect occurs despite the fact that CT induced cAMP levels continue to rise for 24 h after the initial exposure. The timing is coordinate with the activation of ERK1/2 and provides further evidence to support the role of ERK1/2 in cAMP-mediated cell survival. Therefore, we conclude that the inhibition of apoptosis by cAMP is closely linked to the transient nature of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and we propose that it is tightly controlled by ERK1/2 activation. A transient response of the intestine to an acute stress would lead to the preservation of the intestinal proliferative unit while allowing the removal of damaged cells afterward to maintain intestinal homeostasis. This would be crucial in the small intestine, an organ where rapid turnover, yet low cancer rates, exist (2Potten C.S. Li Y.Q. O'Connor P.J. Winton D.J. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and would confer a distinct advantage over a conversion to a more permanent anti-apoptotic, and potentially tumorigenic, phenotype. MAPK signaling pathways are often regulated in a cell specific manner and the effect of cAMP on ERK1/2 signaling is no exception. Activation of ERK1/2 through cAMP has been demonstrated in other transformed cell lines (18Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 19Saavedra A.P. Tsygankova O.M. Prendergast G.V. Dworet J.H. Cheng G. Meinkoth J.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in primarily derived non-intestinal epithelial cell lines (38Yamaguchi T. Pelling J.C. Ramaswamy N.T. Eppler J.W.

Michelet S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18598-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while in other cell lines cAMP can inhibit ERK1/2 (18Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Our data clearly indicate that in confluent T84 intestinal cells, cAMP phosphorylates ERK1/2. The specificity of this signaling pathway in T84 cells was determined on the basis of a dose response, an inhibition of activation through the pharmacologic blockade of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade, and the lack of cross-activation by cGMP. Cyclic AMP signal transduction relies upon its binding to and activation of a cAMP-binding protein. The binding protein that is most often responsible for ERK1/2 activation is PKA (18Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 34Cancedda L. Putignano E. Impey S. Maffei L. Ratto G.M. Pizzorusso T. J.

Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1460-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For this reason, pharmacological inhibition of PKA was used to determine PKA dependence of cAMP on ERK1/2 activation. Despite using a dose of H-89 that sufficiently inhibited PKA activity, there was no diminution of ERK1/2 activity when stimulated with 8-Br-cAMP. This strongly suggests that PKA is not involved in the activation of ERK1/2 in T84 cells. Other notable exceptions of PKA-independent cAMP mediated activation of ERK1/2 are in rat thyroid follicular cells (40Iacovelli L. Capobianco L. Salvatore L. Sallese M. D'Ancona G.M. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and in human renal cortical collecting duct cells (39Laroche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Michelet S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18598-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In T84 cells, cAMP-mediated chloride secretion occurs through a PKA-dependent mechanism (41Singh A.K. Tasken K. Walker W. Frizzell R.A. Watkins S.C. Bridges R.J. Bradbury N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C562-C570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Delineation of the specific pathways involving cAMP-mediated survival and secretion and the point of divergence will be paramount in designing strategies that will support intestinal cell survival without the consequence of a secretory diarrhea in conditions of acute intestinal injury due to apoptosis. Further work is currently ongoing to determine the signaling pathway that links cAMP to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and whether it is independent of intestinal secretion. In addition to PKA independence, another aspect of cAMP activation of ERK1/2 was explored by examining T84 cells at various stages of confluency. Only confluent or near confluent T84 cells can activate ERK1/2 via cAMP, implying that the formation of cell-cell contacts is important. ERK1/2 signaling has been previously linked to cell adhesion in fibroblasts (42Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in a model of cyclic strain in the intestinal Caco-2 cell line through focal adhesion kinase (Fak) (43Li W. Duzgun A. Sumpio B.E. Basson M.D. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. 2001; 280: G75-G87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP signaling through Fak or a similar integrin-associated pathway was not evaluated in this study. An alternative interpretation of the data is that the state of differentiation plays a role in this signaling pathway. T84 cells remain poorly differentiated when grown in culture (35Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ERK1/2 activation is inversely correlated with differentiation in various other intestinal cell lines (12Ding Q. Wang Q. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Luongo D. Mazzarella G. Della R.F. Maurano F. Rossi M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 231: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in vivo, ERK2 appears to be active primarily in the undifferentiated cells of the intestinal crypt (44Mamajiwalla S.N. Burgess D.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP production in response to various agonists is also greater in the undifferentiated cells of the rabbit intestinal crypt when compared with the villus epithelium (45Amelsberg M. Amelsberg A. Ainsworth M.A. Hogan D.L. Isenberg J.I. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 31: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that while the undifferentiated state of T84 cells is likely to permit cAMP-mediated ERK1/2 activation, other factors that are defined by cell context, such as the ability to form cell-cell contacts, may also be involved in the regulation of this signaling pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in the T84 intestinal cell line, cAMP activates ERK1/2 via a PKA independent mechanism, and leads to the transient inhibition of apoptosis. This effect implies a potential mechanism for the inhibition of intestinal crypt cell apoptosis in response to an acute stress. Determination of the pathways utilized by cAMP to activate ERK1/2 and/or other potential survival factors, how they differ from cAMP-mediated chloride secretion, and demonstration of how the various survival mechanisms interact separately and in concert will be paramount in designing therapies to induce epithelial restitution in time of acute injury (e.g. radiation injury, chemotherapeutic mucositis, and ischemia) without enhancing a long term, tumorigenic effect in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2093185489,"Our previous work has shown that the progesterone receptor (PR) can exist in two distinct functional states in mammary adenocarcinoma cells. The differences in function included the ability to activate a promoter in organized chromatin, sensitivity to ligand, and ligand-independent activation. To determine whether these functional differences were because of altered cellular processing, we carried out biochemical analyses of the functionally distinct PRs. Although the majority of PR is localized to the nucleus, biochemical partitioning resulted in a loosely bound (cytosolic) fraction, and a tightly bound (nuclear) fraction. In the absence of progestins, the functionally distinct PRs differed significantly in partitioning between the two fractions. To characterize these fractions further, we analyzed interactions of unliganded PR with chaperones by coimmunoprecipitation. We determined that PR in the cytosolic fraction associated with hsp90 and p23. In contrast, PR in the nuclear fraction consisted of complexes containing hsp90, p23, and FKBP51 as well as PR that was dimerized and highly phosphorylated. Hormone treatment significantly reduced the formation of all PR-chaperone complexes. The hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, similarly blocked transcriptional activity of both functionally distinct receptors. However, the two forms of the PR differed in their ability to associate with the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in organized chromatin. These findings provide new information about the composition and distribution of mature progesterone receptor complexes in mammary adenocarcinoma cells, and suggest that differences in receptor subcellular distribution have a significant impact on their function. These findings also reveal that transiently expressed steroid receptors may not always be processed like their endogenous counterparts.

O'Malley B.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Data from in vitro studies using cultured breast cancer cells suggest that PR exerts its effects on mammary epithelium by regulating cell cycle progression. PR positive breast cancer cells exhibit a biphasic response to progestins, initial cell division followed by long term G1 phase growth arrest (3Groshong S.D. Owen G.I. Grimison B. Schauer I.E. Todd M.C. Langan T.A. Sclafani R.A. Lange C.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 4Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5032-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammary adenocarcinoma, PR-mediated growth regulation is frequently lost. However, loss of function through receptor deletion or receptor mutation occurs only in a subset of tumors (5Encarnacion C.A. Ciocca D.R. McGuire W.L. Clark G.M. Fuqua S.A. Osborne C.K. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 26: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the majority of cases, other mechanisms must be involved in loss of PR function. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which PR function can be modulated would be beneficial to developing therapy for tumors in which PR function has been lost or altered. In vivo, steroid receptors must interact with transcriptionally inactive promoters having complex chromatin structure. Accordingly, their transcriptional activity is dependent upon a variety of proteins that modify chromatin structure, such as ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, histone acetyltransferases, and histone deacetylases (6Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 7Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32423-32426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the ability of the PR to activate and remodel a target promoter was conditional (10Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PR-mediated transcriptional activation of promoters in ordered, replicated chromatin can be studied using the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. In its stably replicating form, MMTV has a highly ordered nucleoprotein structure that consists of six non-randomly positioned nucleosome families. When activated by glucocorticoids, the hormone responsive element region of the MMTV promoter undergoes a chromatin remodeling event producing a nuclease-hypersensitive site (12Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). When PR is expressed through transient transfection of mouse mammary adenocarcinoma-derived cells (tPR), it cannot efficiently activate transcription from a stably replicating MMTV promoter. This, in part, is because of the fact that the tPR cannot induce chromatin remodeling (13Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transiently expressed PR very efficiently activates a transiently transfected MMTV promoter template that has a more disorganized, accessible chromatin structure and does not require remodeling for activation (10Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, when PR is constitutively expressed through stable transfection (sPR), it acquires the ability to activate and remodel the stably replicating MMTV promoter (10Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), implying that PR undergoes a change in function upon continuous expression. These observations suggested that PR can exist in two functional states. Further studies reveal additional physiologically significant differences in PR function. First, tPR is dramatically more sensitive to progestins than sPR. Second, tPR is responsive to ligand-independent activation by cAMP, whereas sPR is completely refractory (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the basis of these functional differences may lie in altered cellular processing of the tPR. Elucidating the mechanisms driving PR function as a transcriptional activator is often approached from the point of hormone binding. However, studies addressing cellular processing of PR prior to hormone binding are likely to provide insight into additional mechanisms of PR action. Data from the literature support the relevance of cellular processing of PR. Studies using a cell-free system led to the discovery that PR must progress through a series of specific complexes in an ordered fashion to be competent for ligand binding (14Smith D.F. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These complexes have been designated as early, intermediate, and mature. The early complex contains PR and hsp70, whereas the intermediate complex contains PR, hsp70, a hsp90 dimer, Hip (hsp70-interacting protein, or p48), and Hop (hsp70-organizing protein, or p60). The mature complex consists of PR, hsp90, p23, and an immunophilin (15Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This cell-free system also revealed that maintenance of progestin binding of the PR required hsp70, Hip, Hop, hsp90, and p23 (16Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These findings suggested a functionally significant role for PR processing in its ability to activate transcription. In this study we have addressed the issue of altered cellular processing by comparing the composition and distribution of tPR and sPR complexes. Consistent with our previous study, we found that the unliganded PR exists in two distinct fractions based on biochemical partitioning (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that there is hormone-binding competent PR in both fractions but that they contain distinct PR complexes. The distribution of the sPR and tPR between the two fractions differed significantly. However, despite its increased nuclear binding, we observed that tPR did not associate with the stably replicating MMTV promoter even upon addition of ligand. These results indicate that unliganded PR complexes are not uniform and can be differentially distributed. They also suggest that altered cellular distribution may significantly perturb PR function. Our findings are of high relevance to studies of steroid receptor function because transiently expressed receptors in cultured cells are often used as models for in vivo steroid receptor function. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Sorting—Cell line 1470.2 was derived from C127 murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells and contains multiple stably replicating copies of bovine papilloma virus-MMTV long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusions (17Pennie W.D. Hager G.L. Smith C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell line 3017.1 was derived from a single-cell clone of 1470.2 cells after stable transfection with pRSVneo, a neomycin resistance expression vector and pcPRO, a chicken PR expression vector (18Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jeltsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cell line 3134 was derived from C127 cells, and it contains 200 tandemly repeated copies of stably integrated bovine papilloma virus-MMTV-Ras (19McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen and Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Transient transfections of 1470.2 cells were performed using electroporation as described previously (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were plated in medium containing charcoal-stripped serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and incubated overnight under normal cell culture conditions. The following day, the medium was replaced and the cells were treated and harvested. For immunoprecipitation and hormone binding analysis, cells were transfected with 7 μg of pcPRO and 10 μg of pCMV-IL2R, an interleukin-2 receptor subunit expression vector used for cell sorting (20Giordano T. Howard T.H. Coleman J. Sakamoto K. Howard B.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For geldanamycin dose-response experiments, transient transfections of 1470.2 and 3017.1 cells were performed using 2 μg of pRSV-βgal, an SV40-driven β-galactosidase expression vector, 10 μg of pLTRluc, an MMTV-driven luciferase expression vector, and 2 μg of pcPRO (pcPRO in 1470.2 cells only). Transfected 1470.2 cells were maintained in charcoal-dextran-treated serum (HyClone Laboratories). Cell sorting was performed using magnetic beads (Dynal, Great Neck, NY) coated with antibodies to the interleukin-2 receptor Tac subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) as reported previously (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For samples designated as R5020-treated extracts, cells were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with R5020 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a final concentration of 30 nm. Extract Preparation and Hormone Binding Analysis—Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3017.1 cells and sorted, transiently transfected 1470.2 cells were suspended in HEDW buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium tungstate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed by Dounce homogenization with an A pestle. Extracts were adjusted to 10% glycerol by volume (HEDGW) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was reserved on ice, and the nuclei were gently resuspended in HEDGW, incubated for 5 min on ice, and centrifuged as above. This supernatant was pooled with the reserved supernatant, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and denoted as the cytosolic extract. Nuclei were then extracted in HEDGW adjusted to 0.25 m NaCl for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. This was denoted as the nuclear extract. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use. A volume of 5–10 μl was reserved for protein concentration measurement using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) as recommended by the manufacturer. For preparation of extracts from R5020-treated cells, all buffers in the extraction process contained 30 nm R5020. To determine whether PR was associated with components of the nuclear matrix or DNA, nuclei from cells expressing sPR or tPR were extracted as reported in previous studies (21Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49435-49442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted in HEDGW, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were aliquoted into equal volumes and extracted with either 0.25 m NaCl on ice for 30 min and/or with 500 units of RNase-free DNase (Worthington) at 37 °C for 30 min. These nuclei were further extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. From each extraction, supernatants and the final pellets, which were resuspended in 0.1 ml of sample loading buffer, were stored for further processing. For hormone binding analysis, 400–500 μg of extract protein from untreated cells was incubated with 4.0 × 10-9m [3H]promegestone (R5020) (Amersham Biosciences) for one-point assays, and the following concentrations for Scatchard analysis: 4.0 × 10-9, 2.0 × 10-9, 1.0 × 10-9, 5.0 × 10-10, 2.5 × 10-10, 1.25 × 10-10, and 6.25 × 10-11m. All assays were carried out in the absence or presence of 500-fold excess unlabeled R5020. Free R5020 was removed by exposure of extracts to dextran-coated charcoal (4% Norit-A (ICN Biochemicals, Inc., Cleveland, OH), 0.4% dextran T-70 (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3). Bound R5020 was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. For one-point assays, counts per μg of protein for the cytosolic and nuclear extracts were adjusted to the percentage of total extract. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Computation of KD values from Scatchard analysis was performed using GraphPad software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—p23 immunoprecipitations were performed with the JJ3 monoclonal antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Inc., Golden, CO) as previously described (22Johnson J. Corbisier R. Stensgard B. Toft D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with the JJ3 antibody. PR immunoprecipitations and heterodimerization experiments were performed with the PR22 or PR6 antibodies (Affinity BioReagents), respectively, cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose using 20 mm dimethylpimelimidate in 200 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.2, followed by washes with 100 mm citric acid, pH 4.0, to remove uncross-linked antibody as previously described (23Logeat F. Pamphile R. Loosfelt H. Jolivet A. Fournier A. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Extracts containing equal amounts of PR were incubated with rotation overnight (JJ3) or 2 h (PR22 and PR6) with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of antibody-conjugated Protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C in a total volume of 500 μl of HEDGW with or without 30 nm R5020. The slurry was then washed twice with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium tungstate, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20 and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer to elute protein complexes. Non-transfected 1470.2 cells incubated with antibody-Protein A-Sepharose or extracts incubated with Protein A-Sepharose alone were used as negative controls and were processed in the same manner for each experiment. Eluted, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on either 10 (for chaperones) or 7.5% (for heterodimerization experiments) gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) in Tris glycine buffer with 20% methanol for 1–4 h at 4 °C. Immunoblotting was performed in TBS, 2% milk and washes were carried out with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Dilutions of primary antibody were performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:5000 (goat anti-mouse, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and 1:10,000 (rabbit anti-goat, Pierce). Chemiluminescence detection of bound antibody was carried out with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and was recorded on a Fluorchem™ 8000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) for quantitative analysis. PR22 antibody was derived from the ascites fluid of PR22.1 hybridoma cells (prepared by SAIC Frederick, Frederick, MD). The monoclonal hsp90 antibody was kindly provided by D. Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). PR6 and the FKBP51 polyclonal antibody were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Transfected cells were harvested by scraping into 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol followed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Cell extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity using a luminometer as previously reported (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MMTV DNA Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and PR Indirect Immunofluorescence—Transfection of 3134 cells was carried out as described above and plated into 6-well plates containing one coverslip per well in charcoal-stripped media. The following day, cells were treated with or without either R5020 (30 nm) or dexamethasone (100 nm) for 1 h and subjected to DNA FISH using avidin-rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as previously described (24Muller W.G. Walker D. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Following DNA FISH, cells were immunostained with PR22 (1:200), PR6 (1:200), or CREB-binding protein (CBP) antibody (1:100) for 2 h followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at 1:200 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were viewed on a Leica DMRA microscope with a Leica 100 × 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Images were collected with a Photometric Sensys CCD camera. The CBP antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Percent co-localization was calculated from the number of cells analyzed for each condition (n = 24–44). Analysis of PR Ligand Binding in Cytosolic and Nuclear Fractions—Previous studies in this laboratory showed through immunofluorescence that the majority of the unliganded PR localized to the nucleus regardless of whether it was transiently or constitutively expressed in our mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in both cases, the unliganded PR could be divided into two distinct biochemical fractions. One fraction was loosely associated with the nucleus and fractionated at low ionic strength with the cytosol. The other was tightly bound to the nucleus and fractionated at high ionic strength with the nuclear extract. Immunoblots of fractionated extracts indicated that, in the absence of ligand, the tPR was enriched in the nuclear fraction, whereas the sPR was predominantly cytosolic (11Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed one-point hormone binding assays with an excess of the progestin, R5020, to more precisely measure the distribution of the hormone-binding competent sPR and tPR between the two fractions (Table I). For sPR, there was six times more hormone binding activity in the cytosolic fraction than the nuclear fraction. In contrast, hormone binding activity of tPR was approximately equal between the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. This difference in fractionation of sPR and tPR is statistically significant and supports the previous observation that the two functionally distinct forms of the receptor have differential nuclear binding properties when unliganded.Table ICellular distribution of hormone-bound sPR and tPR One-point hormone binding assays were performed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent the percentage of total cellular hormone-bound progesterone receptor.sPRtPRCytosolic and loosely bound nuclear fraction84.3 ± 5.6957.3 ± 7.51Tightly bound nuclear fraction15.7 ± 5.6942.7 ± 7.51 Open table in a new tab To determine whether PR in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions had differential hormone binding affinity, Scatchard analysis was performed on the sPR with cytosolic and nuclear extracts using R5020. There was no significant difference in affinity to R5020 between the two fractions. The KD value for sPR in the cytosolic extract was 0.775 nm as compared with 0.815 nm in the nuclear extract. The Bmax values, which indicate the concentration of receptor, were 208 fmol/mg for the cytosolic extract, and 101 fmol/mg for the nuclear extract. Approximately equal amounts of protein were assayed. This is consistent with the one-point hormone binding data that revealed that more of the hormone-binding competent sPR was present in the cytosolic fraction. It was not feasible to perform this comparison with the tPR considering the amount of protein required for this assay. As previously reported, cellular expression of sPR and tPR was approximately equal in all experiments (data not shown). Composition of PR-Chaperone Complexes in the Two Fractions—The presence of two distinct fractions of the unliganded PR raises two immediate questions. First, do the two fractions differ in terms of the composition of PR complexes? Second, is the composition of the complexes different between the two functionally distinct forms of PR? In the unliganded state, the PR has been shown to associate with chaperone proteins in an ordered sequence ultimately resulting in a mature, hormone-binding competent complex containing hsp90, p23, and a large immunophilin, preferentially FKBP51 (25Nair S.C.

To examine the chaperone composition of PR complexes and determine whether the sPR and the tPR are processed differently, a series of immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Because the results of the hormone binding data indicated differences in cellular distribution of the hormone-binding competent PR, the focus was on isolating, identifying, and comparing cellular distribution of the mature PR complex. Hsp90 is an important member of the chaperone complex because it binds PR, p23, and large immunophilins through non-overlapping sites. To examine PR-hsp90 interactions, we prepared cytosolic and nuclear extracts from mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells, either untreated or treated with R5020. Extracts were generated in the presence of tungstate, which, like molybdate, stabilizes hsp90 interactions with steroid hormone receptors (26Hartson S.D. Thulasiraman V. Huang W. Whitesell L. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3837-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, unlike molybdate, tungstate retains this activity in high salt conditions (27Renoir J.M. Radanyi C. Jung-Testas I. Faber L.E. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14402-14406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor was immunoprecipitated from extracts containing approximately equal amounts of sPR and tPR using the PR22 antibody, which recognizes both A and B forms of the receptor. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with hsp90 antibody to determine relative amounts of hsp90-PR complex formation with sPR and tPR in cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as shown in Fig. 1. In both nuclear and cytosolic extracts, unliganded PR associated with hsp90 (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9 and 17 and 18) and this association was significantly decreased in the presence of hormone (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 15 and 16). This is consistent with the original finding that hsp90 associates with PR in the absence of hormone (28Sanchez E.R. Toft D.O. Schlesinger M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12398-12401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Catelli M.G. Binart N. Jung-Testas I. Renoir J.M. Baulieu E.E. Feramisco J.R. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3131-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitating with extracts containing approximately equal amounts of PR and hsp90 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4 and 10–13), we determined that, in the absence of progestin, there was significantly more hsp90/PR association in the cytosolic fraction as compared with the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 8 and 9 with 17 and 18). To provide a quantitative analysis, hsp90 levels in the immunoprecipitates were normalized to immunoprecipitated PR levels for each sample as shown (Fig. 1B). For both the tPR and sPR there was approximately"

When electron transferring flavoprotein and porcine dimethylglycine dehydrogenase or sarcosine dehydrogenase were incubated together in the absence of substrate, a relative molecular mass corresponding to the flavoprotein.electron transferring flavoprotein complex was observed, providing the first direct observation of these mammalian complexes. When an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member, human short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, was incubated with dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and electron transferring flavoprotein, the microelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometry signal for the dimethylglycine dehydrogenase.electron transferring flavoprotein complex decreased, indicating that the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases have the ability to compete with the dimethylglycine dehydrogenase/sarcosine dehydrogenase family for access to electron transferring flavoprotein. Surface plasmon resonance solution competition experiments revealed affinity constants of 2.0 and 5.0 microm for the dimethylglycine dehydrogenase-electron transferring flavoprotein and short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-electron transferring flavoprotein interactions, respectively, suggesting the same or closely overlapping binding motif(s) on electron transferring flavoprotein for dehydrogenase interaction."
