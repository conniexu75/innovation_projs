https://openalex.org/W2468947127,"The thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) has been implicated in restenosis after vascular injury, which induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation. However, the mechanism for this process is largely unknown. In this study, we report that TP signaling induces VSMC migration and proliferation through activating YAP/TAZ, two major downstream effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. The TP-specific agonists [1S-[1α,2α(Z),3β(1E,3S*),4 α]]-7-[3-[3-hydroxy-4-(4-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid (I-BOP) and 9,11-dideoxy-9α,11α-methanoepoxy-prosta-5Z,13E-dien-1-oic acid (U-46619) induce YAP/TAZ activation in multiple cell lines, including VSMCs. YAP/TAZ activation induced by I-BOP is blocked by knockout of the receptor TP or knockdown of the downstream G proteins Gα12/13 Moreover, Rho inhibition or actin cytoskeleton disruption prevents I-BOP-induced YAP/TAZ activation. Importantly, TP activation promotes DNA synthesis and cell migration in VSMCs in a manner dependent on YAP/TAZ. Taken together, thromboxane A2 signaling activates YAP/TAZ to promote VSMC migration and proliferation, indicating YAP/TAZ as potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases."

Loss of Scribble palmitoylation results in loss of cell polarity and its tumor suppressor activity. Scribble (SCRIB) is a tumor-suppressor protein, playing critical roles in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. SCRIB is frequently amplified in human cancers but does not localize properly to cell-cell junctions, suggesting that mislocalization of SCRIB disrupts its tumor-suppressive activities. Using chemical reporters, here we showed that SCRIB localization was regulated by S-palmitoylation at conserved cysteine residues. Palmitoylation-deficient mutants of SCRIB were mislocalized, leading to disruption of cell polarity and loss of their tumor-suppressive activities to oncogenic YAP, MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. We further found that ZDHHC7 was the major palmitoyl acyltransferase regulating SCRIB. Knockout of ZDHHC7 led to SCRIB mislocalization and YAP activation, and disruption of SCRIB's suppressive activities in HRasV12-induced cell invasion. In summary, we demonstrated that ZDHHC7-mediated SCRIB palmitoylation is critical for SCRIB membrane targeting, cell polarity and tumor suppression, providing new mechanistic insights of how dynamic protein palmitoylation regulates cell polarity and tumorigenesis."

To do this, an evaluation of B. subtilis' intrinsic biological parts is required to determine the best strategies to accurately regulate metabolic circuits and expression of target proteins. The strengths of promoter candidates were evaluated by measuring relative fluorescence units of a green fluorescent protein reporter, integrated into B. subtilis' chromosome. A total of 84 predicted promoter sequences located upstream of different classes of proteins including heat shock proteins, cell-envelope proteins, and proteins resistant against toxic metals (based on similarity) and other kinds of genes were tested. The expression levels measured ranged from 0.0023 to 4.53-fold of the activity of the well-characterized strong promoter P43. No significant shifts were observed when strains, carrying different promoter candidates, were cultured at high temperature or in media with ethanol, but some strains showed increased activity when cultured under high osmotic pressure. Randomly selected promoter candidates were tested and found to activate transcription of thermostable β-galactosidase (bgaB) at a similar level, implying the ability of these sequences to function as promoter elements in multiple genetic contexts. In addition, selected promoters elevated the final production of both cytoplasmic bgaB and secreted protein α-amylase to about fourfold and twofold, respectively. The generated data allows a deeper understanding of B. subtilis' metabolism and will facilitate future work to develop this organism for synthetic biology."
https://openalex.org/W2467750347,"It is well-known that the prevalence of chronic diseases is high among older people, especially those who are poor. Moreover, chronic diseases can result in catastrophic health expenditure. The relationship between chronic diseases and their financial burden on households is thus double-sided, as financial difficulties can give rise to, and result from, chronic diseases. Our aim was to examine the levels of catastrophic health expenditure imposed by private out-of-pocket payments among older people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and cancer in 15 European countries.The SHARE dataset for individuals aged 50+ and their households, collected in 2010-2012 was used. The total number of participants included in this study was N = 51,661. The sample consisted of 43.8% male and 56.2% female participants. The average age was 67 years. We applied an instrumental variable approach for binary instrumented variables known as a treatment-effect model.We found that being diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases was associated with catastrophic health expenditure among older people even in comparatively wealthy countries with developed risk-pooling mechanisms. When compared to the Netherlands (the country with the lowest share of out-of-pocket payments as a percentage of total health expenditure in our study), older people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in Portugal, Poland, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Hungary were more likely to experience catastrophic health expenditure. Similar results were observed for diagnosed cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, cancer was not associated with catastrophic health expenditure.Our study shows that older people with diagnosed chronic diseases face catastrophic health expenditure even in some of the wealthiest countries in Europe. The effect differs across chronic diseases and countries. This may be due to different socio-economic contexts, but also due to the specific characteristics of the different health systems. In view of the ageing of European populations, it will be crucial to strengthen the mechanisms for financial protection for older people with chronic diseases."

However, to date, differences in the chemical composition of crop straw residues after incorporation into soil and during its decomposition under anaerobic vs. aerobic conditions have not been well documented. The objective of the present study was to assess changes in the C-containing functional groups of wheat straw residue during its decomposition in anaerobic and aerobic environments. A 12-month incubation experiment was carried out to investigate the temporal variations of mass, carbon, and nitrogen loss, as well as changes in the chemical composition of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) straw residues under anaerobic and aerobic conditions by measuring C-containing functional groups using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The residual mass, carbon content, and nitrogen content of the straw residue sharply declined during the initial 3 months, and then slowly decreased during the last incubation period from 3 to 12 months. The decomposition rate constant (k) for mass loss under aerobic conditions (0.022 d-1) was higher than that under anaerobic conditions (0.014 d-1). The residual mass percentage of cellulose and hemicellulose in the wheat straw gradually declined, whereas that of lignin gradually increased during the entire 12-month incubation period. The NMR spectra of C-containing functional groups in the decomposing straw under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions were similar at the beginning of the incubation as well as at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months. The main alterations in C-containing functional groups during the decomposition of wheat straw were a decrease in the relative abundances of O-alkyl C and an increase in the relative abundances of alkyl C, aromatic C and COO/N-C = O functional groups. The NMR signals of alkyl C and aromatic C in decomposing wheat straw residues under anaerobic condition were higher than those under aerobic conditions. The higher mass percentages of lignin and the higher signals of aromatic C and alkyl C functional groups in decomposing wheat residues under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions were due to the slower decomposition rates of aryl C and alkyl C in wheat straw residues under anaerobic conditions."

Assessment of socio-emotional development was performed using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley III). Detailed maternal and infant history was recorded. Levels of serum zinc, copper, iron, vitamin B12 and complete blood count (CBC) were assessed in a subsample of 193 infants.The risk of having below average socio-emotional composite score was nearly two and half times among formula-fed infants than among breast-fed infants. By binary logistical regression analysis, predictors of below average socio-emotional score were a lower serum zinc value, being formula fed during the first half-year and introduction of complementary food before the age of six months (p< 0.05).Exclusive breastfeeding and to a lesser extent mixed feeding during the first half year is correlated with above average socio-emotional development. Maternal education and zinc status were also determinants of better infant mental health. Our endeavors ought to be directed towards integrated interventions addressing multiple risks to children's development."
https://openalex.org/W2460498449,"Selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells barring the normal cells is considered as an effective strategy to combat cancer. In the present study, a series of twenty-two (22) synthetic 3,3'-(aryl/alkyl-methylene)bis(2-hydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dione) bis-lawsone derivatives were assayed for their pro-apoptotic activity in six different cell lines (five cancerous and one normal) using MTT assay. Out of these 22 test compounds, 1j was found to be the most effective in inducing apoptosis in human glioma cells (CCF-4) among the different cell lines used in the study. The activity of this compound, 1j, was then compared to a popular anticancer drug, cisplatin, having limited usage because of its nephrotoxic nature. In this study, 1j derivative showed much less toxicity to the normal kidney cells compared to cisplatin, thus indicating the superiority of 1j as a possible anticancer agent. This compound was observed to induce apoptosis in the glioma cells by inducing the caspase dependent apoptotic pathways via ROS and downregulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Estimation of different oxidative stress markers also confirms the induction of oxidative stress in 1j exposed cancer cells. The toxicity of 1j compound toward cancer cells was confirmed further by different flow cytometrical analyses to estimate the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle. The sensitivity of malignant cells to apoptosis, provoked by this synthetic derivative in vitro, deserves further studies in suitable in vivo models. These studies not only identified a novel anticancer drug candidate but also help to understand the metabolism of ROS and its application in cancer treatment."

It is secreted by an unconventional secretory mechanism that is based upon direct translocation across the plasma membrane. Key steps of this process are (i) phosphoinositide-dependent membrane recruitment, (ii) FGF2 oligomerization and membrane pore formation, and (iii) extracellular trapping mediated by membrane-proximal heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Efficient secretion of FGF2 is supported by Tec kinase that stimulates membrane pore formation based upon tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF2. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the direct interaction between FGF2 and Tec kinase as well as the identification of small molecules that inhibit (i) the interaction of FGF2 with Tec, (ii) tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF2 mediated by Tec in vitro and in a cellular context, and (iii) unconventional secretion of FGF2 from cells. We further demonstrate the specificity of these inhibitors for FGF2 because tyrosine phosphorylation of a different substrate of Tec is unaffected in their presence. Building on previous evidence using RNA interference, the identified compounds corroborate the role of Tec kinase in unconventional secretion of FGF2. In addition, they are valuable lead compounds with great potential for drug development aiming at the inhibition of FGF2-dependent tumor growth and metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2472363021,"Identifying causal relations from time series is the first step to understanding the behavior of complex systems. Although many methods have been proposed, few papers have applied multiple methods together to detect causal relations based on time series generated from coupled nonlinear systems with some unobserved parts. Here we propose the combined use of three methods and a majority vote to infer causality under such circumstances. Two of these methods are proposed here for the first time, and all of the three methods can be applied even if the underlying dynamics is nonlinear and there are hidden common causes. We test our methods with coupled logistic maps, coupled Rössler models, and coupled Lorenz models. In addition, we show from ice core data how the causal relations among the temperature, the CH4 level, and the CO2 level in the atmosphere changed in the last 800,000 years, a conclusion also supported by irregularly sampled data analysis. Moreover, these methods show how three regions of the brain interact with each other during the visually cued, two-choice arm reaching task. Especially, we demonstrate that this is due to bottom up influences at the beginning of the task, while there exist mutual influences between the posterior medial prefrontal cortex and the presupplementary motor area. Based on our results, we conclude that identifying causality with an appropriate ensemble of multiple methods ensures the validity of the obtained results more firmly."
https://openalex.org/W2468796126,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is difficult to distinguish from autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) because of their clinical and radiological similarities, and therefore simple and minimally invasive surrogate markers for differential diagnosis would be useful. In our previous studies, we identified four microRNAs (miRNAs)–miR-7, miR-34a, miR-181d, and miR-193b –as MAPK-associated microRNAs whose expression was altered significantly with upregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Recently it has been reported that these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers in serum samples for accurate diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether these MAPK-associated miRNAs in serum could be used as biomarkers for differentiating PDAC from AIP. We enrolled 69 patients with PDAC, 26 with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and 15 with AIP. The expression of MAPK-associated miRNAs in serum was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The 2-ΔCT method was used to quantify the expression of miRNAs, and the data were normalized using spiked-in synthetic cel-miR-39. Patients with PDAC or IPMN showed significantly higher amounts of serum MAPK-associated miRNAs than those with AIP (p<0.009 for miR-7, p<0.002 for miR-34a, p<0.001 for miR-181d, p<0.002 for miR-193b). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that these miRNAs had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.723–0.882 for differentiation between PDAC or IPMN from AIP. Furthermore, serum miR-181d was significantly associated with the presence of metastasis in patients with PDA (p = 0.014). Serum MAPK-associated miRNAs could be novel noninvasive biomarkers for differentiation between PDAC or IPMN and AIP."
https://openalex.org/W2473036559,"The stress-induced epimutations could be inherited over generations and play important roles in plant adaption to stressful environments. Upland rice has been domesticated in water-limited environments for thousands of years and accumulated drought-induced epimutations of DNA methylation, making it epigenetically differentiated from lowland rice. To study the epigenetic differentiation between upland and lowland rice ecotypes on their drought-resistances, the epigenetic variation was investigated in 180 rice landraces under both normal and osmotic conditions via methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) technique. Great alterations (52.9~54.3% of total individual-locus combinations) of DNA methylation are recorded when rice encountering the osmotic stress. Although the general level of epigenetic differentiation was very low, considerable level of ΦST (0.134~0.187) was detected on the highly divergent epiloci (HDE). The HDE detected in normal condition tended to stay at low levels in upland rice, particularly the ones de-methylated in responses to osmotic stress. Three out of four selected HDE genes differentially expressed between upland and lowland rice under normal or stressed conditions. Moreover, once a gene at HDE was up-/down-regulated in responses to the osmotic stress, its expression under the normal condition was higher/lower in upland rice. This result suggested expressions of genes at the HDE in upland rice might be more adaptive to the osmotic stress. The epigenetic divergence and its influence on the gene expression should contribute to the higher drought-resistance in upland rice as it is domesticated in the water-limited environment."
https://openalex.org/W2474002338,"Background Injection drug use is a growing major public health concern. Injection drug users (IDUs) have a higher incidence of co-morbidities including HIV, Hepatitis, and other infections. An effective humoral response is critical for optimal homeostasis and protection from infection; however, the impact of injection heroin use on humoral immunity is poorly understood. We hypothesized that IDUs have altered B cell and antibody profiles. Methods and Findings A comprehensive systems biology-based cross-sectional assessment of 130 peripheral blood B cell flow cytometry- and plasma- based features was performed on HIV-/Hepatitis C-, active heroin IDUs who participated in a syringe exchange program (n = 19) and healthy control subjects (n = 19). The IDU group had substantial polydrug use, with 89% reporting cocaine injection within the preceding month. IDUs exhibited a significant, 2-fold increase in total B cells compared to healthy subjects, which was associated with increased activated B cell subsets. Although plasma total IgG titers were similar between groups, IDUs had significantly higher IgG3 and IgG4, suggestive of chronic B cell activation. Total IgM was also increased in IDUs, as well as HIV Envelope-specific IgM, suggestive of increased HIV exposure. IDUs exhibited numerous features suggestive of systemic inflammation, including significantly increased plasma sCD40L, TNF-α, TGF-α, IL-8, and ceramide metabolites. Machine learning multivariate analysis distilled a set of 10 features that classified samples based on group with absolute accuracy. Conclusions These results demonstrate broad alterations in the steady-state humoral profile of IDUs that are associated with increased systemic inflammation. Such dysregulation may impact the ability of IDUs to generate optimal responses to vaccination and infection, or lead to increased risk for inflammation-related co-morbidities, and should be considered when developing immune-based interventions for this growing population."

However, whether such an event occurs in physiological contexts was unknown. Herein, we report the ADRA1D is subjected to innate NT processing in cultured human cells. SNAP near-infrared imaging and tandem-affinity purification revealed the ADRA1D is expressed as both full-length and NT truncated forms in multiple human cell lines. Serial truncation mapping identified the cleavage site as Leu90/Val91 in the 95-amino acid ADRA1D NT domain, suggesting human cells express a Δ1–91 ADRA1D species.

Mutagenesis of the cleavage site nullified the processing event, resulting in ADRA1D agonist responses less than the WT receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2461669702,"Objectives To identify the prevalence and family and community-level predictors of comorbid speech-language difficulties and socioemotional and behavioral (SEB) difficulties across a population of children at school entry. Methods The School Entry Health Questionnaire is a parent survey of children’s health and wellbeing, completed by all children starting school in Victoria, Australia (N = 53256). It includes parental report of speech-language difficulties, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (behavior), and numerous family and community variables. Following univariate analysis, family and community risk characteristics were entered into a multinomial logistic regression model to identify the associated relative risk of comorbid speech/language and SEB needs. The influence of experiencing multiple risk factors was also examined. Results 20.4% (n = 10,868) began school with either speech-language or SEB difficulties, with 3.1% (n = 1670) experiencing comorbid needs. Five factors predicted comorbidity: the child having witnessed violence; a history of parent mental illness; living in more deprived communities; and the educational attainment of each parent (independently). The relative risk of comorbidity was 6.1 (95% Confidence Interval: 3.9, 9.7) when a child experienced four or more risk factors, compared to those with no risk factors. Conclusions The risk of comorbidity in early childhood is associated with a range of family and community factors, and elevated by the presence of multiple factors. Children growing up in families experiencing multiple, complex needs are therefore at heightened risk of the early development of difficulties likely to impact upon schooling. Early identification of these children offers opportunities for appropriate and timely health and education intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2467736954,"To examine the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and support on self-reported work inability of adults reporting disability.Adults (ages 18-64) who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2009 or 2010 and who reported having a disability (n = 13,009).The study used a retrospective cohort design with work inability as the main outcome. ACE categories included abuse (sexual, physical, emotional) and family dysfunction (domestic violence, incarceration, mental illness, substance abuse, divorce). Support included functional (perceived emotional/social support) and structural (living with another adult) support. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders (age, sex and race) and to evaluate whether there was an independent effect of ACEs on work inability after adding other important predictors (support, education, health) to the model.ACEs were highly prevalent with almost 75% of the sample reporting at least one ACE category and over 25% having a high ACE burden (4 or more categories). ACEs were strongly associated with functional support. Participants experiencing a high ACE burden had a higher adjusted odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] of 1.9 [1.5-2.4] of work inability (reference: zero ACEs). Good functional support (adjusted OR 0.52 [0.42-0.63]) and structural support (adjusted OR 0.48 [0.41-0.56]) were protective against work inability. After adding education and health to the model, ACEs no longer appeared to have an independent effect. Structural support remained highly protective, but functional support only appeared to be protective in those with good physical health.ACEs are highly prevalent in working-age US adults with a disability, particularly young adults. ACEs are associated with decreased support, lower educational attainment and worse adult health. Health care providers are encouraged to screen for ACEs. Addressing the effects of ACEs on health and support, in addition to education and retraining, may increase ability to work in those with a disability."
https://openalex.org/W2470893292,"Data on quantitative metabolic liver functions in the life-threatening disease alcoholic hepatitis are scarce. Urea synthesis is an essential metabolic liver function that plays a key regulatory role in nitrogen homeostasis. The urea synthesis capacity decreases in patients with compromised liver function, whereas it increases in patients with inflammation. Alcoholic hepatitis involves both mechanisms, but how these opposite effects are balanced remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate how alcoholic hepatitis affects the capacity for urea synthesis. We related these findings to another measure of metabolic liver function, the galactose elimination capacity (GEC), as well as to clinical disease severity.We included 20 patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 7 healthy controls. The urea synthesis capacity was quantified by the functional hepatic nitrogen clearance (FHNC), i.e., the slope of the linear relationship between the blood α-amino nitrogen concentration and urea nitrogen synthesis rate during alanine infusion. The GEC was determined using blood concentration decay curves after intravenous bolus injection of galactose. Clinical disease severity was assessed by the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.The FHNC was markedly decreased in the alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with the healthy controls (7.2±4.9 L/h vs. 37.4±6.8 L/h, P<0.01), and the largest decrease was observed in those with severe alcoholic hepatitis (4.9±3.6 L/h vs. 9.9±4.9 L/h, P<0.05). The GEC was less markedly reduced than the FHNC. A negative correlation was detected between the FHNC and MELD score (rho = -0.49, P<0.05).Alcoholic hepatitis markedly decreases the urea synthesis capacity. This decrease is associated with an increase in clinical disease severity. Thus, the metabolic failure in alcoholic hepatitis prevails such that the liver cannot adequately perform the metabolic up-regulation observed in other stressful states, including extrahepatic inflammation, which may contribute to the patients' poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2469872761,"Collisions between DNA replication complexes (replisomes) and barriers such as damaged DNA or tightly bound protein complexes can dissociate replisomes from chromosomes prematurely. Replisomes must be reloaded under these circumstances to avoid incomplete replication and cell death. Bacteria have evolved multiple pathways that initiate DNA replication restart by recognizing and remodeling abandoned replication forks and reloading the replicative helicase. In vitro, the simplest of these pathways is mediated by the single-domain PriC protein, which, along with the DnaC helicase loader, can load the DnaB replicative helicase onto DNA bound by the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (SSB). Previous biochemical studies have identified PriC residues that mediate interactions with ssDNA and SSB. However, the mechanisms by which PriC drives DNA replication restart have remained poorly defined due to the limited structural information available for PriC. Here, we report the NMR structure of full-length PriC from Cronobacter sakazakii. PriC forms a compact bundle of α-helices that brings together residues involved in ssDNA and SSB binding at adjacent sites on the protein surface. Disruption of these interaction sites and of other conserved residues leads to decreased DnaB helicase loading onto SSB-bound DNA. We also demonstrate that PriC can directly interact with DnaB and the DnaB·DnaC complex. These data lead to a model in which PriC acts as a scaffold for recruiting DnaB·DnaC to SSB/ssDNA sites present at stalled replication forks."
https://openalex.org/W2472308264,"Biofilm formation is important for infection by many pathogens. Bordetella bronchiseptica causes respiratory tract infections in mammals and forms biofilm structures in nasal epithelium of infected mice. We previously demonstrated that cyclic di-GMP is involved in biofilm formation in B. bronchiseptica. In the present work, based on their previously reported function in Pseudomonas fluorescens, we identified three genes in the B. bronchiseptica genome likely involved in c-di-GMP-dependent biofilm formation: brtA, lapD and lapG. Genetic analysis confirmed a role for BrtA, LapD and LapG in biofilm formation using microtiter plate assays, as well as scanning electron and fluorescent microscopy to analyze the phenotypes of mutants lacking these proteins. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that the protease LapG of B. bronchiseptica cleaves the N-terminal domain of BrtA, as well as the LapA protein of P. fluorescens, indicating functional conservation between these species. Furthermore, while BrtA and LapG appear to have little or no impact on colonization in a mouse model of infection, a B. bronchiseptica strain lacking the LapG protease has a significantly higher rate of inducing a severe disease outcome compared to the wild type. These findings support a role for c-di-GMP acting through BrtA/LapD/LapG to modulate biofilm formation, as well as impact pathogenesis, by B. bronchiseptica"
https://openalex.org/W2468782721,"A potassium channel Kir2.1-associated membrane hyperpolarization is required for myogenic differentiation. However the molecular regulatory mechanisms modulating Kir2.1 channel activities in early stage of myogenesis are largely unknown. A cell surface protein, Cdo functions as a component of multiprotein cell surface complexes to promote myogenesis. In this study, we report that Cdo forms a complex with Kir2.1 during myogenic differentiation, and is required for the channel activity by enhancing the surface expression of Kir2.1 in the early stage of differentiation. The expression of a constitutively active form of the upstream kinase for p38MAPK, MKK6(EE) can restore Kir2.1 activities in Cdo-depleted C2C12 cells, while the treatment with a p38MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 exhibits a similar effect of Cdo depletion on Kir2.1 surface expression. Furthermore, Cdo-/- primary myoblasts, which display a defective differentiation program, exhibit a defective Kir2.1 activity. Taken together, our results suggest that a promyogenic Cdo signaling is critical for Kir2.1 activities in the induction of myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2468945532,"Gqα signaling has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, angiotensin II (Ang II) was also shown to induce its hypertrophic effect through Gqα and PKCδ activation. We recently showed the role of enhanced expression of Gqα/PLCβ1 proteins in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hypertrophy, however, the role of PKCδ in VSMC hypertrophy in animal model is still lacking. The present study was therefore undertaken to examine the role of PKCδ and the associated signaling mechanisms in VSMC hypertrophy using 16-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). VSMC from 16-week-old SHR exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of PKCδ-Tyr311 and increased protein synthesis, marker of hypertrophy, as compared to WKY rats which was attenuated by rottlerin, an inhibitor of PKCδ. In addition, knocking down of PKCδ by PKCδ-siRNA also attenuated enhanced protein synthesis in VSMC from SHR. Furthermore, rottlerin attenuated the increased production of superoxide anion, NAD(P)H oxidase activity, increased expression of Gqα, phospholipase C (PLC)β1, insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) proteins in VSMC from SHR. In addition, the enhanced phosphorylation of c-Src, PKCδ-Tyr311, IGF-1R, EGFR and ERK1/2 exhibited by VSMC from SHR was also attenuated by rottlerin. These results suggest that VSMC from SHR exhibit enhanced activity of PKCδ and that PKCδ is the upstream molecule of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contributes to the enhanced expression of Gqα and PLCβ1 proteins and resultant VSMC hypertrophy involving c-Src, growth factor receptor transactivation and MAP kinase signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2474368800,"Nanostructured electrochemical sensors often suffer from irreversible aggregation and poor adhesion to the supporting materials, resulting in reduced sensitivity and selectivity over time. We describe a versatile method for fabrication of a H2O2 sensor by immobilizing copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs; 20 nm) on graphene oxide (GO) sheets via in-situ reduction of copper(II) on a polydopamine (PDA) coating on a glassy carbon electrode. The PDA film with its amino groups and catechol groups acts as both a reductant and an adhesive that warrants tight bonding between the Cu NPs and the support. The modified electrode, best operated at a working voltage of -0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), has a linear response to H2O2 in the 5 μM to 12 mM concentration range, a sensitivity of 141.54 μA∙mM‾1∙cm‾2, a response time of 4 s, and a 1.4 μM detection limit (at an S/N ratio of 3). The sensor is highly reproducible and selective (with minimal interference to ascorbic acid and uric acid). The method was applied to the determination of H2O2 in sterilant by the standard addition method and gave recoveries between 97% and 99%."
https://openalex.org/W2463014711,"Neurocognitive dysfunction is common in survivors of intensive care. Prolonged sedation has been implicated but the mechanisms are unclear. Neurogenesis continues into adulthood and is implicated in learning. The neural progenitor cells (NPC) that drive neurogenesis have receptors for the major classes of sedatives used clinically, suggesting that interruption of neurogenesis may partly contribute to cognitive decline in ICU survivors. Using an in vitro system, we tested the hypothesis that prolonged exposure to propofol concentration- and duration-dependently kills or markedly decreases the proliferation of NPCs. NPCs isolated from embryonic day 14 Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to 0, 2.5, or 5.0 μg/mL of propofol, concentrations consistent with deep clinical anesthesia, for either 4 or 24 hours. Cells were assayed for cell death and proliferation either immediately following propofol exposure or 24 hours later. NPC death and apoptosis were measured by propidium iodine staining and cleaved caspase-3 immunocytochemistry, respectively, while proliferation was measured by EdU incorporation. Staurosporine (1μM for 6h) was used as a positive control for cell death. Cells were analyzed with unbiased high-throughput immunocytochemistry. There was no cell death at either concentration of propofol or duration of exposure. Neither concentration of propofol impaired NPC proliferation when exposure lasted 4 h, but when exposure lasted 24 h, propofol had an anti-proliferative effect at both concentrations (P < 0.0001, propofol vs. control). However, this effect was transient; proliferation returned to baseline 24 h after discontinuation of propofol (P = 0.37, propofol vs. control). The transient but reversible suppression of NPC proliferation, absence of cytotoxicity, and negligible effect on the neural stem cell pool pool suggest that propofol, even in concentrations used for clinical anesthesia, has limited impact on neural progenitor cell biology."

Apart from their basic function of charging tRNA molecules for protein synthesis, non-canonical functions like ribosomal RNA biogenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and cell signaling have also been reported for several aaRSs (1Guo M. Schimmel P. Essential nontranslational functions of tRNA synthetases.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2Park S.G. Ewalt K.L. Kim S. Functional expansion of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and their interacting factors: new perspectives on housekeepers.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 569-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Novel functions of this group of enzymes depend on the addition of one or more new domains or motifs during the course of evolution (3Guo M. Yang X.L. Schimmel P. New functions of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases beyond translation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is one such aaRS, which belong to a family of class I synthetases, characterized by a structurally well conserved amino-terminal Rossmann-fold domain, which contains the signature sequences “HIGH” and “KMSKS.” The mammalian TyrRS contains a closely homologous endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAPII) domain at the C terminus (4Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Two distinct cytokines released from a human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Under specific conditions, human TyrRS is processed by an elastase enzyme into a free carboxyl-terminal EMAPII-like domain and a second amino-terminal part known as mini-TyrRS. Both released proteins are active in distinct immune signaling pathways (4Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Two distinct cytokines released from a human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of human TyrRS mimics the cytokine function of EMAPII. On the other hand, human mini-TyrRS, via its ELR (Glu-Leu-Arg) motif, interacts with the CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR1/2), and like IL-8, functions as a chemoattractant for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (4Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Two distinct cytokines released from a human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The ELR motif is a signature motif of CXC chemokines such as IL-8 that are active as polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemoattractants (6Strieter R.M. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Arenberg D.A.

This motif is essential for receptor binding and the chemotactic activity of CXC chemokines (7Addison C.L. Daniel T.O. Burdick M.D. Liu H. Ehlert J.E. Xue Y.Y. Buechi L. Walz A. Richmond A.

The ELR motif in mini-TyrRS is also important for its chemokine-like activity (4Wakasugi K. Schimmel P.

This data on human TyrRS suggests that the twin attributes of chemokine trigger and aminoacylation coexist in TyrRS. Not much is known about aaRSs in Leishmania sp. Leishmania genus is the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a group of neglected diseases. The clinical symptoms of the disease depend on the species involved. Leishmania has a digenetic life cycle. Infected sand flies inoculate the mammalian host with promastigotes. Within the mammalian host, promastigotes differentiate into amastigotes that replicate in phagolysosomes. Leishmania parasites have the capability of subverting host function, thereby allowing the parasite to thrive within the organism (10Kaye P. Scott P. Leishmaniasis: complexity at the host-pathogen interface.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 604-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 11Cecílio P. Pérez-Cabezas B. Santarém N. Maciel J. Rodrigues V. Cordeiro da Silva A. Deception and manipulation: the arms of Leishmania, a successful parasite.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 480PubMed Google Scholar). The development of resistance to currently available anti-leishmanial drugs has led to an urgent need to discover novel drug targets (12Croft S.L. Sundar S. Fairlamb A.H. Drug resistance in leishmaniasis.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In this regard, aaRSs constitute ideal targets for drug development. The crystal structure of Leishmania major TyrRS has been recently solved, and it is known to exist as an asymmetric pseudodimer (13Larson E.T. Kim J.E. Castaneda L.J. Napuli A.J. Zhang Z. Fan E. Zucker F.H. Verlinde C.L. Buckner F.S. Van Voorhis W.C. Hol W.G. Merritt E.A.

Biol. 2011; 409: 159-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the catalytic promiscuity and moonlighting function of L. donovani TyrRS (LdTyrRS). The twin attributes of L. donovani tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, namely, aminoacylation and chemokine trigger have been determined. Our earlier comprehensive bioinformatic analysis led to the identification of a total of 26 aaRSs in Leishmania (14Gowri V.S. Ghosh I. Sharma A. Madhubala R. Unusual domain architecture of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and their paralogs from Leishmania major.BMC Genomics. 2012; 13: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Leishmania genome encodes a single copy of TyrRS (tritrypDB ID LdBPK_141460.1). The present study characterizes the aminoacylation activity of LdTyrRS. To elucidate the physiological role of LdTyrRS, gene deletion mutations were attempted via targeted gene replacement. Heterozygous knock-out mutants of LdTyrRS showed reduced growth and were attenuated in their infectivity, indicating the essentiality of this protein. Several attempts to generate homozygous null mutants of LdTyrRS were unsuccessful due to the presence of a single copy of the TyrRS gene. Fisetin, a natural flavonoid compound, was found to inhibit parasite growth by inhibiting the aminoacylation activity of LdTyrRS. Apart from its role in translation, we also report the non-canonical function of LdTyrRS. The most notable and intriguing feature of LdTyrRS is the presence of an “ELR” motif, which is the signature motif conserved among IL-8 chemokines (15Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Interleukin-8, a chemotactic and inflammatory cytokine.FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) and indicates a possible immunomodulating role of this protein. We explored the significance of this ELR motif in the parasite housekeeping enzyme LdTyrRS. Our comprehensive study involving the characterization, localization, and immunological attributes of LdTyrRS provides a platform to explore LdTyrRS as a potential target for drug development. Multiple sequence alignment of LdTyrRS (Uniprot ID A4HW83; tritrypDB ID LdBPK_141460.1) with representative sequences from other eukaryotes such as human (Uniprot ID P54577), Plasmodium (UniProt ID Q8IAR7), Trypanosoma brucei (Uniprot ID Q57WH7; tritrypDB ID Tb927.7.3620), and L. major (Uniprot ID Q4QFJ7; tritrypDB ID LMJF_14_1370) was generated using CLUSTALW. This multiple sequence alignment showed that LdTyrRS belongs to a family of class I synthetases, characterized by a structurally well conserved amino-terminal Rossmann-fold domain that contains the signature sequences HIGH and KMSKS. Our earlier bioinformatics analysis has revealed the presence of an “ELR (Glu-Leu-Arg) motif,” which is the signature motif conserved among CXC chemokines (14Gowri V.S. Ghosh I. Sharma A. Madhubala R. Unusual domain architecture of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and their paralogs from Leishmania major.BMC Genomics. 2012; 13: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ELR motif in LdTyrRS was found to be present at the 22nd amino acid position and indicated a possible immunomodulating role of this enzyme (Fig. 1). The alignment also suggested complete conservation of the ELR motif in parasitic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases (Plasmodium, T. brucei, and L. major). Interestingly, the ELR motif was found to be evolutionarily absent in TyrRSs from lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2.Domain organization of TyrRS from eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The catalytic and anticodon binding domains are indicated. The ELR motif is present at the N terminus and is shown in red. The HIGH and KMSKS active site motifs are common to all class I catalytic domains. The AIDQ motif is characteristic of the ATP binding site in TyrRS. The AC1 motif corresponds to the anticodon-binding domain that interacts with the anticodon stem of tRNATyr. The AC2 motif specifically recognizes the anticodon bases G34 and U/ψ35.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the recombinant LdTyrRS protein, the full-length gene was cloned into a bacterial expression vector pET30a. A histidine-tagged fusion protein with an estimated molecular mass of ∼80 kDa was induced. This size correlated with the amino acid composition of the LdTyrRS protein (∼74 kDa) with a His6 tag (∼6 kDa) at the N terminus (Fig. 3A). Recombinant LdTyrRS was purified to homogeneity by metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A). Purification yielded ∼2 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture. The recombinant protein (rLdTyrRS) was recognized by an anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3B). To further characterize rLdTyrRS, the purified protein was analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectroscopy (data not shown). The spectrum of the protein analyzed by BioTools version 2.2 showed an intensity coverage of 46.6% for tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Leishmania infantum). The expression of the full-length LdTyrRS enzyme was confirmed in Leishmania cell lysates by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3C). The anti-LdTyrRS antibody detected a ∼74 kDa band in the cell extracts of both the promastigotes and the amastigotes (Fig. 3C). To assess the aminoacylation activity of rLdTyrRS, a coupled enzyme assay was performed. The aminoacylation reaction was carried out with rLdTyrRS in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and the Pi produced was measured with a malachite green solution. Recombinant LdTyrRS acylated tRNATyr in a time-dependent manner, demonstrating that the L. donovani TyrRS gene encodes a functional enzyme (Fig. 3D). The kinetic parameters and specificity of rLdTyrRS were determined with l-tyrosine and tRNATyr as substrates in vitro (Fig. 3, E and F). Enzyme kinetics was performed with varying concentrations of l-tyrosine (from 0.1 to 20 μm), whereas other components were kept constant (Fig. 3E). The results showed that the enzyme reaction was dependent on l-tyrosine concentration (Fig. 3E). The Km value of rLdTyrRS for l-tyrosine was 0.21 ± 0.0245 μm, which is closer to that reported in the case of human TyrRS (0.3 μm) (16Jia J. Li B. Jin Y. Wang D. Expression, purification, and characterization of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase.Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because tRNATyr is another essential substrate of the aminoacylation reaction, therefore, we also performed tRNATyr-dependent enzyme kinetics studies (Fig. 3F). The estimated Km of LdTyrRS, for tRNATyr (1.177 ± 0.2271 μm), was closer to that of humans (0.9 μm) (16Jia J. Li B. Jin Y. Wang D. Expression, purification, and characterization of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase.Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) but higher than that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.2 μm) (17Kijima S. Ohta T. Imahori K. Purification and characterization of tyrosyl-RNA synthetase from baker's yeast.J. Biochem. 1968; 63: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence analysis of LdTyrRS by web-based programs like signalP and pSORT II predicted that LdTyrRS does not contain any detectable signal peptide or cleavage site. Moreover, predictions with MARSPred and LocTree3 also indicated a preferentially cytosolic localization. To ascertain the localization of TyrRS in L. donovani, immunofluorescence analysis of log phase promastigotes stained with anti-LdTyrRS antibody and DAPI was conducted. The kinetoplast and nuclear DNA in these cells were readily identified by their bright staining with DAPI (Fig. 4B). LdTyrRS was found to be localized only in the cytoplasm of the parasite (Fig. 4, C and D). Earlier data from mass spectrometry has demonstrated a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of TyrRS in T. brucei (18Cestari I. Kalidas S. Monnerat S. Anupama A. Phillips M.A. Stuart K. A multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex that enhances tRNA-aminoacylation in African trypanosomes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 4872-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Controls performed with mouse preimmune sera, non-permeabilized cells, and secondary antibody alone showed no detectable signal (data not shown). Because TyrRS is an important component of protein translation, we explored whether its depletion from the cell would affect aminoacylation and impact parasite growth and infection. The essentiality of LdTyrRS was assessed by classical gene replacement experiments where attempts were made to replace both the alleles of LdTyrRS by drug-resistance genes. This was achieved by the generation of inactivation cassettes with hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG) or neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) as selection markers along with 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the TyrRS gene, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Linear replacement cassettes made by fusion PCR were electrotransfected into wild-type (WT) L. donovani promastigotes leading to the generation of heterozygous parasites (TyrRS/HYG or TyrRS/NEO) in which one allele of the LdTyrRS gene was replaced with either the hygromycin or neomycin drug resistance gene. The replacement of a single allele of the LdTyrRS gene by the drug resistance gene cassette was confirmed by a PCR-based analysis. After 3–4 passages, DNA from heterozygous mutant parasites (TyrRS/HYG or TyrRS/NEO) was isolated and subjected to a PCR-based analysis using primers external to the inactivation cassette of the LdTyrRS gene (Fig. 5A). The PCR analysis demonstrated the correct integration of HYG and NEO replacement cassettes at the TyrRS locus in heterozygotes (TyrRS/HYG or TyrRS/NEO), as indicated by the appearance of 1.2- (Fig. 5B, lane 1) and 1.3-kb (Fig. 5B, lane 2) bands in the case of HYG cassette and 1.1- (Fig. 5B, lane 1) and 1.3-kb (Fig. 5B, lane 2) bands in the case of NEO cassette, along with the 1.0- (Fig. 5B, lane 3) and 1.3-kb (Fig. 5B, lane 4) bands corresponding to the WT LdTyrRS gene. This data confirmed that a single allele of the LdTyrRS gene had been replaced in heterozygous mutant parasites (TyrRS/HYG or TyrRS/NEO). Several attempts to replace both alleles of the LdTyrRS gene to generate homozygous gene deletion mutants failed. Although few clones resistant to both drugs were obtained, PCR analyses demonstrated that the LdTyrRS gene was still present in the genome of these parasite lines (data not shown), thus indicating that LdTyrRS is an essential gene. The effect of disruption of a single allele of the TyrRS gene at the protein level was studied by Western blotting analysis. Densitometric analysis was performed to evaluate the levels of TyrRS protein across different parasite lines. Comparative densitometry of the bands revealed a ∼1.8-fold decreased expression of TyrRS protein in heterozygous mutants (TyrRS/HYG) (Fig. 5C, lane 4) as compared with that in WT parasites. Complementation of the heterozygous mutant parasites (TyrRS/HYG) with an episomal copy of the TyrRS gene (TyrRS/HYG[pTyrRS+]) restored protein expression to levels comparable with that of WT parasites (Fig. 5C, lane 3). The overexpression of LdTyrRS protein in overexpressing mutants (WT[pTyrRS+]) was also confirmed by Western blotting analysis. A ∼1.5-fold increase in the TyrRS protein level was observed in TyrRS overexpressors (WT[pTyrRS+]) (Fig. 5C, lane 1) as compared with that in WT parasites. To further establish that the elimination of a single allele of the TyrRS gene in L. donovani conferred TyrRS enzyme deficiency, the aminoacylation activity of TyrRS was determined in genetically manipulated parasites and compared with that in WT L. donovani parasites. A ∼2-fold decrease in the aminoacylation activity of TyrRS was observed in heterozygous parasites (TyrRS/HYG) as compared with that in WT parasites (Fig. 5D). Similar results were obtained with TyrRS/NEO parasites (data not shown). The WT and the “add-back” lines (TyrRS/HYG[pTyrRS+]) exhibited comparable TyrRS activity levels (Fig. 5D). To assess if the reduced expression of TyrRS compromised the cellular growth of heterozygous mutant parasites, growth kinetic studies were undertaken. Heterozygous parasites (TyrRS/HYG) consistently showed growth delay as compared with WT parasites (Fig. 5E). The complementation of TyrRS/HYG mutants with an episomal copy (pTyrRS+) rescued the growth of these parasites similar to that of the WT control. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that a gene dosage effect resulted in the production of lesser TyrRS protein, and such a conjecture would suggest that TyrRS is involved in optimal cell proliferation. We also examined the survival of heterozygous mutant parasites (TyrRS/HYG) inside murine macrophages in vitro. Virulence studies in a mouse macrophage cell line were carried out to determine the effects of genetic deficiency of TyrRS and to characterize the LdTyrRS enzyme further as a potential therapeutic target. To this end, a murine macrophage cell line was infected with WT, TyrRS heterozygous mutant (TyrRS/HYG), and add-back (TyrRS/HYG[pTyrRS+]) parasites at an multiplicity of infection of 20:1. WT parasites were capable of infecting and sustaining robust infection in murine macrophages, whereas the parasitemia of the heterozygous mutants was reduced by ∼50% relative to WT parasites 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5F). Similar results were obtained with TyrRS/NEO parasites (data not shown). Complementation with an episomal copy of the TyrRS gene restored the infectivity of the heterozygous (TyrRS/HYG) mutants similar to that of the WT parasites. Taken together, our data suggests that the LdTyrRS gene has a significant role in the growth and intramacrophage survival of amastigotes. Resveratrol is a natural phenolic compound that has recently been shown to inhibit the activity of human TyrRS (19Sajish M. Schimmel P. A human tRNA synthetase is a potent PARP1-activating effector target for resveratrol.Nature. 2015; 519: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A co-crystal structure of resveratrol bound to the active site of human TyrRS has been reported (19Sajish M. Schimmel P. A human tRNA synthetase is a potent PARP1-activating effector target for resveratrol.Nature. 2015; 519: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another flavanoid compound fisetin has also been identified to bind TyrRS of L. major (13Larson E.T. Kim J.E. Castaneda L.J. Napuli A.J. Zhang Z. Fan E. Zucker F.H. Verlinde C.L. Buckner F.S. Van Voorhis W.C. Hol W.G. Merritt E.A. The double-length tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from the eukaryote Leishmania major forms an intrinsically asymmetric pseudo-dimer.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 159-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To test the efficacy of these compounds on L. donovani, log phase promastigotes were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of fisetin and resveratrol. Both compounds were found to inhibit the growth of promastigotes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The effective concentration that caused 50% inhibition of growth (IC50) after 72 h of drug addition was 31.07 μm for fisetin and 47.21 μm for resveratrol (Fig. 6A). The sensitivities of amastigotes were also tested in an intracellular amastigote-macrophage model. The IC50 of fisetin and resveratrol for amastigotes after 3 days of drug treatment was 1.53 and 9.3 μm, respectively (Fig. 6B). At these concentrations, both fisetin and resveratrol did not affect the viability of the macrophage cell line J774A.1, with the IC50 being >400 μm after 48 h of drug treatment. The effect of these compounds on the aminoacylation activity of LdTyrRS (Fig. 6C) was also tested. Fisetin inhibited the enzymatic activity of recombinant LdTyrRS with an IC50 of ∼14.23 μm (Fig. 6C), whereas a concentration of resveratrol as high as 1 mm failed to inhibit the enzymatic activity of LdTyrRS (Fig. 6C). Thus, our results suggest that the anti-leishmanial effect of resveratrol is not due to the inhibition of LdTyrRS. To ascertain whether the anti-leishmanial activity of fisetin is mediated through the inhibition of LdTyrRS, we also evaluated the effect of fisetin on the growth of genetically manipulated parasites (Fig. 6D). WT, overexpressors (WT[pTyrRS+]), heterozygous mutants (TyrRS/HYG), and add-back (TyrRS/HYG[pTyrRS+]) parasites were treated with fisetin at a concentration of 35 μm. In the absence of drug treatment (untreated), the growth of each parasitic line was normalized to a value of 1.0. After 72 h of treatment with fisetin, the growth rate of each parasitic line was calculated relative to the untreated control. Parasites overexpressing LdTyrRS (WT[pTyrRS+]) were found to be more resistant to growth inhibition by fisetin as compared with WT parasites (Fig. 6D). In contrast, heterozygous mutant parasites (TyrRS/HYG) were found to be more susceptible to inhibition by fisetin when compared with WT parasites (Fig. 6D). Complementation of TyrRS/HYG parasites with an episomal TyrRS gene (TyrRS/HYG[pTyrRS+]) decreased the sensitivity of heterozygous mutant parasites (Fig. 6D). The increased susceptibility of the heterozygous mutants to fisetin may be explained by the reduced levels of LdTyrRS expression in heterozygous knock-out parasites. The above data further indicates that fisetin exerts its antileishmanial effect through the inhibition of LdTyrRS. To determine the localization of LdTyrRS during macrophage infection, confocal microscopy of infected macrophages was performed. Infected and uninfected macrophages were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for immunofluorescence using either the anti-LdTyrRS antibody or preimmune sera (Fig. 7, B and C). DAPI staining was utilized for visualizing both the host and parasite nuclei. The anti-LdTyrRS-specific fluorescence observed in infected macrophages was not only associated with parasite nuclei staining but was also present throughout the cytosol of the infected macrophages (Fig. 7C). Thus, the confocal data demonstrates the presence of LdTyrRS in the cytosol of infected macrophages. Uninfected macrophages served as a negative control (Fig. 7A). No signal could be detected with the preimmune sera in infected macrophages (Fig. 7B). The immunofluorescence data thus indicates the possible secretion of TyrRS from Leishmania amastigotes (Fig. 7, A–C). The presence of LdTyrRS in the host cytosol also hinted toward its possible secretion into the extracellular milieu. Therefore, culture supernatants from uninfected or L. donovani-infected macrophages were analyzed for the presence of LdTyrRS by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 7D). As expected, no TyrRS was detected in the culture supernatant of uninfected macrophages (Fig. 7D). In contrast, a single band corresponding to the wild-type LdTyrRS (∼74 kDa) was observed in the culture supernatant of infected macrophages (Fig. 7D). We also analyzed the secretion of TyrRS by Leishmania promastigotes (Fig. 7E). A ∼74-kDa band corresponding to wild-type LdTyrRS was observed in the parasite culture supernatants (Fig. 7E)."
https://openalex.org/W2469214031,"Since their discovery, miRNAs have emerged as a promising therapeutical approach in the treatment of several diseases, as demonstrated by miR-212 and its relation to addiction. Here we prove that the miR-212/132 cluster can be regulated by morphine, through the activation of mu opioid receptor (Oprm1). The molecular pathways triggered after morphine administration also induce changes in the levels of expression of oprm1. In addition, miR-212/132 cluster is actively repressing the expression of mu opioid receptor by targeting a sequence in the 3' UTR of its mRNA. These findings suggest that this cluster is closely related to opioid signaling, and function as a post-transcriptional regulator, modulating morphine response in a dose dependent manner. The regulation of miR-212/132 cluster expression is mediated by MAP kinase pathway, CaMKII-CaMKIV and PKA, through the phosphorylation of CREB. Moreover, the regulation of both oprm1 and of the cluster promoter is mediated by MeCP2, acting as a transcriptional repressor on methylated DNA after prolonged morphine administration. This mechanism explains the molecular signaling triggered by morphine as well as the regulation of the expression of the mu opioid receptor mediated by morphine and the implication of miR-212/132 in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2463916489,"Schistosoma mansoni, one of the causative agents of human schistosomiasis, has a unique antioxidant network that is key to parasite survival and a valuable chemotherapeutic target. The ability to detoxify and tolerate reactive oxygen species increases along S. mansoni development in the vertebrate host, suggesting that adult parasites are more exposed to redox challenges than young stages. Indeed, adult parasites are exposed to multiple redox insults generated from blood digestion, activated immune cells, and, potentially, from their own parasitic aerobic metabolism. However, it remains unknown how reactive oxygen species are produced by S. mansoni metabolism, as well as their biological effects on adult worms. Here, we assessed the contribution of nutrients and parasite gender to oxygen utilization pathways, and reactive oxygen species generation in whole unpaired adult S. mansoni worms. We also determined the susceptibilities of both parasite sexes to a pro-oxidant challenge. We observed that glutamine and serum importantly contribute to both respiratory and non-respiratory oxygen utilization in adult worms, but with different proportions among parasite sexes. Analyses of oxygen utilization pathways revealed that respiratory rates were high in male worms, which contrast with high non-respiratory rates in females, regardless nutritional sources. Interestingly, mitochondrial complex I-III activity was higher than complex IV specifically in females. We also observed sexual preferences in substrate utilization to sustain hydrogen peroxide production towards glucose in females, and glutamine in male worms. Despite strikingly high oxidant levels and hydrogen peroxide production rates, female worms were more resistant to a pro-oxidant challenge than male parasites. The data presented here indicate that sexual preferences in nutrient metabolism in adult S. mansoni worms regulate oxygen utilization and reactive oxygen species production, which may differently contribute to redox biology among parasite sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2462481154,"Background Catecholamine infusion elicits an increase in clotting factors and this increase has been attributed to stimulation of β2-adrenorecptors (β2AR). Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that inhalation of a short-acting selective β2AR agonist can induce a procoagulant state in healthy individuals. Methods We recruited 23 healthy volunteers (nine females; mean age: 26±0.8 years; body mass index: 24.7±0.5 kg/m2) and randomly allocated them into two groups, the β2AR arm (seventeen subjects) and the saline arm (six subjects). Hemodynamics, plasma norepinephrine concentration, and procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic profiles of each participant were determined using specific assays before and after inhalation of either 2 mL nebulized normal saline or a mixture of 1 mL saline and 1 mL of salbutamol (5 mg salbutamol sulfate), a selective β2AR agonist, which were delivered by a nebulizer over ten minutes. Results Saline inhalation had no effect on the procoagulant, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic profiles of the six healthy volunteer in the study's saline arm. Salbutamol inhalation caused (a) a significant increase in the activity or levels of the procoagulant factors; FVIII increased by 11±3% (p = 0.04), von Willebrand factor increased by 7±1% (p = 0.03), and (b) a significant decrease in the activated partial prothrombin time from 27.4±0.4 seconds to 25.5 ±0.5 seconds (p<0.001) in the 17 volunteers in the study's β2AR arm. D-dimer and prothrombin fragments F1+2 were elevated by 200 ±90% and 505.0 ±300.0%, respectively. In addition, the activity of the anticoagulant protein C pathway (demonstrated by the protein C Global assay) decreased from 1.0±0.08 to 0.82±0.06 (p<0.001). Although plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator decreased, all other indices of the fibrinolytic system did not change following salbutamol inhalation. Conclusion We found that a single inhalation of salbutamol, a short-acting β2AR agonist, activates the clotting system without affecting the fibrinolytic system. This induction of a procoagulant state in healthy subjects warrants further investigation in patients treated with these agents."
https://openalex.org/W2462739799,"The number of highly caffeinated products has increased dramatically in the past few years. Among these products, highly caffeinated energy drinks are the most heavily advertised and purchased, which has resulted in increased incidences of co-consumption of energy drinks with alcohol. Despite the growing number of adolescents and young adults reporting caffeine-mixed alcohol use, knowledge of the potential consequences associated with co-consumption has been limited to survey-based results and in-laboratory human behavioral testing. Here, we investigate the effect of repeated adolescent (post-natal days P35-61) exposure to caffeine-mixed alcohol in C57BL/6 mice on common drug-related behaviors such as locomotor sensitivity, drug reward and cross-sensitivity, and natural reward. To determine changes in neurological activity resulting from adolescent exposure, we monitored changes in expression of the transcription factor ΔFosB in the dopaminergic reward pathway as a sign of long-term increases in neuronal activity. Repeated adolescent exposure to caffeine-mixed alcohol exposure induced significant locomotor sensitization, desensitized cocaine conditioned place preference, decreased cocaine locomotor cross-sensitivity, and increased natural reward consumption. We also observed increased accumulation of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens following repeated adolescent caffeine-mixed alcohol exposure compared to alcohol or caffeine alone. Using our exposure model, we found that repeated exposure to caffeine-mixed alcohol during adolescence causes unique behavioral and neurochemical effects not observed in mice exposed to caffeine or alcohol alone. Based on similar findings for different substances of abuse, it is possible that repeated exposure to caffeine-mixed alcohol during adolescence could potentially alter or escalate future substance abuse as means to compensate for these behavioral and neurochemical alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2468402489,"Intracoronary injection of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) is an emerging treatment for heart failure. Initial donor cell retention in the heart is the key to the success of this approach, but this process remains insufficiently characterized. Although it is assumed that cell size of injected cells may influence their initial retention, no scientific evidence has been reported. We developed a unique model utilizing an ex-vivo rat heart perfusion system, enabling quantitative assessment of retention of donor cells after intracoronary injection. The initial (5 minutes after intracoronary injection) retention rate of BMMNC was as low as approximately 20% irrespective of donor cell doses injected (1×106, 8×106, 4×107). Quantitative cell-size assessment revealed a positive relationship between the size of BMMNC and retention ratio; larger subpopulations of BMMNC were more preferentially retained compared to smaller ones. Furthermore, a larger cell type-bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (median size = 11.5μm versus 7.0μm for BMMNC)-had a markedly increased retention rate (77.5±1.8%). A positive relationship between the cell size and retention ratio was also seen in mesenchymal stromal cells. Flow-cytometric studies showed expression of cell-surface proteins, including integrins and selectin-ligands, was unchanged between pre-injection BMMNC and those exited from the heart, suggesting that biochemical interaction between donor cells and host coronary endothelium is not critical for BMMNC retention. Histological analyses showed that retained BMMNC and mesenchymal stromal cells were entrapped in the coronary vasculature and did not extravasate by 60 minutes after transplantation. Whilst BMMNC did not change coronary flow after intracoronary injection, mesenchymal stromal cells reduced it, suggesting coronary embolism, which was supported by the histological finding of intravascular cell-clump formation. These data indicate that cell-size dependent, passive (mechanical), intravascular entrapment is responsible for the initial donor cell retention after intracoronary injection of BMMNC in the heart having normal vasculatures (at least)."
https://openalex.org/W2460842741,"This study examined the effects of emotion on implicit timing. In the implicit timing task used, the participants did not receive any temporal instructions. Instead they were simply asked and trained to press a key as quickly as possible after a stimulus (response stimulus) that was separated from a preceding stimulus by a given temporal interval (reference interval duration). However, in the testing phase, the interval duration was the reference interval duration or a shorter or longer interval duration. In addition, the participants attended two sessions: a first baseline session in which no stimulus was presented during the inter-stimulus intervals, and a second emotional session in which emotional facial expressions (angry, neutral and sad facial expressions) were presented during these intervals. Results showed faster RTs for interval durations close to the reference duration in both the baseline and the emotional conditions and yielded a U-shaped curve. This suggests that implicit processing of time persists in emotional contexts. In addition, the RT was faster for the facial expressions of anger than for those of neutrality and sadness. However, the U-shaped RT curve did not peak clearly at a shorter interval duration for the angry than for the other facial expressions. This lack of time distortion in an implicit timing task in response to arousing emotional stimuli questions the idea of an automatic speeding-up of the interval clock system involved in the representation of time."
https://openalex.org/W2466580381,"Agrin, a multidomain proteoglycan and neurotrypsin, a neuronal serine protease, are important for forming (neuromuscular) synapses. Proteolytical activity of neurotrypsin produces a C-terminal fragment of agrin, termed CAF, of approximately 22 kDA molecular size which also circulates in blood. The presence of CAF in urine suggests either glomerular filtration or secretion into urine. Blood levels of CAF have been identified as a potential novel marker of kidney function. Here we describe that several nephron segments in the mouse kidney express agrin and neutrotrypsin in addition to the localization of both protein in the glomerulum. Agrin mRNA and protein was detected in almost all nephron segments and mRNA abundance was highest in the inner medullary collecting duct. Neurotrypsin mRNA was mostly detected in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the inner medullary collecting duct. Moreover, we show that the proximal tubule absorbs injected recombinant CAF by a process shared with receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytosis. Co-injection of CAF with recombinant human transferrin, a substrate of the receptor-mediated endocytic pathway as well as with FITC-labelled dextran (10 kDa), a marker of fluid phase endocytosis, showed partial colocalization of CAF with both markers. Further colocalization of CAF with the lysosomal marker cathepsin B suggested degradation of CAF by the lysosome in the proximal tubule. Thus, the murine kidney expresses agrin and neurotrypsin in nephron segments beyond the glomerulum. CAF is filtered by the glomerulum and is reabsorbed by endocytosis by the proximal tubule. Thus, impaired kidney function could impair glomerular clearance of CAF and thereby increase circulating CAF levels."

In this study, we explore the utility of DCOL in the reconstruction of networks, by combining it with local false discovery rate (lfdr)–based inference.

https://openalex.org/W2461634760,"Many G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to be sensitive to the presence of sodium ions (Na+). Using radioligand competition binding assays, we have examined and compared the effects of sodium ions on the binding affinities of a number of structurally diverse ligands at human dopamine D2 and dopamine D3 receptor subtypes, which are important therapeutic targets for the treatment of psychotic disorders. At both receptors, the binding affinities of the antagonists/inverse agonists SB-277011-A, L,741,626, GR 103691 and U 99194 were higher in the presence of sodium ions compared to those measured in the presence of the organic cation, N-methyl-D-glucamine, used to control for ionic strength. Conversely, the affinities of spiperone and (+)-butaclamol were unaffected by the presence of sodium ions. Interestingly, the binding of the antagonist/inverse agonist clozapine was affected by changes in ionic strength of the buffer used rather than the presence of specific cations. Similar sensitivities to sodium ions were seen at both receptors, suggesting parallel effects of sodium ion interactions on receptor conformation. However, no clear correlation between ligand characteristics, such as subtype selectivity, and sodium ion sensitivity were observed. Therefore, the properties which determine this sensitivity remain unclear. However these findings do highlight the importance of careful consideration of assay buffer composition for in vitro assays and when comparing data from different studies, and may indicate a further level of control for ligand binding in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2472171070,"Methamphetamine (MA) abuse has been linked to violence, risk-taking behaviors, decreased sexual inhibition, and criminal activity. It is important to understand mechanisms underlying these drug effects for prevention and treatment of MA-associated social problems. Previous studies have demonstrated that experimenter-administered amphetamine inhibits pair bonding and increases aggression in monogamous prairie voles. It is not currently known whether similar effects on social behaviors would be obtained under conditions during which the drug is voluntarily (actively) administered. The current study investigated whether MA drinking affects pair bonding and what neurocircuits are engaged. In Experiment 1, we exposed male and female voles to 4 days each of 20 and 40 mg/L MA under a continuous 2-bottle choice (2BC) procedure. Animals were housed either singly or in mesh-divided cages with a social partner. Voles consumed MA in a drinking solution, but MA drinking was not affected by either sex or housing condition. In Experiment 2, we investigated whether MA drinking disrupts social bonding by measuring aggression and partner preference formation following three consecutive days of 18-hour/day access to 100 mg/L MA in a 2BC procedure. Although aggression toward a novel opposite-sex animal was not affected by MA exposure, partner preference was inhibited in MA drinking animals. Experiment 3 examined whether alterations in hypothalamic neuropeptides provide a potential explanation for the inhibition of partner preference observed in Experiment 2. MA drinking led to significant decreases in oxytocin, but not vasopressin, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. These experiments are the first investigation into how voluntary pre-exposure to MA affects the development of social attachment in a socially monogamous species and identify potential neural circuits involved in these effects."

The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) has been implemented to provide rural residents financial protection against health risks. This study aims to assess the effect of the NCMS on alleviating health payment-induced poverty in the Shaanxi Province of China.The data was drawn from the 5th National Health Service Survey of Shaanxi Province, conducted in 2013. In total, 41,037 individuals covered by NCMS were selected. Poverty headcount ratio (HCR), poverty gap and mean positive poverty gap were used for measuring the incidence, depth and intensity of poverty, respectively. The differences on poverty measures pre- and post- insurance reimbursement indicate the effectiveness of alleviating health payment-induced poverty under NCMS.For the general insured, 5.81% of households fell below the national poverty line owing to the health payment; this HCR dropped to 4.84% after insurance reimbursement. The poverty HCRs for the insured that had hospitalization in the past year dropped from 7.50% to 2.09% after reimbursement. With the NCMS compensation, the poverty gap declined from 42.90 Yuan to 34.49 Yuan (19.60% decreased) for the general insured and from 57.48 Yuan to 10.01 Yuan (82.59% decreased) for the hospital admission insured. The mean positive poverty gap declined 3.56% and 37.40% for two samples, respectively.The NCMS could alleviate the health payment-induced poverty. The effectiveness of alleviating health payment-induced poverty is greater for hospital admission insured than for general insured, mainly because NCMS compensates for serious diseases. Our study suggests that a more comprehensive insurance benefit package design could further improve the effectiveness of poverty alleviation."

Previous studies demonstrated PDHB to be positively related to the intramuscular fat (IMF) content. However, the transcriptional regulation of PDHB remains unclear. In our present study, the cDNA of bovine PDHB was cloned and the genomic structure was analyzed. The phylogenetic tree showed bovine PDHB to be closely related to goat and sheep, and least related to chicken. Spatial expression pattern analysis revealed the products of bovine PDHB to be widely expressed with the highest level in the fat of testis. To understand the transcriptional regulation of bovine PDHB, 1899 base pairs (bp) of the 5'-regulatory region was cloned. Sequence analysis neither found consensus TATA-box nor CCAAT-box in the 5'-flanking region of bovine PDHB. However, a CpG island was predicted from nucleotides -284 to +117. Serial deletion constructs of the 5'-flanking region, evaluated in dual-luciferase reporter assay, revealed the core promoter to be located 490bp upstream from the transcription initiation site (+1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) in combination with asite-directed mutation experiment indicated both myogenin (MYOG) and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPß) to be important transcription factors for bovine PDHB in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2470105260,"During winter, cave cricket larvae undergo dormancy in subterranean habitats; this dormancy is termed diapause in second year Troglophilus cavicola larvae because they mature during this time, and termed quiescence in T. neglectus, because they mature after dormancy. Here we used electron microscopy to analyze ultrastructural changes in the epithelial cells in the Malpighian tubules (MTs) of T. cavicola during diapause, in order to compare them with previous findings on T. neglectus. Moreover, the autophagosomes were studied with immunofluorescence microscopy in both species. Although the basic ultrastructure of the cells was similar, specific differences appeared during overwintering. During this natural starvation period, the nucleus, rER, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria did not show structural changes, and the spherites were exploited. The abundances of autophagic structures in both species increased during overwintering. At the beginning of overwintering, in both species and sexes, the rates of cells with autophagic structures (phagophores, autophagosomes, autolysosomes and residual bodies) were low, while their rates increased gradually towards the end of overwintering. Between sexes, in T. cavicola significant differences were found in the autophagosome abundances in the middle and at the end, and in T. neglectus at the end of overwintering. Females showed higher rates of autophagic cells than males, and these were more abundant in T. cavicola. Thus, autophagic processes in the MT epithelial cells induced by starvation are mostly parallel in diapausing T. cavicola and quiescent T. neglectus, but more intensive in diapausing females."

These SNPs may tag correlated variants with biological importance. Fine-mapping around GWAS loci can facilitate detection of functional candidates and additional independent risk variants. We analyzed 11,900 cases and 14,311 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon Cancer Family Registry. To fine-map genomic regions containing all known common risk variants, we imputed high-density genetic data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We tested single-variant associations with colorectal tumor risk for all variants spanning genomic regions 250-kb upstream or downstream of 31 GWAS-identified SNPs (index SNPs). We queried the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser to examine evidence for biological function. Index SNPs did not show the strongest association signals with colorectal tumor risk in their respective genomic regions. Bioinformatics analysis of SNPs showing smaller P-values in each region revealed 21 functional candidates in 12 loci (5q31.1, 8q24, 11q13.4, 11q23, 12p13.32, 12q24.21, 14q22.2, 15q13, 18q21, 19q13.1, 20p12.3, and 20q13.33).

https://openalex.org/W2460166807,"Macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) populations residing in the intestinal lamina propria (LP) are highly heterogeneous and have disparate yet collaborative roles in the promotion of adaptive immune responses towards intestinal antigen. Under steady-state conditions, macrophages are efficient at acquiring antigen but are non-migratory. In comparison, intestinal DC are inefficient at antigen uptake but migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) where they present antigen to T cells. Whether such distinction in the roles of DC and macrophages in the uptake and transport of antigen is maintained under immunostimulatory conditions is less clear. Here we show that the scavenger and phosphatidylserine receptor T cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin (TIM)-4 is expressed by the majority of LP macrophages at steady-state, whereas DC are TIM-4 negative. Oral treatment with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) induces expression of TIM-4 on a proportion of CD103+ CD11b+ DC in the LP. TIM-4+ DC selectively express high levels of co-stimulatory molecules after CT treatment and are detected in the mLN a short time after appearing in the LP. Importantly, intestinal macrophages and DC expressing TIM-4 are more efficient than their TIM-4 negative counterparts at taking up apoptotic cells and soluble antigen ex vivo. Taken together, our results show that CT induces phenotypic changes to migratory intestinal DC that may impact their ability to take up local antigens and in turn promote the priming of mucosal immunity."

As the tissue-of-origin of the majority of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the fallopian tube fimbriae carrying a precursor cancer lesion may also approach the ovulatory site for metastasis. We hypothesize that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in mature follicle fluid (FF) attracts the migration of PDGFR-expressing fimbriae toward the ovulating follicle. We observed that more PDGFR-β was expressed in the distal part than in the proximal parts of the fallopian tube, particularly in stromal cells in the lamina propria. The stromal cells, but not the epithelial cells, from normal fimbriae and fallopian tube HGSC were highly chemotactic to mature FF. The chemotactic activities were positively correlated with PDGF-BB and estradiol levels in FF and were abolished by a blocking antibody of PDGFR-β and by tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. When PDGF-BB/AB was depleted from the FF, more than 80% of chemotaxis activities were diminished. This study suggests an ovarian follicle-directed and PDGF-dependent attraction of fallopian tube fimbriae before ovulation. The same mechanism may also be crucial for the ovarian homing of HGSC, which largely originates in the fimbriae."
https://openalex.org/W2470449455,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene translation and have been suggested as potent biomarkers in various disease states. In this study, we established an efficient method for simultaneous determination of multiple miRNA levels, employing the previously developed SPC-SBE (solid phase capture-single base extension) approach and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). In this approach, we first perform reverse transcription of miRNAs extracted using stem-loop primers. Then the cDNA is co-amplified with competitors, synthetic oligonucleotides whose sequences precisely match cDNA except for one base, and the amplicons serve as templates for a multiplexed SBE reaction. Extension products are isolated using SPC and quantitatively analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS to determine multiple miRNA levels. Here we demonstrated concurrent analysis of four miRNA levels utilizing the approach. Furthermore, we showed the presented method significantly facilitated MS analysis of peak area ratio owing to SPC. The SPC process allowed effective removal of irrelevant reaction components prior to MS and promoted MS sample purification. Data obtained in this study was verified with RT-qPCR and agreement was shown on one order of magnitude scale, suggesting the SPC-SBE and MS approach has strong potential as a viable tool for high throughput miRNA analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2461810103,"Background Familial sick sinus syndrome is associated with gene mutations and dysfunction of ion channels. In contrast, degenerative fibrosis of the sinus node tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acquired sick sinus syndrome. There is a close relationship between transforming growth factor-β1 mediated cardiac fibrosis and acquired arrhythmia. It is of interest to examine whether transforming growth factor-β1 is involved in the pathogenesis of acquired sick sinus syndrome. Methods Overall, 110 patients with acquired SSS and 137 age/gender-matched controls were screened for transforming growth factor-β1 and cardiac sodium channel gene polymorphisms using gene sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the serum level of transforming growth factor-β1. Results Two transforming growth factor-β1 gene polymorphisms (C-509T and T+869C) and one cardiac sodium channel gene polymorphism (H588R) have been identified. The C-dominant CC/CT genotype frequency of T869C was significantly higher in acquired sick sinus syndrome patients than in controls (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.16–3.75, P = 0.01). Consistently, the level of serum transforming growth factor-β1 was also significantly greater in acquired sick sinus syndrome group than in controls (5.3±3.4 ng/ml vs. 3.7±2.4 ng/ml, P = 0.01). In addition, the CC/CT genotypes showed a higher transforming growth factor-β1 serum level than the TT genotype (4.25 ± 2.50 ng/ml vs. 2.71± 1.76 ng/ml, P = 0.028) in controls. Conclusion Transforming growth factor-β1 T869C polymorphism, correlated with high serum transforming growth factor-β1 levels, is associated with susceptibility to acquired sick sinus syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2468189123,"Background We investigated whether multichannel ECG-recordings are useful to risk-stratify patients with congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) for risk of sudden cardiac death under optimized medical treatment. Methods In 34 LQTS-patients (11 male; age 31±13 years, QTc 478±51ms; LQT1 n = 8, LQT2 n = 15) we performed a standard 12-channel ECG and a 120-channel body surface potential mapping. The occurrence of clinical events (CE; syncope, torsade de pointes (TdP), sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)) was documented and correlated with different ECG-parameters in all lead positions. Results Seven patients developed TdP, four survived SCA and 12 experienced syncope. 12/34 had at least one CE. CE was associated with a longer QTc-interval (519±43ms vs. 458±42ms; p = 0.001), a lower T-wave integral (TWI) on the left upper chest (-1.2±74.4mV*ms vs. 63.0±29.7mV*ms; p = 0.001), a lower range of T-wave amplitude (TWA) in the region of chest lead V8 (0.10±0.08mV vs. 0.18±0.07mV; p = 0.008) and a longer T-peak-T-end time (TpTe) in lead V1 (98±23ms vs. 78±26ms; p = 0.04). Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 75% (area under curve (AUC) 0.89±0.06, p = 0.001) at a cut-off value of 26.8mV*ms for prediction of CE by TWI, a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 83% at a cut-off value of 0.11mV (AUC 0.83±0.09, p = 0.002) for prediction of CE by TWA and a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 73% at a cut-off value of 87ms (AUC 0.80±0.07, p = 0.005) for prediction of CE by TpTe. Conclusions Occurrence of CE in LQTS-patients seems to be associated with a prolonged, low-amplitude T-wave."
https://openalex.org/W2467853965,"In this study, the flanking sequence of an inserted fragment conferring glyphosate tolerance on transgenic cotton line BG2-7 was analyzed by thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR) and standard PCR. The results showed apparent insertion of the exogenous gene into chromosome D10 of the Gossypium hirsutum L. genome, as the left and right borders of the inserted fragment are nucleotides 61,962,952 and 61,962,921 of chromosome D10, respectively. In addition, a 31-bp cotton microsatellite sequence was noted between the genome sequence and the 5' end of the exogenous gene. In total, 84 and 298 bp were deleted from the left and right borders of the exogenous gene, respectively, with 30 bp deleted from the cotton chromosome at the insertion site. According to the flanking sequence obtained, several pairs of event-specific detection primers were designed to amplify sequence between the 5' end of the exogenous gene and the cotton genome junction region as well as between the 3' end and the cotton genome junction region. Based on screening tests, the 5'-end primers GTCATAACGTGACTCCCTTAATTCTCC/CCTATTACACGGCTATGC and 3'-end primers TCCTTTCGCTTTCTTCCCTT/ACACTTACATGGCGTCTTCT were used to detect the respective BG2-7 event-specific primers. The limit of detection of the former primers reached 44 copies, and that of the latter primers reached 88 copies. The results of this study provide useful data for assessment of BG2-7 safety and for accelerating its industrialization."
https://openalex.org/W2469375729,"Assembly of pulmonary surfactant lipid-protein complexes depends on conformational changes coupled with proteolytic maturation of proSP-B, the precursor of pulmonary surfactant protein B (SP-B), along the surfactant biogenesis pathway in pneumocytes. Conformational destabilization of the N-terminal propeptide of proSP-B (SP-BN) triggers exposure of the mature SP-B domain for insertion into surfactant lipids. We have studied the conformational stability during GdmCl- or urea-promoted unfolding of SP-BN with trp fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies. Binding of the intermediate states to bis-ANS suggests their molten globule-like character. ΔG0H2O was ~ 12.7 kJ·mol-1 either with urea or GdmCl. None of the thermal transitions of SP-BN detected by CD correspond to protein unfolding. Differential scanning calorimetry of SP-BN evidenced two endothermic peaks involved in oligomer dissociation as confirmed with 2 M urea. Ionic strength was relevant since at 150 mM NaCl, the process originating the endotherm at the highest temperature was irreversible (Tm2 = 108.5°C) with an activation energy of 703.8 kJ·mol-1. At 500 mM NaCl the process became reversible (Tm2 = 114.4°C) and data were fitted to the Non-two States model with two subpeaks. No free thiols in the propeptide could be titrated by DTNB with or without 5.7 M GdmCl, indicating disulfide bonds establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2470092494,"Repetitive manual handling tasks account for a substantial portion of work-related injuries. However, few studies report endurance time in repetitive manual handling tasks. Consequently, there is little guidance to inform expected work time for repetitive manual handling tasks. We aimed to investigate endurance time and oxygen consumption of a repetitive lift and carry task using linear mixed models.Fourteen male soldiers (age 22.4 ± 4.5 yrs, height 1.78 ± 0.04 m, body mass 76.3 ± 10.1 kg) conducted four assessment sessions that consisted of one maximal box lifting session and three lift and carry sessions. The relationships between carry mass (range 17.5-37.5 kg) and the duration of carry, and carry mass and oxygen consumption, were assessed using linear mixed models with random effects to account for between-subject variation.Results demonstrated that endurance time was inversely associated with carry mass (R2 = 0.24), with significant individual-level variation (R2 = 0.85). Normalising carry mass to performance in a maximal box lifting test improved the prediction of endurance time (R2 = 0.40). Oxygen consumption presented relative to total mass (body mass, external load and carried mass) was not significantly related to lift and carry mass (β1 = 0.16, SE = 0.10, 95%CI: -0.04, 0.36, p = 0.12), indicating that there was no change in oxygen consumption relative to total mass with increasing lift and carry mass.Practically, these data can be used to guide work-rest schedules and provide insight into methods assessing the physical capacity of workers conducting repetitive manual handling tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2470552394,"Next-generation sequencing data pose a severe curse of dimensionality, complicating traditional ""single marker—single trait"" analysis. We propose a two-stage combined p-value method for pathway analysis. The first stage is at the gene level, where we integrate effects within a gene using the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT). The second stage is at the pathway level, where we perform a correlated Lancaster procedure to detect joint effects from multiple genes within a pathway. We show that the Lancaster procedure is optimal in Bahadur efficiency among all combined p-value methods. The Bahadur efficiency,, compares sample sizes among different statistical tests when signals become sparse in sequencing data, i.e. ε →0. The optimal Bahadur efficiency ensures that the Lancaster procedure asymptotically requires a minimal sample size to detect sparse signals (). The Lancaster procedure can also be applied to meta-analysis. Extensive empirical assessments of exome sequencing data show that the proposed method outperforms Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We applied the competitive Lancaster procedure to meta-analysis data generated by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium to identify pathways significantly associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol."
