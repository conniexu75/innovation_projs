https://openalex.org/W2139387072,"We have identified a novel gene referred to asactivation-induced deaminase (AID) by subtraction of cDNAs derived from switch-induced and uninduced murine B lymphoma CH12F3-2 cells, more than 80% of which switch exclusively to IgA upon stimulation. The amino acid sequence encoded by AID cDNA is homologous to that of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1), a type of cytidine deaminase that constitutes a catalytic subunit for the apoB mRNA-editing complex. In vitro experiments using a glutathione S-transferase AID fusion protein revealed significant cytidine deaminase activity that is blocked by tetrahydrouridine and by zinc chelation. However, AID alone did neither demonstrate activity in C to U editing of apoB mRNA nor bind to AU-rich RNA targets. AID mRNA expression is induced in splenic B cells that were activated in vitro or by immunizations with sheep red blood cells. In situ hybridization of immunized spleen sections revealed the restricted expression of AID mRNA in developing germinal centers in which modulation of immunoglobulin gene information through somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination takes place. Taken together, these findings suggest that AID is a new member of the RNA-editing deaminase family and may play a role in genetic events in the germinal center B cell.

Two prominent alterations of immunoglobulin gene information are known to occur in this microenvironment (3Jacob J. Kassir R. Kelsoe G. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 4Kraal G. Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1985; 186: 145-151PubMed Google Scholar, 5Berek C. Berger A. Apel M.

First, accumulation of massive point mutations in the variable region exon, a process refer to as somatic hypermutation (6Neuberger M.S. Milstein C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), gives rise to affinity maturation of antibody in association with selection of B cells expressing high affinity immunoglobulins on their surface (7Sablitzky F.

A. 1988; 85: 8206-8210Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Second, class switch recombination (CSR) replaces the exons encoding the heavy chain constant region (9Lorenz M. Radbruch A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 151-169PubMed Google Scholar), which determines effector functions of the antibody including complement fixation. These two alterations of immunoglobulin gene information are critical for accounting for an effective humoral response to harmful microbes. The molecular mechanisms for these genetic events remain to be elucidated despite intensive study.To dissect the molecular mechanism of class switching, we have isolated a murine B lymphoma clone CH12F3-2 in which CSR from IgM to IgA begins to occur within a few hours after stimulation with IL-4, TGF-β, and CD40L, giving rise to more than 80% IgA+ cells (10Kinoshita K.

Immunol. 1996; 8: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Using CH12F3-2 cells, we have shown that CRS breakpoints are distributed not only within typical repetitive sequences (designated S region) but also in its flanking regions (11Lee C.G. Kondo S. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 227-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the break points were rarely found in the I and C exons, which are separated by the S region, i.e. the intron of germ-line transcripts. Because accumulating evidence indicates that transcription from I to C exon and splicing of the transcripts are essential to CSR (13Hein K. Lorenz M. Siebenkotten B. Petry K. Christine R. Radbruch A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2369-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Lorenz M. Jung S. Radbruch A. Science. 1995; 267: 1825-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it is possible that the transcripts are involved directly or indirectly in CSR. We have thus proposed that a complex structure of DNA and RNA, but not S region sequence per se, is recognized for initiation of CSR (11Lee C.G. Kondo S. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 227-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This idea gained further support with the finding that CSR can take place efficiently even when the Sα region was replaced by the Sε or Sγ1 region in minichromosomal constructs introduced in CH12F3-2 cells upon cytokine stimulation (10Kinoshita K. Tashiro J. Tomita S. Lee Chung-Gi Honjo T. Immunity. 1998; 9: 349-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Another type of genetic regulation, RNA-editing, is widely used as a means to create new functional genes from the restricted genome in plants and protozoa (15Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 833-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Simpson L. Thiemann O.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An increasing number of mammalian mRNAs are also known to be edited, including apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA, glutamate receptor mRNA, Wilms tumor-1 mRNA, α-galactosidase mRNA, neurofibromatosis type-1 mRNA, and tRNAAsp (17Smith H.C. Sowden M.P. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 418-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although most of their molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, that of apoB mRNA editing by APOBEC-1(18, 19) is extensively documented. ApoB mRNA editing involves a site-specific C to U deamination of the first base of a CAA codon, encoding glutamine at residue 2153 in apoB100, and produces a UAA in-frame stop codon in apoB48 mRNA (20Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ApoB100 and apoB48 are translation products of the unedited and edited apoB mRNAs, respectively, and these proteins have completely different physiological functions (21Innerarity T.L. Boren J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). APOBEC-1 requires an auxiliary factor(s) for site-specific RNA editing of apoB mRNA (18Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 19Navaratnam N. Morrison J.R. Bhattacharya S. Patel D. Funahashi T. Giannoni F. Teng B.B. Davidson N.O. Scott J. J. Biol.

APOBEC-1 itself demonstrates cytidine deaminase activity on a monomeric nucleoside substrate and nonspecific, low affinity binding to AU-rich RNA (19Navaratnam N. Morrison J.R. Bhattacharya S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14762-14767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Expression and activity of the auxiliary factors are found not only in organs that carry out apoB mRNA editing but also in those that have no detectable levels of APOBEC-1 or apoB mRNA (18Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 19Navaratnam N. Morrison J.R. Bhattacharya S. Patel D. Funahashi T. Giannoni F. Teng B.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21725-21734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such widespread expression of the auxiliary factors in the absence of APOBEC-1 implies that the auxiliary factors may be involved in either more general cellular functions or editing of other unknown RNAs. However, little is currently known concerning the identity or activity profile of these other components.In this paper we report isolation of cDNA encoding a novelactivation-induced cytidinedeaminase (AID) that is structurally related to the apoB RNA-editing enzyme, APOBEC-1. The restricted expression and inducibility of AID within B cells in GC suggests that AID may play a role in genetic events in GC.DISCUSSIONTo dissect the molecular mechanism of CSR, we screened subtracted cDNA libraries from nonstimulated and stimulated CH12F3-2 cells on the assumption that induction of trans-acting factors, such as switch recombinase, are required for CSR. In support of this, it was demonstrated that cycloheximide treatment inhibited the formation of looped-out circular DNA in stimulated CH12F3-2 cells (Fig. 1,A and B), indicating the requirement for de novo protein synthesis for CSR to take place.Among four novel genes thus isolated, we have characterized AID, which is specifically induced in GC B cells upon immunization. AID contains the active site for cytidine deaminase and catalyzes deamination of cytidine in vitro (Fig. 3). The inhibitory effect of THU and of zinc chelation on enzyme activity suggests that the deamination process may be similar to that of other cytosine deaminases, including APOBEC-1(19). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AID is located closer to the RNA-editing deaminase rather than other cytosine deaminases (Fig. 2 B), despite the fact that AID lacks RNA editing activity on an apoB RNA template. Mutagenesis studies indicate that Phe-66, Phe-87, His-61, Glu-63, and Cys-93 in mouse APOBEC-1 are essential for RNA binding (17Smith H.C. Sowden M.P. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 418-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Anant S. MacGinnitie A.J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14762-14767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These residues were noted to be conserved in the AID primary structure (Fig. 2 A). However, as noted above, AID was not found to exhibit apoB RNA binding activity. X-ray crystallographic studies on the E. colicytidine deaminase has revealed its three-dimensional structure, which has similarities with the predicted structure of APOBEC-1(34). The cytosine deaminase family can be divided into two groups in the view of the quaternary organization (35Navaratnam N. Fujino T. Bayliss J. Jarmuz A. How A. Richardson N. Somasekaram A. Bhattacharya S. Carter C. Scott J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 695-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). E. coli cytidine deaminase and APOBEC-1 have a pseudoactive site domain in the C terminus, which is required to form a homodimer, whereas the other group,e.g. CMP deaminase, lacks such domain and forms homotetramers. AID contains a leucine-rich C terminus, which is shorter than but similar to the pseudoactive site domain of APOBEC-1 (Fig.2 A), indicating that AID belongs to the APOBEC-1/E. coli cytidine deaminase group. The predicted structural similarity of AID to APOBEC-1 implies that AID may be a novel RNA-editing deaminase induced in GC B cells, although it remains to be determined whether AID assembles into either a homodimer or associates into a heteromeric with the auxiliary factors used by APOBEC-1. Further resolution of this issue will require formal identification of the auxiliary factors themselves.AID mRNA was induced in CH12F3-2 cells within 3 h after cytokine stimulation (Fig. 5). The appearance of AID mRNAs and the onset of CSR in CH12F3 cells thus coincide temporally. AID mRNA expression was induced in splenic B cells after in vitrotreatment with LPS and cytokine, which activates naive B cells to initiate CSR (Fig. 6). AID mRNAs were also up-regulated in splenic B cell in vivo when mice were immunized with the T cell-dependent antigen, SRBC. Furthermore, ex vivo experiments (Fig. 7) and in situ hybridization (Fig. 8) studies revealed that AID mRNA was specifically detected in GC B cells, which are competent to perform somatic hypermutation and CSR. In addition, none of the cell lines examined that do not support CSR, including LyD9, BA/F3, 70Z/3, WEHI231, X63, WEHI-3, EL-4, 2B4, F2, P815, L929, NIH3T3, and ST2, were found to express AID mRNA (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that AID mRNA is a GC B cell-specific gene induced upon antigen stimulation. Highly restricted expression of the AID gene in GC B cells together with the concordant onset of AID induction and CSR suggest its role in GC function. Furthermore, the possibility of RNA-editing activity on other templates inspires us to speculate that AID may participate in regulatory steps unique to GC function such as somatic hypermutation and CSR. It is of note that the efficiency of CSR in CH12F3-2 cells is increased up to double when cells were stimulated in the presence of THU (data not shown). The physiological function of AID is currently being investigated by gene targeting and transgenic techniques.

However, as noted above, AID was not found to exhibit apoB RNA binding activity. X-ray crystallographic studies on the E. colicytidine deaminase has revealed its three-dimensional structure, which has similarities with the predicted structure of APOBEC-1(34). The cytosine deaminase family can be divided into two groups in the view of the quaternary organization (35Navaratnam N. Fujino T. Bayliss J. Jarmuz A. How A. Richardson N. Somasekaram A. Bhattacharya S. Carter C. Scott J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 695-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). E. coli cytidine deaminase and APOBEC-1 have a pseudoactive site domain in the C terminus, which is required to form a homodimer, whereas the other group,e.g. CMP deaminase, lacks such domain and forms homotetramers. AID contains a leucine-rich C terminus, which is shorter than but similar to the pseudoactive site domain of APOBEC-1 (Fig.2 A), indicating that AID belongs to the APOBEC-1/E. coli cytidine deaminase group. The predicted structural similarity of AID to APOBEC-1 implies that AID may be a novel RNA-editing deaminase induced in GC B cells, although it remains to be determined whether AID assembles into either a homodimer or associates into a heteromeric with the auxiliary factors used by APOBEC-1. Further resolution of this issue will require formal identification of the auxiliary factors themselves.AID mRNA was induced in CH12F3-2 cells within 3 h after cytokine stimulation (Fig. 5). The appearance of AID mRNAs and the onset of CSR in CH12F3 cells thus coincide temporally. AID mRNA expression was induced in splenic B cells after in vitrotreatment with LPS and cytokine, which activates naive B cells to initiate CSR (Fig. 6). AID mRNAs were also up-regulated in splenic B cell in vivo when mice were immunized with the T cell-dependent antigen, SRBC. Furthermore, ex vivo experiments (Fig. 7) and in situ hybridization (Fig. 8) studies revealed that AID mRNA was specifically detected in GC B cells, which are competent to perform somatic hypermutation and CSR. In addition, none of the cell lines examined that do not support CSR, including LyD9, BA/F3, 70Z/3, WEHI231, X63, WEHI-3, EL-4, 2B4, F2, P815, L929, NIH3T3, and ST2, were found to express AID mRNA (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that AID mRNA is a GC B cell-specific gene induced upon antigen stimulation. Highly restricted expression of the AID gene in GC B cells together with the concordant onset of AID induction and CSR suggest its role in GC function. Furthermore, the possibility of RNA-editing activity on other templates inspires us to speculate that AID may participate in regulatory steps unique to GC function such as somatic hypermutation and CSR. It is of note that the efficiency of CSR in CH12F3-2 cells is increased up to double when cells were stimulated in the presence of THU (data not shown). The physiological function of AID is currently being investigated by gene targeting and transgenic techniques. To dissect the molecular mechanism of CSR, we screened subtracted cDNA libraries from nonstimulated and stimulated CH12F3-2 cells on the assumption that induction of trans-acting factors, such as switch recombinase, are required for CSR. In support of this, it was demonstrated that cycloheximide treatment inhibited the formation of looped-out circular DNA in stimulated CH12F3-2 cells (Fig. 1,A and B), indicating the requirement for de novo protein synthesis for CSR to take place. Among four novel genes thus isolated, we have characterized AID, which is specifically induced in GC B cells upon immunization. AID contains the active site for cytidine deaminase and catalyzes deamination of cytidine in vitro (Fig. 3). The inhibitory effect of THU and of zinc chelation on enzyme activity suggests that the deamination process may be similar to that of other cytosine deaminases, including APOBEC-1(19). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AID is located closer to the RNA-editing deaminase rather than other cytosine deaminases (Fig. 2 B), despite the fact that AID lacks RNA editing activity on an apoB RNA template.

The conversion of mechanical stimulation into chemical signals is still unclear. We report here that shear stress (12 dynes/cm2) induced a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1 and its concomitant association with the adaptor protein Shc; these are accompanied by a concurrent clustering of Flk-1, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Our results also show that shear stress induced an association of αvβ3 and β1 integrins with Shc, and an attendant association of Shc with Grb2. These associations are sustained, in contrast to the transient Flk-1·Shc association in response to shear stress and the transient association between αvβ3 integrin and Shc caused by cell attachment to substratum. Shc-SH2, an expression plasmid encoding the SH2 domain of Shc, attenuated shear stress activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and the gene transcription mediated by the activator protein-1/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element complex. Our results indicate that receptor tyrosine kinases and integrins can serve as mechanosensors to transduce mechanical stimuli into chemical signals via their association with Shc.

The mechanotransduction processes by which these vascular cells convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals have gained increasing attention. Several laboratories, including ours, have performed in vitro experiments using flow channels to study the responses of ECs to applied shear stress (see Refs. 1Davies P.F. Physiol.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase, are rapidly activated by shear stress (5Tseng H.

This results in the transcriptional activation of immediate early genes such as those encoding monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and c-Fos (8Hsieh H.J. Li N.Q. Frangos J.A. J. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). On the upstream side, the shear stress activation of ERK and JNK is modulated by Ras, which in turn is regulated by Son of sevenless (Sos), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as evidenced by the findings that negative mutants of Ras and Sos can block the shear stress induction of ERK and JNK (6Li Y.S.

Conceptually, shear stress acts on the EC membrane to activate putative shear stress sensors or receptors which then lead to the activation of the Sos-Ras pathway. To date, several mechanism of mechanotransduction involving the EC membrane have been suggested. Shear stress activates the seven-span-receptor-coupled G-protein (11Gudi S.R. Clark C.B. Frangos J.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), ion channels such as K+ channel (12Olesen S.P. Clapham D.E. Davies P.F. Nature. 1988; 331: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), and the transforming growth factor-β receptor-related Smad6 and Smad7 (13Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K.R. Xu Y.Y.

A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Several recent studies showed that tyrosine kinases, i.e. focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and c-Src in the focal adhesion site constitute a part of the mechanotransduction in ECs in response to shear stress (10Jalali S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). FAK, by forming a complex with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2), regulates the shear stress induction of ERK and JNK (15Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.-L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The involvement of these signaling molecules in the focal adhesion sites may be correlated with the dynamic reorientation of focal adhesions in ECs under shear stress (16Davies P.F. Robotewskyj A. Griem M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2031-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the multiplicity of the signaling molecules engaged in the EC responses to shear stress, there is a missing link to integrate the various pathways into an unified theme. Shc is an adaptor protein containing a C-terminal Src homology domain-2 (SH2) domain and a central glycine/proline-rich sequence (17Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). In response to many growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (EGF), Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with phosphotyrosines of the cognate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) through SH2 binding (17Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc also associates with Grb2 through SH2 interaction (21Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 22van der Geer P. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5161-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The assembly of Shc·Grb2·Sos provides an alternative mechanism in addition to the Grb2·Sos pathway for the activation of Ras. Recently, it has been shown that Shc is involved in the integrin-mediated signal transduction. In A431 cells, Shc is recruited to α1β1, α5β1, and αvβ3 when these integrins have been conjugated to their corresponding antibodies (23Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In the same study, it was also shown that Shc is necessary and sufficient for the activation of ERK in response to integrin ligation. These results suggest that both growth factors and integrins can regulate the ERK pathway via Shc. In the current study, we show for the first time that fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1), an RTK specific for vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), and integrins (αvβ3,β1, and β5 integrins) can both function as mechanosensors in ECs, and that shear stress causes both to be associated with Shc. The interaction of Shc with Flk-1 is rapid and transient, whereas its association with the various integrin is sustained. These findings provide new insights into the roles of RTKs and integrins in the transduction of shear stress into chemical signals. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were isolated from bovine aorta and cultured in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm each of penicillin-streptomycin and sodium pyruvate. All experiments were conducted with cultures prior to passage 10. A flow system was used to impose shear stress on cultured ECs as described previously (24Frangos J.A. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Ives C.L. Science. 1985; 227: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In brief, a 75 × 38-mm glass slide was seeded with BAECs, which were cultured until reaching a confluent monolayer. A silicone gasket was sandwiched between the glass slide and an acrylic plate to create a rectangular flow channel (0.025 cm in height, 2.5 cm in width, and 5.0 cm in length) with inlet and outlet for exposing the cultured BAECs to shear stress. A high reservoir, the flow channel, a low reservoir, and a peristaltic pump were connected to form a circulation loop. Steady, laminar flow across the channel was generated as a result of the height difference between the two reservoirs. During the flow experiments, the system was kept at 37 °C in a constant temperature cabinet and equilibrated with 95% humidified air plus 5% CO2. The antibodies used in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), polyclonal anti-Shc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal anti-Grb2/Sem5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-c-Myc mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-Flk-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-αvβ3 LM609 mAb, polyclonal anti-β5 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-β1CD29 mAb (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunoprecipitation, cells were scraped into a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100); the lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed and used for either kinase activity assays or immunoblotting. After SDS-PAGE, proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with the primary antibody in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The bound primary antibodies were detected by using a goat anti-mouse or a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Confluent BAEC monolayers were fixed in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were then incubated in PBS containing the polyclonal anti-Flk-1 at a concentration of 1:200 (v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The specimens were washed in PBS and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The immunostaining of Flk-1 was observed with a confocal microscopy system (MRC-1000, Bio-Rad) equipped with an argon/krypton laser line, a scan head, and a Nikon Diaplot 300 inverted microscope. FITC was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm and detected within a band between 506 and 538 nm. The pixel intensity of the confocal images was measured and analyzed by Lasersharp Processing software (Bio-Rad). To construct plasmid Shc-SH2 encoding the SH2 domain of Shc, the full-length Shc cDNA was first obtained from mRNA isolated from HeLa cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using 5′-ATGAACAAGCTGAGTGGAGGC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGCTAGGGCAGATCA-3′ as the forward and reverse primers. The obtained Shc cDNA was then used as the template for the polymerase chain reaction synthesis of the SH2 domain (from Trp-378 to Ser-475) using 5′-TGGTTCCATGGGAAGCTG-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GAGCGCTAGGGCAGATCA-3′ as the reverse primer. The 0.3-kilobase pair amplicons obtained after purification was ligated into plasmid pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the fragments flanked by HindIII and EcoRI sites were then subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids HA-JNK1, Myc-ERK2, 4XTRE-Pl-Luc, and MCP1-Luc-540 have been described previously (25Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

A. 1995; 92: 8069-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The various DNA plasmids were transfected into BAECs at 80% confluence using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 6 h, the transfected cells were washed with DMEM and incubated in fresh complete DMEM to reach confluence. Within 48 h after transfection, the BAEC monolayer was subjected to shear stress or kept as static controls. The epitope-tagged Myc-ERK2 was co-transfected with Shc-SH2 into BAECs. After shear stress experiments, the cells were lysed in a kinase lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate). Myc-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-c-Myc mAb and protein A-Sepharose beads. To perform immunocomplex kinase assays, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice in the lysis buffer and twice in a kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Two micrograms of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, Irvine, CA) in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 25 μm ATP were added to each immunocomplex pellet for kinase reaction at 30 °C for 20 min. The phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried for autoradiography. The kinase activities of the epitope-tagged HA-JNK1 were assessed by using essentially the same method as those for ERK, except that HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA mAb and that glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein was used as the substrate in the immunocomplex kinase assays. pcDNA3 or Shc-SH2 was co-transfected with either 4xTRE-Pl-Luc or MCP1-Luc-540 into BAECs at 70% confluence by using the transient transfection protocols. The pSVβ-gal plasmid, which contains a β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene driven by SV40 promoter and enhancer, was included in the co-transfection to monitor the transfection efficiency. The cells were then subjected to shear stress experiments or kept as static controls. The luciferase reporter activities normalized for transfection efficiency were used to assess the effects of Shc-SH2 on shear stress-induced transcription activation mediated by AP-1/TRE. The binding of growth factors to their cognate RTKs induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of RTKs, leading to the recruitment of the SH2-containing adaptor molecules such as Shc to the phosphorylated tyrosine. To test whether shear stress can activate endothelial RTKs as in the case of growth factor binding, confluent BAEC monolayers were subjected to a shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 for various lengths of time. In parallel positive control experiments, however, BAECs were stimulated with 10 nm VEGF in the absence of shear. The cell lysates from the various experiments were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against Flk-1, a VEGF receptor (27de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated protein complexes were then immunoblotted with PY20 mAb to detect the change in tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1 which has a molecular mass of 210 kDa. As shown in Fig. 1 A, shear stress induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1 as early as 1 min, reached a peak level at 5 min, decreased afterward, and returned to the basal level at 30 min. The temporal response of Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by shear stress was similar to that found in cells stimulated by VEGF (Fig. 1 B). Shear stress induction of Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation occurred both in the absence or presence of serum supplements and was not inhibited by pretreating BAEC monolayer with a polyclonal anti-VEGF antibody, indicating that the effect of shear stress was not due to background growth factors stimulation or to a paracrine or autocrine induction of VEGF. To investigate whether shear stress induction of Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by an increased association of Flk-1 with Shc, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against Shc followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-Flk-1. As shown in Fig.2 A, shear stress increased the association of Flk-1 and Shc in a rapid and transient manner with a time course parallel to that of tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1 shown in Fig. 1 A. As a control, VEGF treatment also induced the association of Flk-1 and Shc in BAECs (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, using anti-rabbit IgG as a negative control in the immunoblotting, the association of FlK-1 with Shc was not observed (data not shown). Neither tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1 nor its association with Shc was due to metabolites released from the shear stress-stimulated ECs, since these responses were not found in ECs incubated with the shearing media (data not shown). Binding of the cognate ligands induces the dimerization and thus the activation of various RTKs. To test the hypothesis that shear stress activates Flk-1 by causing its clustering, confluent monolayers of BAECs were kept static or subjected to a shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 followed by anti-Flk-1 immunostaining. Confocal microscopy revealed that Flk-1 was mainly distributed on the luminal side of BAECs (Fig. 3). Quantification of images from static and sheared samples showed that the application of shear stress for 1 min enhanced the clustering of Flk-1. This focal pattern of clustering peaked at 5 min and reduced to the level comparable to that in the static controls at 30 min after shearing. This time course is similar to those of Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Flk-1·Shc association. When ECs are exposed to shear stress, focal adhesion plaques move dynamically on the abluminal membrane (16Davies P.F. Robotewskyj A. Griem M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2031-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the αvβ3 integrin in focal adhesion sites is involved in the shear stress activation of ERK and JNK (15Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.-L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Shc in the integrin-mediated signal transduction in response to shear stress, αvβ3 was immunoprecipitated from BAEC lysates by LM609 mAb, and this was followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-Shc. As shown in Fig.4 A, Shc association with αvβ3 was not detectable in static BAECs. Application of a shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 rapidly augmented the formation of a complex of αvβ3·Shc, as demonstrated by their co-immunoprecipitation. This association was already detectable 10 min after the cells were exposed to shear stress, reached a peak level at 30 min, and sustained for the duration of this experiment (6 h). In two other separate experiments, the αvβ3·Shc association lasted for at least 18 h (data not shown). In contrast, neither αvβ3 integrin nor ERK was found to be associated with Shc in control experiments using anti-rat IgG or anti-ERK for the immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The αvβ3·Shc association during the endothelial attachment to fibrinogen is transient (Fig. 4 B), becoming undetectable by 2 h. Thus, the integrin-mediated signaling in response to shear stress differs from that caused by cell adhesion in that its association with Shc is sustained. It is possible that mechanotransduction causes the recruitment of Shc to various types of integrins in ECs. Thus, we also investigated whether shear stress increases the association of Shc with integrins containing the β1 or β5 subunit by immunoprecipitating the cell lysates with polyclonal anti-Shc followed by immunoblotting with anti-β1 mAb CD29 or polyclonal anti-β5. As shown in Fig.5, β1- or β5-containing integrins were not associated with Shc in the static cells. Exposure of BAEC monolayer to shear stress increased the association of Shc with β1 or β5 with a time course similar to that for αvβ3. Together, the data presented in Figs. 2, 4, and 5 demonstrate that Shc associates with both RTKs and integrins in ECs in response to shear stress. In contrast to the transient Shc·Flk-1 association, the Shc·integrin association is much more sustained. When cells are stimulated by growth factors, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc coincides with its recruitment to RTKs. To investigate whether Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to shear stress, the anti-Shc immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with PY20 mAb. As shown in Fig.6 A, shear stress caused a sustained increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, which lasted for at least 6 h after the exposure to shear stress. FAK regulates Grb2·Sos-Ras pathway in the EC response to shear stress, which was demonstrated by the association of FAK with Grb2 (15Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.-L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible engagement of Shc in the shear stress activation of the Grb2·Sos-Ras pathway, we examined whether Shc associates with Grb2 in the sheared BAECs. As shown in Fig.6 B, there was an increase in the amount of Grb2 co-immunoprecipitated with Shc in ECs subjected to shear stress for 1 min. This increased association of Grb2 with Shc was sustained. In a separate experiment, cell lysates immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Shc and immunoblotted with the polyclonal anti-Sos revealed that Shc was also associated with Sos in sheared cells (data not shown). The results in Fig. 6 demonstrate that shear stress induces a sustained interaction of integrins with Shc, which not only results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, but also the association of Shc with the Grb2·Sos complex. Shear stress activates mitogen activated protein kinases, including ERK and JNK (5Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 6Li Y.S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8069-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Through its association with Grb2·Sos, Shc can be upstream of these events. We constructed Shc-SH2 that functions as a negative mutant of Shc (28Gotoh N. Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Chida K. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2525-2533PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate its inhibitory effects on the shear stress activation of ERK, JNK, and on the TRE-driven luciferase reporter. Shc-SH2 was co-transfected with either Myc-ERK2 or HA-JNK1 into BAECs, and pcDNA3 parental plasmid was used as parallel controls. The transfected cells were either kept under static condition or subjected to a shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 for 10 min (for Myc-ERK2 assay) or 30 min (for HA-JNK1 assay) followed by immunocomplex kinase assays using MBP or GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein as the respective substrate. As shown in Fig. 7, shear stress activated Myc-ERK2 and HA-JNK1 in BAECs transfected with pcDNA3 by 2- and 3-fold, respectively. Co-transfection of Shc-SH2 drastically attenuated the shear stress activation of Myc-ERK2 and HA-JNK1. These results indicate that Shc is involved in the upstream signaling for the shear stress induction of ERK and JNK. BAECs were co-transfected with Shc-SH2 and the chimeric construct 4XTRE-Pl-Luc consisting of luciferase reporter driven by four copies of TRE linked to the rat prolactin minimum promoter. In parallel experiments, cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3 together with 4XTRE-Pl-Luc. A shear stress of 12 dynes/cm2 caused 33-fold induction of luciferase activities (relative to those in the static controls kept for 8 h); this shear stress induction of luciferase activity was drastically reduced in cells co-transfected with Shc-SH2 (Fig. 8 A). We also tested whether Shc-SH2 can attenuate shear stress induction of MCP1-Luc-540 by using a chimeric construct which contains luciferase under the control of the 540-base pair 5′ promoter of the MCP-1 g"

Display on filamentous phage in combination with selection forms a powerful tool for the identification of peptide- or protein-based drugs (1Winter G. Griffiths A.D. Hawkins R.E. Hoogenboom H.R.

Of these, antibodies are especially of interest, due to their capacity to recognize a variety of targets with high specificity and affinity. In particular, the use of partially or completely human antibodies, which elicit no or minimal immune response when administered to patients, is yielding an increasing list of FDA-approved protein-based drugs (3Holliger P.H.

Key to the success of the technology were two critical observations: (i) the expression of functional antibody fragments by secretion into the periplasm of Escherichia coli (8Better M. Chang C.P.

The natural primary (unselected) antibody repertoire within B cells contains a large array of antibodies that recognize a variety of antigens; this array can be cloned as a “naı̈ve” repertoire of rearranged genes, by harvesting the V-genes from the IgM mRNA of B cells of unimmunized human donors, isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes (4Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar), from bone marrow or tonsils (7Vaughan T.P. Williams A.W. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R.J.C.E. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat.

This procedure provides access to antibodies that have not yet encountered antigen, although the frequency of those genuine “germline” antibodies will depend heavily on the source of B cells (17Klein U. Kuppers R. Rajewsky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single naı̈ve library, if sufficiently large and diverse, can indeed be used to generate antibodies to a large panel of antigens, including self, non-immunogenic and relatively toxic antigens (4Marks J.D.

In a different approach, antibodies may be built artificially, by in vitroassembly of V-gene segments and D/J segments, yielding “synthetic” antibodies (5Hoogenboom H.R. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A major drawback of these procedures is that from the initial naı̈ve and synthetic libraries, only moderate affinity antibodies were isolated (4Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Over the last few years, more efficient techniques have been developed to build larger libraries of antibody fragments, using sophisticated in vivorecombination methods (6Griffiths A.D. Malmqvist M. Marks J.D. Bye J.M. Embleton M.J. McCafferty J. Baier M. Holliger K.P. Gorick B.D. Hughes J.N. Hoogenboom H.R. Winter G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) or brute force cloning procedures (7Vaughan T.P. Williams A.W. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R.J.C.E. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 19Sheets M.D. Amersdorfer P. Finnern R. Sargent P. Lindqvist E. Schier R. Hemingsen G. Wong C. Gerhart J.C. Marks J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Such large libraries have yielded a greater number of human antibodies per antigen tested, with on average much higher affinity (up to subnanomolar). However, technical restrictions on the size of libraries that may be obtained or handled in selection, the loss of library diversity upon library amplification, and the relatively long downstream analysis path of the selected antibodies, i.e.large scale affinity analysis, have limited the spread of these libraries as generic tools in antibody generation. We describe here the generation of a very large antibody library based on the display of Fab fragments on phage. The choice for the Fab format was based on the notion that the monomeric appearance of the Fab should permit the rapid screening of large numbers of clones on kinetics of binding (off-rate) with crude protein fractions. Most large libraries made to date use the single-chain format (scFv) for display on phage (7Vaughan T.P. Williams A.W. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R.J.C.E. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 19Sheets M.D. Amersdorfer P. Finnern R. Sargent P. Lindqvist E. Schier R. Hemingsen G. Wong C. Gerhart J.C. Marks J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), but these fragments have the tendency to form dimers and higher order multimers in a clone-dependent and relatively unpredictable way (20Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10281-10288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Holliger P. Prospero T. Winter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Multimeric antibody molecules bind more strongly to immobilized antigen than monomeric fragments because of their greater avidity, and therefore have higher “apparent” affinities (23Pack P. Muller K. Zahn R. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This explains why an accurate determination of the affinity is not easily possible with mixtures of mono- and multimeric scFv fragments. As a consequence, the affinity assay used for ranking individual clones (such as BIAcore analysis) often necessitates time-consuming purification to obtain the monomeric fraction of the selected antibody fragments (19Sheets M.D. Amersdorfer P. Finnern R. Sargent P. Lindqvist E. Schier R. Hemingsen G. Wong C. Gerhart J.C. Marks J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24Schier R. Bye J. Apell G. McCall A. Adams G.P. Malmqvist M. Weiner L.M. Marks J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). An additional argument for the choice of the Fab format is to avoid possible problems with avidity of the displayed antibody fragment on the phage itself. The tendency of Fabs to be expressed at lower levels than scFv fragments and the lack of multimerization will lead to a lower display frequency and lower fraction of avid phage. The effect of multimerization of scFv on phage with respect to the selection of fragments with very low affinities has indeed been observed previously (6Griffiths A.D. Malmqvist M. Marks J.D. Bye J.M. Embleton M.J. McCafferty J. Baier M. Holliger K.P. Gorick B.D. Hughes J.N. Hoogenboom H.R. Winter G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Therefore, compared with scFv libraries, selections with Fab phage may be more governed by affinity rather than avidity, even when performing selections by panning on immobilized antigen (24Schier R. Bye J. Apell G. McCall A. Adams G.P. Malmqvist M. Weiner L.M. Marks J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) or with soluble multivalent antigen (25de Haard H.J.W. Kazemier B. Koolen M.J.M. Nijholt L.J. Meloen R.H. van Gemen B. Hoogenboom H.R. Arends J.W. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 636-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This report describes the strategy for the construction of a very large antibody library. An efficient cloning method, in which restriction fragments instead of PCR products were used, made it possible to generate a repertoire with as many as 37 billion different Fab clones. The performance of the library was analyzed by the selection with an extended panel of antigens including three closely related glycoprotein hormones, yielding a diverse set of specific antibody fragments for each antigen. Without using sophisticated selection protocols, hormone-specific as well as cross-reactive Fabs were retrieved against the highly homologous glycohormones, demonstrating that the library is a rich source of antibody specificities. The affinities of the anti-glycohormone antibodies varied between 2.7 and 38 nm. Finally, the Fab format indeed permitted the rapid screening and a reliable ranking of individual clones on off-rate using crude antibody fractions. As source of lymphoid tissues, we used peripheral blood lymphocytes from 4 healthy donors and part of a tumor-free spleen removed from a patient with gastric carcinoma. B lymphocytes were isolated from 2 liters of blood on a Ficoll-Pacque gradient. For RNA isolation, the cell pellet was immediately dissolved in 50 ml of 8 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.1 m2-mercaptoethanol (26Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was sheared to completion by passing through a narrow syringe (1.2/0.5-mm gauge), and insoluble debris was removed by low speed centrifugation (15 min at 2,934 ×g at room temperature). RNA was pelleted by centrifugation through a CsCl block gradient (12 ml of supernatant on a layer of 3.5 ml of 5.7 m CsCl, 0.1 m EDTA; in total four tubes) during 20 h at 125,000 × g at 20 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). The yield of total RNA was approximately 600 μg. RNA was stored at −20 °C in ethanol. From the spleen, 2 g of tissue was used for homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer in 20 ml of 8 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. The total volume was increased to 80 ml with guanidinium thiocyanate buffer, and after passage through a narrow syringe for shearing and removal of debris, RNA was pelleted as described before, except for 15 h at 85,000 × g at 20 °C in a SW28.1 rotor (12 ml of supernatant on 3.5 ml of 5.7 m CsCl, 0.1 m EDTA in five SW28.1 tubes). From 2 g of tissue, 3 mg of total RNA was extracted. Random primed cDNA was prepared with 250 μg of PBL RNA, while in a separate reaction 300 μg of spleen RNA was used as template. RNA was heat-denatured for 5 min at 65 °C in the presence of 20 μg of random primer (Promega); subsequently, buffer and dithiothreitol were added according to the supplier's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.), as well as 250 μm dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 800 units of RNasin (40 units/μl; Promega), and 2,000 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units/μl; Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 500 μl. After 2 h at 42 °C, the incubation was stopped by a phenol/chloroform extraction; cDNA was precipitated and dissolved in 85 μl of water. Oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification of human heavy and light chain V-regions are described in Table I. IgM-derived heavy chain variable regions were obtained by a primary PCR with an IgM constant region primer. All primary PCRs were carried out with separate BACK primers and combined FOR primers, to maintain maximal diversity. The PCR products were reamplified with a combination of JHFOR primers, annealing to the 3′ end of VH, and Sfi-tagged VHBACK primers, annealing to the 5′ end, and subsequently cloned as VH fragments. The light chain V-genes of the κ and λ families were obtained by PCR with a set of CKFOR or CλFOR primer annealing to the 3′ end of the constant domain and BACK primers, priming at the 5′ end of the V-regions. The DNA segments were reamplified with primers tagged with restriction sites and cloned as VκCκ and VλCλ fragments.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for construction of the libraryA.

For the light chain families, 6 different VκCκ products and 11 VλCλ products (Cλ2 and Cλ7 primers combined in each reaction) were obtained. All products were purified from agarose gel with the QIAex-II extraction kit (Qiagen). As input for reamplification to introduce restriction sites, 100–200 ng of purified DNA fragment was used as template in a 100-μl reaction volume. The large amount of input, ensuring the maintenance of variability, was checked by analysis of 4 μl of the “unamplified” PCR mixture on agarose gel. For the construction of the primary heavy chain and the two primary light chain repertoires, the PCR products, appended with restriction sites, were gel-purified prior to digestion and the different VH, Vκ, and Vλ families combined into three groups. The VκCκ and VλCλ fragments were digested with ApaLI and AscI, and cloned into the phagemid vector pCES1 (Fig. 1). The VH fragments, 1.5 μg in total, were digested with SfiI and BstEII and ligated in a 100–200-μl reaction mixture with 9 units of T4-DNA ligase at room temperature to 4 μg, gel-purified vector pUC119-CES1 (similar to vector pCES1, but with the pIII gene deleted). The desalted ligation mixture for light or heavy chain pools was used for electroporation of the E. coli strain TG1, to create the one-chain libraries. The Fab library was obtained by cloning of VH fragments, digested from plasmid DNA prepared from the heavy chain repertoires, into the plasmid collection containing the light chain repertoires. Plasmid DNA, isolated from at least 3 × 109 bacteria of the VH library, was digested with SfiI and BstEII for cloning in the vector that already contained λ and κ light chain libraries. To retain clones with internal BstEII site in the Vλ (this site is relatively frequent in some λ germline V-segments (27Persic L. Roberts A. Wilton J. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Hoogenboom H.R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and also in the constant domain of one of the λ families), the cloning of VHCH1 in the λ light chain repertoire containing vector was also carried out using SfiI and NotI cloning sites, to create a less restriction-biased Vλ library. The rescue of phagemid particles with helper phage M13-KO7 was performed according to (4Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar) on a 10-liter scale, using representative numbers of bacteria from the library for inoculation, to ensure the presence of at least 10 bacteria from each clone in the start inoculum. For selections, 1013colony-forming units were used with antigens immobilized in immunotubes (Maxisorp tubes, Nunc) (4Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J.

The amount of the immobilized antigens tetanus toxoid and the hapten phenyl-oxazolone (conjugated to BSA in a ratio of 17 to 1) was reduced 10-fold during subsequent selection rounds, starting at 100 μg/ml at round 1. Capture with biotinylated antigen in solution was used for a 100-mer peptide encoding five copies of the tandem repeat of MUC1 (29Henderikx P. Kandilogiannaki M. Petrarca C. von Mensdorff-Pouilly S. Hilgers J.H. Krambovitis E. Arends J.W. Hoogenboom H.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4324-4332PubMed Google Scholar), or with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human luteinizing hormone (hLH), human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH) and its chimeric derivative (hFSH-CTP, containing the carboxyl-terminal peptide from the hCG β-subunit fused to the β-subunit of hFSH). Antigens were biotinylated at a ratio of 10–20 molecules of NHS-Biotin (Pierce) per molecule of antigen according to the supplier's recommendations. Unless stated otherwise, the antigens were used for selection at concentrations of 100, 30, and 10 nm during rounds 1, 2, and 3 respectively. For hFSH-CTP, 50, 15, and 10 nm was used, respectively; for MUC1 peptide, 500, 100, 20, and 5 nm was used. Soluble Fab was produced from individual clones as described before (4Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were tested in ELISA with directly coated antigen or indirectly captured biotinylated antigen via immobilized biotinylated BSA-streptavidin. Tetanus toxoid and phOx-BSA were coated at 10 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6, for 16 h at 4 °C. For coating of hCG and hFSH-CTP, a concentration of 4 μg/ml in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, was used. For capture of biotinylated antigens, biotinylated BSA was coated at 2 μg/ml in PBS during 1 h at 37 °C. After 3 washes with PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, plates were incubated during 1 h with streptavidin (10 μg/ml in PBS/0.5% gelatin) (30Matzuk M.M. Spangler M.M. Camel M. Suganuma N. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following washing as above, biotinylated antigen was added for an overnight incubation at 4 °C at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml for MUC-1 peptide, 3 μg/ml for hLH, and 0.6 μg/ml for hFSH (binding to hCG was tested with directly coated antigen). The plates were blocked during 30 min at room temperature with 2% (w/v) semi-skim milk powder (Marvel) in PBS. The culture supernatant was diluted 1- or 5-fold in 2% (w/v) Marvel/PBS and incubated 2 h; bound Fab was detected with anti-mycantibody 9E10 (5 μg/ml) recognizing the myc-peptide tag at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy Fd chain, and rabbit anti-mouse-HRP conjugate (Dako) (4Marks J.D.

Following the last incubation, staining was performed with tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2 as substrate and stopped by adding 0.5 volume of 2 nH2SO4; the optical density was measured at 450 nm.

The deduced amino acid sequence contains 779 amino acids, including a putative cGMP binding sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule and a catalytic domain that is 16–47% identical in amino acid sequence to those of other PDE families. Recombinant PDE10A transfected and expressed in COS-7 cells hydrolyzed cAMP and cGMP with K m values of 0.26 and 7.2 μm, respectively, and V max with cGMP was almost twice that with cAMP. Of the PDE inhibitors tested, dipyridamole was most effective, with IC50 values of 1.2 and 0.45 μm for inhibition of cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis, respectively. cGMP inhibited hydrolysis of cAMP, and cAMP inhibited cGMP hydrolysis with IC50 values of 14 and 0.39 μm, respectively. Thus, PDE10A exhibited properties of a cAMP PDE and a cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE. PDE10A transcripts were particularly abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions of brain and in thyroid and testis, and in much lower amounts in other tissues.

Cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP are well known as second messengers and regulate many functions in various tissues (1Kukovetz W.R. Holzmann S. Wurm A. Poch G. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch.

Many kinds of PDEs are involved in the metabolism of cyclic nucleotides. Based on their amino acid sequence homology, biochemical properties, and inhibitor profiles, seven PDE families have been recognized in mammalian tissues (5Beavo J.A. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase:Structure, Regulation and Drug Action. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar, 6Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). PDE1 is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, hydrolyzing both cAMP and cGMP. PDE2 is stimulated by cGMP and hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP. PDE3 is cGMP-inhibited. PDE4 is cAMP-specific and rolipram-sensitive. PDE5 is cGMP-specific. PDE6 is a photoreceptor cGMP PDE. PDE7 is cAMP-specific and rolipram-insensitive. Very recently, cDNAs encoding two kinds of novel PDEs were isolated from humans and mice (7Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S.

PDE7 and the two latter PDEs are insensitive to the nonspecific PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). cDNA cloning of these novel PDEs was done by an approach using bioinformatics. A search of data bases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was performed using parts of PDE sequences such as the catalytic domain. The approach was shown to be effective for the isolation of novel PDE cDNAs.Genome sequencing projects are progressing in many organisms, providing us information of a variety of pathways involved in the cyclic nucleotide metabolism necessary to maintain life. InCaenorhabditis elegans, which is a small soil nematode found in temperate regions, there are five pairs of autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes; that is, at least five distinct sequences show significant similarity with a catalytic domain of PDE5 based on the nucleotide sequence data base. Probably many PDE homologs still remain unidentified in humans, and they likely play distinct physiological roles. Characterization of these unidentified PDEs will be very important for understanding complex mechanisms in controlling cyclic nucleotide levels and for finding pharmacologically significant molecules.In this work, we report the cloning of the full-length cDNA encoding a novel human phosphodiesterase family, PDE10A, using bioinformatics. The cloned cDNA was transfected into COS-7 cells, and enzymatic properties of the recombinant protein were investigated. The tissue-specific expression patterns of PDE10A transcripts were examined. Furthermore, we also demonstrate chromosomal localization of the human PDE10A gene.DISCUSSIONA full-length cDNA, which was isolated by an approach using bioinformatics, encoded a novel PDE containing a catalytic domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion and a putative cGMP binding sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule. The primary structure of PDE10A was more analogous to those of cGMP-binding PDEs such as PDE2, PDE5, and PDE6s. A putative cGMP binding sequence containing the conserved amino acid residues among many cGMP-binding proteins (22McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L.

However, an incomplete cGMP binding sequence was also found (amino acid residues 65–203). It lacked some conserved amino acids (22McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L.

From the sequence analysis, PDE10A was categorized as a cGMP-binding PDE. The gene product encoded by the cDNA demonstrated the activity of not only cGMP but also cAMP hydrolysis when expressed in COS-7 cells. The affinity for cAMP was about 11-fold higher than that for cGMP. V max with cGMP was about twice as fast as that with cAMP. Interestingly, cAMP potently antagonized cGMP hydrolysis with IC50 value of 0.39 μm, whereas cAMP hydrolysis was inhibited by cGMP at high concentration (IC50 = 14 μm). In PDE3, which is known as a cGMP-inhibited cAMP PDE, cAMP hydrolysis is antagonized by cGMP at a low concentration (IC50 = 0.2 μm) (24Degerman E. Belfrage P. Newman A.H. Rice K.C. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5797-5807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PDE10A, the concentration of cAMP necessary to inhibit the activity of cGMP hydrolysis was as low as that of cGMP on PDE3 inhibition. These observations indicated that PDE10A is a novel cAMP and cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE.PDE10A lacked the phosphorylation site of cAMP- or cGMP-dependent kinase, which is found in PDE5A (23McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Thomas M.K.

In PDE10A, instead of the phosphorylation site by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (amino acid residues 158–160, 363–365, 504–506, and 650–652) were observed, suggesting regulation of PDE10A activity by protein kinase C. Although we investigated the cGMP binding activities in cytosolic extracts from transfected COS-7 cells, unexpectedly, cGMP binding activities were not found under the conditions described elsewhere (data not shown) (27Kotera J.

Further study will elucidate the regulation of PDE10A.A nonspecific PDE inhibitor, IBMX, showed moderate inhibition of PDE10A. The catalytic domain of PDE10A showed the highest sequence similarity with that of PDE5A (47%) and PDE2A (42%). PDE5 inhibitors (zaprinast, E4021, SCH51866, and dipyridamole) were more effective antagonists for PDE10A activity than were other PDE inhibitors. Despite the sequence similarity, a PDE2 inhibitor (EHNA) was not an inhibitor of PDE10A. Among PDE5 inhibitors, dipyridamole, which showed inhibition against PDE2 and PDE4 (28Miyahara M. Ito M. Itoh H. Shiraishi T. Isaka N. Konishi T. Nakano T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 284: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was the most effective against PDE10A. These findings are interesting and informative and could be useful in developing a PDE10A-specific inhibitor.In the testis, highly abundant short transcripts of 4.0 kb were observed in addition to 10-kb transcripts, which are found in several other tissues. Five putative polyadenylation sites were found in the 3′-noncoding region. The short transcripts in the testis were suspected to be transcripts truncated at these sites. The localization of PDE10A transcripts in the brain is of interest. Dopamine receptors D1 and D2 are expressed prominently in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions. Signals from D1 and D2 receptors are transmitted via cAMP: D1 stimulates the adenyl cyclase, and D2 inhibits the enzyme. PDE1B1 expressed in these regions is suggested to play important roles for regulating these signals by controlling cAMP levels (29Yan C. Bentley K. Sonnenburg W.K. Beavo J.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 973-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Polli J.W. Kincaid R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific expression of PDE10A transcripts in the same regions described above also suggest that PDE10A may be involved in controlling cAMP levels there. Because PDE10A is a cAMP PDE and cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE, cGMP hydrolysis could be regulated by intracellular cAMP levels in the cells where PDE10A is localized; that is, cAMP-mediated signals may control the function of cGMP. In the putamen and caudate nucleus, cAMP generated by dopaminergic stimulation possibly leads to an increase in cGMP, which likely plays a role in neuronal signal transduction. The precise localization of PDE10A and further analysis are needed to clarify this hypothesis.The human PDE10A gene, HSPDE10A1, was mapped to chromosome 6q26. The genome data base OMIM was searched for disease markers or genes on chromosome 6. Many loci have been identified in 6q26. One locus of interest, juvenile Parkinson's disease, has been identified in 6q25.2-q27 (31Jones A.C. Yamamura Y. Almasy L. Bohlega S. Elibol B. Hubble J. Kazuhara S. Uchida M. Yanagi T. Weeks D.E.

Juvenile parkinsonism is defined as particular parkinson manifestations including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor with onset before 40 years of age. Very recently, the gene responsible for autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism has been identified, and the gene product was named Parkin (32Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). PDE10A is expressed in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions that have dopamine receptors and are related to juvenile parkinsonism. Thus, the possibility of genetic linkage of the PDE10A gene with this disease is intriguing.In conclusion, we revealed the structure and tissue-specific expression patterns of the transcripts of a novel human PDE, PDE10A. Presently the physiological role of this enzyme remains unknown. Analysis of tissue distribution in detail such as in situ hybridization analysis and immunohistochemical approach will be informative in revealing a role of this enzyme. Pharmacological analysis using selective inhibitors for this enzyme will elucidate a new physiological function of cAMP or cGMP in specific tissues or cells. Cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP are well known as second messengers and regulate many functions in various tissues (1Kukovetz W.R. Holzmann S. Wurm A. Poch G. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1979; 310: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2Schram M. Selinger Z. Science. 1984; 225: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Ignarro L.J. Kadowits P.J.

Intracellular cAMP and cGMP concentrations are controlled via stimulation of adenyl and guanyl cyclases in response to extracellular signaling and their degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), 1The abbreviations used are: PDE(s), phosphodiesterase(s); IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; EST, expressed sequence tag(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EHNA, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine; kb, kilobase(s); FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization; ORF, open reading frame.1The abbreviations used are: PDE(s), phosphodiesterase(s); IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; EST, expressed sequence tag(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EHNA, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine; kb, kilobase(s); FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization; ORF, open reading frame.respectively. Many kinds of PDEs are involved in the metabolism of cyclic nucleotides. Based on their amino acid sequence homology, biochemical properties, and inhibitor profiles, seven PDE families have been recognized in mammalian tissues (5Beavo J.A. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase:Structure, Regulation and Drug Action. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar, 6Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). PDE1 is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, hydrolyzing both cAMP and cGMP. PDE2 is stimulated by cGMP and hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP. PDE3 is cGMP-inhibited. PDE4 is cAMP-specific and rolipram-sensitive. PDE5 is cGMP-specific. PDE6 is a photoreceptor cGMP PDE. PDE7 is cAMP-specific and rolipram-insensitive. Very recently, cDNAs encoding two kinds of novel PDEs were isolated from humans and mice (7Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S.

PDE7 and the two latter PDEs are insensitive to the nonspecific PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). cDNA cloning of these novel PDEs was done by an approach using bioinformatics. A search of data bases of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was performed using parts of PDE sequences such as the catalytic domain. The approach was shown to be effective for the isolation of novel PDE cDNAs. Genome sequencing projects are progressing in many organisms, providing us information of a variety of pathways involved in the cyclic nucleotide metabolism necessary to maintain life. InCaenorhabditis elegans, which is a small soil nematode found in temperate regions, there are five pairs of autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes; that is, at least five distinct sequences show significant similarity with a catalytic domain of PDE5 based on the nucleotide sequence data base. Probably many PDE homologs still remain unidentified in humans, and they likely play distinct physiological roles. Characterization of these unidentified PDEs will be very important for understanding complex mechanisms in controlling cyclic nucleotide levels and for finding pharmacologically significant molecules. In this work, we report the cloning of the full-length cDNA encoding a novel human phosphodiesterase family, PDE10A, using bioinformatics. The cloned cDNA was transfected into COS-7 cells, and enzymatic properties of the recombinant protein were investigated. The tissue-specific expression patterns of PDE10A transcripts were examined. Furthermore, we also demonstrate chromosomal localization of the human PDE10A gene. DISCUSSIONA full-length cDNA, which was isolated by an approach using bioinformatics, encoded a novel PDE containing a catalytic domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion and a putative cGMP binding sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule. The primary structure of PDE10A was more analogous to those of cGMP-binding PDEs such as PDE2, PDE5, and PDE6s. A putative cGMP binding sequence containing the conserved amino acid residues among many cGMP-binding proteins (22McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L.

However, an incomplete cGMP binding sequence was also found (amino acid residues 65–203). It lacked some conserved amino acids (22McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L.

From the sequence analysis, PDE10A was categorized as a cGMP-binding PDE. The gene product encoded by the cDNA demonstrated the activity of not only cGMP but also cAMP hydrolysis when expressed in COS-7 cells. The affinity for cAMP was about 11-fold higher than that for cGMP. V max with cGMP was about twice as fast as that with cAMP. Interestingly, cAMP potently antagonized cGMP hydrolysis with IC50 value of 0.39 μm, whereas cAMP hydrolysis was inhibited by cGMP at high concentration (IC50 = 14 μm). In PDE3, which is known as a cGMP-inhibited cAMP PDE, cAMP hydrolysis is antagonized by cGMP at a low concentration (IC50 = 0.2 μm) (24Degerman E. Belfrage P. Newman A.H. Rice K.C. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5797-5807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PDE10A, the concentration of cAMP necessary to inhibit the activity of cGMP hydrolysis was as low as that of cGMP on PDE3 inhibition. These observations indicated that PDE10A is a novel cAMP and cAMP-inhibited cGMP PDE.PDE10A lacked the phosphorylation site of cAMP- or cGMP-dependent kinase, which is found in PDE5A (23McAllister-Lucas L.M.

The nonfluorescent products were identified as theN δ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-l-ornithine derivatives (5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone) and a novel MG-arginine adduct having a tetrahydropyrimidine moiety (N δ-(4-carboxy-4,6-dimethyl-5,6-dihydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-2-yl)-l-ornithine).On the basis of the following chemical and spectroscopic evidence, the major fluorescent product, putatively identified asN δ-(5-methylimidazolon-2-yl)-l-ornithine (5-methylimidazolone), was found to be identical toN δ-(5-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine-2-yl)-l-ornithine (argpyrimidine): (i) the low and high resolution fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry gave a molecular ion peak atm/z of 297 (M+H) and a molecular formula of C10H25O6N4, respectively, which coincided with argpyrimidine; (ii) the1H NMR spectrum of this product indMe2SO showed a singlet at 2.10 ppm corresponding to six protons; (iii) the peak corresponding to the 5-methylimidazolone derivative was not detected by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with the mode of selected ion monitoring; (iv) incubation of 5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone, a putative precursor of 5-methylimidazolone, at 37 °C for 14 days scarcely generated 5-methylimidazolone.On the other hand, as an immunochemical approach to the detection of these MG adducts, we raised the monoclonal antibodies (mAb3C and mAb6B) directed to the MG-modified protein and found that they specifically recognized the major fluorescent product, argpyrimidine, as the dominant epitope. The immunohistochemical analysis of the kidneys from diabetic patients revealed the localization of argpyrimidine in intima and media of small artery walls. Furthermore, the accumulation of argpyrimidine was also observed in some arterial walls of the rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. These results suggest that argpyrimidine may contribute to the progression of not only long term diabetic complications, such as nephropathy and atherosclerosis, but also the tissue injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion. Methylglyoxal (MG), an endogenous metabolite that increases in diabetes and is a common intermediate in the Maillard reaction (glycation), reacts with proteins and forms advanced glycation end products. In the present study, we identify a novel MG-arginine adduct and also characterize the structure of a major fluorescent adduct. In addition, we describe the immunochemical study on the MG-arginine adducts using monoclonal antibody directed to MG-modified protein. Upon incubation ofN α-acetyl-l-arginine with MG at 37 °C, two nonfluorescent products and one fluorescent product were detected as the major products.

Nonenzymatic glycation (Maillard reaction) is a complex series of reactions between reducing sugars and amino groups of proteins, which leads to browning, fluorescence, and cross-linking of the proteins. The reaction is initiated with the reversible formation of a Schiff's base, which undergoes a rearrangement to form a relatively stable Amadori product. The Amadori product further undergoes a series of reactions through dicarbonyl intermediates to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; MG, methylglyoxal; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; CEL, N ε-carboxyethyllysine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; MG, methylglyoxal; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; CEL, N ε-carboxyethyllysine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody.(1Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the formation of AGEs in vivocontributes to the pathophysiologies associated with aging and the long term complications of diabetes (2Baynes J.W. Monnier V.M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 304: 1-410Google Scholar).A number of aldehydes and ketones, in addition to sugars, are known to form AGEs. Methylglyoxal (MG), among them, has recently received considerable attention as a mediator to form AGEs. MG is known to be formed nonenzymically by amine-catalyzed sugar fragmentation reactions (3Hayashi T. Mase S. Namiki M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 1959-1964Crossref Google Scholar, 4Hayashi T.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is also a product of the metabolism of acetol, an intermediate in the catabolism of both threonine (6Ray M. Ray S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5974-5977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ketone body acetone (7Reichard G.A. Skutches C.L. Hoeldtke R.D. Owen O.E. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 668-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study on the formation of AGEs in endothelial cells cultured under hyperglycemic conditions indicated that MG was the major precursor of AGEs (8Shinohara M. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 126ACrossref Google Scholar). Chaplen et al.(9Chaplen F.W.R. Fahl W.E. Cameron D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, increased levels of MG are also found in blood from diabetic patients and in the lens of streptozotosin-induced diabetic rats (10Phillips S.A. Mirrlees D. Thonalley P.J. Biochem.

It is also known that MG is the physiological substrate of the glyoxalase system, which catalyzes the conversion of MG tod-lactate via the intermediateS-d-lactoylgluthathione (13Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar).MG irreversibly modifies proteins under physiological conditions (14Lo T.W.C. Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-32305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions proceed even at physiological concentrations of MG (14Lo T.W.C. Westwood M.E.

Acta. 1968; 168: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). MG modification of protein may be closely associated with cellular toxicity. It has been shown that MG selectively inhibits mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in the cells (23Biswas S. Ray M. Misra S. Dutta D.P. Ray S. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In relation to this, MG has been shown to inactivate membrane ATPases and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway (24Halder J. Ray M. Ray S. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The high reactivity of MG with proteins and its relatively high concentration in the plasma (25Monnier V.M. Sell D.R. Miyata S. Nagaraj R.H. Finot P.A. Aeschbacher H.U. Hurrel R.F. Liardon R. The Maillard Reaction in Food Processing, Human Nutrition, and Physiology. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel1990: 393Google Scholar) suggest that MG represents a common intermediate in the formation of AGEs in vivo. This assumption may be supported by the fact that macrophages have a specific receptor for proteins modified by reaction with MG, as well as for glucose-derived AGEs (18Westwood M.E. MacLellan A.C. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32293-32298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that MG primarily reacts with arginine residues to formN δ-(5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-l-ornithine (5-methylimidazolone) andN δ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-l-ornithine (5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone) (26Westwood M.E. Thornalley P.J. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Shipanova et al.(27Shipanova I.N. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) have recently identified a novel MG-arginine adduct,N δ-(5-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine-2-yl)-l-ornithine (argpyrimidine), as a major fluorescent product, and the presence of this adduct in the human serum and cornea has also been demonstrated (28Shamsi F.A. Partal A. Sady C. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6928-6936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MG also reacts with lysine residues to generate an MG-derived lysine-lysine cross-link (imidazolysine) (29Nagaraj R.H. Shipanova I.N. Faust F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) andN ε-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) (30Ahmed M.U. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4889-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which accumulate with aging and its related diseases.Here, we report the chemical and immunochemical characterization of the MG modification of arginine. On the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence, we identify a novel MG-arginine adduct having the tetrahydropyrimidine structure and also demonstrate that the major fluorescent product, originally identified as 5methylimidazolone, is argpyrimidine. In addition, as an immunochemical approach to the detection of MG-arginine adducts in vivo, we raised the monoclonal antibodies and characterize their specificities. An attempt to detect antigenic materials in vivo was also made in the kidneys from diabetic patients and in the rat brain after ischemia/reperfusion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMG (40% aqueous solution), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (essentially fatty acid-free) andN α-acetyl-l-arginine were purchased from Sigma. MG was purified by distillation under reduced pressure, and the concentration of MG in stock solutions was determined by HPLC as 2-methylquinoxaline (31Corderio C. Freire A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An authentic sample of CEL was kindly provided by Dr. J. W. Baynes (University of South Carolina). 3-Deoxyglucosone was kindly provided by Dr. F. Hayase (Meiji University). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin was obtained from Pierce. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG fraction to mouse IgG was obtained from Organon Teknika Co. (Durham, NC).General ProcedureSeparation of MG-treatedN α-acetylarginine was carried out on a Jasco Gulliver HPLC with a Jasco MD-910 UV-visible photodiode array detector. Low and high resolution fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was measured with a JEOL JMS-700 (MStation) instrument. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AMX600 (600 MHz) instrument. Ultraviolet absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi U-Best-50 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-2000 spectrometer. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was measured with a Jasco PlatformII-LC instrument.Reaction of Nα-Acetyl-l-arginine with MGN α-Acetyl-l-arginine (100 mm) was incubated with MG (100 mm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 14 days, with adjustment of the pH to 7.4 with sodium hydroxide solution (5 m) as required. The reaction mixture was then lyophilized to dryness and extracted with ethanol. After evaporation of the ethanol under vacuum, the residual solid product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC.HPLC AnalysisSeparation was carried out in a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nomura Chemicals Co., Seto, Japan) by applying a linear gradient of 10–50% methanol in 50 mm acetic acid from 15 to 30 min after the isocratic condition (0.1% methanol in 50 mm acetic acid) for 15 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 230 nm. For preparative HPLC, the reaction mixture was applied to a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (8.0 × 250 mm), equilibrated in a solution of 15% methanol in 50 mmacetic acid, and eluted at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 215 nm.Amino Acid AnalysisBSA (1 mg/ml) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was treated with 100 mm MG at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were collected and washed with 200 μl of diethyl ether. The resultant pellets were dried and subjected to acid hydrolysis with 6n HCl at 105 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysate was concentrated and dissolved with 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.2). The amino acid analysis was performed with a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 data analyzing system.Monoclonal AntibodiesFemale BALB/c mice were immunized three times with the MG-treated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxantine/aminopterin/thymidine selection medium. Culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), employing pairs of wells of microtiter plates on which were absorbed MG-treated BSA and native BSA as antigen (1 μg of protein/well). After incubation of 50 μl of hybridoma supernatants, and with intervening washes with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween), the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG, followed by a substrate solution containing 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate. Hybridoma cells corresponding to supernatants that were positive on MG-modified BSA and negative on native BSA were then cloned by limiting dilution. After repeated screening, three clones were obtained. Among them, clones 3C and 6B showed the most distinctive recognition of MG-modified BSA.ELISADirect ELISAA coating antigen was prepared by incubating 1 mg of BSA with 10 mm aldehydic compounds in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 24 h at 37 °C. A 100-μl aliquot of the antigen solution containing 0.4 mg of protein was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The antigen solution was then removed, and the plate was washed with PBS-Tween. Each well was filled with 200 μl of 0.5% gelatin solution for 1 h at 37 °C. The primary antibody was then added to the wells at 100 μl/well of 1 μg/ml solution for 3 h at 37 °C. The plate was then washed once with PBS-Tween. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with PBS-Tween, 100 μl of a 5 × 103 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS-Tween was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. Enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed by adding 100 μl/well 1,2-phenylenediamine (0.5 mg/ml) in 0.1 mcitrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.003% H2O2. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 492 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader.Competitive ELISAFor characterization of the antibody, a competitor was incubated with the antibody for 20 h at 4 °C to yield competitor/antibody mixtures containing antibody at 1 μg/ml and variable concentrations of the competitor. A 100-μl aliquot of the competitor/antibody mixture was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with PBS-Tween, the second antibody was added, and the enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed as described previously. Results were expressed as the ratioB/Bo, where B = (absorbance in the presence of the competitor − background absorbance (no antibody)) and Bo = (absorbance in the absence of the competitor − background absorbance).Animal ExperimentsThe details of the operative method have been previously reported (32Urabe T. Hattori N. Nagamatsu H. Sawa Y. Mizuno Y. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 256-271Google Scholar). Animal experiments were carried out according to a protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee of Juntendo University. Adults male Wistar rats (SPF) weighing 250–300 g were used (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan). In anesthetized rats, the right middle cerebral artery was occluded at its origin by the insertion of a thin nylon surgical thread via the external and internal carotid arteries according to the method of Longa et al. (33Longa E.Z. Weinstein P.R. Carlson S. Cummins R. Stroke. 1989; 20: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6580) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After 3 h of right middle cerebral artery occlusion, the thread was removed to allow reperfusion. The body (rectal) temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad and lamp-heating. All rats exhibited neurogenic deficits characterized by severe left hemiparesis, more in the upper extremity, and right Horner's syndrome, and most of the rats died after 48 h due to severe brain edema. Five rats were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS each at 6 and 24 h after reperfusion.ImmunohistochemistryHuman KidneysFormalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded renal tissues derived from autopsy samples of diabetic and nondiabetic patients were prepared. The immunohistochemical localization of argpyrimidine in the tissues was examined by a labeled streptavidin biotin method using Maxitags immunoenzyme universal kit (Shandon Lipshaw, Pittsburgh, PA). In brief, the tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated in a series of increasing water concentrations in ethanol. The slides were then placed in a chamber containing 0.3% H2O2 solution in methanol for 20 min at room temperature to inhibit the endogenous peroxidase activity, followed by the blocking step for 15 min. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of anti-argpyrimidine mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb6B) for 2 h at room temperature. To perform immunoabsorption experiments, the antibody was preincubated with and without free N-acetylargpyrimidine (final concentration, 25 μm) overnight at 4 °C before application to the tissue section as described above. After the reaction with primary antibody, the slides were washed with water and PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at room temperature, followed by another wash. In the next step, the slides were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with water. The color reaction was carried out by incubating the slides with freshly prepared 3,3′-diaminobenzidine reagent. After stopping the reaction by washing the slides with water, the nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin for 20 s.Rat Brain after Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Followed by ReperfusionThe brains were removed and then postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The paraffin-embedded brains were cut coronary at a thickness of 5 mm, deparaffinized with xylene, and dehydrated with 100% ethanol. Immunostaining was performed by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method as previously reported (32Urabe T. Hattori N. Nagamatsu H. Sawa Y. Mizuno Y. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 256-271Google Scholar, 34Yoritaka A. Hattori N. Uchida K. Tanaka M. Stadtman E.R. Mizuno Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). After blocking endogenous peroxidase activities by treatment with 3% H2O2 in methanol, the sections were incubated with 10% normal goat serum in 0.01 m PBS containing 2% BSA for 10 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with the monoclonal antibody (mAb6B) overnight at 4 °C. After being rinsed in 0.01 m PBS, the sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution; Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 60 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with ABC (1:100 dilution; Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. After rinsing, sections were finally incubated with 0.02% 3,3-diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H2O2 in distilled water for 7–10 min. To confirm the specificity of immunostaining, competition experiments were performed with the mAb6B that was preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C with an excess of argpyrimidine. Control sections were treated in the same manner with omission of the primary antibodies or with nonimmune rabbit or mouse IgG as a negative control.RESULTSCharacterization of Major Nonfluorescent and Fluorescent MG-Arginine AdductsThe selectivity of the binding of MG to arginine residues was assessed by changes in the amino acid composition of MG-treated proteins. When BSA (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 100 mm MG for 24 h at 37 °C, about 78% of the arginine and 27% of lysine residues were lost, and no significant change in other amino acids was observed. The data suggested that the arginine residues of proteins represented primary targets for reaction with MG. Hence, to determine the structure of the MG-arginine adduct generated in the protein, the reaction of MG withN α-acetylarginine was carried out. Upon incubation of N α-acetylarginine with MG for 14 days at 37 °C, two nonfluorescent products (a andb) and one fluorescent product (c) were detected (Fig. 1). After purification, they were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, FAB-MS, and LC-MS along with N α-acetylarginine.Nonfluorescent ProductsThe LC-MS analysis of the peaks (product b) eluted at 22–24 min exhibited the same molecular weight of 361 (M+H) (data not shown). After purification, the product was characterized by FAB-MS and 1H and13C NMR. The FAB-MS on the glycerol matrix showed a molecular ion at m/z of 361 (M+H) (Fig.2). High resolution FAB-MS in the positive ion mode showed a molecular weight of 361.1729 (S.E., +1.6 ppm), that corresponded to the molecular formula of C14H25O7N4. The1H NMR spectrum exhibited the following signals: δH (D2O): 1.48 (g, 3H, s), 1.51 (g′,3H, s), 1.53 (f, 3H, s), 1.57 (f′,3H, s), 1.62 (d, 1H, m), 1.68 (d, 1H, m), 1.83 (c, 2H, m), 1.98 (a, 3H, s), 3.24 (e, 2H, t, Jd, e = 6.8 Hz), 3.75 (h, 1H, s), 3.94 (h′, 1H, s), 4.22 (b, 1H, m). The13C NMR spectrum showed the following signals; δC (D2O): 22.5 (C-a), 22.6 (C-f), 25.2 (C-d), 25.4 (C-g), 29.0 (C-c), 41.1 (C-e), 54.4 (C-b), 58.4 (C-l), 63.0 (C-l′), 72.5 (C-h′), 75.4 (C-h), 80.2 (C-m), 81.8 (C-m′), 151.6 (C-k), 174.8 (C-i), 177.1 (C-n′, COOH), 178.0 (C-j, COOH), 178.7 (C-n, COOH). Compared with the1H and 13C NMR spectra betweenN α-acetylarginine and the product, the following signals were assigned for the presence of nativeN α-acetylarginine structure in the product; δH 1.98 (a), 4.22 (b), 1.83 (c), 1.62 (d), 1.68 (d), 3.24 (e); δC 22.5 (C-a), 54.4 (C-b), 29.0 (C-c), 25.2 (C-d), 41.1 (C-e), 174.8 (C-i), 178.0 (C-j, COOH), 151.6 (C-k). The 1H and13C NMR spectra of the product showed the presence of one methine (h or h′). The 13C NMR spectrum showed the presence of two quaternary carbons linked with the guanidino group (C-l and C-m) and one carboxylic acid carbon (C-n or C-n′). It was suggested that the product had isomers, because C-m was an asymmetric carbon. Each signal of two methyl (f and g) and methine (h) showed two peaks by the effects of a chiral center. The methyl protons (f or f′) was correlated with C-h (or C-h′), C-l (or C-l′) and C-n (or C-n′) in the1H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectrum (Fig. 3). The two-dimensional spectra also showed the correlation of another methyl protons (g or g′) and C-m (or C-m′), and of methine (h or h′) and C-f (or C-f′), C-g (or C-g′), C-l (or C-l′), and C-m (or C-m′). Six signals of carbon (C-f, C-g, C-h, C-l, C-m, and C-n) seemed to have originated from two molecules of MG at the reaction with the guanidino group inN α-acetylarginine. Based on these characteristics, it was determined that the purified product was a novel tetrahydropyrimidine-type MG-arginine adduct,N δ-(4-carboxy-4,6-dimethyl-5,6-dihydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-2-yl)-l-ornithine (Fig. 3). The product was generated in the yield of 16.0% whenN α-acetylarginine was incubated with MG for 14 days at 37 °C. It is also notable that a similar tetrahydropyrimidine derivative was also isolated from the reaction mixture of N α-benzoylarginine with MG (data not shown).Figure 2FAB-MS spectrum of productb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Assignment of spectroscopic data from1H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectrum experiments to structure elements of productb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)All of the peaks (product a) eluted at 13–15 min in Fig.1 A showed an absorption maximum at 220 nm and a molecular weight of 271 upon LC-MS analysis, suggesting that they were a mix"
https://openalex.org/W2059501883,"The human premature aging disorder Werner syndrome (WS) is associated with a large number of symptoms displayed in normal aging. The WRN gene product, a DNA helicase, has been previously shown to unwind short DNA duplexes (≤53 base pairs) in a reaction stimulated by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. We have studied the helicase activity of purified WRN protein on a variety of DNA duplex substrates to characterize the unwinding properties of the enzyme in greater detail. WRN helicase can catalyze unwinding of long duplex DNA substrates up to 849 base pairs in a reaction dependent on human replication protein A (hRPA). Escherichia coli SSB and bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein (gp32) completely failed to stimulate WRN helicase to unwind long DNA duplexes indicating a specific functional interaction between WRN and hRPA. So far, there have been no reports of any physical interactions between WRN helicase and other proteins. In support of the functional interaction, we demonstrate a direct interaction between WRN and hRPA by coimmunoprecipitation of purified proteins. The physical and functional interaction between WRN and hRPA suggests that the two proteins may function together in vivo in a pathway of DNA metabolism such as replication, recombination, or repair.

Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1978; 14: 5-39PubMed Google Scholar). Prevalent disorders of WS, including osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus (type II), cataracts, wrinkled skin, and gray hair, develop in early adulthood. In addition, cancers, particularly sarcomas, have been observed in these patients with increased frequency. Most patients afflicted with WS die before age 50. Somatic cells of WS patients display a mutator phenotype characterized by extensive chromosomal rearrangements (2Salk D. Au K. Hoehn H. Martin G.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1981; 30: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and deletions (3Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat R.J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). WS cells exhibit a reduced replicative life span (4Martin G.M. Sprague C.A. Epstein C.J. Lab.

Martin G.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1992; 202: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and a reduced frequency of initiation sites (7Takeuchi F. Hanaoka F. Goto M. Akaoka I. Hori T. Yamada M.

Shmookler R.R. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) which may contribute to genomic instability. A possible defect in recombination is supported by the demonstration that WRNhomologs in yeast sgs1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (10Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol.

Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar) all negatively regulate recombination. Notably, the human WRNgene can suppress the increased homologous and illegitimate recombination in sgs1 (15Yamagata K. Kato J. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8733-8738Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Some evidence suggests a role for the WRN protein in DNA repair. This notion is supported by a recent report that WS cells are hypersensitive to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (6Poot M. Hoehn H. Runger T.M. Martin G.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1992; 202: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Gray M.D. Wang L. Youssoufian H. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) which introduces bulky base damage, as well as 8-hydroxyguanine and strand breaks (18Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 42-43Google Scholar). However, WS cells do not exhibit a hypersensitivity to other DNA-damaging agents suggesting that a repair deficiency in WS is subtle and perhaps not the primary defect in the disease. This laboratory using the gene-specific and strand-specific repair assays reported a fine structure defect in WS lymphoblasts (19Webb D.K. Evans M.K. Bohr V.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Some WS cells also exhibit reduced telomere repair (20Kruk P.A. Rampino N.J. Bohr V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA metabolic defects, evidence from this laboratory suggests that WS cells are partially defective in transcription. 2Balajee, A. S., Machwe, A., May, A., Gray, M.

M., Nehlin, J. O., Brosh, R. M., Jr., Orren, D. K., and Bohr, V. A., Mol. Biol. Cell, in press. Further studies will be required to test hypotheses directly implicating WRN protein in specific DNA metabolic pathways. The gene defective in WS, designated WRN, encodes a protein of 1432 amino acids with the seven conserved motifs found in a class of enzymes known as helicases (21Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). By sequence alignment, theWRN gene product belongs to the RecQ superfamily of DNA helicases that includes Escherichia coli RecQ, S. cerevisiae Sgs1p, S. pombe rqh1p, and two human proteins, BLM (defective in Bloom syndrome) and RecQL. The WRN protein has been shown to be a DNA-stimulated ATPase and a helicase (22Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 23Suzuki N. Shimamoto A. Imamura O. Kuromitsu J. Kitao S. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), catalyzing strand displacement of short oligonucleotides (≤53 bp) with a 3′ to 5′ polarity (22Gray M.D. Shen J.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition to the helicase domains, the protein sequence of WRN contains a region of similarity to the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I and RNase D (25Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and has been shown to possess a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity (26Huang S. Li B.

Aside from these basic biochemical activities, molecular details of the interactions of WRN protein with other proteins and biological DNA substrates remain to be well defined. The molecular deficiencies involved in the clinical phenotype of WS presumably reflect an impaired function of the WRN protein in a pathway of nucleic acid metabolism. In this study, we have investigated a possible interaction between WRN protein and hRPA. hRPA, composed of three subunits 70, 32, and 14 kDa, was originally isolated as a factor required for simian virus (SV40) DNA replication in vitro (29Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). hRPA binds tightly to ssDNA and only weakly to dsDNA or RNA. hRPA interacts specifically with SV40 large T antigen (a 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase) and DNA polymerase α (30Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von, W. D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in viral replication, hRPA is required for replication of chromosomal DNA. hRPA has also been directly implicated in the following three steps of nucleotide excision repair: damage recognition (31He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), excision (32Matsunaga T. Park C.H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and gap-filling DNA synthesis (33Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that hRPA plays a role in long patch DNA base excision repair (36DeMott M.S. Zigman S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27492-27498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RPA is proposed to play a role in recombination by stimulating strand exchange proteins from S. cerevisiae (37Heyer W.D. Rao M.R. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2321-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and humans (38Moore S.P. Erdile L. Kelly T. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9067-9071Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that hRPA is a key player in DNA metabolism, modulating these processes by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. As shown previously by Shen et al. (24Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the helicase activity of WRN protein on a 42-bp partial duplex is stimulated by several SSBs. In their experiments, the helicase activity of WRN protein was stimulated better by hRPA than either ESSB or gp32. We have further examined the WRN-hRPA connection by characterizing the effect of SSBs on WRN helicase activity using DNA substrates of various lengths. ESSB and gp32 completely failed to stimulate WRN helicase activity on long DNA duplexes. In contrast, hRPA was required to support WRN helicase activity on long DNA duplexes indicating a functional interaction between WRN and hRPA. This functional interaction was further substantiated by the demonstration of a physical interaction between hRPA and WRN. This interaction, the first to be described for WRN protein, is likely to play a critical role in a pathway of DNA metabolism defective in WS. A recombinant hexa-histidine-tagged WRN protein was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by Ni2+ chromatography as described previously (22Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 3D. K. Orren, R. M. Brosh, Jr., J. O. Nehlin, A. Machwe, M. D. Gray, and V. A. Bohr, submitted for publication. All steps of purification were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, insect cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (150 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and chymostatin)) and incubated for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the clarified lysate was bound in batch for 1 h to nickel-agarose resin (Qiagen), pre-equilibrated in Lysis Buffer. The resin/lysate slurry was transferred to a column, and unbound material was allowed to flow through. The column was sequentially washed with 20 column volumes of Wash Buffer (150 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mmLiCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture), 10 column volumes of Wash Buffer 2 (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture), 10 column volumes of Wash Buffer 3 (Wash Buffer 2 plus 10 mm imidazole), and 20 column volumes of Wash Buffer 4 (Wash Buffer 2 plus 25 mm imidazole) to remove nonspecifically bound protein. WRN protein was eluted from nickel-agarose resin using Elution Buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mmNaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF). The solubility of WRN protein was maintained by immediate addition of BSA to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Purified recombinant WRN protein (1.5 μg) migrated as a single Coomassie-stained band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1 A). Protein from cells infected with baculovirus containing WRN-K577M, a point mutant in motif I of the conserved ATPase domain of WRN, was purified in an identical manner. WRN protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay using BSA as a standard. hRPA containing all three subunits (RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14) was purified as described previously (39Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ESSB was purchased from Promega. T4 gp32 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Restriction endonuclease HaeIII, calf intestinal phosphatase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs. BSA type V was from ICN Biochemicals. M13mp18 ssDNA was from New England Biolabs. The 28-mer oligonucleotide was from Life Technologies, Inc. M13mp18 RFI was prepared as described previously (40Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(dT) and ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Yeast tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. The 69, 257, and 849-bp M13mp18 partial duplex substrates were constructed as described previously (41Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The gel-purified duplex DNA fragments of the appropriate sizes from the HaeIII digest of M13mp18 RF were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove 5′-phosphates and subsequently labeled at their 5′ ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The complementary fragments were then annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA circle. The 28-bp M13mp18 partial duplex substrate was constructed with a 28-mer complementary to positions 6296 to 6323 in M13mp18. The 28-mer was labeled at its 5′ end as described above and annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA circle. Partial duplex DNA substrates were purified by gel filtration column chromatography using Bio-Gel A-5m resin (Bio-Rad). The purified 849-bp partial duplex substrate contained unannealed complementary radiolabeled oligonucleotide that coeluted in the void volume. Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmATP, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA and the indicated amounts of WRN helicase, ESSB and/or hRPA. Yeast tRNA was included in helicase reactions to inhibit nuclease activity present in preparations of WRN protein. Typically, less than 1% of the helicase substrate was susceptible to nuclease in the presence of tRNA at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The concentration of the 28-, 69-, 257-, and 849-bp partial duplex helicase substrates in the reaction mixture was approximately 2 μm (nucleotide phosphate). Reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN protein and incubated at 24 °C for the indicated times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol. The products of helicase reactions with the 28-, 69-, 257-, and 849-bp partial duplex substrates were resolved on 12, 8, 6, and 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, respectively. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager or film autoradiography and quantitated using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the following formula: % displacement = 100 × P/(S +P). P is the product volume, and S is the substrate volume. The values for P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured controls, respectively. ATPase assay reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, M13mp18 ssDNA (30 μm nucleotide phosphate), 0.8 mm[3H]ATP (42 cpm/pmol), 107 nm WRN protein, and the indicated amounts of hRPA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN protein and incubated at 24 °C. Samples (5 μl) were removed at 1- or 2-min intervals and evaluated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (42Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less than 20% of the substrate ATP was consumed in the reaction over the entire time course of the experiment. Affinity beads coated with WRN antibody were used to immunoprecipitate WRN-hRPA complexes. scFvs against WRN have been selected from a phage display library. 4P. Ravn, unpublished data. Two different WRN monoclonal scFvs were coated on tosyl-activated magnetic beads (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the tosyl-activated beads were washed twice in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with 500 μl of purified scFv (200 μg of scFv, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2)) for 24 h at 24 °C. Beads were washed twice in buffer D (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.1% BSA) and incubated in buffer E (200 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 0.1% BSA) for 24 h at 24 °C. Beads were stored at 4 °C after washing in buffer D. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 μg of purified hRPA was incubated with or without 1 μg of purified WRN in 200 μl of helicase reaction buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2) containing 2 mm ATP and 5 μg/ml BSA at 4 °C for 90 min. Approximately 3.3 × 106 WRN antibody-coated affinity beads in 20 μl of helicase buffer were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were isolated and washed five times in 400 μl of helicase buffer containing 150 mmNaCl and 0.1% BSA. Immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 2 min. The samples were run on 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using the NOVEX system. hRPA was detected using a monoclonal mouse IgG against hRPA (Calbiochem) and goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). WRN was detected using a goat polyclonal IgG against WRN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Both WRN and hRPA were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant WRN protein was purified using nickel-agarose as described under “Materials and Methods.” The inclusion of an extensive wash with buffer containing low imidazole concentrations (10–25 mm) effectively removes a number of residual contaminant proteins from the final WRN protein preparation. Recombinant WRN protein migrated as a single Coomassie-staining band of the predicted size (∼163 kDa) on a 8–16% polyacrylamide gel run in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1 A). Purified WRN protein was judged to be pure of DNA by analysis using SYBR Green Stain (FMC Bioproducts). To ascertain the enzymatic purity of the WRN protein, ATPase and helicase assays were conducted on the wild-type and mutant WRN-K577M proteins purified in an identical manner. In the WRN-K577M mutant protein, the invariant lysine residue of the conserved motif I (Walker A ATPase site) of DNA helicases has been replaced with a methionine (22Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). On a short 28-bp partial duplex DNA substrate, wild-type WRN protein unwound approximately 80% of the substrate molecules in 60 min (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), whereas no unwinding of the 28-bp partial duplex by WRN-K577M was detected (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). We also examined the ATPase activity of the purified wild-type and mutant WRN proteins (Fig. 1 C). The k cat of wild-type WRN protein for ATP hydrolysis using M13mp18 as the ssDNA effector was 58.4 ± 17 min−1. Importantly, the WRN-K577M mutant protein, purified using the same method as the wild-type WRN protein, exhibited no ATP hydrolysis. Thus WRN protein is devoid of contaminating helicase and ATPase activities and suitable for use in these studies. The k cat value of 58.4 min−1 for WRN-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis using M13mp18 ssDNA as the DNA effector obtained in these studies is dramatically different from the previously reported k cat value for WRN-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis of approximately 1,000,000 min−1 using calf thymus DNA as the effector in the ATPase reaction (23Suzuki N. Shimamoto A. Imamura O. Kuromitsu J. Kitao S. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have determined k cat values for WRN ATPase activity using a variety of ssDNA effectors that are all in the range of 50–200 min−1 (TableI).3 We cannot explain the discrepancy between our data and the previously published data. To our knowledge, a k cat value of 1,000,000 min−1 is far greater than any previously reported value for a DNA helicase, whereas a k cat of 58 min−1 is in the same range as values reported for a number of DNA helicases (for review, see Matson et al. (43Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar)).Table IThe effect of hRPA on the kcat for ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by WRNhRPAssDNA effectorM13mp18Poly(dT)aThe concentration of WRN in each reaction was 107 nm., bThe approximate length of poly(dT) was 263 bases.nmmin−1058.4 ± 17150 ± 193260.9 ± 21151 ± 346469.7 ± 20134 ± 3612862.0 ± 22126 ± 2825673.3 ± 22146 ± 27a The concentration of WRN in each reaction was 107 nm.b The approximate length of poly(dT) was 263 bases. Open table in a new tab An important property of DNA helicases is their ability to unwind DNA duplexes of various lengths. A highly processive helicase is required in the process of replication where long stretches of base pairs must be unwound in an efficient manner. In contrast, a helicase capable of unwinding short DNA duplexes could serve in short patch DNA repair. By using a variety of DNA substrates, biochemical studies of purified helicases in vitro have demonstrated that each DNA unwinding enzyme exhibits its own characteristic dependence of unwinding on DNA duplex length (43Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To characterize the effect of duplex length on the unwinding activity of the WRN helicase, we tested partial duplex substrates of varying lengths in a strand displacement assay. WRN helicase alone readily catalyzed 80% unwinding in 60 min on a short partial duplex of 28 bp (Fig. 1 B). Thus WRN helicase catalyzes unwinding of very short DNA duplexes confirming previous reports (22Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 23Suzuki N. Shimamoto A. Imamura O. Kuromitsu J. Kitao S. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 24Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We subsequently analyzed WRN helicase activity on longer DNA duplex substrates in the presence or absence of SSB. WRN-catalyzed unwinding of a 69-bp partial duplex required an SSB (Fig.2 A). WRN protein (184 nm) alone failed to catalyze detectable unwinding of the 69-bp partial duplex DNA substrate. In control reactions, hRPA (384 nm, heterotrimer) or ESSB (1456 nm, homotetramer) alone did not denature the 69-bp partial duplex DNA substrate. Either ESSB or hRPA could stimulate WRN helicase to unwind the 69-bp partial duplex. However, WRN helicase activity on the 69-bp partial duplex is stimulated much more efficiently by hRPA than ESSB. In the hRPA-supported reaction, approximately 95% of the 69-bp partial duplex is unwound at a concentration of 96 nm hRPA heterotrimer (Fig. 2 B). In the WRN helicase reaction containing ESSB, a maximum of 20% unwinding of the 69-bp partial duplex is achieved at a concentration of 1092 nm ESSB homotetramer. Thus a 10-fold higher molar concentration of ESSB compared with hRPA only modestly supports WRN helicase unwinding of the 69-bp duplex, approximately one-fifth the level observed in the hRPA-supported reaction. SSB may stimulate helicase activity by simply coating the ssDNA generated during the unwinding reaction, thereby preventing reannealing of the two displaced strands. To gain insight into the mechanism of stimulation of helicase activity by SSB, strand displacement was expressed as a function of the ratio (R) of SSB-binding units per DNA-binding site (Fig. 2 C). This analysis takes into account the fact that one ESSB homotetramer binds 35 nt (44Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and one hRPA heterotrimer binds 30 nt (29Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). A comparison of the ESSB and hRPA profiles using the 69-bp partial duplex substrate shows that at a concentration of hRPA which coats the ssDNA molecules in the helicase reaction (96 nm heterotrimer), 95% of the 69-mers are released by WRN helicase. In contrast, at an ssDNA coating concentration of ESSB (91 nm homotetramer), only 6% of the 69-mers are released. These results are in good agreement"

Given its plasma membrane localization, extracellular matrix-degrading activity, and expression by breast cancer cells, this protease may be involved in multiple aspects of breast tumor progression, including cancer invasion. In breast cancer cells, matriptase was detected mainly as an uncomplexed form; however, low levels of matriptase were detected in complexes. In striking contrast, only the complexed matriptase was detected in human milk. The complexed matriptase has now been purified. Amino acid sequences obtained from the matriptase-associated proteins reveal that they are fragments of a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that was previously reported to be an inhibitor of the hepatocyte growth factor activator. In addition, matriptase and its complexes were detected in milk-derived, SV40 T-antigen-immortalized mammary luminal epithelial cell lines, but not in human foreskin fibroblasts or in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. These results suggest that the milk-derived matriptase complexes are likely to be produced by the epithelial components of the lactating mammary gland in vivo and that the activity and function of matriptase may be differentially regulated by its cognate inhibitor, comparing breast cancer with the lactating mammary gland.

Matriptase is a trypsin-like serine protease with two regulatory modules: two tandem repeats of the complement subcomponent C1r/s domain and four tandem repeats of the low density lipoprotein receptor domain (1Lin C.-Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Matriptase was initially identified from T-47D human breast cancer cells as a major gelatinolytic activity on a gelatin zymogram, with a migration rate between those of gelatinase A (72 kDa; MMP-2) and gelatinase B (92 kDa; MMP-9) (2Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar); it has been proposed to play a role in breast cancer invasion (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The primary cleavage specificity of matriptase was identified to be arginine and lysine residues, similar to the majority of serine proteases, including trypsin and plasmin. In addition, matriptase, as does trypsin, exhibits broad spectrum cleavage activity, and such activity is likely to contribute to its gelatinolytic activity on a gelatin zymogram. HAI-1 (hepatocyte growth factor activatorinhibitor-1) (4Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that is able to inhibit the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 1The abbreviations used are: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.activator, a blood coagulation factor XII-like serine protease (5Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mature form of this protease inhibitor has 478 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 53,319 Da. A putative transmembrane domain is located at its carboxyl terminus. HAI-1 contains two Kunitz domains (domain I spans residues 246–306, and domain II spans residues 371–431) separated by a low density lipoprotein receptor domain (residues 315–360). The presumed P1 residue of the active-site cleft is likely to be arginine 260 in Kunitz domain I and lysine 385 in domain II by alignment with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (aprotinin) and with other Kunitz-type inhibitors (6Girard T.J.

Biol. 1984; 180: 301-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Thus, HAI-1 has specificity against trypsin-type proteases. Although the HGF activator is exclusively expressed by liver cells, HAI-1 was originally purified from the conditioned medium of carcinoma cells as a 40-kDa fragment doublet, rather than the proposed mature, membrane-bound 53-kDa form (4Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The protein inhibitors of serine proteases can be classified into at least 10 families, according to various schemes (9Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). Among them, serpins such as maspin (10Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E.A. Dias L. Hendrix M.J. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and Kunitz-type inhibitors such as urinary trypsin inhibitor (11Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Takeuchi K. Itoh M. Fujie M. Saitoh M. Terao T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 844-849PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously implicated in suppression of cancer invasion. The Kunitz-type inhibitors form very tight, but reversible complexes with their target serine proteases. The reactive sites of these inhibitors are rigid and can simulate optimal protease substrates (12Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The interaction between a serine protease and a Kunitz-type inhibitor depends on complementary large surface areas of contact between the protease and inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the recovered Kunitz-type inhibitor from protease complexes can always be reconstituted. The Kunitz-type inhibitors may be cleaved by cognate proteases, but such cleavage is not essential for their inhibitory activity. In this study, to begin to investigate the role of matriptase under physiological conditions such as differentiation and lactation, we studied its expression in human milk. We found that milk-derived matriptase strongly interacts with fragments of HAI-1 to form complexes. Four milk-derived, immortalized mammary luminal epithelial cell lines (MTSV-1.1B, MTSV-1.7, MRSV-4.1, and MRSV-4.2) were a gift from Dr. J. Taylor-Papadimitriou (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) (13Bartek J. Bartkova J. Kyprianou N. Lalani E.N. Staskova Z. Shearer M. Chang S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and were maintained in modified Iscove's minimal essential medium (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, 5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and antibiotics. Human foreskin fibroblasts and the fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 (from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in modified Iscove's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To collect cell-conditioned medium, monolayers of these cells at confluency were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were cultured for 2 days in the absence of the serum in modified Iscove's minimal essential medium supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium (Biofluids, Inc.). To isolate matriptase-related proteases, 1.5 liters of frozen human milk from the Georgetown University Medical Center Milk Bank were thawed and centrifuged to remove the milk fat and insoluble debris. Ammonium sulfate powder was added to the milk with continuous mixing to 40% saturation and allowed to precipitate in a cold room for at least 2 h. Protein precipitates were obtained by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 20 min. The pellets were saved, and the supernatant was further precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate powder to 60% saturation. The protein pellets were dissolved in water and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for DEAE chromatography or against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, for CM chromatography. Insoluble debris was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was divided into five batches; each batch was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (2.5 × 20 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. Bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1m NaCl in DEAE equilibration buffer with a total volume of 500 ml. Fractions (14 ml) were collected and assessed by immunoblotting using mAb 21-9. To perform CM chromatography, the 95-kDa fraction from DEAE chromatography or the precipitate derived directly from ammonium sulfate precipitation was dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Insoluble debris was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a CM-Sepharose FF column (2.5 × 20 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. Bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with a total volume of 500 ml. Fractions (14 ml) were assessed by immunoblotting using mAb 21-9. Preparation of an immunoaffinity column by coupling mAb 21-9 to Sepharose 4B (5 mg of IgG/ml of beads) was performed using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as described previously (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Partially purified 95-kDa matriptase complex from DEAE or CM chromatography was loaded onto a 1-ml column at a flow rate of 7 ml/h. The column was washed with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Bound protease was then eluted using 0.1m glycine HCl, pH 2.4. Fractions were immediately neutralized using 2 m Trizma (Tris base). Two 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with matriptase complexes (10 μg/dose) at intervals of 2 weeks. Complete Freund's adjuvant was used for the initial immunizations, whereas incomplete adjuvant was used for boosts. Three days after the second boost, antiserum was collected from the tail vein, and the immunoresponse was determined by immunoblotting. The final boost was conducted with the matriptase complex in the absence of adjuvant by tail vein injection. The splenocytes were collected and fused with mouse myoloma cells (SP2 or NS1) by polyethylene glycol methodology, and the successful hybridoma cells were selected by HAT medium (14Kilmartin J.V. Wright B. Milstein C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The primary screening was carried out by Western blotting using the targets that contain a mixture of intact 95-kDa matriptase complex, dissociated matriptase, and the binding proteins. More than 100 positive clones were selected in the primary screening. Three anti-matriptase mAbs (M32, M92, and M84) and two anti-binding protein mAbs (M19 and M58) were selected and characterized in detail. To produce mAbs, hybridoma lines were gradually adapted to low serum-supplemented culture medium and then to protein-free hybridoma medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). mAbs were harvested and precipitated by 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate. Further purification was carried out by DEAE chromatography. Immunoblotting was conducted as described previously (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and probed with mAbs as specified. Immunoreactive polypeptides were visualized using peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 95-kDa matriptase complex preparation was resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonboiling conditions. The gel strip was sliced out, boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer, placed on an SDS-acrylamide gel without wells, and electrophoresed under the same conditions as the first dimension gel. Protein bands were stained by colloidal Coomassie (15Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) due to the negative image observed with silver stain. The 40- and 25-kDa binding proteins were purified as described above. The amino-terminal sequences of these proteins were determined as described previously (16Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twelve (from the 40-kDa protein) and seven (from the 25-kDa protein) amino acid residues obtained were identical to the deduced amino acid sequences of HAI-1 (4Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To further confirm the identity of the binding protein as HAI-1, the larger band from the 40-kDa protein doublet was subjected to in-gel digestion and then to analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Laboratory and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. To verify that HAI-1 encodes the binding protein of matriptase, we isolated an HAI-1 cDNA fragment by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction utilizing mRNA from MTSV-1.1B immortalized human mammary luminal epithelial cells. Primer sequences for HAI-1 (5′-GGCCCGCGCTCTGAAGGTGA-3′ and 5′-TTGGCAAGCAGGAAGCAGGG-3′) were derived from the published sequence. Standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out using the Advantage RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH), and the product was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by TA cloning. The sequence of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product was obtained by standard methods and confirmed with the published HAI-1 sequence (5Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A eukaryotic expression vector was constructed (pcDNA/HAI-1) utilizing the commercially available pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). A 1.6-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment containing the HAI-1 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1. This construct contains the open reading frame of HAI-1 driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Correct insertion of the HAI-1 cDNA was verified by restriction mapping. Transfections were performed using SuperFect transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) as specified in manufacturer's handbook. After 48 h, the HAI-1-transfected COS-7 cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. In our previous study (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), matriptase was observed to exist either in a major uncomplexed form or in two minor complexed forms with apparent molecular masses of 110 and 95 kDa. The matriptase-binding protein(s) was not identified. To identify these binding protein(s), we now have examined the matriptase complexes found in human milk. Our hypothesis has been that the binding protein is a protease inhibitor and that its expression may be associated with a specific physiological status such as differentiation or lactation. In human milk, two immunoreactive bands of 95 and 110 kDa in size (but no uncomplexed matriptase) were detected by anti-matriptase mAb 21-9 under nonboiling and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). The 95-kDa band was the predominant species; the relative amount of the minor 110-kDa band varied between different batches of milk (Fig. 1, A andB). In common with a 95-kDa immunoreactive matriptase complex previously identified in human breast cancer cells (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the milk-derived 95-kDa immunoreactive species was converted, after boiling in the absence of reducing agents, to a smaller immunoreactive band. This band corresponds in size to the previously described uncomplexed matriptase from breast cancer (Fig. 1 C). Thus, matriptase appears to be a component of the 95-kDa complex, both in breast cancer cells and in milk. Although most of the matriptase detected in breast cancer cells is uncomplexed; the opposite is true in milk. Most of the minor 110-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide in milk was precipitated by a 40% saturation of ammonium sulfate; this band was then separated from the major 95-kDa matriptase complex by DEAE chromatography (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the 95-kDa matriptase complex, the milk-derived 110-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide had a reduced rate of migration on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel after boiling (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that this milk-derived 110-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide is not likely to be a protease complex. Alternatively, this milk-derived 110-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide is likely to be a serpin complex, which is known to be stable in SDS. In contrast, the 110-kDa species from breast cancer cells was converted by boiling into matriptase and another unidentified species (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This milk-derived 110-kDa species was thus distinct from the 110-kDa matriptase complex previously isolated from T-47D breast cancer cells. The milk-derived 95-kDa matriptase complex has been isolated using an anti-matriptase mAb-21-9 immunoaffinity column. This highly purified 95-kDa matriptase complex can be converted to matriptase, after boiling, in conjunction with the appearance of a protein doublet with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa (1Lin C.-Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In some batches of milk, another protease complex doublet, with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa, was also observed, in addition to the 95-kDa complex (Fig.2, lane 1). Both 95- and 85-kDa matriptase complexes released matriptase after boiling. In addition to matriptase, 40- and 25-kDa protein bands were observed (Fig. 2, lane 2). Biochemical and immunological approaches have been taken to prove that the 40- and 25-kDa bands are components of matriptase complexes. In our biochemical approach, a 95-kDa matriptase complex preparation, which also contains low levels of uncomplexed matriptase, was subjected to nonboiling/boiling diagonal gel electrophoresis. In this gel electrophoresis system, proteins whose migration rate on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel are not changed by boiling will be seen on the diagonal line. In contrast, heat-sensitive complexes will be dissociated into their constituent subunits and will be seen on the same electrophoretic path below the diagonal line. Proteins whose configuration is changed by boiling, resulting in a lower migration rate, will be seen beyond the diagonal line. The sample was first resolved by SDS-PAGE, and a strip of gel was sliced off. The sliced gel strip was boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents, placed on a second SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed (Fig. 3). In the case of the 95-kDa matriptase complex, both the 40-kDa protein doublet and matriptase were observed below the diagonal line and on the same electrophoretic path (Fig. 3). This result thus confirms that matriptase and the 40-kDa doublet are components of the 95-kDa protease complex. On the other hand, uncomplexed matriptase was seen on the diagonal line (Fig.3). In our immunological approach, a panel of mAbs was obtained using matriptase complexes as immunogens (Fig.4). A new anti-matriptase mAb (M92) recognized both 95- and 85-kDa complexes under nonboiling conditions (Fig. 4 A, lane 5); this mAb recognized uncomplexed matriptase, but not the 40- and 25-kDa bands, after boiling (lane 6). These results suggest that matriptase is a component of these two complexes. In contrast to mAb M92, mAb M19 recognized both 40- and 25-kDa bands, but not matriptase, under boiling conditions (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). This mAb also recognized both 95- and 85-kDa complexes under nonboiling conditions (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). These results suggest that both 40- and 25-kDa bands are components of these matriptase complexes. A third antibody type, mAb M58, was also selected. This mAb selectively recognized only the 95-kDa matriptase complex (not the 85-kDa complex) under nonboiling conditions (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Furthermore, mAb M58 recognized only the 40-kDa band (not the 25-kDa band) after boiling (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). Both 40- and 25-kDa bands are fragments of a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor; the 25-kDa band is a carboxyl-terminal degraded product of the 40-kDa band (see below). Thus, the epitope that is recognized by mAb M58 is likely to reside on the amino terminus of the 40-kDa band. These results, combined with the results in Fig. 2, suggest that the 95-kDa matriptase complex is composed of matriptase and the 40-kDa component; the 85-kDa matriptase complex is composed of matriptase and the 25-kDa component. In Fig.4 B, we summarize the structures of both 95- and 85-kDa matriptase complexes and their interactions with these mAbs. When the amino-terminal sequences of the 40- and 25-kDa binding proteins were determined, the sequence of the 40-kDa binding protein (GPPPAPPGLPAG) was found to be identical to the amino-terminal sequence of a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (4Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which was previously identified as HAI-1 (4Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues (TQGFGGS) obtained from the N terminus of the 25-kDa binding protein are identical to the sequence from residues 154 to 160 of HAI-1 (4Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To further confirm that the binding proteins of matriptase are identifiable as HAI-1, the larger band from the 40-kDa doublet was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion; the tryptic digests were examined by MALDI-MS. Twelve unique peptides from the tryptic digests were matched with the HAI-1 sequences by searching the entire HAI-1 sequence for observed MALDI-MS masses (Fig.5). These 12 peptides cover 87 residues that span positions 135–310. These results indicate that the binding proteins of matriptase are fragments of HAI-1. We further examined the immunoreactivity of an anti-binding protein mAb with HAI-1 that was expressed by HAI-1-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.6). Anti-binding protein mAb M19 detected a band with an apparent size of 55 kDa in the cell lysate of HAI-1-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 6, lane 2) and in the 2 m KCl-washed membrane fraction of T-47D human breast cancer cells (lane 4), but not in the COS-7 cells (lane 3) or in matriptase-transfected COS-7 cells (lane 1). The immunoreactivity of the anti-binding protein mAb for HAI-1 provides a second line of evidence that the binding protein of matriptase is HAI-1. Because the size of the immunoreactive 55-kDa band is close to the calculated molecular mass (53,319 Da) of mature membrane-bound HAI-1 and because its association with the membrane fraction is sufficiently strong that it resists dissociation by washing with 2 m KCl, this 55-kDa band is considered likely to be mature intact HAI-1. To investigate the possible cell types that release matriptase and its complexes, we examined their expression in four milk-derived, SV40 large tumor antigen-immortalized luminal epithelial cell lines (milk cells) (13Bartek J. Bartkova J. Kyprianou N. Lalani E.N. Staskova Z. Shearer M. Chang S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), two cultured human foreskin fibroblast cultures, and the fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 (Fig.7). Positive results for the mammary luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 7, lanes 4–11) and negative results for the fibroblasts and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells (lanes 1–3) suggest that the protease and its binding protein are produced by the epithelial components of the lactating mammary gland. In contrast to milk, the immortalized mammary luminal epithelial cells expressed detectable uncomplexed matriptase and a 110-kDa complex. This 110-kDa complex species was not detected in milk, but was detected in T-47D breast cancer cells (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although matriptase has been previously purified from breast cancer cells (3Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we now report on its expression in the normal lactating mammary gland and in immortalized mammary luminal epithelial cells. Expression of matriptase in the lactating mammary gland is, however, characterized by its strong association with HAI-1 fragments to form complexes that were previously identified as minor forms of matriptase in cultured breast cancer cells. Expression of matriptase in milk in its complexed form with a protease inhibitor suggests that the activity of matriptase is highly regulated in the lactating mammary gland. Because the P1 residues of both Kunitz domains of HAI-1 are likely to be arginine 260 and lysine 385, HAI-1 is likely to be an inhibitor directed against trypsin-like serine proteases. The trypsin-like activity of matriptase was previously confirmed by its cleavage activity against various synthetic substrates with arginine and lysine as P1 sites and by Asp positioned at the bottom of its substrate specificity pocket. Thus, HAI-1 is not only a matriptase-binding protein, but also a potential inhibitor of matriptase. However, because HAI-1 is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor that exhibits its inhibitory activity in a competitive and reversible manner, residual activity of matriptase was consistently observed in association with matriptase·HAI-1 complexes. This residual activity was detected both as gelatinolytic activity and cleavage activity against synthetic substrates. This residual activity may also contribute to the cleavage of a 40-kDa fragment of HAI-1 at Arg-153 in the process of purification, resulting in the 25-kDa fragment of HAI-1 and the 85-kDa matriptase complex in some purified batches. Although HAI-1 was originally identified as an inhibitor of the HGF activator, it is possible that matriptase is an in vivotarget protease of this Kunitz-type inhibitor, at least in the mammary gland. Both matriptase and HAI-1 are colocalized on the surfaces of T-47D cells 2C.-Y. Lin, J. Anders, M. Johnson, and R. B. Dickson, unpublished results.; they are coexpressed by four different immortalized mammary luminal epithelial cell lines; and they are copurified from human milk as complexes. Activation of HGF requires cleavage at an arginine residue as the P1 site by a protease such as the HGF activator or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (17Naldini L. Vigna E. Bardelli A. Follenzi A. Galimi F. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 603-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); the putative P1 arginine residue in Kunitz domain I of HAI-1 makes the HGF activator a possible target. However, the HGF activator, a serine protease, is produced mainly in the liver and circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen (5Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HAI-1 is expressed mainly in the kidney, pancreas, prostate, small intestine, colon, fetal lung, and fetal kidney; but negligible expression of HAI-1 was observed in adult and fetal liver (4Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HAI-1 activity is detected in some lung and stomach carcinoma cell lines, but it is negligible in hepatoma cell lines and in immortalized cells from human fetal liver. Therefore, it is not clear that HAI-1 is an in vivo inhibitor for the HGF activator, particularly since HAI-1 is expressed at negligible levels in the lung and liver, where highly regulated activity of HGF is thought to play a crucial role in repair following injury (18Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Naka D. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8966-8970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In summary, in this study, we have provided evidence that the previously described breast cancer cell-derived matriptase is also produced by the lactating mammary gland. In milk, however, the protease tightly associates with a 40-kDa fragment of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, forming a 95-kDa protease complex. The formation of a protease complex appears to be selective for lactating mammary epithelial cells; increased levels of uncomplexed protease are associated with epithelial immortalization and, in particular, with breast tumorigenesis. Study of the activity of this plasma membrane-associated protease and its potential regulation by complexation with the Kunitz-type inhibitor could provide insight into how cancer cells utilize a physiological protease for multiple malignant processes such as invasion and metastasis.

To structurally characterize the enzyme, we isolated a cDNA encoding the protease.

By comparison with other serine proteases, the active-site triad was identified as His-484, Asp-539, and Ser-633.

The bottom of the substrate specificity pocket was identified to be Asp-627 by comparison with other trypsin-like serine proteases.

The stromal origins of these well characterized extracellular matrix-degrading proteases may suggest that cancer invasion is an event that either depends entirely upon stromal-epithelial cooperation or is controlled by some other unknown epithelium-derived protease(s). A search for these epithelium-derived proteolytic systems that may interact with the plasmin/urokinase-type plasminogen activator system and/or with the MMP family could provide a missing link in our understanding of malignant invasion.We have pursued studies of a novel protease with the hypothesis that a tumor itself may be a major source of proteases important for multiple aspects of malignant behavior, including invasion and metastasis. To this end, we systematically altered several conditions such as the pH using gelatin zymography to search for potentially important breast cancer cell-derived gelatinases. This search led us to the discovery of a major protease, which on a gelatin zymogram had a slightly alkaline pH optimum and a size between those of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in T-47D human breast cancer cells (6Shi Y.E.

Higher than normal levels of l-4-aminoarabinose are made in polymyxin-resistant mutants of S. typhimurium, which harbor lesions in another two component regulatory system, known as PmrA/PmrB (24Vaara M.

Kilpelainen I. Zähringer U. Vaara M. Helander I.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). E. coli K12 must therefore possess the enzymatic machinery to generate these substitutions, despite their absence in cells grown on nutrient broth. An operon of PhoP/PhoQ-regulated genes that is required for the maintenance of polymyxin resistance (and possibly forl-4-aminoarabinose biosynthesis) has recently been discovered in both S. typhimurium and E. coli K12 (18Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The regulatory and enzymatic functions of the products encoded by these genes have not yet been elucidated (18Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol.

A separate PhoP/PhoQ-regulated gene (pagP), which is required for resistance to a subset of the antibacterial polypeptides present in neutrophils (17Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), may encode the enzyme that incorporates the palmitate residue found in some lipid A molecular species of S. typhimurium. However, pagP is not part of thel-4-aminoarabinose gene cluster (17Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I.

We now report that six major lipid A variants derivatized with palmitate, l-4-aminoarabinose, and/or phosphoethanolamine (Fig. 1 C) accumulate in wild-type cells of E. coli K12 treated with 25 mmNH4VO3, despite their complete absence under ordinary growth conditions (Fig. 1 A).

We have devised methods for isolating milligram quantities of several of the predominant lipid A species found in NH4VO3-treated E. coli. These substances were released from cells by pH 4.5 hydrolysis at 100 °C in SDS (10Rosner M.R. Tang J. Barzilay I. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

To recover the lipid A, the hydrolyzed material was converted to a two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture by addition of 2 ml of chloroform and 2 ml of methanol. After centrifugation at low speed, the lower phase was collected and washed twice with 4 ml of the upper phase derived from a fresh neutral two phase Bligh/Dyer mixture, consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (2:2:1.8, v/v). The washed lower phase was dried under N2. The lipid A sample was re-dissolved in the solvent of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v), and several microliters (∼1,000 cpm) were applied to the origin of a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. The plate was developed in the solvent of chloroform/pyridine, 88% formic acid/water (50:50:16:5, v/v).

The “normal” hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate and the hepta-acylated species EV1 were eluted with 12 ml of chloroform/methanol/240 mm ammonium acetate (2:3:1, v/v). Finally, the column was eluted with 12 ml of chloroform/methanol/480 mm ammonium acetate (2:3:1, v/v) to make certain no other lipids were present. To locate the fractions containing the desired lipids, 20 μl of each fraction was spotted onto a 10 × 20-cm Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. The plate was developed in the solvent of chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). The spots were visualized by charring on a hot plate after spraying the chromatogram with a mixture of ethanol/p-anisaldehyde/H2SO4/acetic acid (89:2.5:4:1, v/v) (36Christ W.J. McGuinness P.D.

The DEAE cellulose fractions containing the lipids of interest were then converted to neutral two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixtures by addition of the necessary amounts of chloroform and water. The lower phases were pooled, as appropriate, dried under N2, and stored at −20 °C. With the exception of EV5, which was produced in much lower quantities, the substituted lipid A derivative EV1, EV2, EV3, EV4, and EV6 that accumulated in NH4VO3-treated cells (as well as the lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate from untreated cells) were further purified by preparative thin layer chromatography.

We report here that hMTH1 hydrolyzed 2-hydroxy-dATP (2-OH-dATP) and 8-hydroxy-dATP (8-OH-dATP), oxidized forms of dATP, but not (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP, 5-hydroxy-dCTP, and 5-formyl-dUTP. The kinetic parameters indicated that 2-OH-dATP was hydrolyzed more efficiently and with higher affinity than 8-OH-dGTP. 8-OH-dATP was hydrolyzed as efficiently as 8-OH-dGTP. The preferential hydrolysis of 2-OH-dATP over 8-OH-dGTP was observed at all of the pH values tested (pH 7.2 to pH 8.8). In particular, a 5-fold difference in the hydrolysis efficiencies for 2-OH-dATP over 8-OH-dGTP was found at pH 7.2. However, E. coli MutT had no hydrolysis activity for either 2-OH-dATP or 8-OH-dATP. Thus, E. coli MutT is an imperfect counterpart for hMTH1. Furthermore, we found that 2-hydroxy-dADP and 8-hydroxy-dGDP competitively inhibited both the 2-OH-dATP hydrolase and 8-OH-dGTP hydrolase activities of hMTH1. The inhibitory effects of 2-hydroxy-dADP were 3-fold stronger than those of 8-hydroxy-dGDP. These results suggest that the three damaged nucleotides share the same recognition site of hMTH1 and that it is a more important sanitization enzyme than expected thus far.

It is known that theEscherichia coli MutT protein hydrolyzes 8-OH-dGTP to 8-hydroxy-dGMP (4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Because the mutation rate in amutT-deficient strain increases up to 1000-fold as compared with the wild type (7Yanofsky C. Cox E.C. Horn V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), 8-OH-dGTP is considered to be a major source of spontaneous mutations caused by endogenous reactive oxygen species, and MutT appears to efficiently prevent the spontaneous occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion mutations. In human cells, the hMTH1 protein is considered to be a functional homologue of the E. coli MutT because the hMTH1 protein hydrolyzes 8-OH-dGTP in vitro and suppresses the mutator phenotype of E. coli mutT-deficient cells (8Sakumi K.

Recently, we found that 2-hydroxy-dAdo and 2-OH-dATP are produced efficiently by reactive oxygen species treatment of dAdo and dATP, respectively (10Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Muraoka M. Kaji H. Kasai H. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 1997; 38: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 2-OH-dATP specifically induces G:C to T:A transversion mutations and is more mutagenic than 8-OH-dGTP in vivo (5Inoue M.

Thus, 2-OH-dATP is thought to act as an endogenous mutagen in cells. However, the presence of a hydrolyzing activity for 2-OH-dATP has not been described. We supposed that the MutT and hMTH1 proteins may act on this mutagenic nucleotide, 2-OH-dATP. We report here that the hMTH1 protein, which is known as an 8-OH-dGTPase, hydrolyzes 2-OH-dATP more efficiently than 8-OH-dGTP. In addition, hMTH1 also hydrolyzed 8-OH-dATP, another oxidized form of dATP, as efficiently as 8-OH-dGTP. On the other hand, the MutT protein hydrolyzed neither 2-OH-dATP nor 8-OH-dATP. This is the first demonstration that various oxidized nucleotides are hydrolyzed by a nucleotide sanitization enzyme, hMTH1. The hMTH1 protein and the E. coli MutT protein were purified from an E. coli overexpression system (12Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat.

Similarly, 2-OH-dADP, 2-hydroxy-dAMP, 8-OH-dGDP, and 8-hydroxy-dGMP were obtained by the oxidation of dADP, dAMP, dGDP, and dGMP, respectively. 8-OH-dATP and (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP were prepared by subjecting a 1 mg/ml dATP (Sigma) solution to 1400 Gy of γ-irradiation and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a YMC-Pack ODS-AM S-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC) with isocratic elution by buffer A (12.5 mm citric acid, 25 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm acetic acid, 45 mm sodium hydroxide, and 4% methanol) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and by monitoring of the UV spectra. The 8-OH-dATP and (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP fractions were further purified by anion exchange HPLC using a TSK-GEL DEAE-2SW column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh) with an isocratic elution by 75 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 20% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP fraction was re-injected into a YMC-Pack ODS-AM column with isocratic elution by buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The 8-OH-dATP and (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP were finally desalted by reverse-phase HPLC using an Ultrasphere ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm; 5 μm; Beckman) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Detection was performed with a Hewlett Packard 1040 M HPLC Detection System. 8-OH-dADP and 8-hydroxy-dAMP were obtained by similar procedures. The MutT activities were assayed in a reaction mixture (5 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and various amounts of deoxynucleotide substrates. After a preincubation at 30 °C for 2 min, the mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with various amounts of the MutT protein. Reactions were terminated by adding 200 μl of 2 mm EDTA. All samples were injected into a TSK-GEL DEAE-2SW column, with an isocratic elution by 75 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 20% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The nucleoside triphosphates and their hydrolyzed products were quantified by measuring the area of UV absorbance. The hMTH1 activities were assayed in a reaction mixture (200 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (unless otherwise noted, pH 8.0), 4 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and various amounts of the deoxynucleotide substrates. After a preincubation at 30 °C for 2 min, the mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min with 1 nm hMTH1 protein. Reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of 40 mm EDTA. The nucleoside triphosphates and their hydrolyzed products were quantified as described above. The MutT activities for 8-OH-dGTP, undamaged dGTP, and 2-OH-dATP were measured. A fixed amount (400 μm) of each substrate was mixed with various amounts of the MutT protein and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The hydrolyzed products were separated and quantified by anion exchange HPLC. Under our conditions, the nucleoside triphosphates and their cognate di- and monophosphates were clearly separated (Fig.1 A; data not shown). As expected, the hydrolyses of 8-OH-dGTP and undamaged dGTP were confirmed by the use of our procedure (Fig. 1, B–D). The reaction rate of the 8-OH-dGTPase activity of MutT was 8-fold higher than the deoxyguanosine triphosphatase activity (Fig.2). This result was expected, based on the kinetic parameters determined previously by the use of radiolabeled substrates (4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). However, 2-OH-dATPase activity was not found, even under conditions in which deoxyguanosine triphosphatase activity was detectable (Fig. 1 E). No 2-OH-dATPase activity was detected at substrate concentrations ranging from 2 to 400 μm and at extensions of the incubation time up to 3 h. Similarly, 8-OH-dATP and (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP, other forms of oxidized dATP, and 5-hydroxy-dCTP and 5-formyl-dUTP, the major oxidative products of pyrimidine nucleotides (11Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Muraoka M. Kaji H. Kasai H. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 1997; 38: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), were not hydrolyzed by the MutT enzyme (data not shown). Thus, MutT appears to be a sanitization enzyme specific for 8-OH-dGTP.Figure 2Hydrolysis of 2-OH-dATP by hMTH1 , monitored by anion exchange HPLC .

When 2-OH-dATP was incubated with hMTH1, it was hydrolyzed to the cognate monophosphate as 8-OH-dGTP (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, 2-OH-dATP was hydrolyzed more rapidly than 8-OH-dGTP (Fig. 3). Undamaged dGTP was slightly hydrolyzed, whereas no hydrolysis of undamaged dATP was detected (data not shown). The Michaelis constant (K m) and the catalytic constant (k cat) of the reactions catalyzed by the hMTH1 protein at pH 8.0 were calculated (TableI). 8-OH-dGTP was hydrolyzed with 14-fold greater efficiency as compared with the undamaged dGTP, as described previously (8Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The (k cat/K m) value, representing the catalytic efficiency, for 2-OH-dATP was 2-fold higher than that for 8-OH-dGTP. This kinetic difference for 2-OH-dATP over 8-OH-dGTP contributed fully to the K m values, and the k cat values for the two nucleotides were similar. Thus, hMTH1 recognized 2-OH-dATP with a 2-fold higher affinity and consequently hydrolyzed 2-OH-dATP twice as efficiently as 8-OH-dGTP. In addition to the normal form of hMTH1 (valine 83) described above, the variant form of the protein (methionine 83) (12Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) also hydrolyzed 2-OH-dATP more efficiently than 8-OH-dGTP (data not shown).Table ISubstrate specificity of hMTH1SubstrateK mk catk cat/K mμms−1s−1· μm−1pH 8.02-OH-dATP8.313.91.688-OH-dGTP15.212.30.818-OH-dATP13.910.80.78dGTP25815.70.06pH 7.22-OH-dATP5.74.70.838-OH-dGTP12.82.10.16The reaction mixtures, containing various concentrations of substrates (1–20 μm for 2-OH-dATP, 8-OH-dGTP, and 8-OH-dATP and 0.05–2 mm for dGTP), were incubated with 1 nmhMTH1 for 5 min at 30 °C. The k cat value was calculated as molecules of product formed per molecule of hMTH1 per second. Open table in a new tab The reaction mixtures, containing various concentrations of substrates (1–20 μm for 2-OH-dATP, 8-OH-dGTP, and 8-OH-dATP and 0.05–2 mm for dGTP), were incubated with 1 nmhMTH1 for 5 min at 30 °C. The k cat value was calculated as molecules of product formed per molecule of hMTH1 per second. The effects of pH on the 2-OH-dATPase and 8-OH-dGTPase activities of hMTH1 were analyzed (Fig.4). The hMTH1 protein hydrolyzed 2-OH-dATP more efficiently than 8-OH-dGTP at all of the pH values tested (pH 7.2 to pH 8.8). In particular, the reaction rates (s−1) for 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP were quite different at pH 7.2 and pH 8.8, as compared with those at pH 8.0. With the change from pH 8.0 to pH 7.2, the predominance of the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for 2-OH-dATP over 8-OH-dGTP increased up to 5-fold with the major contribution to thek cat values (Table I). These results imply that 2-OH-dATP is a better substrate for hMTH1 than 8-OH-dGTP in cells. During the course of this study, we found that 2-OH-dADP inhibited the 2-OH-dATPase activity of the hMTH1 protein. Previously, it was shown that 8-OH-dGDP is an inhibitor of the 8-OH-dGTPase activity of the hamster MTH1 protein (15Bialkowski K. Kasprzak K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We then studied whether 2-OH-dADP and 8-OH-dGDP inhibit the 8-OH-dGTPase and the 2-OH-dATPase activities, respectively, of the hMTH1 protein. Various amounts of the diphosphate and triphosphate derivatives of 2-hydroxy-dAdo and 8-hydroxy-dGuo were mixed and incubated with hMTH1. 8-OH-dGDP competitively inhibited the 2-OH-dATPase activity in addition to the 8-OH-dGTPase activity (data not shown). Similarly, 2-OH-dADP inhibited both the 2-OH-dATPase and 8-OH-dGTPase activities. The inhibition constants (K i) indicated that the inhibitory effects of 2-OH-dADP were 3-fold stronger than those of 8-OH-dGDP (Table II). These results are in agreement with our finding that 2-OH-dATP is recognized with higher affinity than 8-OH-dGTP. It is noteworthy that 2-OH-dADP and 8-OH-dGDP are the strongest hMTH1 inhibitors that have been found. In addition, 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP were also inhibitors of the 2-OH-dATPase activity and the 8-OH-dGTPase activity, respectively (TableII).Table IIInhibition parameters of various nucleotides on the hMTH1 activitiesActivityK i8-OH-dGDP2-OH-dADP8-OH-dGTP2-OH-dATP8-OH-dGTPase0.510.20∼9.72-OH-dATPase0.720.22∼12.9The reaction mixtures, containing various amounts of substrates (1–10 μm for 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP) and inhibitors (0–0.5 μm for 2-OH-dADP and 8-OH-dGDP), were incubated with the hMTH1 protein for 5 min at 30 °C. The inhibition constants,K i (μm), were obtained by performing linear least-squares fitting to the Dixon plots. Open table in a new tab The reaction mixtures, containing various amounts of substrates (1–10 μm for 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP) and inhibitors (0–0.5 μm for 2-OH-dADP and 8-OH-dGDP), were incubated with the hMTH1 protein for 5 min at 30 °C. The inhibition constants,K i (μm), were obtained by performing linear least-squares fitting to the Dixon plots. The preferential hydrolysis of 2-OH-dATP over 8-OH-dGTP by hMTH1 prompted us to study whether other damaged purine nucleotides are substrates. 8-OH-dATP and (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP were incubated with the hMTH1 protein, and their hydrolyses were analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig.5, 8-OH-dATP was hydrolyzed to 8-hydroxy-dAMP by the hMTH1 protein. We found that theK m and k cat values of this reaction were similar to those for 8-OH-dGTP (Fig. 3; Table I). Thus, the hydrolysis of 8-OH-dATP was as efficient as that of 8-OH-dGTP. On the other hand, no hydrolyzing activity of hMTH1 for (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP was detected (data not shown). The damaged pyrimidine nucleotides, 5-hydroxy-dCTP and 5-formyl-dUTP, were also not hydrolyzed (data not shown). Therefore, the hMTH1 protein hydrolyzed the three oxidized purine nucleotides, 8-OH-dGTP, 2-OH-dATP, and 8-OH-dATP. The most striking feature of this study is that hMTH1 hydrolyzed 2-OH-dATP more efficiently and with higher affinity than 8-OH-dGTP (Table I). In particular, a 5-fold difference in the hydrolysis efficiencies for 2-OH-dATP over 8-OH-dGTP was observed at pH 7.2. These results imply that 2-OH-dATP is an intrinsic substrate for hMTH1. In agreement with these findings, it was observed that the 2-OH-dATPase and the 8-OH-dGTPase activities of hMTH1 were competitively inhibited by both 2-OH-dADP and 8-OH-dGDP and that the inhibitory effect of 2-OH-dADP is 3-fold stronger than that of 8-OH-dGDP (Table II). These results indicate that the two damaged bases of these nucleotides share the same recognition site of hMTH1. In addition, hMTH1 also hydrolyzed 8-OH-dATP (Fig. 5). The hMTH1 protein recognizes and hydrolyzes at least three oxidized purine nucleotides. In contrast to hMTH1, E. coli MutT hydrolyzed neither 2-OH-dATP nor 8-OH-dATP. It has been reported that MutT hydrolyzes 8-OH-dGTP and prevents the mutations caused by this damaged nucleotide (4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The hMTH1 protein also hydrolyzes 8-OH-dGTP and suppresses the mutator phenotype of E. coli mutT-deficient cells (8Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hMTH1 has been proposed to be a functional homologue of E. coli MutT. However, our results indicate that MutT is an imperfect functional counterpart for hMTH1. In addition, the 8-OH-dGTPase activity of MutT, as compared with its undamaged deoxyguanosine triphosphatase activity, was more specific (2000-fold) (4Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) than that of hMTH1 (14-fold; this study). Moreover, the MutT protein has higher activity for 8-hydroxy-rGTP than hMTH1 (16Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M. Cirinesi A. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Hayakawa H. Hofer A. Thelander L. Kitajima S. Cai Y. Oshiro S. Yakushiji Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kuwano M. Sekiguchi M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3610-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the amino acid sequence of MutT has little identity to that of hMTH1, except for the conserved region, which is thought to be a catalytic domain (from the 36th to the 60th amino acid of hMTH1) (8Sakumi K.

The MutT protein may also differ from the hMTH1 protein in the structure of its base recognition site, although the predicted secondary structure of hMTH1 resembles that of MutT (12Yakushiji H.

It is possible that the MutT protein interacts with some of the nucleotide functional groups, such as the 7-NH and 8-oxo groups. Another possibility is that the MutT protein recognizes specific conformations of oxidized nucleotides. For example, the conformations of the MutT-bound AMP derivative and dGMP are high anti(19Frick D.N. Weber D.J. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5577-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which are part of a syn conformation near thesyn-anti boundary (20Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). 8-OH-dGTP appears to favor a syn conformation (21Uesugi S. Yano J. Yano E. Ikehara M. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and may adopt a highanti conformation in the binding site of MutT. In addition, 8-bromo-dGTP, which also favors a syn conformation, is hydrolyzed with 66-fold higher efficiency as compared with the unmodified dGTP (19Frick D.N. Weber D.J. Abeygunawardana C. Gittis A.G. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5577-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the MutT protein did not hydrolyze 8-OH-dATP, which also has 7-NH and 8-oxo groups and adopts asyn conformation (21Uesugi S. Yano J. Yano E. Ikehara M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 2313-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Leonard G.A. Guy A. Brown T. Teoule R. Hunter W.N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8415-8420Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Lin et al. (24Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that the 6-NH2 group of an ATP analogue bound to MutT is located close to Asn-119, and they suggested the existence of electrostatic repulsion between these NH2 groups. They speculated that this unfavorable interaction may determine the preferential binding with (d)GTP rather than with (d)ATP. The observation that the MutT protein hydrolyzed 8-OH-dGTP but not 8-OH-dATP may be explained by this interaction, at least in part. It is very interesting how 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dATP, in addition to 8-OH-dGTP, are bound to the hMTH1 protein. The kinetic parameters indicate that the affinities to hMTH1 are in the order of 2-OH-dATP > 8-OH-dATP ∼ 8-OH-dGTP. The hMTH1 protein specifically recognized these oxidized purine bases and seemed not to distinguish between damaged adenine and guanine bases. These are critical differences between the hMTH1 activity and the MutT activity. The hMTH1 protein may interact with the 1-NH and/or 2-oxo groups of the 1,2-dihydro-2-oxo tautomer or the 2-OH group of the 2-hydroxy tautomer (25Sepiol J. Kazimierczuk Z. Shugar D. Z.

Acta. 1995; 78: 1843-1854Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in addition to the 7-NH and/or 8-oxo groups of 8-OH-dGTP and 8-OH-dATP. However, it is more interesting to speculate that the hMTH1 protein also recognizes the specific conformations of oxidized nucleotides, because 2-hydroxy-dAdo, 8-hydroxy-dAdo, and 8-hydroxy-dGuo all favor the syn conformation (21Uesugi S. Yano J. Yano E. Ikehara M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 2313-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Kouchakdjian M. Bodepudi V. Shibutani S. Eisenberg M. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J.

Kamiya and H. Kasai, unpublished results. This speculation agrees with the result that hMTH1 has no activity for (R)-8,5′-cyclo-dATP, an anti-oriented adenine nucleotide. On the other hand, no hMTH1 hydrolase activities for 5-hydroxy-dCTP and 5-formyl-dUTP were detectable. The hMTH1 protein recognizes the three damaged purine bases specifically. The overall shape of the purine base may be required for recognition by hMTH1. The tertiary structures of the hMTH1 protein complexed with 8-OH-dGTP, 2-OH-dATP, and 8-OH-dATP would resolve these modes of substrate recognition. Recently, it has been shown that two or three proteins other than the p18 hMTH1 protein, which we studied here, are generated by alternative splicing and that these proteins have different NH2 termini (28Oda H.

Nishioka, H. Yakushiji, T. Suzuki, M. Sekiguchi, and Y. Nakabeppu, unpublished results. The possibility that other forms of hMTH1 may have substrate specificities different from those of the p18 protein should be noted. We have shown that the hMTH1 protein has three functions: the 2-OH-dATPase, 8-hydroxydeoxyadenosine triphosphatase, and 8-OH-dGTPase activities. Our new findings highlight the possibility that a loss or decrease in the hMTH1 activity is more deeply involved in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, aging, and other diseases with multiple mechanisms than expected thus far from only its 8-OH-dGTPase activity. Studies with MTH1-null mutant mice will provide more insight into the role of this sanitizing enzyme and are in progress."

Cell. 1996; 87: 1261-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), has prompted the evaluation of histone acetylation in transcriptional control. Reversible acetylation of core histones is critical for transcriptional activation of eukaryotic target genes (5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 6Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem.

By alleviating the transcriptionally repressive interaction between positively charged histone amino termini and negatively charged DNA and thus providing direct access of the transcription machinery, hyperacetylation of distinct loci within chromatin is thought to give rise to gene activation (reviewed in Refs. 5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 6Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem.

However, several aspects of this model have proven to be more complex. Some evidence supports the concept that the amino termini participate primarily in protein-protein interactions rather than protein-DNA interactions (reviewed in Ref. 8Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the physical consequence of histone tail acetylation is the disruption of structured domains in the amino termini, rather than the strict neutralization of positive charge (reviewed in Ref. 8Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Enrichment of acetylation on specific lysine residues suggests that differential acetylation within distinct chromatin loci may play a key role in regulation (5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Also, the notion that nonhistone proteins may be the actual targets of many HATs has been proposed (9Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 10Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar), because acetylation of the general transcription factors by various HATs (9Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and the acetylation of the tumor suppressor p53 by p300 (10Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated in vitro. Despite the explosion of recent reports linking transcription and reversible protein/histone acetylation, the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. At least four distinct human HAT families have been identified (11Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The prototypical GCN5 family of HATs constitutes a large group of enzymes found in such diverse organisms as yeast,Tetrahymena, and humans (5Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The GCN5 family exhibits specificity toward lysine 14 of H3 and lysines 8 and 16 of H4 (12Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). GCN5 enzymes are members of a superfamily ofN-acetyltransferases that appear to share a common structural core (13Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although the sequence identity is limited among these diverse enzymes, this region is predicted to form a similar acetyl-CoA binding structure (13Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 14Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V.

Several x-ray structures of other CoA-dependent transferases in this superfamily have recently been reported (14Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V.

Cell. 1999; 3: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); however, the catalytic mechanism has not been established. Here, we report the first detailed biochemical study that probes the catalytic mechanism and the function of invariant glutamic acid 173 within the GCN5 family of HATs. Our results suggest that the HAT reaction does not involve the formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate but rather involves the formation of a ternary complex (histones, acetyl-CoA, and enzyme) where the ε-amino group of histone lysine residues directly attacks the bound acetyl-CoA. We demonstrate that glutamic acid 173 is an essential catalytic residue, acting as a general base catalyst by deprotonating the histone substrate. All chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Calf thymus histones where purchased from Calbiochem. Amino acids 99–262 of yeast GCN5 corresponding to the HAT catalytic domain were overexpressed in BL21-DE3 bacteria. T7 based protein expression of GCN5 was induced for 3.5 h. Harvested cells were lysed by French pressure in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). GCN5 from clarified extract was adsorbed over a 4-ml column of Ni2+ affinity resin (Qiagen) and eluted with a 0–50 mm imidazole gradient in the above buffer. GCN5 eluted at 12 mm imidazole. Fractions with HAT activity where pooled and concentrated to a volume of 1–2 ml. Concentrated sample was then applied to a G-75 size exclusion column and eluted in a buffer of 30 mm HEPES (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. E173Q was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and was purified using SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), CoA-agarose (Sigma) and Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration chromatography. Pure fractions (assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled and stored at either 4 °C or −20 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Extensive development of the HAT assays were required for the detailed kinetic analysis. Assays were performed in 100 mm acetate, 50 mm Bis-Tris, and 50 mm Tris, a three-component buffer that maintains constant ionic strength at a function of pH. Briefly, the assay involves the determination of [3H]acetate transfer from [3H]acetyl-CoA to the histone substrate, catalyzed by GCN5. Labeled [3H]acetyl-CoA (NEN Life Science Products) was mixed with cold acetyl-CoA to generate a stock solution with 40–200 cpm/pmol specific activity. Final acetyl-CoA concentrations of 2–30 μm were employed depending on the assay. Histones were resuspended separately at ∼10 mg/ml in the assay buffer. The reactions (55 μl) were initiated by either the addition of [3H]acetyl-CoA or enzyme (final concentration, 20–100 nm). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5–25 min at 22 °C before quenching the reaction by spotting the solution onto Whatman P81 (phosphocellulose) filter paper discs. The absorbed histones were then washed three times in 600 ml of 50 mmNaHCO3 buffer (pH 9). Discs were dried briefly in acetone, and the amount of tritium retained was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Initial velocities were determined by varying both substrate (histones and acetyl-CoA) concentrations. Usually, histone concentrations were varied (0.5–50 μm) at different fixed levels of acetyl-CoA (1–30 μm). Because the nonenzymatic histone acetylation reaction resulted in significant background counts, we developed a series of controls to take this into account. For every GNC5 enzymatic reaction, a corresponding nonenzymatic control reaction was performed. The nonenzymatic rate was then subtracted from each sample, prior to fitting the data. When one substrate was varied at saturating levels of the second, the data were fitted to the following equation using KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA.).v=(kcat·S)/(Km+S)Equation 1 When both substrates were varied, the data were fitted to the following equation.v=[kcat·A·B/(Kia·Kb+Ka·B+Kb·A+A·B)]Equation 2 Alternatively, the data were plotted in double reciprocal form (as in Fig. 1), and the kinetic parameters were determined from intercept and slope replots (17Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 506-841Google Scholar) using the computer program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software). The chemical modifying agents iodoacetate, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), and 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) were used to inactivate GCN5. GCN5 was incubated in the presence of the reagent for an extended period (10–60 min) at pH 7.5 and 22 °C. The remaining GCN5 activity was then determined at saturating levels of histones and acetyl-CoA, as described above. At different pH values between 5.9 and 10.5, the k cat andk cat/K m(histones)values were determined by varying both histone and acetyl-CoA concentrations and fitting the resulting data to Equation 2. Alternatively, saturating levels of acetyl-CoA (30 μm) were used, and histone concentration was varied. Thek cat andk cat/K m(histones)values were then determined from a fit to Equation 1. Once thek cat andk cat/K m(histones)values were obtained at the indicated pH, each parameter was fitted to the following equation.v=C/(1+H/Ka)Equation 3 where C is the pH-independent value, andK a is the ionization constant, and H is the proton concentration. CoA-dependent transferases are known to utilize one of two distinct mechanisms to catalyze acetyl transfer. One mechanism involves acetyl transfer from CoA to an enzyme nucleophile prior to transfer to the second substrate (18Thompson S. Mayerl F. Peoples O.P. Masamune S. Sinskey A.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5735-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a subsequent step, the enzyme then transfers this group to the acceptor substrate. The alternative mechanism involves direct acetyl transfer from CoA to the substrate acceptor, without the formation of a covalent enzyme intermediate (19Lewendon A. Murray I.A. Shaw W.V. Gibbs M.R. Leslie A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism requires that both substrates and enzyme must form a ternary complex before catalysis can occur. For yeast GCN5 HAT, these two mechanisms were distinguished from a steady-state kinetic analysis. Both substrate (histones and acetyl-CoA) concentrations were varied, and the resulting initial velocities were determined. Fig.1 displays the data in double reciprocal form where 1/velocity is plotted against 1/ [histone] at various fixed concentrations of acetyl-CoA. The observed intersecting line pattern is diagnostic for the mechanism in which both substrates must bind to the enzyme before catalysis (Fig. 1). These data argue against a mechanism involving initial acetylation of an enzyme residue, followed by acetyl transfer to lysine. Instead, the data suggest that the ε-amino group of lysine directly attacks the acetyl-CoA within the active site of the enzyme. Supporting evidence comes from the recent x-ray structure of the related HAT1/acetyl-CoA complex, which revealed that the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA was not transferred to the enzyme in the complex (14Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To date, there is no evidence for a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Consistent with our data (Fig. 1), similar intersecting line patterns were reported for the native rat liver nuclear HAT (20Wiktorowicz J.E. Campos K.L. Bonner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus the GCN5 HAT family will likely utilize a catalytic mechanism that will optimize this direct attack on acetyl-CoA by lysine. The HATs must overcome the fact that at physiological pH values, the ε-amino of the lysine substrate is protonated and therefore unreactive. The ε-amino group of lysine must first be deprotonated by an active site amino acid residue acting as a general base catalyst. To identify critical active site residues, we utilized a variety of side chain-specific amino acid modifying reagents to inactivate GCN5. Chemical modifying agents DEPC and iodoacetate, which are specific for histidine and cysteine residues, respectively, failed to inactivate GCN5 HAT activity. Although thiol group sensitivity has been previously reported with native (full-length) HATs fromTetrahymena (21Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and rat liver (22Wiktorowicz J.E. Bonner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12893-12900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observe no adverse effect of iodoacetate treatment when only the HAT catalytic domain is employed. It is likely that these differences in thiol sensitivity result from reactivity of structurally important cysteine residues outside the putative catalytic domain. In contrast, the carboxylate-directed reagent EDAC was effective at inactivating GCN5 catalytic activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2), suggesting the importance of one or more carboxylic acid-containing residues. If a side chain carboxylate is responsible for deprotonating the ε-amino group of a histone lysine, then the enzyme would be active only when this acidic residue is unprotonated in the active ternary complex. The pH dependence of the reaction rate should indicate the presence of an ionization that must be unprotonated for binding/catalysis. To explore the possibility of general base catalysis by an acidic residue, we generated pH rate profiles of the steady-state kinetic parameters, k cat andk cat/K m. The second order rate constant k cat/K mdescribes the reaction between free enzyme and free substrate. Reflecting both substrate binding and catalysis, thek cat/K m pH profile will yield the intrinsic pK a values of critical ionizations. The k cat parameter describes the unimolecular catalytic steps subsequent to enzyme/substrate complex formation and will therefore yield pK a values of the complex. Because of high nonenzymatic histone acetylation at alkaline pH, the background reaction rate at each substrate concentration was determined and subtracted from each data point. The pH profile of bothk cat/K m andk cat revealed a critical ionization that must be unprotonated for catalysis (Fig. 3). As the pH increases there is a corresponding increase in catalytic activity that plateaus above the critical ionization with pK a value of 8.1 ± 0.2 fork cat and 8.3 ± 0.2 fork cat/K m. Below the pK a, the rate of catalysis drops 10-fold for every pH unit decrease, toward a limit of zero. These data indicate the catalytic requirement of an unprotonated active site residue and are consistent with a mechanism in which this residue may abstract a proton from the ε-amino group of substrate. The minimal catalytic domain of GCN5 has been mapped to region between amino acids 170 and 253 (1Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 23Candau R. Zhou J.X. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Within this stretch of amino acids, there are only three invariant acidic residues, Glu-173, Glu-183, and Asp-214. Previous single-site mutational analysis had indicated the detrimental effect of substitution at Asp-214 but a lack of an effect upon Glu-183 substitution (24Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Although substitution at Asp-214 resulted in decreased activity, this mutant was not among the most debilitating in the study (24Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 25Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A triple mutant involving residues 171–173 was one of the most debilitating mutations in vivo and in vitro, suggesting an important role for Glu-173 (25Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Glu-173, a GCN5 mutant protein harboring a Glu-173 to Gln substitution was generated and probed as the potential catalytic base in the reaction. The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined and compared with the wild type enzyme (TableI). Strikingly, thek cat value for the E173Q mutant was 320-fold lower than that determined for the wild type enzyme at pH 7.5. But theK m values for histones and acetyl-CoA were not significantly different between wild type (K m(histones)= 28 μm;K m(AcCoA) = 20 μm) and mutant protein (K m(histones)= 17 μm; K m(AcCoA) = 21 μm). These data suggest that the E173Q mutant does not alter the ability of protein to bind substrates but rather has a profound effect on catalysis. No difference in binding affinity also suggests that the overall structural integrity of the protein is maintained.Table IKinetic analysis for GCN5 and E173Q mutant histone acetyltransferasesEnzymek catK mhistonesK m AcCoAs−1μmGCN5, pH 7.58.0 × 10−2 ± 3.7 × 10−228 ± 2.120 ± 6.6E173Q, pH 7.52.5 × 10−4 ± 2.3 × 10−417 ± 6.821 ± 8.6GCN5, pH 9.750.18 ± 0.031.9 ± 1.157 ± 13E173Q, pH 9.752.8 × 10−2 ± 0.3 × 10−28.0 ± 4.715 ± 3.2Errors are the standard errors of the fitted parameters determined from least squares fitting from one representative data set.

The conditions were 100 mm acetate, 50 mm Bis-Tris, 50 mm Tris, and 22 °C. If Glu-173 is the general base responsible for deprotonating the lysine (Fig. 4), one would predict that at elevated pH values where the concentration of unprotonated lysine is significant, the E173Q mutant activity will converge toward wild type activity. Because the reaction requires an unprotonated lysine to act as the nucleophile within the active site, this can either be accomplished by active deprotonation by Glu-173 at neutral pH (general base catalysis) or by artificially raising the pH to deprotonate the free histone lysine residues. Indeed, at pH 9.75 the E173Q mutantk cat value is only 6-fold lower than wild type, as compared with 320-fold at pH 7.5 (Table I). To explore this further, a complete pH rate analysis of the E173Q mutant was performed (Fig. 3). The E173Q mutant does not display the ionization with pK a value of 8 found with the wild type enzyme but rather exhibited an ionization with a pK a value of 9.7 (and 10.1 in k cat/K m) for a group that must be unprotonated for activity. This pK a 9.7–10.1 group is consistent with the ionization of the ε-amino group of histone lysines (26Jencks W.P. Regenstein J. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1976: 305-351Google Scholar). To verify that the ionization displayed in the E173Q pH profile is the ε-amino group from histone lysine residues, the pH-dependent rate for the nonenzymatic reaction was determined (Fig. 3). The nonenzymatic reaction will be fully dependent upon the ionization of histone lysines and should yield an average pK a value of all reactive lysine residues. The apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of acetyl-CoA and histones in the absence of GCN5 was measured as a function of pH and is displayed in Fig. 3. Identical to the E173Q catalyzed reaction, the reaction rate decreases 10-fold for every pH unit decrease below a pK a value of 9.8. As predicted, the rate of nonenzymatic histone acetylation depends solely upon the solution ionization state of lysine residues. Similarly, the E173Q mutant enzyme depends upon the solution ionization state of histone lysine residues. At high pH where the majority of free histone lysine residues are unprotonated, the rate of catalysis by E173Q reaches values observed with wild type enzyme. That is, the requirement for lysine deprotonation by Glu-173 is lost at alkaline pH, and the E173Q can function as efficiently as wild type GCN5 (Fig. 4). However, at physiological pH the E173Q mutant is 320-fold less efficient as a catalyst, compared with wild type GCN5. In the cell, we would predict this mutant to be functionally inactive as a transcriptional activator. The recent x-ray structure of N-myristoyl transferase revealed that a conserved glutamic acid (Glu-173) residue is positioned between two hydrophobic pockets (27Weston S.A. Camble R. Colls J. Rosenbrock G. Taylor I. Egerton M. Tucker A.D. Tunnicliffe A. Mistry A. Mancia F. de la Fortelle E. Irwin J. Bricogne G. Pauptit R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Based upon its location within the protein, the authors have implicated this residue in catalysis. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase utilizes a histidine residue as a general base to abstract a proton from the primary hydroxyl group of chloramphenicol (19Lewendon A. Murray I.A. Shaw W.V. Gibbs M.R. Leslie A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Amazingly, glumatic acid replacement at this position can substitute as the general base, albeit with lower catalytic activity (19Lewendon A. Murray I.A. Shaw W.V. Gibbs M.R. Leslie A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The effect of burying the glutamic acid within the hydrophobic active site resulted in a dramatic shift in the pK a of the substituted general base, from a pK a of 6.6 for histidine to a pK aof 8.3 for glutamic acid. Similar to our measured value of 8.3 for Glu-173 of GCN5, Glu-173 would be expected to reside within a hydrophobic active site pocket. Knowledge of the molecular details of HAT-catalyzed reactions will lead to a better understanding of their specific physiological functions and will augment the design of specific HAT inhibitors. This work provides the foundation for elucidating the role of protein/histone acetylation in the control of gene activation."

Here we demonstrate that TFTC, similar to other TBP-free TAFII complexes (yeast SAGA, hSTAGA, and hPCAF) contains the acetyltransferase hGCN5 and is able to acetylate histones in both a free and a nucleosomal context. The recently described TRRAP cofactor for oncogenic transcription factor pathways was also characterized as a TFTC subunit. Furthermore, we identified four other previously uncharacterized subunits of TFTC: hADA3, hTAFII150, hSPT3, and hPAF65β. Thus, the polypeptide composition of TFTC suggests that TFTC is recruited to chromatin templates by activators to acetylate histones and thus may potentiate initiation and activation of transcription.

Initiation of transcription of protein-encoding genes by RNA polymerase II requires transcription factor TFIID that is comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TFTC, TBP-free TAFII-containing complex; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; h, human; y, yeast; r, recombinant; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NR, nuclear receptor; HFMC, histone fold motif-containing; pol II, polymerase II. and series of TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs) (1Tansey W.P. Herr W. Cell. 1997; 88: 729-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TFIID directs preinitiation complex assembly on both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters. Previously, we have shown that functionally distinct TFIID complexes composed of both common and specific TAFIIs exist in human HeLa cells (for review, see Ref. 2Bell B. Tora L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have isolated and partially characterized a novel human (h) multiprotein complex, which contains neither TBP nor TBP-like factor but is composed of several TAFIIs and a number of uncharacterized polypeptides (3Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This novel complex, called TBP-free TAFII-containing complex (TFTC) is able to direct preinitiation complex formation and initiation of transcription on both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters in in vitrotranscription assays and can mediate transcriptional activation by GAL-VP16 (3Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Following the discovery of the TFTC complex, TAFIIs have also been described in different histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes: the yeast SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex and the human PCAF-GCN5 and the human STAGA complexes (4Grant P.A.

Histone acetylation and deacetylation have been strongly linked to the regulation of transcription (7Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Yeast (y) Gcn5 has HAT activity and is a transcriptional coactivator required for correct expression of various genes (8Candau R. Zhou J.X. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activators, such as VP16 or GCN4, interact directly with the SAGA complex and direct nucleosomal acetylation to potentiate transcriptional activation (10Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Cote J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The yeast SAGA complex consists of yGcn5 and various Ada (Ada1, Ada2, and Ada3) and Spt (Spt3, Spt7, Spt8, and Spt20) proteins (11Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). In addition to these proteins the SAGA complex also contains a distinct set of yTAFIIs (TAFII90, TAFII68, TAFII60, TAFII25, and TAFII17/20) (4Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To date two human homologues of the yGcn5 have been identified. The first human homologue of yGcn5 is hGCN5 (called hGCN5-L), which is highly homologous to yeast GCN5 but contains an extended amino-terminal domain (12Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in human cells an incompletely spliced transcript may exist that would encode a shorter GCN5 protein (called hGCN5-S) with a similar size to yeast Gcn5 (12Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The second human yGcn5 homologue is hPCAF, which was isolated as a p300/CBP-associated factor (15Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). PCAF is highly similar to hGCN5 throughout the entire length of the protein (15Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either hPCAF or hGCN5-S in HeLa cells allowed the isolation of large multiprotein complex(es) containing previously identified TAFIIs (TAFII31, TAFII30, and TAFII20/15) (5Ogryzko V.V.

In addition to the TAFIIs, the PCAF-GCN5 complexes also contain the human homologues of the yeast Ada (hADA2 and hADA3) and Spt (hSpt3) proteins and two other proteins that resemble previously identified TAFIIs (PAF65α and PAF65β) (5Ogryzko V.V.

A third TAFII-HAT complex was recently described and termed hSTAGA complex (6Martinez E. Kundu T.K. Fu J. Roeder R.G. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 23781-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this multiprotein complex the hGCN5 is associated with hTAFII31 and hSPT3 (6Martinez E. Kundu T.K. Fu J. Roeder R.G. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 23781-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). When the polypeptide composition of TFTC was compared with that of the other TAFII-HAT-containing complexes, it became clear that these complexes share a number of common features (2Bell B. Tora L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Neither TFTC nor the other TAFII-HAT complexes contain TBP, hTAFII250/yTAFII145 (the TFIID HAT (16Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D.

To further study the similarities between TFTC and the TAFII-HAT complexes, we investigated whether TFTC also contains a HAT activity and identified six previously unidentified components of the TFTC complex. Our results indicate that TFTC is very similar in its polypeptide composition and its HAT specificity to the previously described SAGA, PCAF, and STAGA complexes. Mouse P19 cells were washed and resuspended in buffer N (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Cells were lysed in buffer N containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40, and nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1500 rpm. Nuclei were then incubated with micrococcal nuclease at 37 °C for 30 min in buffer N and centrifuged at 6000 rpm (17Bellard M. Dretzen G. Giangrande A. Ramain P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 317-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 2 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant contained the mononucleosomes. To verify the mononucleosomes, they were either deproteinated with proteinase K, and the length of the DNA was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel or the histone composition was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To overexpress PCAF theEcoRI/KpnI fragment (containing the PCAF cDNA together with a FLAG tag) from the pCX-FLAG-PCAF vector (15Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) was inserted into the corresponding sites of the baculovirus expression vector pAcSG-His NT-C (PharMingen). To overexpress GCN5, the hGCN5-S-containing cDNA was PCR-amplified from the pcDNA3-hsGCN5 plasmid (14Candau R. Moore P.A. Wang L. Barlev N. Ying C.Y. Rosen C.A. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Double-tagged hPCAF was expressed using baculovirus in Sf9 cells and purified in the presence of 1 μmacetyl-CoA first on a Ni2+ column, then by an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (Sigma) and peptide elution. His-tagged rGCN5-S was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a Ni2+ column (Qiagen). TFTC and TFIIDβ complexes were purified as described previously (3Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). TFTC, TFIIDβ, rPCAF, or rGCN5-S was incubated with 1.6 nmol of [14C]acetyl-CoA (ICN) and 1 μg of core histones, histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or mononucleosomes in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mmKCl, 20 mm sodium butyrate, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 30 °C. The samples were separated on a 4–20% gradient (core histones and mononucleosomes) or a 10% (histone H1) SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, enhanced with diphenyloxazol, dried, and exposed to x-ray films for 5 days. The synthetic peptides and the HAT assay using these peptides were described previously (19Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J.

Western blots were carried out by standard procedures and treated with either polyclonal rabbit or monoclonal mouse antibodies followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti rabbit or goat-anti mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch).

The previously characterized anti-hGCN5 antibodies (12Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D.

These results indicate that TFTC contains hGCN5, but no or only trace amounts of hPCAF. Interestingly, the previously described PCAF complex also contains substantial amounts of hGCN5 as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2).Figure 2Newly identified components of the TFTC complex. 50 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract (NE;lane 1), purified PCAF (lane 2), TFTC (lane 3), and TFIIDβ (lane 4) complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted on a nitrocellulose filter, and examined for the presence of the indicated proteins by using the corresponding antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next tested the HAT activity of the TFTC complex using either free core histones (Fig. 1 C), H1 linker histone (Fig.1 D), or mononucleosomes (Fig. 1 E). Assays were performed using either TFTC, TFIIDβ (3Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), rGCN5-S, or rPCAF proteins. We estimated that 10 μl of TFTC complex (the amount used in the following experiments) contains about 10 ng of GCN5 using Western blot analysis (data not shown). When free histones were used as substrate, the TFTC complex (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), rGCN5-S and rPCAF (lanes 4–6) all strongly acetylated histone H3 and weakly modified histone H4. The acetylation of free histones by TFTC was comparable with that obtained with 10 ng of rGCN5-S (Fig.1 C, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, TFIIDβ acetylated histones H3 and H4 with the same intensity (Fig.1C, lane 3; Ref.16). Moreover, when histone H1 was used as a substrate, the TFTC complex acetylated histone H1 about five times better than the same amount of rGCN5-S (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2 and 4), whereas TFIIDβ did not acetylate histone H1 (lane 3). When mononucleosomes were used as substrates, the level of acetylation by the TFTC complex was easily detectable and about two times weaker than the acetylation obtained by 50 ng of rPCAF (Fig. 1 E, lanes 2 and 5), whereas rGCN5-S did not acetylate nucleosomes (lane 4). These results together indicate that the TFTC complex contains the hGCN5 HAT activity and is capable of efficiently acetylating histones in both a free and a nucleosomal context. Thus, acetylation specificity of the hTFTC complex is very similar to that of the ySAGA and the hPCAF-GCN5 complexes (4Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J.R.

The TFTC complex acetylates histone H1 (an artificial but potential target) much better than the rGCN5, suggesting that additional proteins may increase the efficiency of acetylation in the TFTC complex and that ySAGA, hPCAF-GCN5, and hTFTC complexes may also acetylate substrates other than nucleosomes. As expanded lysine acetylation specificity has been reported for the SAGA complex on histone H3 compared with recombinant yGcn5, which predominantly acetylates lysine 14 (19Grant P.A. Eberharter A.

Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we investigated the lysine acetylation specificity of TFTC on histone H3. To investigate the acetylation specificity of the TFTC complex, we used a set of peptides that spanned the histone H3 amino terminus (19Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J. Biol Chem. 1999; 274: 5895-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The wild type peptide carries nonacetylated lysines at all four positions (Lys-9, Lys-14, Lys-18, and Lys-23), while derivatives of this peptide were either acetylated at all four lysines or retained only single nonacetylated lysines at positions Lys-9, Lys-14, Lys-18, or Lys-23 (19Grant P.A.

These peptides were used in HAT assays to determine the lysine specificity of the TFTC complex in comparison with rGCN5-S. Consistent with previous studies carried out with either yGcn5 (19Grant P.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), rGCN5-S was able to efficiently acetylate only the wild type peptide or the peptide with nonacetylated Lys-14 (Fig. 1 F). However, TFTC was able to acetylate Lys-18 and Lys-23 in addition to Lys-14, indicating an expanded lysine specificity over rGCN5-S (Fig.1 F). Thus, TFTC and SAGA show a similar expanded pattern of H3 lysine acetylation, suggesting that the expanded histone acetylation specificity of GCN5 in both complexes may be influenced by the same additional factors. To characterize unidentified polypeptides of TFTC, certain proteins of TFTC were microsequenced. From a ∼300-kDa protein species we obtained four peptide sequences (GTQASHQVLR, LHNLAQFEGGESK, TIPNVIISHR, and VVAVSPQMR). Data base searches indicated that these peptides were contained in the sequence of the hTRRAP protein. The TRRAP protein was recently identified as an essential cofactor for oncogenic transcription factor pathways and shown to interact specifically with c-Myc and E2F-1 transactivation domains (20McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The presence of TRRAP in the TFTC complex was also confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-hTRRAP-specific antisera (Fig. 2) (20McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). These results indicate that TRRAP is a component of the TFTC complex. Thus, it is possible that TFTC is able to play an adaptor role between Myc/Max and/or E2F/DP and the basic transcriptional machinery. Recently, hTRRAP (also called PAF400) and its yeast homologue, Tra1, were shown to be components of the hPCAF-GCN5 and the yeast SAGA complexes, respectively (25Saleh A. Schieltz D. Ting N. McMahon S.B. Litchfield D.W. Yates J.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Cole M.D. Brandl C.J. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 26559-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Grant P.A.

Avantaggiati M.L. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 869-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The fact that TRRAP is a TFTC subunit further strengthens the link between TFTC and the other TAFII-HAT complexes. The isolation of multiple transcriptional adaptor-HAT complexes containing TRRAP (or yTra1) suggests that the function of TRRAP/Tra1 is to directly interact with transcriptional activators and to recruit the HAT and the transcription initiation activities to promoters. Targeting these activities to activator bound promoter regions would then efficiently promote localized histone acetylation and stimulation of specific initiation of transcription. Since hTFTC is similar to ySAGA and hPCAF-GCN5 complexes, we tested whether these complexes also share other common subunits. Antibodies specifically recognizing hADA2 or hADA32 demonstrated that hADA3, but not hADA2, is present in the TFTC complex (Fig. 2), while these antibodies recognized both hADA2 and hADA3 in the hPCAF complex (Fig. 2). Our finding is not unexpected, since it has been demonstrated that hGCN5 exists in stable macromolecular complexes lacking hADA2 (28Forsberg E.C. Lam L.T. Yang X.J. Nakatani Y. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15918-15924Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that ligand-dependent transactivation of different nuclear receptors (NRs) was mediated by the yeast ADA complex in which ADA3 directly bound to the ligand binding domain of some NRs (18vom Baur E. Harbers M. Um S.J. Benecke A. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This observation further suggests that TFTC may interact with several activators to mediate transcriptional stimulation. We next investigated whether, as in the case of the other TAFII-HAT complexes (4Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J.R. Workman J.L.

Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 23781-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), hSPT3 would be a component of TFTC. An antibody raised against hSPT3 (6Martinez E. Kundu T.K. Fu J. Roeder R.G. J. Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 23781-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) specifically recognized a protein species both in the TFTC and PCAF complexes (Fig. 2), indicating that hSPT3 is a component of the TFTC complex. Thus, as TFTC contains neither hTAFII28 nor hTAFII18, hSPT3, which contains two intramolecular histone fold motifs very similar to those found in hTAFII28 or hTAFII18 (29Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ruff M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 94: 239-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), may replace these two TAFIIs in TFTC. Thus, out of the five histone fold motif-containing (HFMC) TAFIIs (29Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ruff M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Moras D.

Structural or functional properties of certain factors are given at the left. Yeast (y) and human (h) proteins within the same horizontal row show homology to each other. ND, nondefined. Next we tested whether TFTC contains hTAFII150, a TAFII that was not always found associated with the different TFIID preparations (32Kaufmann J. Ahrens K. Koop R. Smale S.T. Muller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but which was shown to bind sequences overlapping the start site of transcription on pol II promoters (34Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against hTAFII150 specifically recognized a polypeptide migrating around 140 kDa in both the TFTC and TFIIDβ complexes (Fig. 2). This indicates that both TAFII30-containing complexes, TFTC and TFIIDβ, contain hTAFII150 (Table I). While our results are consistent with hTAFII150 (CIF150) being a component of hTFIID complex (33Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the presence of hTAFII150 in the TFTC complex is surprising since hTAFII150 and its yeast homologue, TSM1, have not been identified from the hPCAF and the ySAGA complexes. Interestingly, in contrast to the hPCAF and the ySAGA complexes which are not able to nucleate pol II transcription initiation, TFTC contains a certain number of additional TAFIIs (Table I). The presence of hTAFII150, together with the additional TAFIIs, in TFTC may account for the promoter specific sequence binding capability and the transcription initiation activity of TFTC (3Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and explain the functional differences observed between TFTC and the other TAFII-HAT complexes. The PCAF complex contains hPAF65β, a WD40 repeat-containing factor having similarity to hTAFII100 (5Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against hPAF65β revealed a band around 65 kDa in both the PCAF and the TFTC complexes (Fig. 2), indicating that hPAF65β is a subunit of TFTC. Note, that a monoclonal antibody raised against hTAFII100 recognized hTAFII100 not only in TFTC, but detected also a weak band in the PCAF complex (Fig. 2), indicating that the presence of several WD40 repeat containing proteins in these complexes is not mutually exclusive. Taken together the above results indicate that hTFTC, hPCAF-GCN5, and ySAGA complexes share very similar, but not identical, polypeptide composition (Table I). This suggests that different TAFII-HAT complexes may exist to carry out distinct but related functions. RNA polymerase II subunits, general transcription factors, and components of the Srb-mediator complex are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Moreover, many SAGA components have human homologues in the TFTC and PCAF-GCN5 complexes. Thus, the gene regulatory mechanisms regulated by the TAFII-GCN5-HAT complexes seem to be conserved in all eukaryotes. The differences observed in the polypeptide composition of the distinct TBP-free TAFII-HAT complexes suggest that different subpopulations of TAFII-GCN5-HAT complexes may exist in the cells (Table I). Thus, these different TAFII-HAT complexes may permit a broad range of regulatory capabilities in pol II transcription. It is likely that several components of the TAFII-HAT complexes provide interaction surfaces for distinct activators (i.e.TRRAP for c-Myc or E2F-1 or ADA3 for NRs). This complex network of interactions may then lead to the recruitment of the TAFII-GCN5-HAT complexes, to specific acetylation of the nucleosomes surrounding the promoters, and subsequently to efficient initiation and activation of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1966949090,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that displays 19-25% sequence identity to the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. All three groups of receptors have a large amino-terminal domain (ATD), which for the mGlu receptors has been shown to bind the endogenous agonist. To investigate whether the agonist-binding domain of the CaR also is located in the ATD, we constructed a chimeric receptor named Ca/1a consisting of the ATD of CaR and the seven transmembrane region and C terminus of mGlu1a. The Ca/1a receptor stimulated inositol phosphate production when exposed to the cationic agonists Ca2+, Mg2+, and Ba2+ in transiently transfected tsA cells (a transformed HEK 293 cell line). The pharmacological profile of Ca/1a (EC50 values of 3.3, 2.6, and 3.9 mM for these cations, respectively) was very similar to that of the wild-type CaR (EC50 values of 3.2, 4.7, and 4.1 mM, respectively). For the mGlu1a receptor, it has been shown that Ser-165 and Thr-188, which are located in the ATD, are involved in the agonist binding. An alignment of CaR with the mGlu receptors showed that these two amino acid residues have been conserved in CaR as Ser-147 and Ser-170, respectively. Each of these residues was mutated to alanines and tested pharmacologically using the endogenous agonist Ca2+. CaR-S147A showed an impaired function as compared with wild-type CaR both with respect to potency of Ca2+ (4-fold increase in EC50) and maximal response (79% of wild-type response). CaR-S170A showed no significant response to Ca2+ even at 50 mM concentration. In contrast, each of the two adjacent mutations, S169A and S171A, resulted in pharmacological profiles almost identical to that of the wild-type receptor. These data demonstrate that Ser-170 and to some extent Ser-147 are involved in the Ca2+ activation of the CaR, and taken together, our results reveal a close resemblance of the activation mechanism between the CaR and the mGlu receptors."

In this study we have shown that SPA-1 interferes with Rap1 activation by membrane-targeted C3G, C3G-F, in 293T cells through the GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity. SPA-1 transiently expressed in HeLa cells was mostly localized at the cortical cytoskeleton and induced rounding up of the cells, whereas C3G-F conversely induced extensive cell spreading. Conditional SPA-1 overexpression in HeLa cells by tetracycline-regulative system suppressed Rap1 activation upon plating on dishes coated with fibronectin and resulted in the reduced adhesion. When SPA-1 was conditionally induced after the established cell adhesion, the cells gradually rounded up and detached from the dish. Both effects were counteracted by exogenous fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner.

Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that Rap1 GTP antagonizes the Ras signaling pathways (13Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A.

In some of these, it has been shown that Rap1 is activated by C3G recruited by the CRK adapter protein (18Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M.

Together with the presence of multiple Rap1-regulatory proteins with unique signaling motifs and distinct tissue distribution patterns, these results suggest that Rap1 is activated in multiple signal transduction pathways depending on the cell types. The exact functions of Rap1 in the cells, however, still remain largely unknown.In the present study, we first indicate that SPA-1 and C3G regulate Rap1 activation antagonistically to each other in the cells, in which the former interferes with the activation of endogenous Rap1 by the latter. Conditional overexpression of SPA-1 in HeLa cells resulted in the inhibition of Rap1 activation and reduced adhesion upon contact to the substrate and the detachment of the cells when induced after the establishment of cell adhesion, both of which could be overcome dose-dependently by exogenous fibronectin. Also, retroviral overexpression of SPA-1 in the nonadherent promyelocytic 32D cells inhibited the activation of Rap1 and the induction of cell adhesion by G-CSF stimulation. Thus, the present results have indicated that Rap1 activation is critically involved in the cell adhesion induced by both ECM and soluble factors and that SPA-1 functions as a negative regulator for the activation of Rap1, thereby setting a threshold for cell adhesion.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have indicated that SPA-1 interferes with the activation of Rap1 by C3G bearing a CAAX motif (C3G-F) in 293T cells. In the presence of excess SPA-1, efficiency of Rap1 activation by the transfected C3G-F was markedly reduced, strongly suggesting that SPA-1 can control the threshold against the activation of Rap1 in the cells. HeLa cells transiently transfected with Spa-1 cDNA tended to show smaller and round cell shape, whereas those transfected with C3G-F cDNA conversely exhibited more enlarged and flattened shape with extensive cytoplasmic protrusions. Recently, overexpression of v-Crk that can bind and recruit C3G has been reported to induce cell spreading and focal adhesion formation in PC12 cells (27Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. de Graaf P. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner J.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The effect was confirmed in HeLa cells that could conditionally overexpress SPA-1 by the tetracycline-regulative system (SPA/HeLa). SPA/HeLa cells were indistinguishable from parental cells, whereas, upon induction of SPA-1 by removing Dox from the culture, the tightly adherent cells gradually became round and detached from the dish. The results have strongly suggested that sustained activation of Rap1 is needed for cells to maintain the adherent state. When non-induced SPA/HeLa cells in suspension were plated on dishes and allowed to adhere, Rap1GTP was significantly increased. In contrast, no detectable activation of Rap1 was observed in SPA/HeLa cells that had been induced with SPA-1. When plated onto dishes coated with fibronectin, such induced SPA/HeLa cells showed significant generation of Rap1GTP, yet much less than in parental cells. Concomitantly, they showed reduced adhesion to exogenous fibronectin. Thus, it has been indicated that SPA-1 negatively regulates both initiation and maintenance of cell adhesion.The effect of SPA-1 was further investigated in the nonadherent 32D cells, in which cell adhesion is induced by specific soluble factor. Following the stimulation with G-CSF, Rap1 GTP was generated within a day and increased thereafter. In an attempt to prevent the accumulation of Rap1 GTP following the G-CSF stimulation, we transduced Spa-1 cDNA into 32D cells using a recombinant retrovirus (32D/SPA-1). As expected, the generation of Rap1GTP following G-CSF stimulation was nearly completely suppressed in the 32D/SPA-1. Concomitantly, 32D/SPA-1 cells remained totally nonadherent in the presence of G-CSF. The effect was not observed in 32D cells transduced with ΔGRD-Spa-1 retrovirus, indicating that Rap1 GAP activity was required for the effect. We have reported previously that the endogenous SPA-1 is markedly down-regulated in human HL60 promyeloid cells preceding the induction of cell adhesion and extensive spreading by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (11Kurachi H. Wada Y. Tsukamoto N. Maeda M. Kubota H. Hattori M. Iwai K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28081-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand, morphological differentiation into polymorphonuclear granulocytes by G-CSF occurred in 32D/SPA-1 comparably to the wild type cells, indicating that the G-CSF receptor per se functioned normally in 32D/SPA-1 cells. Expression levels of both integrins β1 and β2 following G-CSF stimulation were unaffected either by SPA-1 overexpression.These results have indicated collectively that Rap1 is activated either by the adherence to substratum in intrinsically adherent HeLa cells or by the specific soluble factor G-CSF in nonadherent hematopoietic 32D cells, and in both types of cells Rap1GTP is required for the cell adherence and possibly for cell spreading. It appears that sustained presence of Rap1 GTP is required to maintain the cell adhesion. SPA-1 not only inhibits the activation of Rap1 upon contact with substrates but also reduces the accumulated Rap1 GTP pool in the adherent state, thereby interfering with both initiation and maintenance of cell adhesion. Cell adhesion to the ECM via integrins results in the activation of tyrosine kinases such as Src and FAK, which phosphorylate focal adhesion molecules including FAK itself, paxillin, and Cas (28Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that Crk adapter protein is recruited to the focal adhesion complex via SH2 domain (28Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar), it seems possible that Rap1 can be activated there. In addition to C3G that can bind to Crk, distinct Rap1GEFs directly activated by the common second messengers have been recently identified (7Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen which Rap1GEF is primarily responsible for Rap1 activation by ECM in HeLa or by G-CSF in 32D cells. Rho GTPases involved in the cytoskeletal reorganization are also activated by both extracellular soluble factors and insoluble ECMs in fibroblasts (29Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In human T cells, however, inactivation of Rho GTPase by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme was reported to show no effect on the cell adhesion to ECMper se, whereas it inhibited the costimulatory activity for T cell receptor-mediated activation (30Woodside D.G. Wooten D.K. McIntyre B.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).How Rap1GTP is involved in the cell adhesion and spreading remains to be investigated. Recently, molecules that specifically bind to Rap1GTP have been identified, including a group of RalGEFs such as RalGDS (31Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and Rgr (32Wolthuis R.M. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that can activate Ral GTPase. Furthermore, one of the Ral GTP-binding proteins (RalBP1) has been shown to be a GAP for Rho family GTPases (34Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These results may imply that ECM- or receptor-coupled Rap1 signaling pathway converges to other small GTPases including Rho family GTPases at the cytoskeletal compartment. In this aspect, it is particularly noted that a substantial portion of SPA-1 is located at the cytoskeletal compartment along with Rap1. It has been reported also that Rap1 is translocated rapidly to the cytoskeleton upon activation in platelets (35Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. Lacal J.C. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19405-19408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPA-1 has a PDZ domain followed by leucine zipper motif (37Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which potentially mediates the interaction with cytoskeletal elements (38Ranganathan R. Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R770-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our unpublished results, on the other hand, have indicated that overexpression of rapGAP, which lacks above domains and is located mostly in the cytosolic soluble fraction, hardly affects the cell adhesion in the same HeLa/Tet-off system. 2M. Hattori and N. Minato, unpublished observation. These results altogether suggest that the cytoskeletal association of SPA-1 is crucially important for the regulation of cell adhesion by setting a threshold for Rap1 activation via various external signals.We have indicated previously that the Spa-1 gene is expressed most abundantly in normal lymphohematopoietic cells (11Kurachi H. Wada Y. Tsukamoto N. Maeda M. Kubota H. Hattori M. Iwai K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28081-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), in particular mature peripheral lymphocytes. 3N. Minato, unpublished observation. One of the most characteristic features of them is to recirculate in the blood and lymphatics. Under the particular situations such as antigenic stimulation and production of chemotaxic factors in inflammation, however, they are trapped rapidly at the secondary lymphoid tissues or inflammatory sites, where they are activated and/or proliferate. In such mobile cells, polarized regulation of cell adhesion within a cell is shown to play critical roles for cellular interactions and cell movement such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, antigen-presentation, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (39Sanchez-Madrid F. Angel del Pozo M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell adhesion plays important roles in the signal transduction for both cell differentiation and proliferation (28Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mice targeted for Spa-1 gene, which we have recently developed, should help to understand the roles Rap1 and SPA-1 play in vivo. Rap1 is the closest member of Ras family small GTPases (1Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Mammalian Rap1 was isolated by cross-hybridization with aDrosophila ras-related gene (2Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar) and was reported to revert “malignant” morphology of oncogenic Ras-transformed 3T3 cells to “normal” phenotype (3Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 can be regulated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; GAP, GTPase activating protein; G-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras binding domain; GRD, GAP-related domain; IL-3, interleukin 3; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; wt, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; GAP, GTPase activating protein; G-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras binding domain; GRD, GAP-related domain; IL-3, interleukin 3; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; wt, wild type.catalyzing the conversion from GDP- to GTP-bound forms and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) accelerating the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP (4Bos J.L.

C3G, originally isolated as a binding protein to v-crk oncogene product (5Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), has been shown to exhibit Rap1 GEF activity (6Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H.

Most recently, other Rap1 GEFs have been isolated including CalDAG GEFI and Epac, which are regulated by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol and cAMP, respectively (7Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, at least two distinct proteins are shown at present to exhibit specific Rap1 GAP activityin vitro, rapGAP (10Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and SPA-1 (11Kurachi H. Wada Y. Tsukamoto N. Maeda M. Kubota H. Hattori M. Iwai K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28081-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Expression profiles ofrapGAP and Spa-1 genes are quite distinct, in that the former is selectively expressed in brain, pancreas, and kidney and the latter predominantly in lymphohematopoietic tissues (11Kurachi H.

Recently, an arginine finger motif conserved in the shared catalytic domains of rapGAP and SPA-1 has been proposed to be essential for their GAP activity (12Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Based on the findings that Rap1 shares the effector domain with Ras and binds to several Ras effector molecules (13Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A.

On the other hand, morphological differentiation into polymorphonuclear granulocytes by G-CSF occurred in 32D/SPA-1 comparably to the wild type cells, indicating that the G-CSF receptor per se functioned normally in 32D/SPA-1 cells. Expression levels of both integrins β1 and β2 following G-CSF stimulation were unaffected either by SPA-1 overexpression.These results have indicated collectively that Rap1 is activated either by the adherence to substratum in intrinsically adherent HeLa cells or by the specific soluble factor G-CSF in nonadherent hematopoietic 32D cells, and in both types of cells Rap1GTP is required for the cell adherence and possibly for cell spreading. It appears that sustained presence of Rap1 GTP is required to maintain the cell adhesion. SPA-1 not only inhibits the activation of Rap1 upon contact with substrates but also reduces the accumulated Rap1 GTP pool in the adherent state, thereby interfering with both initiation and maintenance of cell adhesion. Cell adhesion to the ECM via integrins results in the activation of tyrosine kinases such as Src and FAK, which phosphorylate focal adhesion molecules including FAK itself, paxillin, and Cas (28Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that Crk adapter protein is recruited to the focal adhesion complex via SH2 domain (28Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar), it seems possible that Rap1 can be activated there. In addition to C3G that can bind to Crk, distinct Rap1GEFs directly activated by the common second messengers have been recently identified (7Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P.

Rho GTPases involved in the cytoskeletal reorganization are also activated by both extracellular soluble factors and insoluble ECMs in fibroblasts (29Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In human T cells, however, inactivation of Rho GTPase by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme was reported to show no effect on the cell adhesion to ECMper se, whereas it inhibited the costimulatory activity for T cell receptor-mediated activation (30Woodside D.G. Wooten D.K. McIntyre B.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).How Rap1GTP is involved in the cell adhesion and spreading remains to be investigated. Recently, molecules that specifically bind to Rap1GTP have been identified, including a group of RalGEFs such as RalGDS (31Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and Rgr (32Wolthuis R.M. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that can activate Ral GTPase. Furthermore, one of the Ral GTP-binding proteins (RalBP1) has been shown to be a GAP for Rho family GTPases (34Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These results may imply that ECM- or receptor-coupled Rap1 signaling pathway converges to other small GTPases including Rho family GTPases at the cytoskeletal compartment. In this aspect, it is particularly noted that a substantial portion of SPA-1 is located at the cytoskeletal compartment along with Rap1. It has been reported also that Rap1 is translocated rapidly to the cytoskeleton upon activation in platelets (35Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. Lacal J.C. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19405-19408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. McCormick F. Duffy C.M. White II, G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17257-17261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPA-1 has a PDZ domain followed by leucine zipper motif (37Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which potentially mediates the interaction with cytoskeletal elements (38Ranganathan R. Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R770-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our unpublished results, on the other hand, have indicated that overexpression of rapGAP, which lacks above domains and is located mostly in the cytosolic soluble fraction, hardly affects the cell adhesion in the same HeLa/Tet-off system. 2M. Hattori and N. Minato, unpublished observation. These results altogether suggest that the cytoskeletal association of SPA-1 is crucially important for the regulation of cell adhesion by setting a threshold for Rap1 activation via various external signals.We have indicated previously that the Spa-1 gene is expressed most abundantly in normal lymphohematopoietic cells (11Kurachi H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28081-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), in particular mature peripheral lymphocytes. 3N. Minato, unpublished observation. One of the most characteristic features of them is to recirculate in the blood and lymphatics. Under the particular situations such as antigenic stimulation and production of chemotaxic factors in inflammation, however, they are trapped rapidly at the secondary lymphoid tissues or inflammatory sites, where they are activated and/or proliferate. In such mobile cells, polarized regulation of cell adhesion within a cell is shown to play critical roles for cellular interactions and cell movement such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, antigen-presentation, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (39Sanchez-Madrid F. Angel del Pozo M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell adhesion plays important roles in the signal transduction for both cell differentiation and proliferation (28Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mice targeted for Spa-1 gene, which we have recently developed, should help to understand the roles Rap1 and SPA-1 play in vivo. In the present study, we have indicated that SPA-1 interferes with the activation of Rap1 by C3G bearing a CAAX motif (C3G-F) in 293T cells. In the presence of excess SPA-1, efficiency of Rap1 activation by the transfected C3G-F was markedly reduced, strongly suggesting that SPA-1 can control the threshold against the activation of Rap1 in the cells. HeLa cells transiently transfected with Spa-1 cDNA tended to show smaller and round cell shape, whereas those transfected with C3G-F cDNA conversely exhibited more enlarged and flattened shape with extensive cytoplasmic protrusions. Recently, overexpression of v-Crk that can bind and recruit C3G has been reported to induce cell spreading and focal adhesion formation in PC12 cells (27Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. de Graaf P. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner J.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The effect was confirmed in HeLa cells that could conditionally overexpress SPA-1 by the tetracycline-regulative system (SPA/HeLa). SPA/HeLa cells were indistinguishable from parental cells, whereas, upon induction of SPA-1 by removing Dox from the culture, the tightly adherent cells gradually became round and detached from the dish. The results have strongly suggested that sustained activation of Rap1 is needed for cells to maintain the adherent state. When non-induced SPA/HeLa cells in suspension were plated on dishes and allowed to adhere, Rap1GTP was significantly increased. In contrast, no detectable activation of Rap1 was observed in SPA/HeLa cells that had been induced with SPA-1. When plated onto dishes coated with fibronectin, such induced SPA/HeLa cells showed significant generation of Rap1GTP, yet much less than in parental cells. Concomitantly, they showed reduced adhesion to exogenous fibronectin. Thus, it has been indicated that SPA-1 negatively regulates both initiation and maintenance of cell adhesion. The effect of SPA-1 was further investigated in the nonadherent 32D cells, in which cell adhesion is induced by specific soluble factor. Following the stimulation with G-CSF, Rap1 GTP was generated within a day and increased thereafter. In an attempt to prevent the accumulation of Rap1 GTP following the G-CSF stimulation, we transduced Spa-1 cDNA into 32D cells using a recombinant retrovirus (32D/SPA-1). As expected, the generation of Rap1GTP following G-CSF stimulation was nearly completely suppressed in the 32D/SPA-1. Concomitantly, 32D/SPA-1 cells remained totally nonadherent in the presence of G-CSF. The effect was not observed in 32D cells transduced with ΔGRD-Spa-1 retrovirus, indicating that Rap1 GAP activity was required for the effect. We have reported previously that the endogenous SPA-1 is markedly down-regulated in human HL60 promyeloid cells preceding the induction of cell adhesion and extensive spreading by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (11Kurachi H.

The tethered ligand, once exposed, is always available to interact with its binding site. Thus, efficient mechanisms must prevent continuous activation, including receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling from G-proteins, receptor endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation. β-Arrestins mediate uncoupling and endocytosis of certain neurotransmitter receptors, which are activated in a reversible manner. However, the role of β-arrestins in trafficking of PARs, which are irreversibly activated, and the effects of proteases on the subcellular distribution of β-arrestins have not been examined. We studied trafficking of PAR2 and β-arrestin1 coupled to green fluorescent protein. Trypsin induced the following: (a) redistribution of β-arrestin1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it co-localized with PAR2; (b) internalization of β-arrestin1 and PAR2 into the same early endosomes; (c) redistribution of β-arrestin1 to the cytosol concurrent with PAR2 translocation to lysosomes; and (d) mobilization of PAR2 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of a C-terminal fragment of β-arrestin-319–418, which interacts constitutively with clathrin but does not bind receptors, inhibited agonist-induced endocytosis of PAR2.

In view of the potential importance of PAR2 in normal regulation, inflammation, and mitogenesis, it is important to understand the mechanisms that terminate PAR2 signaling. Although we have shown that trypsin induces endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of PAR2 (23Böhm S.K. Khitin L.M. Grady E.F. Aponte G. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22003-22016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), agonist-induced trafficking of PAR2 and β-arrestin1 has not been examined in real time, and the role of β-arrestins in PAR2 endocytosis is unknown.The purpose of the present study was to investigate agonist-induced trafficking of β-arrestin1 and PAR2 and to determine the role of β-arrestins in trafficking of PAR2. To examine trafficking of PAR2 and β-arrestin1 in real time, we expressed chimeras of these proteins and green fluorescent protein (GFP). To determine the role of β-arrestins in PAR2 trafficking, we expressed a C-terminal fragment, β-arrestin319–418, that serves as a dominant negative mutant for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (34Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Our aims were as follows: (a) generate cell lines expressing PAR2-GFP or wild type PAR2 plus β-arrestin1-GFP (ARR-GFP) or dominant negative β-arrestin-GFP (ARR319–418-GFP); (b) verify that GFP did not affect PAR2 signaling, desensitization, or trafficking or the capacity of β-arrestin to participate in these processes; (c) examine agonist-induced redistribution of PAR2 and β-arrestin1 in real time; (d) determine the fate of endocytosed PAR2 and β-arrestin1; and (e) investigate the role of β-arrestins in PAR2 endocytosis.RESULTSGeneration of Cell Lines Expressing PAR2-GFP and PAR2 Plus ARR-GFP or ARR319–418-GFPKNRK cells were used for transfection since we have extensively studied signaling and trafficking of PAR2 and other GPCRs in this cell line (23Böhm S.K.

The mechanism of PAR2 desensitization in KNRK cells resembles that observed in enterocytes (23Böhm S.K. Khitin L.M. Grady E.F. Aponte G. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22003-22016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, KNRK cells regulate PAR2 similarly to cells that naturally express this receptor.We transfected KNRK cells with cDNA encoding PAR2-GFP in a neomycin-resistant vector or with PAR2 in a hygromycin-resistant vector plus ARR-GFP or ARR319–418-GFP in neomycin-resistant vectors. We screened cells by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to obtain clonal cell lines. KNRK-PAR2-GFP clone 3C was used in all experiments since analysis by flow cytometry revealed a single population of cells that expressed PAR2-GFP at a high level (Fig.2 A). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the high, uniform expression of PAR2-GFP, which was detected at the plasma membrane and in a prominent perinuclear pool (Fig.2 B). KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP clone 16 was selected since analysis by flow cytometry identified a single population of cells that expressed PAR2 and β-arrestin1 at a high and uniform level (Fig.2 A). ARR-GFP was cytosolic with no detectable localization at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the co-expression of PAR2 and ARR-GFP (e.g. Fig.6). Thus, there is no co-localization of PAR2 and β-arrestin1 in the unstimulated state. KNRK-PAR2 + ARR319–418-GFP clone 17 was selected since flow cytometry indicated that a large proportion of these cells co-expressed PAR2 and ARR319–418-GFP (Fig.2 A). ARR319–418-GFP had a punctate distribution throughout the cell which resembles the distribution of clathrin in KNRK cells (37Grady E.F. Garland A.G. Gamp P.D. Lovett M. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Since ARR319–418-GFP constitutively interacts with clathrin (34Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), it is probable that this protein is co-localized with clathrin in KNRK-PAR2 + ARR319–418-GFP cells.Figure 6Localization of PAR2 and ARR-GFP in KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells. Cells were exposed to carrier (0 min, control) or 10 nm trypsin for 2–60 min at 37 °C. PAR2 was localized with the HA.11 antibody and a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (left panels). β-Arrestin1 was localized with GFP (center panels). Images in the right panels are formed by superimposition of images from the two other panels in the same row. In carrier-treated cells at 0 min, PAR2 was at the cell surface (arrow heads) and ARR-GFP was cytosolic (arrows), with no co-localization. After 2 min incubation with trypsin, PAR2 was still at the cell surface (white arrowheads) and ARR-GFP was also at the plasma membrane (yellow arrowheads) in close proximity to PAR2. After 5 min with trypsin, both PAR2 and ARR-GFP were co-localized at the plasma membrane (white arrowheads). After 10–60 min with trypsin, PAR2 and ARR-GFP were co-localized in vesicles in the superficial, then in the perinuclear location (white arrows). Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We analyzed cells by Western blotting with a GFP antibody to determine whether chimeric proteins of the predicted size were expressed. The antibody detected recombinant GFP with an apparent mass of ∼27 kDa (Fig. 2 C). A broad protein band of ∼60–90 kDa was detected in extracts of KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells. The predicted mass of human PAR2 is ∼44 kDa, but there is one consensus site forN-linked glycosylation. Therefore, this protein probably represents glycosylated PAR2-GFP. A prominent protein of ∼75 kDa was detected in extracts of KNRK-PAR2+ARR-GFP cells, which corresponds to the known mass of β-arrestin1 (∼48 kDa) plus GFP (∼27 kDa). A protein band of ∼40 kDa was detected in extracts of KNRK-PAR2+ARR319–418-GFP cells, which corresponds to the known mass of β-arrestin-319–418 (∼12 kDa) plus GFP (∼27 kDa). The level of expression of ARR-GFP was higher that of ARR319–418-GFP, as judged by the intensity of the immunoreactive proteins. Thus, the GFP antibody recognizes proteins of the predicted sizes in transfected cell lines. The GFP antibody is specific because it did not interact with proteins in extracts of untransfected KNRK cells, and preabsorption of the antibody with GFP-GST fusion protein markedly diminished the signal in transfected cells.Functional Characterization of Cells Expressing PAR2-GFP and PAR2 Plus ARR-GFP or ARR319–418-GFPAlthough GFP is a compact protein that has been attached to other GPCRs and β-arrestin2 without affecting signaling or trafficking (38Tarasova N.I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), it is important to verify that GFP does not affect the function of each protein to which it is coupled. To determine if GFP affected PAR2 signaling, we measured trypsin- and AP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells, KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells, and KNRK-PAR2 + ARR319–418-GFP cells. In all cell lines, trypsin and AP strongly stimulated Ca2+mobilization, although the concentration-response curve for cells expressing PAR2-GFP was right-shifted for both trypsin and AP (Fig.3 A). We did not complete full concentration-response curves for all cell lines, and thus we cannot accurately determine the efficacy and EC50 values of the responses. However, approximate EC50 values were as follows: KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells, trypsin 10 nm, AP 20 μm; KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells, trypsin 2 nm, AP 2 μm; KNRK-PAR2-ARR319–418-GFP cells, trypsin 2 nm, AP 7 μm (mean,n = 3 experiments). In KNRK cells expressing wild type human PAR-2, we have previously reported that trypsin and AP stimulate Ca2+ mobilization with potencies of 2 nm and 18 μm, respectively (28Böhm S.K. Kong W. Brömme D. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Connolly A. Kahn M. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, trypsin and AP are slightly less potent agonists in cells expressing PAR2-GFP. In all cell lines, 10 nm trypsin induced a prompt increase in [Ca2+]i which was maximal within a few seconds and which declined to 50% of the maximal levels within 19 ± 2 s for KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells, 21 ± 1 s for KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells, and 99 ± 13 s for KNRK-PAR2 + ARR319–418-GFP cells (mean ± S.E., n= 3 experiments) (Fig. 3, B–D). Therefore, the increase in [Ca2+]i is more prolonged in cells expressing ARR319–418-GFP.Figure 3Trypsin and AP induced Ca2+mobilization in KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells, KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells, and KNRK-PAR2 + ARR 319–418 -GFP cells. A, cells were exposed to graded concentrations of trypsin or AP (SLIGKV-NH2), and the peak response was subtracted from the basal value to determine the change in the fluorescence ratio (n = 3–6 observations). B and C,cells were exposed to carrier (control) or 10 nm trypsin for 2 min, washed, and then exposed to 10 nm trypsin 5 min after the first challenge. Representative results from 3 observations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine desensitization, we exposed cells to 10 nmtrypsin, 100 μm AP, or carrier (control) for 2 min, washed cells, and challenged them again with 10 nm trypsin or 100 μm AP 5 min after the first challenge. The magnitude of responses to the second challenge was compared with the response of carrier-treated cells to determine the extent of desensitization (Fig. 3, B–D). In KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells, exposure to trypsin caused 88 ± 5% desensitization to a second trypsin exposure, and exposure to AP caused 45 ± 4% desensitization to a second AP exposure (mean ± S.E.,n = 3 experiments). In KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells, desensitization to trypsin was 52 ± 10%, and desensitization to AP was 21 ± 18%. In KNRK-PAR2-ARR319–418GFP cells, desensitization to trypsin was 91 ± 2%, and desensitization to AP was 48 ± 5%. Thus, in all cell lines, trypsin induces stronger desensitization than AP. We have previously reported that trypsin more strongly desensitizes Ca2+ mobilization than does AP in KNRK cells expressing wild type PAR2 (23Böhm S.K. Khitin L.M. Grady E.F. Aponte G. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22003-22016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Desensitization to trypsin and AP was less in cells expressing ARR-GFP.Together, these results indicate that GFP has only minor effects on PAR2-mediated signaling, on desensitization of signal transduction, or on the ability of β-arrestin1 to participate in desensitization.Trypsin-induced Trafficking of PAR2-GFP and ARR-GFP in Real TimePAR2-GFPWe have previously examined trypsin- and AP-induced trafficking of PAR2 in populations of cells fixed at various times after stimulation (23Böhm S.K.

We examined the effects of trypsin on the subcellular distribution of PAR2-GFP in individual KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells in real time. Before addition of trypsin, PAR2-GFP was detected at the plasma membrane and in a perinuclear compartment (Fig.4). After 2–5 min incubation with 10 nm trypsin at 37 °C, PAR2-GFP was observed at the plasma membrane and in a few superficial vesicles. After 10 min, PAR2-GFP was prominently detected in vesicles in a peripheral and a perinuclear location, and there was diminished localization at the plasma membrane. After 30–60 min, PAR2-GFP was present in vesicles in a perinuclear location.Figure 4Real time trypsin-induced trafficking of PAR2-GFP in the same KNRK-PAR2-GFP cells. Cells were observed before and after addition of trypsin (10 nm). Note the redistribution of PAR2-GFP from the plasma membrane (0 min,arrowheads) to vesicles located immediately beneath the plasma membrane (2–10 min, arrows), and finally to a cluster of vesicles in a perinuclear location (30, 60 min,arrows).

Before addition of trypsin, ARR-GFP was uniformly distributed in the cytosol and was not detected at the plasma membrane or in vesicles (Fig.5). After 2–5 min incubation with 10 nm trypsin at 37 °C, ARR-GFP was prominently detected at the plasma membrane and in a few superficial vesicles. After 10 min, ARR-GFP was present in vesicles in a peripheral and a perinuclear location and was no longer present at the plasma membrane. After 30–60 min, ARR-GFP was detected in vesicles in a perinuclear location, and the intensity of the signal in the cytoplasm was diminished.Figure 5Real time trypsin-induced trafficking of ARR-GFP in the same KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells. Cells were observed before and after addition of trypsin (10 nm). Note the redistribution of ARR-GFP from the cytosol (0 min, arrows), to the plasma membrane (2 and 5 min, arrowheads), to vesicles located immediately beneath the plasma membrane (10 min,arrows), and finally to a cluster of vesicles in a perinuclear location (30 and 60 min, arrows). Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thus, trypsin induces rapid redistribution of PAR2-GFP from the plasma membrane and into vesicles in a superficial and then a perinuclear location and stimulates translocation of ARR-GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, followed by redistribution to endosomes. At 2–5 min, PAR2-GFP was detected in endosomes and at the plasma membrane, and ARR-GFP was usually present at the plasma membrane. Both proteins were clearly detected in endosomes at 10 min. If β-arrestin1 mediates endocytosis of PAR2, we would expect membrane translocation of β-arrestin1 to precede PAR2 endocytosis and that β-arrestin1 would co-localize with PAR2 in vesicles. However, this possibility could not be investigated by observation of different cell populations in real time, when only a few cells were examined in any one experiment.Simultaneous Localization of PAR2 and ARR-GFPTo examine the effect of trypsin on the subcellular distribution of PAR2 and β-arrestin1 in the same cells, we simultaneously localized these proteins in KNRK-PAR2 + ARR-GFP cells by using an antibody to the C-terminal 12CA5 epitope and a Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody to detect PA"
https://openalex.org/W2120765836,"The effects of acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) and insulin on free fatty acid (FFA) release from isolated human fat cells and the signal transduction pathways to induce these effects were studied. ASP and insulin inhibited basal and norepinephrine-induced FFA release by stimulating fractional FFA re-esterification (both to the same extent) and by inhibiting FFA produced during lipolysis (ASP to a lesser extent than insulin). Protein kinase C inhibition influenced none of the effects of ASP or insulin. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition counteracted the effects of insulin but not of ASP. Phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) activity was stimulated by ASP and insulin, whereas PDE4 activity was slightly increased by ASP only. Selective PDE3 inhibition reversed the effects of both ASP and insulin on fractional FFA re-esterification and lipolysis. Selective PDE4 inhibition slightly counteracted the ASP but not the effect of insulin on fractional FFA re-esterification and did not prevent the action of ASP or insulin on lipolysis. Thus, ASP and insulin play a major role in regulating FFA release from fat cells as follows: insulin by stimulating fractional FFA re-esterification and inhibiting lipolysis and ASP mainly by stimulating fractional FFA re-esterification. For both ASP and insulin these effects on FFA release are mediated by PDE3, and for ASP PDE4 might also be involved.

This is mainly the result of two processes occurring simultaneously in the fat cell, lipolysis and FFA re-esterification. During lipolysis, triglyceride molecules are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol, which are released from the fat cell. Some of the FFA formed during lipolysis can be re-esterified to triglycerides (1Steinberg D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1963; 24: 111-138PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1992; 263: E1063-E1069PubMed Google Scholar). Primary re-esterification is the total amount of FFA that is re-esterified during a given situation and reflects the triglyceride synthesis capacity of the fat cells (7Edens N.K. Leibel R.L. Hirsch J.J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1423-1431PubMed Google Scholar). Fractional re-esterification is the proportion of FFA re-esterified in relation to the amount of FFA formed by lipolysis in fat cells (4Campbell P.J. Carlson M.G. Hill J.O. Nurjhan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1063-E1069PubMed Google Scholar). The latter constitutes a futile cycle, energy-rich FFA first being formed by lipolysis of triglycerides and then synthesized to triglycerides without the achievement of any net biochemical work. The mechanism by which the release of FFA from fat cells is regulated is only partly known; insulin has been shown to inhibit lipolysis in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- (PI3K) and phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3)-dependent manner (8Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and to stimulate fractional re-esterification (9Campbell P.J. Carlson M.G. Nurjhan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E600-E605PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in inhibition of FFA release. However, little is known about the signal transduction pathways involved in the action of insulin on FFA re-esterification, although PI3K seems to be involved (10Zierath J.R. Livingstone J.N. Thorne A. Bolinder J. Reynisdottir S. Lonnqvist F. Arner P. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1343-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Another protein with a potentially important effect on FFA release from human fat cells is acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) (for a review see Ref. 11Cianflone K. Clin. Biochem. 1997; 30: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Human fat cells synthesize and secrete three proteins in the complement family as follows: the third component of complement (C3), factor D (adipsin), and factor B. They interact to form C3a-des-Arg which is identical to ASP (12Schreiber R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1722-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Lesavre P.H.

It has been shown that ASP is a potent stimulator of triglyceride synthesis in human skin fibroblasts and fat cells (16Baldo A. Sniderman A.D. St-Luce S. Kohen R. Maslowska M. Hoang B. Monge J.C. Bell A. Mulay S. Cianflone K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. Walsh M.J. Vu H. Gagnon J. Rodriguez M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After interaction with a specific membrane receptor (18Cianflone K.M. Maslowska M.H. Sniderman A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it triggers a protein kinase C (PKC) pathway (19Baldo A. Sniderman A.D. St-Luce S. Zhang X.J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in two effects. First, ASP increases glucose transport by promoting the translocation of glucose transporters from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (20Germinario R. Sniderman A.D. Manuel S. Pratt S. Baldo A. Cianflone K. Metabolism. 1993; 40: 574-580Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Maslowska M. Scantlebury T. Germinario R. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tao Y. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. Colby-Germinario S.P. Germinario R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The intracellular glucose can be used as the backbone of the triglyceride molecule, glycerol 3-phosphate. Second, ASP increases the activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the final and rate-limiting step in triglyceride synthesis (23Yasruel Z. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. Rosenbloom M. Walsh M. Rodriguez M.A. Lipids. 1991; 26: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These effects of ASP are additive to and independent of those observed with insulin (20Germinario R. Sniderman A.D. Manuel S. Pratt S. Baldo A. Cianflone K. Metabolism. 1993; 40: 574-580Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar,24Walsh M.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Vu H. Rodriguez M.A. Forse R.A. J. Surg. Res. 1989; 46: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The action of ASP on FFA release from fat cells, on the other hand, is unknown. The first aim of the present study was to determine the effect of ASP on FFA produced and re-esterified during lipolysis in isolated human subcutaneous fat cells and to compare these effects with those of insulin. The second aim was to investigate which intracellular signaling pathways for ASP and insulin control their effects on FFA release. One focus was on PKC and PI3K which are reported to be linked to the known effects of ASP and insulin, respectively, in fat cells. A second focus was on signaling downstream of PKC and PI3K. For the latter purpose, the roles of PDE3 and PDE4 were examined. These PDE subtypes are present in fat cells (25Shechter Y. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) where they regulate lipolysis by modifying intracellular cyclic AMP levels. PDE3 is known to be the key enzyme involved in the antilipolytic action of insulin (8Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis was that PDE3 and other PDEs might regulate hormone effects on FFA re-esterification as well. The study group consisted of 36 subjects who underwent elective open abdominal surgery for non-malignant disorders (gallstone, hernia, and gastric banding for obesity). According to patient history, the subjects were healthy except for the surgical diagnosis. None was on regular medication or had undergone a recent weight reduction program. The subjects, who had fasted overnight, were anesthetized at 8.00 a.m., as described in detail (26Large V. Reynisdottir S. Eleborg E. Van Harmelen V. Strömmer L. Arner P. Int. J. Obes. 1997; 21: 78-82Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Before taking the fat biopsy, only saline was administered intravenously. Immediately after the abdominal wall had been opened, a specimen of subcutaneous fat tissue (2–5 g) was obtained from the surgical incision and immediately transported to the laboratory in saline at 37 °C. Most patients at the hospital are at present operated on by laparoscopic methods, making them unsuitable for fat biopsy procedures. From the few remaining subjects undergoing open surgery, it was not possible to select for gender (10 men and 26 women), age (range: 25–68 years), or body mass index (BMI range: 21–60 kg/m2). The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Karolinska Institute at Huddinge Hospital. It was explained in detail to all participants. All subjects gave their consent. The ASP was prepared at the Royal Victoria Hospital. It was isolated and purified from frozen human plasma (obtained from the local blood bank), as described previously (19Baldo A. Sniderman A.D. St-Luce S. Zhang X.J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of each ASP preparation was determined by ion spray mass spectrometry (95–99% pure), and the activity was tested through stimulation of [3H]oleic acid incorporation into intracellular triglycerides in human skin fibroblasts (19Baldo A. Sniderman A.D. St-Luce S. Zhang X.J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASP was frozen (−80 °C) in aliquots in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and was shipped on dry ice to Huddinge Hospital, where all subsequent experiments took place. Insulin was not detected in the ASP samples, using an ultra-sensitive insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden), which can detect insulin at a concentration as low as 1 pm. Fat cells were isolated from the subcutaneous fat tissue specimen by collagenase treatment, as described (27Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, all visible blood vessels and connective tissue were removed, and 2 g of fat tissue was cut into fragments of around 5–10 mg and incubated in 5 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.5 g/liter collagenase and 40 g/liter dialyzed bovine serum albumin, in a shaking bath at 37 °C for 1 h. The fat cells were filtered twice through a nylon cloth and subsequently washed three times with collagenase-free KRP buffer (pH 7.4). The fat cell incubations were conducted as described previously (28Lönnqvist F. Thörne A. Nilsell K. Hoffstedt J. Arner P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In brief, diluted suspensions of fat cells (5–10,000 cells/ml) were incubated for 2 h in duplicate in a shaking bath with air as the gas phase at 37 °C in 0.2 ml of KRP buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 g/liter fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 1 g/liter glucose, and 0.035 g/liter ascorbic acid in the presence of various agents, which were added simultaneously at the beginning of the incubation. Under the present incubation conditions, rates of metabolic activities are constant for at least 4 h. In the first set of experiments (number of subjects (n) = 11), fat cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ASP (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.8, and 5.6 μm) with and without norepinephrine (1 μm). The highest ASP concentration was also incubated together with insulin (0.1 nm). In addition, fat cells from the same subjects were incubated with increasing concentrations of insulin (0.01, 0.1, and 1 nm) with or without norepinephrine (1 μm). In the second set of experiments (n = 10), fat cells were incubated with ASP (5.6 μm) or insulin (0.1 nm) in combination with calphostin C (a selective PKC inhibitor (29Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 2: 548-553Crossref Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) at 1, 10, and 100 nm and 1 μm). In the third set of experiments (n = 10), fat cells were incubated with ASP (5.6 μm) or insulin (0.1 nm) in combination with wortmannin (selective PI3K inhibitor (30Rahn T. Ridderstråle M. Tornqvist H. Manganiello V. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. Degerman E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) at 0.1 μm or enprofylline (non-selective PDE inhibitor with insignificant adenosine interactions (31Lönnqvist F. Wennlund A. Arner P. Int. J. Obes. 1989; 13: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar)) at 1 mm. Fat cells from 8 of these subjects were also incubated with norepinephrine (1 μm) and either ASP (5.6 μm) or insulin (0.1 nm) with or without the addition of enprofylline (1 mm). In the fourth set of experiments (n = 9), fat cells were incubated with ASP (5.6 μm) or insulin (0.1 nm) in combination with OPC 3911 (selective PDE3 inhibitor, at 1, 3 and 10 μm (32Lindgren S. Rascon A. Andersson K.E. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Biochem. Pharm. 1991; 42: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) or rolipram (selective PDE4 inhibitor, at 1, 3, and 100 μm (32Lindgren S. Rascon A. Andersson K.E. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Biochem. Pharm. 1991; 42: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Hagstrom-Toft E. Bolinder J. Eriksson S. Arner P. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The total lipid content in the incubate was measured gravimetrically after organic extraction with heptane. At the end of the incubation, a cell-free aliquot of the incubation medium was removed for glycerol release determination by a bioluminescence method (34Hellmér J. Arner P. Lundin A. Biochemistry. 1989; 177: 132-137Google Scholar). Another aliquot was used for the measurement of FFA release from fat cells, using a chemiluminescence method (35Näslund B. Bernström K. Lundin A. Arner P. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 633-642PubMed Google Scholar). FFA oxidation in this in vitro system is negligible (36Steinberg D. Vaughan M. Handbook of Physiology, Adipose Tissue. American Physiological Society, Bethesda1965: 335-347Google Scholar), so the only expected outcomes for the FFA are either release from the fat cells during lipolysis or re-esterification. The glycerol release can be used as an accurate index of the amount of FFA released during lipolysis, as glycerol cannot be re-utilized by fat cells to any important extent (3Low G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1631-1637Google Scholar). Complete hydrolysis of one triglyceride molecule generates three molecules of FFA and one molecule of glycerol. Since there is only minor partial hydrolysis of triglycerides in human fat cells (37Arner P. Ostman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the molar amount of FFA produced during lipolysis was calculated as 3× molar glycerol release. The absolute rate of primary FFA esterification was calculated as described earlier (4Campbell P.J. Carlson M.G. Hill J.O. Nurjhan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1063-E1069PubMed Google Scholar): primary FFA esterification = (3× molar glycerol release) − molar FFA release. Fractional FFA re-esterification, the proportion of FFA molecules formed during lipolysis that is re-esterified to triglycerides, was calculated as the ratio of primary FFA esterification to total FFA formed by lipolysis (4Campbell P.J. Carlson M.G. Hill J.O. Nurjhan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1063-E1069PubMed Google Scholar). This ratio can vary between 0 and 1. It is 0 when no FFA are re-esterified and 1 when all FFA are re-esterified. As discussed in detail (38Arner P. Int. J. Obes. 1995; 19: 435-442PubMed Google Scholar), this way of calculating re-esterification relies on the following: (a) there is only minor net synthesis or breakdown of partial glycerides (mono- and diglycerides), (b) there are only minor net changes in the small intracellular pool of FFA, and (c) FFA are not oxidized by fat cells to any significant extent. PDE activity was measured in fat cells from 7 subjects, as described (39Manganiello V.C. Murad F. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2195-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fat cells (400 μl) were incubated for 10 min in duplicate in a shaking bath at 37 °C in 2 ml (∼250,000 cells/ml) KRP buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 g/liter fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 1 g/liter glucose, and 0.1 mg/liter ascorbic acid with or without insulin (0.1 nm) or ASP (5.6 μm). The fat cells were homogenized at room temperature with 10 strokes in a glass homogenizer in 1 ml of homogenization buffer containing 50 mm TES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 600 nmokadaic acid, and 10 μg/ml each of antipain and leupeptin and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Fat cakes were removed. PDE activity, which was defined as the amount of hydrolyzed cAMP per min (39Manganiello V.C. Murad F. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2195-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was measured in the homogenate. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in a total volume of 300 μl, containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 8.3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μm[3H]cAMP. OPC 3911 and rolipram were used at 10 and 30 μm, respectively, in the assays to estimate PDE3 and PDE4 activities. PDE activity was expressed per ml of fat cells. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, Clostridium histolyticum collagenase type I, glycerol kinase fromEscherichia coli (G4509), acyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.3) from Pseudomonas specialis, acyl-CoA oxidase fromCandida lipolytica, horseradish peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7, type VI; 250–330 units/mg), sodium dodecyl sulfate, ascorbate oxidase, adenosine deaminase, Triton X-100, ATP, insulin, calphostin C, wortmannin, TES, antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin, Hepes, and cAMP were obtained from Sigma. ATP-monitoring reagent containing firefly luciferase came from LKB Wallac (Turku, Finland). Enprofylline came from AB Draco (Lund, Sweden). Okadaic acid came from Calbiochem. Rolipram came from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [2,8-3H]cAMP came from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK). OPC 3911 was obtained from Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of the highest grade of purity commercially available and were obtained from Kebo (Stockholm, Sweden). Values are given as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t test were used for statistical comparisons. A correction of the pvalue according to Bonferroni was made when it was appropriate. Correlations were analyzed using the linear regression method. These experiments were performed in an identical fashion on 11 subjects. As shown in Fig.1, ASP inhibited FFA release from fat cells incubated under basal conditions in a concentration-dependent way (ANOVA, F = 21,p < 0.0001). The minimum effective concentration was −6.3 log mol/liter (paired t test, p < 0.05 (corrected according to Bonferroni)). At the highest ASP concentration (−5.3 log mol/liter), FFA release was inhibited by ∼85%. Norepinephrine (1 μm) doubled the rate of FFA release in comparison to basal incubation (paired t testp < 0.01). Also in combination with norepinephrine, ASP inhibited FFA release (ANOVA, F = 16,p < 0.0001). The minimum effective ASP concentration for this effect was −6 log mol/liter (paired t test (Bonferroni), p < 0.05) and at the highest ASP concentration, FFA release was inhibited by ∼45%. Insulin inhibited basal FFA release in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, ANOVA,F = 20, p < 0.0001). The minimum effective concentration for this effect was −10 log mol/liter (pairedt test (corrected according to Bonferroni),p < 0.05). At the highest insulin concentration (−9 log mol/liter), FFA release was inhibited by ∼90%. In the presence of 1 μm norepinephrine, insulin maintained its ability to inhibit FFA release in a concentration-dependent fashion (ANOVA, F = 20, p < 0.0001). The minimum effective insulin concentration for this effect was −10 log mol/liter insulin (paired t test (Bonferroni),p < 0.05) and at the highest insulin concentration, FFA release was inhibited by ∼80%. As shown in Fig. 2, ASP slightly inhibited the total amount of FFA produced during basal lipolysis (as calculated from glycerol release) in a concentration-dependent fashion (ANOVA, F = 10, p < 0.0001). The minimum effective ASP concentration was −6.3 log mol/liter (paired t test,p < 0.05 (Bonferroni)). At the highest ASP concentration (−5.3 log mol/liter), lipolysis-produced FFA was inhibited by ∼30%. Norepinephrine (1 μm) almost doubled the rate of lipolysis in comparison to the basal state (p < 0.05). Also in combination with norepinephrine, ASP reduced the amount of FFA produced during lipolysis (ANOVA,F = 3, p < 0.01), but the effect was very small, i.e. lipolysis was inhibited by ∼15% at the highest ASP concentration. Insulin markedly inhibited the FFA production during basal lipolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, ANOVA,F = 14, p < 0.0001). The minimum effective concentration for this effect was −10 log mol/liter insulin (paired t test (Bonferroni), p < 0.05). At the highest insulin concentration (−9 log mol/liter), lipolysis was inhibited by ∼60%. In the presence of 1 μmnorepinephrine, insulin maintained its marked ability to inhibit lipolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion (ANOVA,F = 12, p < 0.0001). The minimum effective insulin concentration for this effect was −10 log mol/liter insulin (paired t test (Bonferroni), p < 0.05), and at the highest insulin concentration, the amount of FFA produced during lipolysis was decreased by ∼60%. The absolute rate of primary FFA esterification in the experiments described in Figs. 1 and 2 was calculated as the difference between total FFA produced by lipolysis (calculated from glycerol release) and the actual amount of FFA released from the cells. This rate was not influenced by ASP when fat cells were incubated in the basal state. The rates of primary esterification with and without the highest ASP concentration were similar: 2.92 ± 0.50 versus2.82 ± 0.43 μmol/g lipid/2 h, p = not significant. Norepinephrine at 1 μm increased the absolute rate of primary FFA re-esterification (paired ttest, 2.92 ± 0.50 versus 4.36 ± 0.54 μmol/g lipid/2 h, p < 0.05). Increasing concentrations of ASP did not change this effect of norepinephrine (paired t test, norepinephrine versus norepinephrine + ASP (−5.3 log mol/liter): 4.36 ± 0.54 versus 4.66 ± 0.56 μmol/g lipid/2 h, p = not significant). Insulin did not influence the absolute rate of primary FFA re-esterification significantly either, in the absence or presence of norepinephrine. The fractional FFA re-esterification, which is the proportion of FFA re-esterified during lipolysis, increased markedly with increasing concentrations of ASP when fat cells were incubated in the basal state (Fig. 3, ANOVA, F = 4,p < 0.01). This stimulation was significant at −6.3 log mol/liter ASP (paired t test (Bonferroni),p < 0.01), and at the highest concentration, ASP increased fractional FFA re-esterification by ∼40%. Norepinephrine alone at 1 μm decreased the fractional FFA re-esterification (paired t test, p < 0.01). In the presence of norepinephrine, ASP increased the fractional FFA re-esterification in a concentration-dependent manner (ANOVA, F = 5, p < 0.001). This stimulation started to be significant at −6.3 log mol/liter ASP (paired t test (Bonferroni), p < 0.05), and at the highest ASP concentration, fractional FFA re-esterification was increased by ∼25%. Insulin also increased the fractional FFA re-esterification in a marked and concentration-dependent fashion under basal conditions (Fig. 3, ANOVA, F = 24,p < 0.0001). The minimum significant effective concentration for this effect was −10 log mol/liter insulin (pairedt test (Bonferroni), p < 0.05). At the highest insulin concentration (−9 log mol/liter), fractional FFA re-esterification was increased by ∼40%. In the presence of 1 μm norepinephrine, insulin maintained its ability to stimulate fractional FFA re-esterification (ANOVA, F = 10, p < 0.0001). The minimum effective insulin concentration for this effect was −10 log mol/liter insulin (pairedt test (Bonferroni), p < 0.05) and at the highest insulin concentration, fractional FFA re-esterification was increased by ∼25%. Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 show data with increasing concentrations of ASP and insulin up to 5.6 μm and 1 nm, respectively. The observed effects at these concentrations did not differ in a significant way from the effects at higher concentrations (data not shown). Comparing the maximum effects of ASP and insulin on release, production and fractional re-esterification of FFA, ASP, and insulin were equally efficient in inhibiting FFA release and stimulating fractional FFA re-esterification, whereas insulin was significantly more efficient than ASP in inhibiting production of FFA during lipolysis (pairedt test, p < 0.01). These experiments were performed in an identical way on 11 subjects. In TableI, it is shown that ASP (5.6 μm) could augment the effect of insulin (0.1 nm) on basal and norepinephrine-stimulated (1 μm) FFA release from fat cells and vice versa (pairedt test, INS versus ASP + INS, ASPversus ASP + INS; p < 0.01). ASP could also augment the effect of insulin on basal lipolysis and the other way around (paired t test, INS versus ASP + INSp < 0.05; ASP versus ASP + INS,p < 0.01). Furthermore, insulin could augment the effect of ASP on norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis (ASP + NEversus ASP + NE + INS, p < 0.01), whereas ASP did not significantly augment the effect of insulin on norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis. ASP together with insulin almost completely suppressed FFA release, whereas together they only inhibited lipolysis by 50–60%. ASP could augment the effect of insulin on basal and norepinephrine-inhibited fractional FFA re-esterification and the other way around (paired t test, INS versus ASP + INS, ASP versus ASP + INS; p < 0.05).Table IAdditive effects of ASP and insulin in human fat cells, effects on FFA release, FFA produced during lipolysis, and fractio"
https://openalex.org/W2038905197,"In yeast two-hybrid screens for proteins that bind to SNAP-25 and may be involved in exocytosis, we isolated a protein called EHSH1 (for EH domain/SH3 domain-containing protein). Cloning of full-length cDNAs revealed that EHSH1 is composed of an N-terminal region with two EH domains, a central region that is enriched in lysine, leucine, glutamate, arginine, and glutamine (KLERQ domain), and a C-terminal region comprised of five SH3 domains. The third SH3 domain is alternatively spliced. Data bank searches demonstrated that EHSH1 is very similar to Xenopus and human intersectins and to human SH3P17. In addition, we identified expressed sequence tags that encode a second isoform of EHSH1, called EHSH2. EHSH1 is abundantly expressed in brain and at lower levels in all other tissues tested. In binding studies, we found that the central KLERQ domain of EHSH1 binds to recombinant or native brain SNAP-25 and SNAP-23. The C-terminal SH3 domains, by contrast, quantitatively interact with dynamin, a protein involved in endocytosis. Dynamin strongly binds to the alternatively spliced central SH3 domain (SH3C) and the two C-terminal SH3 domains (SH3D and SH3E) but not to the N-terminal SH3 domains (SH3A and SH3B). Immunoprecipitations confirmed that both dynamin and SNAP-25 are complexed to EHSH1 in brain. Our data suggest that EHSH1/intersectin may be a novel adaptor protein that couples endocytic membrane traffic to exocytosis. The ability of multiple SH3 domains in EHSH1 to bind to dynamin suggests that EHSH1 can cluster several dynamin molecules in a manner that is regulated by alternative splicing. In yeast two-hybrid screens for proteins that bind to SNAP-25 and may be involved in exocytosis, we isolated a protein called EHSH1 (for EH domain/SH3 domain-containing protein). Cloning of full-length cDNAs revealed that EHSH1 is composed of an N-terminal region with two EH domains, a central region that is enriched in lysine, leucine, glutamate, arginine, and glutamine (KLERQ domain), and a C-terminal region comprised of five SH3 domains. The third SH3 domain is alternatively spliced. Data bank searches demonstrated that EHSH1 is very similar to Xenopus and human intersectins and to human SH3P17. In addition, we identified expressed sequence tags that encode a second isoform of EHSH1, called EHSH2. EHSH1 is abundantly expressed in brain and at lower levels in all other tissues tested. In binding studies, we found that the central KLERQ domain of EHSH1 binds to recombinant or native brain SNAP-25 and SNAP-23. The C-terminal SH3 domains, by contrast, quantitatively interact with dynamin, a protein involved in endocytosis. Dynamin strongly binds to the alternatively spliced central SH3 domain (SH3C) and the two C-terminal SH3 domains (SH3D and SH3E) but not to the N-terminal SH3 domains (SH3A and SH3B). Immunoprecipitations confirmed that both dynamin and SNAP-25 are complexed to EHSH1 in brain. Our data suggest that EHSH1/intersectin may be a novel adaptor protein that couples endocytic membrane traffic to exocytosis. The ability of multiple SH3 domains in EHSH1 to bind to dynamin suggests that EHSH1 can cluster several dynamin molecules in a manner that is regulated by alternative splicing. At the plasma membrane of all cells, vesicles are inserted by exocytosis and retrieved by endocytosis (1Palade G.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 821-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A specialized form of exo- and endocytosis operates in nerve terminals (reviewed in Refs. 2Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 3Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). In nerve terminals, Ca2+ triggers the rapid exocytotic fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane followed by fast endocytosis and recycling. This leads to millisecond trafficking reactions that are precisely timed and targeted. A critical step in synaptic vesicle exocytosis is the formation of the core complex between the vesicle protein synaptobrevin/VAMP and the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25. Botulinum and tetanus toxins inhibit exocytosis by cleaving the components of the core complex, demonstrating that the core complex is essential for exocytosis (4Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Exocytosis outside of synapses probably utilizes mechanisms that are analogous to those of the synapse (5Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). It is likely that exocytosis in non-neuronal cells also requires the formation of a core complex composed of homologs of SNAP-25 (e.g. SNAP-23), syntaxin 1 (e.g. syntaxins 2, 3, and 4), and synaptobrevin (e.g. cellubrevin). Variations of the model developed for the synapse appear to operate in vesicular membrane traffic at the plasma membrane in all cells and possibly also in vesicular traffic between intracellular compartments. Although much is known about the core complex, its precise function or the mechanism of membrane fusion are unknown. One interesting property of synaptic vesicle exocytosis is the accurate timing of exocytosis. Synaptic vesicle exocytosis is faster and more tightly regulated than any other form of exocytosis. In nerve terminals, Ca2+influx triggers exocytosis by an unknown mechanism that requires the presence of the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptotagmin I or II (6Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Because synaptotagmins are Ca2+-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (395) Google Scholar), they probably represent Ca2+ sensors in exocytosis. It is unclear, however, whether Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin regulates fusion and how this relates to core complex formation. After exocytosis, synaptic vesicles are retrieved by endocytosis. The mechanisms involved in endocytosis have been studied in great detail in nerve terminals and fibroblasts (for reviews see Refs. 8Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 9van der Bliek A.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 10Chen M.S.

The seminal discovery of clathrin coats and clathrin assembly proteins in endocytosis raised the question of how these coats invaginate (reviewed in Ref. 8Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Analysis of a Drosophila mutation called shibire revealed that the GTPase dynamin is essential for invagination of clathrin-coated pits (9van der Bliek A.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 10Chen M.S. Obar R.A. Schroeder C.C. Austin T.W. Poodry C.A. Wadsworth S.C. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Dynamin is thought to drive endocytosis by interacting directly and indirectly with multiple components of the endocytic machinery and with phospholipids (reviewed in Refs. 11Urrutia R. Henley J.R.

Dynamin includes a proline-rich C-terminal sequence that binds to SH3 domains of several proteins, although largely nonstoichiometrically (14Wigge P. Vallis Y. McMahon H.T. Curr.

A large number of proteins with putative functions in endocytosis have been identified in addition to dynamin, clathrin, and the clathrin assembly proteins. This has led to a view whereby endocytosis is driven by a molecular superstructure involving at least 20 different proteins. Among these proteins are phosphoinositide phosphatases called synaptojanins (20McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Nemoto Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19594-19600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although we know many proteins now that are probably involved in endocytosis, it is unclear what most of these proteins actually do. One of the major problems in understanding exo- and endocytosis has been the mechanism by which they are coupled. Especially in nerve terminals, these two processes appear to be temporally closely linked. The observation that synaptotagmin binds with high affinity to the clathrin assembly protein complex AP2 (28Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) led to the idea that synaptotagmin serves both in exo- and endocytosis by functioning first as a Ca2+ sensor in exocytosis and then in endocytosis as a catalyst for clathrin assembly via AP2. This model was supported by the finding that in Caenorhabditis elegans, synaptotagmin-deficient nerve terminals lack synaptic vesicles and may therefore be defective in endocytosis (29Jorgensen E. Hartwied E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, direct support for a role of synaptotagmin in endocytosis is lacking. In the current study, we have used yeast two-hybrid screens to search for SNAP-25 interacting proteins with the hypothesis that the cycle of core complex assembly and disassembly requires unknown intermediates with unidentified binding partners. We isolated a multidomain protein that we called EHSH1 because it is composed of two N-terminal EH domains, a central highly charged domain, and five C-terminal SH3 domains. EHSH1 interacts with SNAP-25 via its central domain and quantitatively binds dynamin via multiple SH3 domains. After the initial review of this manuscript, cDNA sequences corresponding to EHSH1 were reported from humans and Xenopus where they were named intersectins (30Yamabhai M. Horrman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Guipponi M. Scott H.S. Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 53: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results reported here, Xenopus intersectin was shown to bind to dynamin and synaptojanin. In addition, although the mammalian proteins were not investigated, the sequence of a brain-specific splice variant of human EHSH/intersection that encodes a much larger protein was characterized. In addition to confirming these results, our data extend these findings by demonstrating that two EHSH1/intersectin proteins are in fact produced in a brain-specific fashion, that EHSH1 binds to SNAP-25 and SNAP-23, and that its interaction with dynamin is stoichiometric and mediated by multiple SH3 domains. Our results suggest that a specific protein may participate in coupling exo- and endocytosis. We screened a cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+-enriched rat brain RNA from postnatal day 8 with a bait vector encoding full-length SNAP-25B fused to LexA (pBTM116-SNAP25B) (32Vojtek A.B.

Among the positive clones obtained, sequencing revealed that two clones were independent isolates of the protein that we named EHSH1. Yeast two-hybrid quantitations of interactions between various forms of SNAP-25 and EHSH1 were performed by liquid β-galactosidase measurements as described (23Carbone R. Fre S. Iannolo G.

Yeast two-hybrid bait and prey vectors were constructed in pBTM116 or pLexN and pVP16–3 using standard procedures (34Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using fluorescently labeled primers and an ABI DNA sequencer. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones were deposited in GenBankTM (accession numbers AF127798 and AF132672). BLAST searches identified several clones in the EST 1The abbreviations used are: EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase(s). data banks that corresponded to isoforms of EHSH1. Sequence analyses were performed with the program suite at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. Plasmids were constructed in pVP16–3, pBTM116, and pLexN for use as yeast two-hybrid prey and bait vectors, respectively; pGEX-KG was for expression as GST fusion proteins (37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E.

Proteins were expressed in bacteria or COS cells as described, and GST fusion proteins were purified as reported by Guan and Dixon (37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Three frozen rat brains were homogenized in 20 ml of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 g/liter PMSF. Triton X-100 was added to 1% (v/v). The homogenate was extracted by end-over-end rotation for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to obtain total brain extracts as the supernatant (≈400 mg protein/3 rat brains). Total brain extract was precleared by incubation with glutathione agarose without GST fusion protein for 6 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation (800 × g for 2 min). 18 ml of precleared total brain extract was loaded onto the respective GST-protein affinity columns (1 ml of glutathione-agarose with 4–5 mg of GST fusion proteins attached) that had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.25% Triton X-100. Loading was performed by 10 recirculations of the brain extract over the columns under gravity flow at 4 °C. The flow-through from the last cycle was collected, and the columns were sequentially washed with 20 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% CHAPS containing 0.1m NaCl or 0.5 m NaCl. After washing, the columns were eluted with the same buffer containing 1 mNaCl followed by SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (20 ml/lane) or immunoblotting (5 ml/lane). Approximately 0.1 mg of GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose were incubated with total rat brain extract (20 mg of protein; precleared with GST alone immobilized on glutathione agarose for most experiments) or extracts from transfected COS cells (1 mg of protein) in 10 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 g/liter PMSF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 12–16 h. The beads were washed six times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1 g/liter PMSF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, and retained proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Ponceau S staining or immunoblotting. For all experiments, GST alone or irrelevant GST fusion proteins were used as controls. Four rat brains were extracted as described above (see affinity chromatography) except that 20 ml of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 g/liter PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 were used. Aliquots (30 mg) of the brain extracts were precleared by incubation with protein A- or G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C and then reacted with affinity purified EHSH1 antibodies or preimmune serum (25 mg of protein) on ice for 12–16 h. A 50% slurry of protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (100 ml) were added and incubated with end-over-end rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with the same buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Three antibodies were raised against GST fusion proteins of EHSH1: S750 was raised against GST-EHSH1–1 (residues 1–440); P229 was raised against GST-EHSH1SH3A/B (residues 598–975); and P227 was raised against GST-EHSH1SH3D/E (residues 1028–1217). Antibodies were affinity purified on immobilized GST fusion proteins as described (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). SNAP-23 antibodies were a gift of Dr. E. Link (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany). Dynamin antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (D25520). All other antibodies were reported previously (21Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Proteins were assayed with a Coomassie Blue-based assay kit (Bio-Rad). RNA blotting analysis was performed using commercially available blots (CLONTECH) containing total RNA from rat tissues. To find potential new membrane trafficking proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens for proteins interacting with SNAP-25. Clones corresponding to two novel proteins were repeatedly isolated. These include a protein that we named EHSH1 because its domain structure includes EH and SH3 domains (see below) and a second protein without defined domains that will be described elsewhere. 2S. Schoch, M. Okamoto, and T. C. Südhof, unpublished observation. The yeast two-hybrid prey clones encoding EHSH1 were used to isolate full-length cDNA clones from conventional libraries. A complete amino acid sequence for EHSH1 was assembled from the cDNA sequences and employed in data bank searches. These revealed that the C-terminal third of EHSH1 is identical with SH3P17, a partial cDNA containing multiple SH3 domains (42Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), except that SH3P17 misses the central SH3 domain present in EHSH1, which is probably alternatively spliced (see below). In addition, after review of this manuscript theXenopus and human sequences of intersectins were reported that are probably orthologs of EHSH1 (Fig.1 and Refs. 30Yamabhai M. Horrman N.G.

Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 53: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to these presumed orthologs, the C terminus of EHSH1 is very similar to SH3P18, which may represent a partial cDNA clone of an isoform of EHSH1, and full-length EHSH1 is distantly related to aDrosophila protein called DAP160 (43Roos J. Kelly R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). DAP160 is more similar to SH3P18 than to EHSH1 and thus may correspond to an EHSH1 isoform. Data bank searches also revealed that the human gene for EHSH1 has been largely sequenced on two adjacent segments on chromosome 21q11.1 (GenBankTM accession numbers AP000049 andAP000050). The gene contains at least 26 exons over 110 kilobases. At the N terminus, EHSH1 contains two EH domains. EH domains are relatively short, evolutionarily conserved sequences that were first identified in EPS15 (hence their name; Refs. 37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal.

Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Following the EH domains, EHSH1 contains a sequence of 373 amino acids (green in Fig. 1) that scores high on coiled-coil prediction programs and is noticeable for its unusual amino acid composition. This domain is almost entirely composed of lysine (11%), leucine (12%), glutamate (20%), arginine (13%), and glutamine (15%). Because of its amino acid composition, we named this domain the “KLERQ domain.” The KLERQ domain is not simply a highly charged sequence but exhibits a strong residue bias. Although glutamate and glutamine together account for 35% of its sequence, aspartate and asparagine are almost absent (3 and 2%, respectively). Similarly, leucine is frequent (12%) but alanine, valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine are rare (4, 3, 3, and 1%, respectively). It seems likely that this sequence forms a charged α-helix. At the C terminus, EHSH1 is composed of five SH3 domains. The first and second SH3 domains (SH3A and SH3B) are separated by a relatively long, highly conserved linker sequence (Fig. 1). The SH3A domain is the most divergent and is only distantly related to the other SH3 domains. In data bank searches, we found that the SH3 domains are most similar to SH3 domains in the SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Nck (GenBankTMaccession number 127962). Interestingly, we observed that the third SH3 domain (SH3C) is absent in multiple independent human EST clones of EHSH1. This indicates that this SH3 domain is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in proteins that include either four or five SH3 domains. In addition to this alternative splicing, a short sequence in SH3A also appears to be alternatively spliced based on EST data bank searches (underlined in Fig. 1). Both alternatively spliced sequences precisely correspond to exon-intron boundaries in the human gene structure (data not shown). EST data bank searches revealed the presence of a second protein closely related to EHSH1. EST sequences from both human and mice encoding this isoform were found (Fig. 2). We have named this protein EHSH2 because it is highly homologous to EHSH1, suggesting that it represents an isoform. Comparison of the EH domains from EHSH1 and EHSH2 with those from EPS15 and 15R shows that they are only distantly related (Fig. 2). DAP160 was initially thought to have only one EH domain (43Roos J. Kelly R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) but reanalysis reveals that it also contains two N-terminal EH domains (data not shown). Although DAP160 is therefore similar to EHSH in structure, its EH domains are more distantly related to EHSH1 and EHSH2 than they are to each other, suggesting that they are homologs and not orthologs. To determine which tissues express EHSH1, we performed RNA blotting analyses (Fig.3). Blots containing equal amounts of poly(A)+-enriched RNA from different rat tissues were hybridized at high stringency with a 32P-labeled probe from the N terminus of EHSH1. mRNAs of approximately 4.2 and 5.5 kb were observed in all tissues. Brain contained the highest levels of the 5.5-kb mRNA and the lowest levels of the 4.2-kb mRNA (Fig. 3). In addition, a large mRNA (approximately 10 kb) was detected only in brain even after prolonged exposure (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Because blotting transfer of large mRNAs"

After affinity isolation on immobilized BC3 antibody, MUC1 was partially deglycosylated by enzymatic treatment with α-sialidase/β-galactosidase and fragmented by proteolytic cleavage with the Arg-C-specific endopeptidase clostripain. The PAP20 glycopeptides were isolated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography and subjected to the structural analyses by quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and to the sequencing by Edman degradation. All five positions of the repeat peptide were revealed as <i>O</i>-glycosylation targets in the tumor cell, including the Thr within the DTR motif. The degree of substitution was estimated to average 4.8 glycans per repeat, which compares to 2.6 glycosylated sites per repeat for the mucin from milk (Müller, S., Goletz, S., Packer, N., Gooley, A. A., Lawson, A. M., and Hanisch, F.-G. (1997) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i>272, 24780–24793). In addition to a modification by glycosylation, the immunodominant DTR motif on T47D-MUC1 is altered by amino acid replacements (PAPGSTAPAAHGVTSAPESR), which were revealed in about 50% of PAP20 peptides. The high incidence of these replacements and their detection also in other cancer cell lines imply that the conserved tandem repeat domain of MUC1 is polymorphic with respect to the peptide sequence."

(Ssp DnaB intein) and Mycobacterium xenopi (Mxe GyrA intein) that have been modified to cleave peptide bonds at their C and N termini, respectively, were cloned in-frame to the N and C termini of a target protein. Peptide bond cleavage of the modified inteins generated an N-terminal cysteine and a C-terminal thioester on the same protein. These complementary reactive groups underwent intra- or intermolecular condensation to generate circular or polymeric protein species with a new peptide bond at the site of ligation. Three cyclic peptides, BBP, an organ specific localization peptide; RGD, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation; and CDR-H3/C2, which inhibits HIV-1 replication, were isolated using the two-intein system. BBP, RGD, and CDR-H3/C2 had masses of 977.1, 1119.9, and 2098.6 g/mol, respectively, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry, which agreed well with the values of 977.2, 1120.3, and 2098.3 g/mol, respectively, predicted for the cyclic species. This system was used to cyclize proteins as large as 395 amino acids. Furthermore, multimers of thioredoxin were formed upon concentration of the reactive species, indicating the potential to form novel biomaterials based on fibrous proteins."

Many biological macromolecules have information encoded in their primary structure. In proteins, the amino acid sequence determines the secondary and tertiary structural characteristics of the folded protein, whereas in DNA and RNA the nucleotide sequence is the means of storing coded information that can be read by the transcriptional and translational machinery of the cell. Information for ligand binding and activation is also present within the structure of complex saccharides (1Dwek R. Biochem. Soc.

Heparin Binding Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar, 4Gallagher J. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1998; 10: 137-144Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, unlike nucleic acids and protein, there is no established method available to read this primary information. The near ubiquitous occurrence and strategic positioning of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, both at the surface of most mammalian cells and in the extracellular matrix, is a good indicator of their role in cell-cell recognition and cell-matrix adhesion (5Bernfield M.

Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are key sites of interaction and signaling when cells form focal adhesions on extracellular matrix substrates such as fibronectin (7Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A very extensive range of growth factors and cytokines, including key angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (8Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

The similarity between the co-receptor role of HS and the effect of heparin in facilitating the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin is indicative of many biological processes being driven by HS catalysis. It may therefore be possible to exploit an understanding of HS-growth factor interactions to modulate the effects of these ligands (12David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) in a similar way to the current clinical use of heparin. Although there is a substantial body of information concerning the general similarities (and differences) in structure between HS from different sources (13Fransson L.-Å. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 115-134Google Scholar, 14Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Lyon M. Deakin J.A.

J. 1985; 230: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), regrettably little is still known about its detailed primary structure. Furthermore, although common molecular designs in the form of spatially discrete sulfated domains (S-domains) can be recognized within the HS family, cells impose their own imprint on this design through variations in sugar sequence and patterns of sulfation, which are known to be of physiological significance. The HS chain is initially formed in the Golgi as a polymer of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcUA) residues. A number of modification steps then follow. First, selected GlcNAc residues undergo linked N-deacetylation andN-sulfation. This N-sulfation is a prerequisite for the epimerization of adjacent GlcUA to iduronic acid (IdoUA). Following epimerization, O-sulfation takes place at various positions around these saccharides, i.e. at C-2 of IdoUA, C-6 (and rarely C-3) of N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS), and C-6 of GlcNAc. These modifications, which are clearly nonrandom, are both interdependent and quantitatively incomplete and generate regions of high sulfation that alternate with areas with little or no modification. The controlled variability of S-domain structure and spacing may be a method used by cells to direct which signaling molecules they respond to or to regulate their adhesion and migration in different extracellular matrix environments (14Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). What is clear is that HS binds to effector proteins via S-domains with specific sugar sequences and sulfation patterns, and the importance of these interactions has been revealed in studies of development. Studies in mice indicate the key role of sulfation of HS for normal kidney growth (18Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 19Davies J. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Garrod D. Development. 1995; 121: 1507-1517PubMed Google Scholar). Also, HS and its associated core proteins are mediators in the decapentaplegic and wingless pathways inDrosophila (20Binari R.C. Staveley B.E. Johnson W.A. Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. Manoukian A.S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The best known example of the involvement of HS and heparin in molecular recognition is the antithrombin III binding sequence, the elucidation of which was a landmark discovery that required the concerted use of a variety of specialized techniques and many years of work (24Lindahl U. Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Riesenfeld J. Nordling K. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12368-12376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, high affinity binding sites have been identified for bFGF (25Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y.K. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sites are of relatively simple structure, being mainly composed of 4–5 repeat units of IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS, but intriguingly, these sequences fail to elicit a biological response to bFGF unless substituted by one or more 6-O-sulfate groups (27Guimond S.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This has led to the view that HS may act as a template for cell activation, with the 6-O-sulfate groups being needed to dock an HS-bFGF complex onto the signaling receptor (29Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Other members of the FGF family (27Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also unrelated growth factors, e.g. hepatocyte growth factor (10Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are responsive to different HS structures than those that affect bFGF activity, but their active-site sequences are unknown. Likewise, the Hep II domain of fibronectin accommodates an extended S-domain of 14–16 sugar residues, but the sulfation pattern of the binding sequence is unknown (30Walker A. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The development of a rapid sequencing method for HS is vital if we are to understand its detailed structure-function relationships and exploit this knowledge for therapeutic use. The method we describe here allows the progressive sequencing of regions of metabolically radiolabeled HS purified from cells grown in culture. We have been able to sequence trace quantities of HS oligosaccharides rapidly and accurately. All the major S-domains falling within the size range of hexa- to octasaccharides, together with a proportion of the decasaccharides have been sequenced without selection by ligand binding. This approach has yielded new and intriguing information on the molecular structure of HS. Cell culture media and donor calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Heparinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum; heparin lyase EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (F. heparinum; no EC number assigned), and heparinase III (F. heparinum; heparitin-sulfate lyase EC 4.2.2.8) were all purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK).

PD-10 prepacked, disposable Sephadex G-25 mcolumns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 3H-Labeled anhydromannose-containing disaccharide standards derived from heparin were purchased from Chirazyme (Urbana, IL). All HPLC solutions were prepared using MilliQ (Millipore; Watford, UK) ultra pure water. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2 in air) in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 5–10% donor calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units ml−1), and streptomycin (100 μg ml−1l). Antibiotics were removed from the culture medium for one week before radiolabeling. 3H-Glucosamine (up to 40 μCi ml−1) and Na235SO4 (up to 80 μCi ml−1) were added to the culture medium of cells at ∼80% confluency for 24 h. Radiolabeled HS chains were extracted and digested with heparinase III, and the enzyme-resistant fragments were further purified as described previously (10Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following heparinase III digestion, enzyme-resistant fragments were separated by size using a Bio-Gel P-10 gel filtration column (170 cm × 1 cm). Samples were eluted at 4 ml h−1 in 0.1 mammonium hydrogen carbonate, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots were monitored for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Peaks of radioactivity were pooled separately and freeze-dried several times to remove residual salt. Individual size-fractionated samples corresponding to degree of polymerization dp6-dp10 (dp = degree of polymerization, or number of saccharide units, e.g. dp6 = hexasaccharide) were then further resolved by strong anion-exchange (SAX) HPLC chromatography as described previously (28Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Samples were applied to a ProPac PA-1 (4.6 × 250 mm) column preequilibrated in distilled water adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl and eluted with increasing NaCl (maximum of 1.5 m). Oligosaccharides were fractionated using a range of linear gradients optimized for the separation of each size group. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and the aliquots were subjected to scintillation counting (see Fig. 1). By collection of only the central fractions from each peak, single species were obtained that were then desalted by passage over a PD-10 column eluted in H2O and lyophilized. Each peak was checked for purity by reapplication onto a ProPac PA-1 column and elution using the extended gradient conditions described below. Only those oligosaccharides observed as single peaks under these conditions were further analyzed by sequencing. Aliquots containing 5000 cpm of 3H were taken from each of the isolated oligosaccharides and lyophilized. These were then digested with a combination of heparinase I, II, and III enzymes and assayed for their specific disaccharide composition as detailed previously (26Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y.K. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrous acid affects deaminative scission of glycosidic linkages of GlcNS-HexA, releasing inorganic 35SO4, and converting GlcNS to anhydromannose (aMan). Each oligosaccharide was subjected to partial depolymerization using dilute nitrous acid as described (34Radoff S. Danishefsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with aliquots of the reaction stopped at a number of time points to generate a range of intermediates of the depolymerization process. Briefly, each oligosaccharide was lyophilized, then resuspended in 80 μl of H20 to which was added 10 μl each of 10 mmNaNO2 and 190 mm HCl. At each stop point (usually 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h), 20 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and added to a common vial containing 25 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. All procedures and reagents were at 4 °C. As can be seen in Fig. 2, cleavage of a hexasaccharide, with two internal GlcNS residues, will produce two distinct tetrasaccharides, one of which will contain a Δ4,5-unsaturated uronate at the nonreducing end (from the action of heparinase III) and one with a natural uronate at this position. Also present in the reaction mixture will be three disaccharides and some remaining intact dp6. If a hexasaccharide has one internal GlcNAc residue, then only one tetrasaccharide can be formed. If two internal GlcNAc residues are present, the entire hexasaccharide will be resistant to nitrous acid cleavage. Following nitrous acid depolymerization, samples to be digested with enzymes were desalted by passage over PD-10 size exclusion columns eluted with H20, then lyophilized. Digests were set up in a total volume of 25 μl of 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. 2-Sulfatase and iduronidase were used either singly or combined sequentially; 6-sulfatase was only used following use of the former two enzymes. Each individual enzyme digest was incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. Iduronidase was used at 0.29 milliunits/digest, 2-sulfatase was used at 0.54 milliunits/digest, and 6-sulfatase was used at 0.096 μunits/digest. Occasionally, glucuronidase (1,000 units/digest) was also used for sequence analysis. After treatment with the enzymes, samples were adjusted to 1 ml by addition of H2O/HCl, pH 3.5. A single ProPac PA-1 SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm) was used with a linear gradient running from 0–0.75 m NaCl over 110 min. Samples were loaded using a 1-ml sample injection loop. Following sample loading, the loop was washed onto the column with 1 ml of H2O before application of the gradient. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Radioactivity in each fraction was measured by scintillation counting. S-domains generated by heparinase III digestion were separated by Bio-Gel P10 gel filtration and SAX-HPLC to yield a range of oligosaccharide species differing in length, sugar sequence, and sulfation pattern. The HPLC separations for dp6–10 are shown in Fig.1. Individually purified oligosaccharides from Fig. 1 were partially depolymerized using dilute nitrous acid (Fig.2), and the scission products were separated by SAX-HPLC. A typical profile is shown for the major hexasaccharide species designated 6a (Fig.3 A). In this profile, we can recognize peaks that correspond to the nonsulfated disaccharides (fraction 18, labeled non-S; IdoUA-aMan, GlcUA-aMan, and ΔUA-aMan all co-elute as a single peak), the sulfated disaccharide IdoUA(2S)-aMan (fraction 45, labeled ISM), free35SO4 (fraction 38), two tetrasaccharides (fractions 78 and 95, designated R4 and U4 in Fig. 2), and the original hexasaccharide at fraction 118. The disaccharides were identified by comparison with known standards. R4 and U4 were confirmed as tetrasaccharides by their size elution position on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (data not shown). The appearance of two tetrasaccharides indicates that there are two internal GlcNS residues in dp6a. One of these tetrasaccharide fragments, in common with the original dp6 fragment, will contain a Δ4,5-unsaturated uronate at its nonreducing end and will be resistant to lysosomal enzymes; the other will be linked to the reducing end and will be susceptible to the enzymes. It is possible to distinguish between tetrasaccharides R4 and U4 by comparing the profiles in Fig. 3,panels B–D. Digestion with 2-sulfatase causes the R4 peak (at fraction 78) to shift to fraction 45 (R4′); further digestion with iduronidase causes an additional shift to fraction 31 (R4′′). This tetrasaccharide is therefore unequivocally identified as being derived from the reducing end of dp6a (thus designated R4), and it contains a terminal IdoUA(2S). The other tetrasaccharide is not affected by the enzymes and is derived from theunsaturated nonreducing end of dp6a (thus designated U4). As expected, the original dp6a is also unchanged after exoenzyme digestion. The disaccharide identified as IdoUA(2S)-aMan moves as expected after 2-sulfatase treatment but not with iduronidase alone, providing a useful internal control for the action of the enzymes. The last piece of information to be extracted from the profiles is the identity of the residues in the reducing terminal disaccharide of dp6a. ΔUA-GlcNAc was seen in the disaccharide analysis of the hexasaccharide, and iduronidase generates a peak in the position of free GlcNAc from the nonsulfated disaccharides. Nitrous acid scission showed that all the internal amino sugars were N-sulfated; therefore the deduced IdoUA-GlcNAc disaccharide must be at the reducing end. The entire sequence of dp6a is therefore ΔUA-GlcNS-IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS-IdoUA-GlcNAc. The disaccharide analysis of dp6a (Table I) is compatible with this sequence.Table IDisaccharide compositions of HS oligosaccharidesΔUA-GlcNAcΔUA-GlcNSΔUA(2S)-GlcNSΔUA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)6a1.171.001.098a0.991.002.138d0.971.001.140.8810a0.941.002.92Compositions are shown for the four oligosaccharides used as detailed examples of the sequencing protocol.

Open table in a new tab Compositions are shown for the four oligosaccharides used as detailed examples of the sequencing protocol. Data are shown as molar ratios (derived from the 3H content), relative to that of the common disaccharide ΔUA-GlcNS, which occurs once at the nonreducing end of each oligosaccharide. The major octasaccharide 8a was subjected to a similar analysis, generating the profiles seen in Fig. 4. Again, by observing the ways in which each of the peaks seen in the profile of the initial partial nitrous acid scission (Fig. 4,panel A) are affected by the sequencing enzymes, it is possible to assign fragments for sequencing. A number of peaks were observed, but the key ones for sequencing are the hexa- and tetrasaccharides R6 and R4. The enzyme digestions (panels B–D) show that both R6 and R4 contain terminal IdoUA(2S) units. Another tetrasaccharide derived from the middle of dp8a (thus designated M4) was also present after partial nitrous acid treatment, and this fragment also contained an IdoUA(2S) terminal unit, whereas a third tetrasaccharide (U4) was enzyme-resistant and, therefore, from the unsaturated end. The presence of three tetrasaccharides (R4, M4, and U4) after partial nitrous acid shows that the three internal GlcN residues of dp8a are N-sulfated. AnN-acetylated disaccharide is also present in dp8a, and this must therefore be at the reducing end. This is compatible with the fact that iduronidase yields free GlcNAc from the nonsulfated disaccharide peak. Furthermore, the elution characteristics of R4 in dp8a were identical to those of R4 in dp6a, indicating a reducing end sequence of IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS-IdoUA-GlcNAc. The complete sequence of dp8a is therefore ΔUA-GlcNS-IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS-IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS-IdoUA-GlcNAc, and this again is compatible with the disaccharide analysis (Table I). The presence of U4 and U6 fragments after nitrous acid depolymerization is further confirmation that the sequence has three internalN-sulfated units. The elution position of U4 in dp8a was identical to that of U4 in dp6a, and this would be predicted from the sequences of dp6a/dp8a. Although not strictly necessary to sequence an unknown oligosaccharide, the predictable nature of these common fragments did prove useful, particularly in reducing the number of peaks to be classified within a set of profiles. The profiles for the sequencing of the major decasaccharide 10a are shown in Fig. 5. Once again, U4 and U6 are clearly identified by their resistance to the exoenzymes. Fragments R4, R6, and M4 all move with 2-sulfatase but not with iduronidase alone. It is not possible to accurately identify either R8 or U8. Fragments U6 and R6, being derived from opposite ends of the dp10 sequence, overlap in the central disaccharide repeat, and this fact essentially solves the sequence. Other identified fragments (e.g. R4 and U4) are all compatible with the final sequence shown in Fig. 5. More complex species are also easily solved using this technique. When the products of partial nitrous acid scission of octasaccharide 8d were separated by HPLC, the presence of 6-O-sulfation was indicated by a peak corresponding to the disaccharide IdoUA(2S)-aMan(6S) (Fig. 6). Therefore an additional enzyme digestion step was included in this analysis, combining 6-sulfatase, 2-sulfatase, and iduronidase. Once again, it is easy to identify fragments that are not affected by any of the enzyme treatments (i.e. U6 and the intact dp8) as well as one tetrasaccharide (R4, the same as was seen in 6a and 8a), which shifts with the 2-sulfatase alone and further with 2-sulfatase plus iduronidase. An additional peak is also observed that elutes at fraction 190 (R6) and that shifts with 2-sulfatase to fraction 150 (R′). This latter peak displays only a small shift when subsequently treated with iduronidase (fraction 148, R6′′), but the combination of these two enzymes must be removing the hexuronate as the subsequent addition of 6-sulfatase causes a further significant shift to fraction 98 (R6′′′). Fragment R6 therefore contains a nonreducing terminal sequence of IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) and is a reducing end fragment of dp8d. The presence of R6 after nitrous acid scission shows that the unsaturated disaccharide of dp8d is N-sulfated. Confirmation that the unsaturated uronic acid lacks 2-sulfation comes from the presence of the nonsulfated disaccharide peak in all of the profiles (fraction 18); specifically this peak is still observed after the combined 2-sulfatase and iduronidase digest. Combining the sequence data of R6 with the presence of R4, the sequence of dp8d is ΔUA-GlcNSIdoUA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)-IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS-IdoUA-GlcNAc. This same principle of observing the results of digesting partial nitrous acid-generated fragments with exoenzymes was therefore used to deduce the sequences of all the oligosaccharides labeled in Fig. 1,panels A and B, as well as two decasaccharides from Fig. 1, panel C (see TableII). In each case, the ability to match common fragments between analyses (e.g. R4 in 6a, 8a, and 10a) and to independently ascertain the disaccharide composition by multiheparinase digestion helped to confirm the sequences.Table IISequence comparisons for all the twelve HS oligosaccharides analyzed so farThe individual oligosaccharide designations refer to the labeled peaks in Fig. 1.

https://openalex.org/W2008784787,"Binding of vinculin to adhesion plaque proteins is restricted by an intramolecular association of vinculin's head and tail regions. Results of previous work suggest that polyphosphoinositides disrupt this interaction and thereby promote binding of vinculin to both talin and actin. However, data presented here show that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) inhibits the interaction of purified tail domain with F-actin. Upon re-examining the effect of PI4,5P2 on the actin and talin-binding activities of intact vinculin, we find that when the experimental design controls for the effect of magnesium on aggregation of PI4,5P2 micelles, polyphosphoinositides promote interactions with the talin-binding domain, but block interactions of the actin-binding domain. In contrast, if vinculin is trapped in an open confirmation by a peptide specific for the talin-binding domain of vinculin, actin binding is allowed. These results demonstrate that activation of the actin-binding activity of vinculin requires steps other than or in addition to the binding of PI4,5P2.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of the head-tail interaction to expose cryptic ligand binding and regulatory sites is hypothesized to be critical for recruitment of vinculin to sites of cell adhesion and/or for vinculin-dependent assembly of focal adhesion complexes (13Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the factors that regulate the head-tail interaction is central to understanding how events at the cell surface are expressed ultimately in the activities of molecules directly responsible for the functions of focal adhesion plaques. Evidence from in vitro experiments shows that acidic phospholipids in general (16Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem.

This observation provides a mechanistic link between cell surface receptors that modulate the synthesis of PI4,5P2, a signaling molecule (19McNamee H.M. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 121: 673-678Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and vinculin, a structural molecule involved in assembling a focal adhesion plaque and mediating anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton. Here we provide new information that modifies the proposed role of PI4,5P2 in activation of vinculin. In particular, we report that occupancy of the lipid-binding sites in purified tail domain prevents occupancy of the actin-binding sites. The effect of PI4,5P2 on the interaction of purifiedV t with F-actin had not been examined in previous studies. Therefore, to evaluate the apparent inconsistency of our result with the proposed role of PI4,5P2 on the actin binding activity of vinculin, we have used a novel peptide probe of vinculin conformation to re-assess the effects of acidic phospholipids, including polyphosphoinositides, on the actin- and talin-binding activities of vinculin. We find that when the experiments are controlled for the effect of MgCl2 on the aggregation of PI4,5P2 micelles, the results support a modified model in which the role of PI4,5P2 is to expose the talin-binding site on vinculin while blocking the actin-binding site. Chicken smooth muscle vinculin and its 95-kDa head fragment were purified (14Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PIC I was added from a 1,000 × stock containing 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml antipain, 10 mg/ml benzamidine, 10 KIU/ml aprotinin in H2O. PIC II (1,000 ×) contains 1 mg/ml chymostatin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin in dimethysulfoxide. Vinculin was dialyzed against H2O, 0.5% βME containing 2 × PIC I and II before its use in pVR binding experiments containing phospholipids. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified as described previously (22Spudich J. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but with an additional gel exclusion chromatography step (23MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Purified G-actin was stored in buffer A (2 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm βME). GST/V884–1066 was constructed and purified as has been described (12Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at 4 °C in TEEAN. For experiments requiring untagged vinculin tail fragment, V884–1066 was expressed as a 6-histidine (His)-tagged fusion protein. Construction of 6-His/V884–1066 involved polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate region of the chick embryo vinculin cDNA (24Coutu M.D. Craig S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8535-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using in-frame primers. The forward and reverse primers contained NdeI and XhoI sites, respectively. The amplified product was ligated into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that recombinants were transformed into competentEscherichia coli DH5α cells. Recombinant plasmid was digested with NdeI and XhoI to yield the insert fragment containing the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding region and flanking vector sequence. The fragments were gel-purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Chatsworth, CA) and ligated into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET-15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). As described in the manufacturer's instructions (pET System Manual; Novagen), 6·His/V884–1066 was expressed, purified, and then cleaved with thrombin to remove the 6·His tag. V884–1066 was dialyzed against TEEAN containing 0.5% βME and 2 × PIC I and II and quantified spectrophotometrically (E m280 = 18,350) at 280 nm. The pVR peptide (KKKSTGGFDDVYDLARRVSSALTTTLVATRPK) with and without biotin added to the N terminus was synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 430 peptide synthesizer, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation at the Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Dept. Biological Chemistry), Baltimore, MD. Biotinylated pVR was characterized by mass spectrometry at the JHU School of Medicine (Dept. Pharmacology) Mass Spectrometry Center, Baltimore, MD. Phosphatidylcholine, PI, and phosphatidylserine were purchased as chloroform stocks from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and stored at −20 °C. PI4P and PI4,5P2 were obtained as lyophilized powders from Sigma and were resuspended in distilled H2O, 0.5% βME, and stored (4 °C) for use in assays. PI3P, PI3,4P2, and PI3,4,5P3 were purchased from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA) as vacuum-dried powders and then resuspended in chloroform for storage at −20 °C. For the preparation of phosphatidylcholine, PI, and phosphatidylserine small unilamellar vesicles, chloroform stocks of these phospholipids were dried under N2 and then swollen at 5 mg/ml in distilled H2O, 0.5% βME, and then sonicated (30 min, 25 °C) in a Branson bath sonicator at the highest power setting. Small unilamellar vesicles containing both PI and PI4,5P2at the desired ratios were prepared by adding the required amount of PI4,5P2 (in distilled H2O, 0.5% βME) to a known amount of dried PI and then sonicating as described. PI3P, PI3,4P2, and PI3,4,5P3 were dried under N2 and resuspended in H2O, 0.5% βME before sonication (30 min, 25 °C). Likewise, solutions of PI4P and PI4,5P2 were sonicated (30 min, 25 °C) before use in assays. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by inorganic phosphate analysis using the Ames method (25Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, actin polymerization was induced by the addition of 100 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 from a concentrated stock solution as described previously (13Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For F-actin binding assays containing lipid, the MgCl2 concentration was reduced to 2 μm to eliminate background sedimentation of vinculin and vinculin tail fragment. For experiments in low magnesium, actin polymerization was initiated by adding 100 mm KCl and 0.1 μm sonicated (30 s, 25 °C) F-actin seed (polymerized 2 h, 25 °C by the addition of 100 mm KCl and 0.1 mm MgCl2 to a solution of 5 μmG-actin containing buffer A, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA) to the reaction mix (26Pollard T.D Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To complex pVR with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (SaAP), 4 μm biotinylated-pVR was incubated (1 h, 25 °C) with 20 units/ml SaAP (Boehringer-Mannheim) in a 100-μl reaction mix. After incubation, 5 μl of saturated (0.22 mg/ml) biotin was added to the reaction mix and then incubated (0.5 h, 25 °C) to block the remaining biotin-binding sites of SaAP. The pVR·SaAP complex was diluted 1/40 for use on Western blots. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) (27Mumby S.M. Buss J.E. METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1990; 1: 216-220Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and blocked with 10% BLOTTO in Tris-buffered saline (TBST; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Blots containing immobilized vinculin and vinculin head fragment were probed (1 h, 25 °C) with SaAP·pVR complexes, washed (4 × 10 min, 25 °C) with TBST, and then treated with Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (Sigma) in 0.1 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.5), 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 mmMgCl2 for colorimetric detection of SaAP·pVR complexes bound to either immobilized vinculin or V h. Methods specific to individual experiments are described in the figure legends. Complexes with biotinylated pVR were isolated by incubating (0.5 h, 25 °C, with inversion) assay mixtures with steptavidin(Sa)-agarose beads (Novagen) followed by low speed (2,000 rpm × 4 min) centrifugation. Equal volumes of the pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel) analysis (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and the amount of target protein bound to Sa-agarose·pVR complexes was determined by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. For relative quantitation, stained gels were dried, scanned, and analyzed densitometrically with the NIH Image program. PI4,5P2presented in micellar form, blocks the interaction of purified vinculin tail (V884–1066) with F-actin (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–8). Although the standard buffer for actin polymerization includes 2 mm MgCl2, experiments with micelles of pure PI4,5P2 were done in 0.002 mm Mg2+because 2 mm Mg2+ causes mixtures ofV t and PI4,5P2 to sediment in the absence of actin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9–12). Reduction of the MgCl2 concentration from 2 mmto 2 μm eliminated this problem (compare Fig.1 A, lanes 11–14 and lanes 3,4, 7, and 8). Presentation of PI4,5P2 in the form of mixed micelles with Triton X-100 also inhibited interaction of V t with F-actin (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of the interaction ofV t with actin by PI4,5P2 presented either in micellar form or as mixed micelles with Triton X-100, is dependent on the concentration of lipid (Fig. 1 B). Phosphatidylcholine at up to 100 μm has no effect on F-actin binding by vinculin tail (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of other phospholipids revealed that PI4,5P2/Triton X-100 mixed micelles (>200 μm), PI3,4P2 (30 μm), PI3,4,5P3 (30 μm), and phosphatidylserine (400 μm) inhibited completely the binding of purified vinculin tail to F-actin (data not shown). Because inhibition of the binding ofV t to actin by PI4,5P2 is not obviously consistent with a role of PI4,5P2 in exposing a functional actin-binding site on vinculin, we wanted to confirm the effects of acidic phospholipids on the conformational state of vinculin by assaying for co-sedimentation of vinculin with F-actin in the presence of either PI4,5P2/Triton X-100 mixed micelles (18Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) or pure PI4,5P2 micelles (16Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When the assay was controlled for the effect of MgCl2 on the aggregation and sedimentation of PI4,5P2 micelles, there was no co-sedimentation of vinculin with F-actin in the presence of micelles composed of pure PI4,5P2 (Fig. 2, A versus B). Divalent cations induce aggregation of PI4,5P2 micelles (29Flanagan L.A. Cunningham C.C. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Kosik K.S. Janmey P.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 73: 1440-1447Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar), thus proteins bound to PI4,5P2 micelles co-sediment with cation-induced PI4,5P2 aggregates. Although the Mg2+concentration does not affect the sedimentation of mixed micelles of PI4,5P2 and Triton X-100, when these mixed micelles were examined at more than one concentration, they also failed to induce dose-dependent co-sedimentation of vinculin with F-actin even when the PI4,5P2 concentration was raised to 100 μm (Fig. 2 C). As an independent means of assessing the effect of acidic phospholipids on exposure of the actin- and talin-binding sites of vinculin, we have used a peptide (KKKSTGGFDDVYDLARRVSSALTTTLVATRPK) isolated from a phage-displayed random peptide library based on binding of phage to immobilized vinculin (30Adey N.B. Kay B.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This peptide, called pVR, inhibits binding of talin, but not α-actinin or paxillin, to immobilized vinculin, suggesting that the peptide binds at or near the talin-binding domain of vinculin. Control peptides bearing the same net positive charge as pVR but having distinct amino acid sequences do not bind to vinculin (30Adey N.B. Kay B.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous work (30Adey N.B. Kay B.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) demonstrated that although pVR binds to vinculin that has been adsorbed to polystyrene, polyvinylidene difluoride, or nitrocellulose (Fig.3 B), it does not bind to vinculin in solution (Fig. 3 A). The pVR binding site, located in the first 258 amino acid residues of the N-terminal head domain of vinculin, is made accessible for solution-based assays by removing the C-terminal tail domain of vinculin, residues 857–1066 (Fig. 3 A) (30Adey N.B. Kay B.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that the intramolecular head-tail interaction of vinculin blocks the binding site for pVR. That pVR is a specific probe for the open conformation of native vinculin is further supported by the finding that addition of purified vinculin tail domain to the reaction mix inhibits binding of pVR to vinculin head fragment in a dose-dependent fashion (K i ∼ 0.4 μm) (Fig. 4 A). This experiment shows that pVR binding occurs specifically to a site onV h that is masked by V t in the closed conformation of vinculin rather than to a new site created by unfolding of V h after proteolytic removal ofV t. Conversely, pVR is able to compete binding ofV t to V h with ∼K i = 0.3 μm (Fig. 4 B) indicating that V t and pVR interact at or near the same site on V h. Collectively, these observations validate the use of pVR as a probe to identify the open conformation of full-length vinculin in vitro.Figure 4A, evaluation of pVR as a specific probe for the open conformation of vinculin in vitro.V h (0.3 μm) was incubated (1 h, 25 °C, 50-μl reaction) with a range (0.25–8 μm) of GST-V884–1066 (GST-V t) concentrations in PBS and 0.01% BSA before adding 1 μm (final concentration) biotinylated pVR to the reaction mix. Complexes with pVR were isolated as described, and the relative amounts ofV h co-sedimenting with Sa-agarose·pVR complexes in the presence (lanes 3 and 4, inset) or absence (lanes 1 and 2, inset) of GST-V t were quantified by densitometry of Coomassie Blue stained gels. The amount of V h pelleting in the absence of GST-V t represents 100% bound.B, competition of pVR for V t binding toV h . V h (0.35 μm) was incubated (1 h, 25 °C, 50 μl reaction) with a range (0.5–20 μm) of pVR (nonbiotinylated) concentrations in PBS and 0.01% BSA before adding 1 μmGST-V t to the reaction mix. GST·V t complexes were isolated by incubating (0.5 h, 25 °C, with inversion) the reaction mixes with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) followed by low speed (2,000 rpm × 4 min) centrifugation. Coomassie Blue stained gels of the resulting pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were analyzed by densitometry to determine the relative amounts of V hco-sedimenting with glutathione-agarose beads in the presence (lanes 3 and 4, inset) or absence (lanes 1 and 2, inset) of pVR. The amount of V h pelleting in the absence of pVR represents 100% bound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Using biotinylated pVR to examine the effects of PI4,5P2 exposure of the talin- and actin-binding sites on vinculin, we found that in 100 mm KCl only micelles of pure PI4,5P2 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–8) and bilayer vesicles containing at least 50% PI4,5P2 (Fig. 6 B) induce a dose-dependent opening of vinculin to expose the pVR binding site. Mixed Triton micelles containing up to 100 μm PI4,5P2 did not activate vinculin for pVR binding (Fig. 5 B, lanes 9–12). To control for the possibility that pVR associates with vinculin through the mutual affinity of vinculin and pVR for PI4,5P2 micelles rather than through a PI4,5P2-induced exposure of the pVR binding site on vinculin, we examined the interaction of pVR with vinculin tail in the presence of PI4,5P2. Although vinculin tail contains the high affinity PI4,5P2 binding site (14Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), pVR does not bind to purified vinculin tail in the presence of PI4,5P2(Fig. 5 C, lanes 13–16). Thus, polyphosphoinositide-induced binding of pVR to vinculin is mediated by the specific interaction of the peptide with its binding site in vinculin head domain.Figure 6A, abilities of various acidic phospholipids to induce pVR binding by vinculin. Reaction mix A (see Fig. 5 A) with or without 10 μm lipid (phosphatidylserine, PI, PI3P, PI4P, PI3,4P2, PI4,5P2, or PI3,4,5P3 as indicated) was incubated (0.5 h at 25 °C, 50-μl reaction). Reaction mix B (see Fig. 5 A) was then added, and the reaction was then incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Complexes with biotinylated pVR were isolated and analyzed as described, and the relative amounts of vinculin co-sedimenting with Sa-agarose·pVR complexes were determined. Plotted values represent the mean of three independent determinations, and bars indicate the mean ± S.E. B, effects of phospholipid packing on activating vinculin to bind pVR. The pVR binding activity of native vinculin was assayed (as described for Fig.6 A) in the presence of either pure PI4,5P2micelles, PI4,5P2/Triton X-100 mixed micelles, or mixed vesicles of PI4,5P2 and PI (at the ratios indicated in the figure). C, relative ability of different polyphosphoinositides to open vinculin for pVR binding. The level of pVR binding by vinculin was determined (as described for Fig.6 A) at physiologic ionic strength (100 mm KCl) in the presence of 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μmPI3,4P2, PI4,5P2, or PI3,4,5P3. Plotted values represent the mean of three independent determinations; error bars indicate the plotted mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Among the acidic phospholipids tested, only the polyphosphoinositides (PI3,4P2, PI4,5P2, and PI3,4,5P3) activated vinculin for pVR binding (Fig. 6 A) when the assay was performed in at least 100 mm salt. This polyphosphoinositide-induced activation of vinculin is dose-dependent (Fig. 6 C) and peaks at about 40 μm lipid. When the concentration of polyphosphoinositide is >40 μm, the level of pVR binding by vinculin decreases due to an apparent interaction between pVR and polyphosphoinositide at high concentrations of phospholipid (data not shown). Vinculin also binds to pVR when PI4,5P2 is presented in mixed vesicles with PI. However, maximal activation occurs only when PI4,5P2 represents at least 50% of the vesicular lipid (Fig. 6 B). The preceding results indicated that pVR could be used to determine whether vinculin in the open conformation can bind F-actin when the actin-binding site is not occluded by PI4,5P2. In solution, the closed conformation of vinculin is favored strongly because of the high affinity of the head-tail interaction and the fact that head and tail interact intramolecularly. However, equilibrium kinetics predicts that vinculin can be trapped kinetically in open form in the presence of a large molar excess of a ligand that inhibits the intramolecular head-tail interaction. pVR blocks the bimolecular interaction between the purified head and tail fragments of vinculin with aK i of ∼ 0.3 μm (Fig.4 B), consistent with the affinity (K d ∼ 0.1 μm) of pVR for vinculin head (30Adey N.B. Kay B.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When the concentration of pVR is raised to 6,000-fold molar excess over theK d determined for the bimolecular interaction of head and tail (K d ∼ 50 nm), vinculin becomes competent to bind F-actin (Fig.7). This effect of pVR on binding of vinculin to actin is specific because 95-kDa head fragment alone does not co-sediment with F-actin at similar concentrations of pVR. Sedimentation of vinculin requires the presence of both pVR and F-actin, and sedimentation of vinculin with actin depends upon the amount of pVR present (Fig. 7). We have found that micellar PI4,5P2 enables vinculin to bind pVR, but does not allow binding to F-actin. This result is consistent with the observation that PI4,5P2 inhibits binding of F-actin to purified V t. We also show that vinculin does bind F-actin when the intramolecular interaction of head and tail is displaced by an ∼6,000-fold molar excess of pVR over theK d for the bimolecular interaction of the purified head and tail domains. Previous studies have shown that PI4,5P2 and several other acidic phospholipids, inhibit the bimolecular interaction of purified head and purified tail (16Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition, there is partial overlap of vinculin's F-actin binding regions (residues 884–1012 and 1012–1066) (31Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (abstr.): 341Google Scholar, 32Huttelmaier S. Bubeck P. Rudiger M. Jockusch B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and acidic phospholipid binding regions (residues 916–970 and 1012–1066) (33Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10211-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,34Tempel M. Goldmann W.H. Isenberg G. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 228-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that PI4,5P2 inhibits the interaction of vinculin and V t with F-actin by occluding the actin-binding site. Altogether, the data are consistent with a model in which polyphosphoinositides presented in the form of micelles displace the head domain of vinculin by binding to the tail domain. Ligand-binding sites in V h are unmasked, but the F-actin binding sites in V t are occluded by the bound phospholipid (Fig. 8). Based on earlier work (33Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10211-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the tail domain of open vinculin will be partially buried in the hydrophobic core of the lipid micelles (Fig. 8). Several other actin-binding proteins are also inhibited by PI4,5P2 (35Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and recent structural evidence suggests a common mechanism of PI4,5P2 action. The atomic structure of gelsolin indicates that polyphosphoinositides compete with F-actin for binding to overlapping, solvent-exposed sites on plasma gelsolin (36Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Evidence also suggests a competitive mechanism for PI4,5P2disruption of profilin-actin (37Pollard T.D. Almo S. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and destrin-actin (38Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa I. Inagaki F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) complexes. A possible source of the difference between our results on the effects of micellar PI4,5P2 and those reported previously (16Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) is the concentration of MgCl2 used in the buffer for actin-binding assays. We observed that when 2 mmMgCl2 was a component of the actin polymerization buffer (as in Ref. 16Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), addition of pure PI4,5P2 micelles to the assay mix caused sedimentation of vinculin and vinculin tail in the absence of F-actin. At millimolar concentrations of divalent cation, PI4,5P2 micelles form large aggregates that pellet at speeds required to sediment F-actin (29Flanagan L.A. Cunningham C.C. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Kosik K.S. Janmey P.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 73: 1440-1447Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, proteins that bind to PI4,5P2 also sediment. The published data does not exclude the possibility that the MgCl2 effect on aggregation of PI4,5P2 micelles is a source of the difference between our results and those of Weekes et al.(16Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our data indicates that the physical packing of polyphosphoinositides in pure micelles is crucial for opening vinculin because mixed micelles of Triton X-100 and PI4,5P2 are unable to cause binding of pVR or F-actin to vinculin. This finding is inconsistent with an earlier report that mixed micelles containing 0.33 molecules of PI4,5P2/Triton micelle (10 μmPI4,5P2) activates vinculin to bind both talin and F-actin (18Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In our experiments, there is not a dose-dependent effect of mixed micelles containing from 0.33–3 molecules of PI4,5P2 per micelle on co-sedimentation of actin and vinculin. Although it is possible that we have not reproduced exactly the conditions of the previous report, the absence of data demonstrating a dependence of vinculin co-sedimentation with F-actin on the amount of PI4,5P2 in the Triton micelles (18Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), together with the results presented here, argues against a role for PI4,5P2 in exposing the actin-binding activity of vinculin. This conclusion is strengthened by the demonstration of dose-dependent inhibition of F-actin binding to purifiedV t by PI4,5P2 micelles and by PI4,5P2/Triton mixed micelles. Using pVR as a probe for the talin-binding conformation of vinculin, we examined the effects of various acidic phospholipids on exposure of the talin-binding site on vinculin. In buffers containing at least 100 mm KCl, only pure micelles of the polyphosphoinositides (PI3,4P2, PI4,5P2, and PI3,4,5P3) induce a dose-dependent binding of pVR to vinculin. The finding that 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids can induce conformational change in vinculin suggests that intracellular signaling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (to produce PI3,4P2 and PI3,4,5P3), along with those signals mediating PI4,5P2 levels, may also be important in vinculin activation. Evidently, differential exposure of various ligand-binding sites on vinculin can be achieved depending on the mechanism of conformational alteration. For example, PI4,5P2-induced changes in vinculin unmask the talin and pVR-binding site but block the actin-binding sites, whereas pVR-induced changes occupy the talin-binding site and expose the actin-binding sites (Fig. 8). The implication is that depending on the mechanism of activation, vinculin might be assembled into complexes that differ by virtue of which ligand-binding sites on vinculin are functional. This provides a potential mechanism for building functionally dissimilar protein complexes from the same repertoire of protein components. Currently it is thought that signal transduction events stimulate the local synthesis of PI4,5P2 at focal adhesions. This newly synthesized PI4,5P2 then recruits and/or opens vinculin to expose the sites for talin and F-actin, thereby contributing to assembly of plaque components and linkage of actin to the plasma membrane (18Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that in order for PI4,5P2-bound vinculin to bind actin, the PI4,5P2 would have to be hydrolyzed or displaced from vinculin. PI4,5P2 hydrolysis could occur by the action of a specific phospholipase or phosphatase, making the induction of vinculin's actin-binding activity a two step process. Alternatively, vinculin might be activated by yet unknown mechanisms that expose both the talin- and actin-binding activities.

Both the α and β subunit contain a C-terminal cyclase homology domain (CHD), which, in analogy to adenylyl cyclases and pGCs, constitutes a bipartite catalytic center by the association of the α and β C-terminal domains (4Koesling D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sGC activity depends on heterodimerization. Only the coexpression of α and β subunit cDNAs in heterologous expression systems constitutes active sGC (15Harteneck C. Koesling D. Söling A. Schultz G. Böhme E.

Moreover, sGC activity could not be restored by mixing of the expressed subunits (15Harteneck C. Koesling D. Söling A. Schultz G. Böhme E.

Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This prompted us to speculate whether homodimer formation of sGCα or sGCβ may also occur. It is, however, unknown whether α/α and/or β/β homodimers can assemble intracellularly or whether separately expressed sGC subunits stay monomeric in the absence of a complementary subunit. This would prevent the formation of a “two-CHD” catalytic center and thereby explain the lack of cGMP formation. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant human sGC subunits expressed in a baculovirus expression system, we here present a single-step purification method for recombinant human sGC (rhsGC) and its subunits, which enabled us to analyze the oligomerization behavior of the sGC subunits. Here we demonstrate for the first time the formation of homodimeric yet inactive sGC complexes. The possible physiological implications for regulation of sGC activity in intact cells are discussed.

All other chemicals were of the highest purity grade available and obtained from either Sigma Chemicals (Deisenhofen, Germany) or Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany). Water was deionized to 18mΩ cm (Milli-Q; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). cDNAs comprising the complete coding sequences for hsGCα and β subunits (17Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Giuili G. Scholl U. Bulle F. Guellaen G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pAcG2T baculovirus transfer vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), which allows the expression of GST-sGC fusion proteins and provides a thrombin cleavage site for proteolytic removal of the GST tag. For in-frame cloning, BamHI sites (underlined below) were introduced by polymerase chain reaction immediately upstream of the translational start sites. Fragments were amplified with the primer pairs 5′-AAAAGGATCCATGTTCTGCACGAAGCTC-3′ (bp 524–541) and 5′-ATTATGGAAGCAGGGAGG-3′ (bp 1249–1232) for α1 and 5′-AAAAGGATCCATGTACGGATTTGTGAAT-3′ (bp 89–106) and 5′-ATGCGTGATTCCTGGGTACC-3′ (bp 711–692) for β1. Products were cut with BamHI/BsaAI (α1) orBamHI/KpnI (β1) and ligated withBsaAI/EcoRI (bp 1193–3015, α1) orKpnI/EcoRI (bp 692–2444, β1) cDNA fragments to the BamHI/EcoRI-cleaved vector. Recombinant GST-hsGCα1 and GST-hsGCβ1 baculoviruses were isolated as described for hsGCα1 and hsGCβ1 baculoviruses (17Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were cultured as described (17Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For expression of nontagged rhsGC subunits, spinner cultures (2 × 106 cells ml−1) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses coding for hsGCα1 or hsGCβ1 (17Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. This high m.o.i. ensured that nearly all cells (>99%) were infected with the viruses encoding the nontagged subunits, which is necessary in the triple expression experiment shown in Fig. 2 D (see “Results”). Infections with GST-hsGCα and GST-hsGCβ viruses (see above) were performed at an m.o.i. of 0.5 plaque-forming units/cell, because expression levels of the GST-tagged rhsGC subunits were substantially higher (data not shown). Infection of cells with a baculovirus coding for GST (kind gift from C. Weber, Institut für Medizinische Strahlenkunde und Zellforschung, Würzburg) were performed at a m.o.i. of 2.5 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were harvested 72 h post infection, and all subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μg ml−1 soy bean trypsin inhibitor), and crude supernatant and particulate fractions were separated by centrifugation (20,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant fractions were brought to a final concentration of 75 mm NaCl; for storage at −20 °C, a final concentration of 10% (v/v) glycerol was used. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) was equilibrated with lysis buffer (see above) containing 75 mm NaCl, incubated with crude supernatant fractions of rhsGC-containing Sf9 cells for 1 h at 25 °C in a rotation mixer, and washed two or three times with lysis buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. For GSH elution, GSH-Sepharose was incubated with 5 mm GSH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min at 25 °C. Fractions were brought to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) glycerol and kept at −20 °C. Crude rhsGC-containing Sf9 supernatant fractions were subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for rhsGC-immunoreactive protein by Western blot. Signals were quantitated by flatbed scanning and densitometry using the NIH Image software (Division of Computer Research and Technology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The column was calibrated with standard proteins (Sigma) of known Stoke's radii: thyroglobulin (8.5 nm), apoferritin (6.1 nm), alcohol dehydrogenase (4.55 nm), bovine serum albumin (3.55 nm), and carbonic anhydrase (2.01 nm). sGC activity was measured as the formation of cGMP at 37 °C for 10 min in a total volume of 100 μl, containing 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm GSH, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.25 mg ml−1 creatine kinase, 500 μm GTP, and either 3 mmMgCl2 or 3 mm MnCl2. Reactions were started by adding the enzyme-containing fraction and immediately thereafter the sGC activator sodium nitroprusside (100 μm). The cGMP content was determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (Biotrend, Cologne, Germany). Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments. Immunodetection of nontagged and GST-tagged rhsGC subunits was performed as described previously (17Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), using polyclonal antibodies raised against peptide sequences that correspond to hsGCα1 (amino acids 634–647) and hsGCβ1 (amino acids 593–614), which were affinity-purified against the respective peptides. Blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To examine sGC subunit association, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify rhsGC and its subunits. Fusion proteins composed of a GST affinity tag (25 kDa), and the recombinant human sGCα1 and β1 subunits (rhsGCα1, 79.5 kDa, and rhsGCβ1, 68, 5 kDa (17Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) were constructed and expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the recombinant GST-rhsGCα1 and GST-rhsGCβ1 (GSTα, GSTβ) fusion proteins migrated with the expected apparent molecular masses of 105 and 94 kDa, bound to GSH-Sepharose, and were specifically eluted with GSH (lanes 2–5). In contrast, the nontagged rhsGCα1 (α) and rhsGCβ1 (β) subunits did not bind to the GSH beads (lanes 6–9). In addition to the full-length recombinant proteins, some sGC-immunoreactive degradation products were recognized in crude Sf9 lysates (lanes 2, 4, and6), which did not appear in lysates from noninfected Sf9 cells (lane 1). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the GST-tagged sGC subunits retained their ability to heterodimerize with the respective complementary nontagged subunit. When coexpressed in Sf9 cells, nontagged β co-eluted with GSTα and vice versa (lanes 1–4), indicating a direct physical interaction and demonstrating that addition of the GST tag did apparently not interfere with the dimerization function. Whereas coexpression of GSTα and β subunits yielded active and NO-sensitive sGC in crude Sf9 cell supernatant fractions, only basal sGC activity was obtained upon coexpression of GSTβ and α (Table I). Apparently, GST tagging of the sGCβ N terminus interfered with NO stimulation, probably because of the close proximity of the GST to the heme-binding site (11Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4502-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GSTα/β activity in the presence of Mg2+ was very similar to that of nontagged rhsGC expressed in the same system (17Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mn2+, basal sGC activity was increased, whereas NO-stimulated activity was decreased (Table I), as reported for native (21Waldman S.A. Murad F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 163-196PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant sGC (9Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24871-24875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Specific basal sGC activity was dramatically increased in the GSH eluate fraction (Table I), similar to sGCα/β prepared by multi-step purification procedures (8Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 240-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Braughler J.M. Mittal C.K. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, NO sensitivity of purified GSTα/β was preserved, because the enzyme was activated 30-fold by 100 μm sodium nitroprusside (Table I).Table ISpecific activities of rhsGC dimerssGC activityBasalSNPStimulation factorMg2+Mn2+Mg2+Mn2+Mg2+Mn2+nmol cGMP mg−1min−1nmol cGMP mg−1 min−1GSTα/β1.3 ± 0.37.6 ± 0.430.1 ± 5.117.7 ± 0.5232.3GSTβ/α0.5 ± 0.17.7 ± 1.20.5 ± 0.16.9 ± 0.210.9GSTα/α<0.03<0.03<0.03<0.03NANAGSTβ/β<0.03<0.03<0.03<0.03NANAGSTα or GSTβ were coexpressed with α or β in Sf9 cells.

The corresponding stimulation factors are provided (-fold). NA, not applicable. Heterodimerization of both GSTα/β and GSTβ/α complexes was dependent on coexpression of the respective subunits (Fig.1 B, lanes 5–8). Accordingly, no basal or NO-stimulated sGC activity was detected in the load or eluate fractions derived from separately expressed and mixed GSTα and β (or GSTβ and α) subunits (data not shown), which was in agreement with previous findings on nontagged α and β subunits (15Harteneck C. Koesling D. Söling A. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) When GSTα/α and GSTβ/β were coexpressed in Sf9 cells, none of the crude cell lysates contained any detectable sGC activity (i.e. <30 pmol cGMP mg−1 min−1; Table I), neither with Mg2+ nor Mn2+. To investigate whether sGC subunits homo-oligomerized, fractions were analyzed by Western blot. Interestingly, nontagged β efficiently copurified with GSTβ, demonstrating a direct physical interaction between sGCβ subunits (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and4). This β/β homodimerization was dependent on coexpression of both subunits (lanes 7 and 8). Similarly, the nontagged α subunit copurified with GSTα. However, binding of GSTα to the GSH-Sepharose was weakened when nontagged α was coexpressed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and2), requiring longer exposure times during Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). In contrast, nontagged α, which was expressed separately and mixed with GSTα, had no effect on binding of GSTα to the beads (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5 and 6). This demonstrated that nontagged α interacted with GSTα upon coexpression, leading to an interference with binding to GSH-Sepharose, possibly because of steric hindrance. Coelution of α and β with the respective GST-tagged subunit did not result from unspecific binding to the GSH-Sepharose, because the wash steps prior to elution did not contain any nontagged sGC (Fig. 2 B). Likewise, α and β did not coelute with GST alone (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, coelution of α with GSTα and of β with GSTβ represent specific protein-protein interactions of identical rhsGC subunits. To analyze whether single rhsGC subunits form dimeric (as does α/β) or multimeric complexes, crude Sf9 supernatant fractions containing rhsGC were subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Fig.3). To exclude any potential artifacts caused by the GST tag, nontagged subunits were applied in this set of experiments. As shown in Fig. 3 A, coexpressed rhsGCα and β subunits perfectly co-eluted upon size exclusion chromatography, with a Stoke's radius of 5.3 nm (Fig. 3 A,inset). A similar Stoke's radius (4.8 nm) was reported for heterodimeric sGC purified from rat lung (3Kamisaki Y. Saheki S. Nakane M. Palmieri J.A. Kuno T. Chang B.Y. Waldman S.A. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7236-7241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, rhsGCα and rhsGCβ, when expressed separately, showed an elution pattern very similar to heterodimeric sGC (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that both subunits indeed exist as homodimers. However, a fraction of rhsGCβ (<20%) formed aggregates under these conditions (Fig. 3 B,fractions 2–6). The peaks of rhsGCα and rhsGCβ were slightly separated, reflecting apparent differences in the Stoke's radii between the α/α and β/β homodimers (Fig.3 B). To further investigate whether sGC homodimer formation can occur also in the presence of complementary subunits, Sf9 cells were cotransfected with three viruses coding for GSTα, α, and β (or GSTβ, α and β). Viruses coding for α and β were applied at a high m.o.i. to ensure that nearly all cells (>99%) expressing GSTα (or GSTβ) were simultaneously infected with both α and β viruses. As shown in Fig. 2 D, heterodimer (i.e. GSTβ/α or GSTα/β), formation is preferred under these conditions in insect cells. However, about 10% of the recombinant protein formed GSTα/α or GSTβ/β complexes even in the presence of the respective complementary subunits. This demonstrated the existence of an equilibrium between homo- and heterodimeric sGC. Based on these data, sGCα and β subunits are in fact capable of forming homodimeric complexes in intact Sf9 cells. It has to be clarified whether classical purification methods efficiently remove homodimeric sGC from crude preparations of recombinant sGC or whether apparently homogenous sGC preparations contain “silent” homodimeric sGC. With the novel purification method presented here, only GSTα/β heterodimers will be purified, because β/β does not bind to the column. There are different potential mechanisms that might underlie the observed preferential heterodimer formation in Sf9 cells. Homodimer formation may be suppressed in intact cells because of a much higher affinity between complementary subunits. So far, no data on sGC dimerization kinetics and apparent K D values are available. However, the high stability of homodimeric sGC upon mixing of separately expressed subunits, which seems to be similar to that of heterodimeric sGC, argues against substantial affinity differences. On the other hand, sGC dimerization might be a regulated process in living cells. The existence of at least two different isoforms of each subunit (α1, α2, β1, and β2) led to the concept that sGC activity is regulated in vivo by alternative heterodimerization (4Koesling D. Humbert P. Schultz G. Nitric Oxide in the Nervous System. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 43-50Crossref Google Scholar, 5Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is an intriguing possibility that regulation of sGC activityin vivo might involve not only alternative heterodimerization but also changes in the extent of homodimerization. Based on our data, it cannot be excluded that a further protein is associated with homodimeric sGC complexes, which may be involved in complex formation and therefore be a functional inhibitor of sGC activity. An endogenous inhibitor of sGC has been described in Ref. 25Kim T.D. Burstyn J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Interestingly, both homo- and heterodimerization depend on co- or post-translational processes. It has been suggested that chaperone-mediated formation of hetero-oligomeric protein complexes is involved in the regulation of signaling pathways (26Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A related process may regulate sGC protein-protein interactions and thus NO/cGMP signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1991278351,"The interferon-inducible RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) is an RNA editing enzyme implicated in the site-selective deamination of adenosine to inosine in cellular pre-mRNAs. The pre-mRNA for the rat serotonin-2C receptor (5-HT2CR) possesses four editing sites (A, B, C, and D), which undergo A-to-I nucleotide conversions that alter the signaling function of the encoded G-protein-coupled receptor. Measurements of 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA editing in vitro revealed site-specific deamination catalyzed by ADAR1. Three splice site variants, ADAR1-a, -b, and -c, all efficiently edited the A site of 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA, but the D site did not serve as an efficient substrate for any of the ADAR1 variants. Mutational analysis of the three double-stranded (ds) RNA binding motifs present in ADAR1 revealed a different relative importance of the individual dsRNA binding motifs for deamination of the A site of 5-HT2CR and synthetic dsRNA substrates. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that the 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA was most highly expressed in the choroid plexus of rat brain. However, ADAR1 and the related deaminase ADAR2 showed significant expression in all regions of the brain examined, including cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and striatum, where the 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA was extensively edited.

RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process by which RNA transcripts are covalently modified in a manner that potentially alters the function of the encoded product (1Simpson L. Emeson R.B. Annu.

Cell. 1987; 48: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 7Rebagliati M.R. Melton D.A. Cell. 1987; 48: 599-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the search for naturally occurring substrates revealed multiple candidate RNAs that defined two types of A-to-I editing processes. First, in viral RNAs such modifications characteristic of adenosine deamination were found at multiple sites, as exemplified by the extensive adenosine modifications present on the viral antisense RNA late in polyoma virus infection (8Kumar M. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3542-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and by the biased hypermutations observed in negative-stranded RNA virus genomes during lytic and persistent infections, as in the case of measles virus (9Cattaneo R.

Second, highly site-specific A-to-I modifications have also been characterized that occur at one or a few sites in certain viral and cellular RNA transcripts, as demonstrated by the editing of hepatitis delta virus RNA (11Casey J.L.

Furthermore, the A-to-I deaminations observed both in viral genomes and cellular pre-mRNA transcripts are dependent upon double-stranded regions within the substrate RNAs (17Rueter S.M. Emeson R.B.

ADAR1 is a 1226-amino acid protein containing in the central region three functionally distinct copies of the highly conserved double-stranded RNA binding motif (dsRBM), designated as RI, RII, and RIII; these dsRBMs are implicated in the recognition of dsRNA structures within the substrate RNAs (21Patterson J.B.

More strikingly, characterization of ADAR1 and PKR genomic clones demonstrated that the codon phasing is precisely conserved at the junctions of the three exons which specify the three dsRBMs of ADAR1 and also at the junctions of the two exons that specify the two dsRBMs of PKR (38Liu Y.

Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The gene encoding these proteins maps to human chromosome 1q21.1–21.2 (39Weier H.-U.G. George C.X. Greulich K.M. Samuel C.E. Genomics. 1995; 30: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two promoters, one interferon-inducible and the other not, initiate transcription of the ADAR1 gene, and alternative splicing of unique exon 1 structures to a common exon 2 junction generates RNA transcripts with the deduced coding capacity for either the ∼150-kDa protein or the ∼110-kDa protein (40George C.X. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A second ADAR gene, ADAR2, encodes a ∼80-kDa protein (41Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A.

Genet. 1997; 23: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unlike ADAR1, ADAR2 has a shorter N-terminal region and only two dsRNA-binding motifs encoded by one single large exon (41Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 43Villard L. Tassone F. Haymowicz M. Welborn R. Gardiner K. Somat. Cell Mol.

The ADAR1 and ADAR2 dsRNA adenosine deaminases display differential editing activities for the editing sites within GluR-B RNA transcripts (16Maas S. Melcher T. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Keller W.

Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipursky S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995Google Scholar). We have described three naturally occurring splice variant isoforms of human ADAR1 (Fig. 1) that are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific fashion (38Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In comparison to the full-length 1226-amino acid ADAR1 protein (21Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 25Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ADAR1-c variant has an additional deletion of 19 amino acids resulting from a 3′-splice site selection between the RII and RIII dsRBMs. Although the three ADAR1 isoforms exhibit comparable deaminase activity when assessed with a synthetic dsRNA substrate, site-directed mutagenesis of individual dsRBMs revealed that the three dsRBM copies in ADAR1 variants are functionally distinct (38Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similar to ADAR1, multiple splice variant isoforms of ADAR2 have also been identified, some of which show distinguishable deaminase activities (42Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the case of ADAR2, the alternative splice site variants differ in the catalytic domain (42Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 43Villard L. Tassone F. Haymowicz M. Welborn R. Gardiner K. Somat. Cell Mol.

Brain Res. 1997; 52: 130-138Google Scholar), and at the extreme C terminus (42Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) rather than in the RNA-binding region as seen for the ADAR1 variants (38Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is now apparent that the RNA-specific adenosine deaminases constitute a family of enzymes specified by alternative splicing of transcripts from at least two genes.Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is a biogenic amine that elicits a wide variety of physiological functions as a neurotransmitter, mediated by interaction with multiple distinct subtypes of cell surface receptors (47Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). The rat serotonin-2C receptor (5-HT2CR), one of the three 5-HT2 subtype receptors linked to phospholipase C via G-protein coupling, is regulated by RNA editing (48Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The third exon of 5-HT2CR includes the coding region for the second putative intracellular loop of the receptor (49Julius D. MacDermott A.B. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Science. 1988; 241: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Within the third exon of 5-HT2CR, four A-to-I editing sites (denoted A, B, C, and D) have been identified that specify three amino acid substitutions (48Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The genomic sequence specifies amino acid residues Ile, Asn, and Ile in the three positions that are substituted with the residues Val, Ser, and Val that are encoded by the fully edited mRNA (Fig. 2 A). This editing is dictated by a sequence within the adjacent intron 3 that possesses an imperfect inverted repeat, which forms a potential duplex structure with the 3′ end of exon 3 where the sites of adenosine deamination are located (17Rueter S.M. Emeson R.B. Modifications and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 343-361Google Scholar). Editing at all of the four sites results in a 10–15-fold reduction in G-protein-mediated signaling as assessed by dose-response analysis of inositol phosphate accumulation with serotonergic agonists in transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells (48Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Co-transfection experiments indicated that both ADAR1 and ADAR2 are involved in editing the 5-HT2CR RNA (48Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar).Figure 2Editing of the 5-HT2C receptor RNA. A, schematic representation showing the four sites of editing (A, B, C, and D) located in exon 3 of the 5-HT2Creceptor pre-mRNA. A-to-I modification at the four sites results in the change of the genomically encoded INI codons to the VSV codons present in the edited mRNA. The position of the imperfect inverted repeat forming an RNA duplex between the 3′-end of exon 3 spanning the four editing sites and the 5′ end of intron 3 is shown by theoverlying arrows.

The sense sequence is shown for the RT-PCR products spanning the region of the four sites of editing. End-labeled antisense primer (−)AB was used to analyze the editing efficiency at the A and B sites in the presence of a dideoxynucleotide mixture containing either ddCTP or ddTTP as indicated. End-labeled sense primer (+)CD was used to analyze the editing efficiency at the C and D sites in the presence of ddGTP. The end-labeled (*) primers are shown by open bars, with arrows at the end. The predicted extension products are shown by the sequences extending from the primers, with the sizes (nt) in parentheses for RNAs that contained edited or non-edited sites as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In this study, we describe the site-dependent in vitro editing of 5-HT2CR transcripts by the splice variant isoforms of ADAR1 (38Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All three ADAR1 variants were significantly more efficient for editing the A than the B or C sites of 5-HT2CR RNA in vitro, while none was capable of effectively modifying the D site. Mutational analysis of the three dsRBM motifs showed that the RI and RII motifs were relatively more important for the editing of the 5-HT2CR RNA in vitro than for the deamination of a synthetic dsRNA substrate. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses of the RNA transcripts from dissected rat brain regions revealed the differential expression of the key RNA editing components, including ADAR1-a and -b, ADAR2, and the substrate 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA. Higher levels of ADAR1-a transcripts were detected than ADAR1-b in all samples. However, among the brain regions examined, ADAR1-b transcripts were most abundant in choroid plexus, the same region where the 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA substrate was also present at the greatest level.DISCUSSIONUsing individual recombinant ADAR1 proteins, we found that the ADAR1-a, -b, and -c splice site variants exhibited differential A-to-I editing activities for the four target sites within a 288-nt 5-HT2CR substrate RNA. The three human ADAR1 variants all possessed editing activity for the A, B, and C editing sites of 5-HT2CR but were inactive for the D site (Fig. 3). However, they showed substantially greater activity for the A site than for either the B or C site. These results indicate that the two deletions introduced by alternative splicing that alter the spacing between the RNA-binding motifs and the catalytic domain of ADAR1 do not significantly affect the site-selectivity for editing the 5-HT2CR RNA substrate in vitro. However, for the A and C sites, ADAR1-b and -c possessed somewhat higher editing activity than did ADAR1-a; by contrast, ADAR1-a was more active than ADAR1-b and -c for the B site editing (Fig. 3). The differential activities displayed by the ADAR1 splice site variants suggest that the two deletions in the spacer regions may indeed affect how efficiently an adenosine at a particular site of the substrate bound by the dsRBMs is presented to the catalytic center of ADAR1 for deamination.Mutational analysis revealed that the functional importance of the repeated RNA-binding motifs RI, RII, and RIII differed for the editing of the A site of 5-HT2CR RNA as compared with the random deamination of a synthetic dsRNA substrate (Fig. 4). When the deaminase activities of wild-type and single amino acid substitution mutant ADAR1-b proteins were compared for A site editing and dsRNA deamination, the RI and RII dsRBM motifs were found to be more important with the 5-HT2CR RNA substrate than a synthetic dsRNA substrate. The RIII motif was of central importance for editing the A site of 5-HT2CR RNA, consistent with earlier observations obtained with synthetic dsRNA (37Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GluR-B RNA (51Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5070-5077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) where a wild-type RIII motif was found essential for efficient catalysis. However, the RI and RIIdsRBM motifs were relatively less important for deamination of synthetic dsRNA (38Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the R/G site of GluR-B RNA (51Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5070-5077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to dsRNA and the R/G site of GluR-B RNA, the RImotif in addition to the RIII motif was especially important for efficient A site editing of 5-HT2CR RNA. These differences between 5-HT2CR RNA and the GluR-B RNA and dsRNA substrates conceivably reflect sequence-dependent structural features of the serotonin receptor RNA required to confer binding with specificity for selective deamination of the A site. Surprisingly little is known about the molecular basis of protein-dsRNA interactions relative to our understanding of protein-DNA interactions. NMR and crystallography studies of the isolated dsRBM fromEscherichia coli RNase III and Xenopus laevisRNA-binding proteins show an α-β-β-β-α protein topology (32Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,52Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The residues of the dsRBM involved in RNA binding cluster on one face of the motif and, with synthetic dsRNA, the XenopusdsRBM interacts with two successive minor grooves and across the intervening major groove on one face of the RNA helix (52Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). RNAs selected for binding to the dsRNA binding motifs of the PKR kinase often possess secondary structure defects consistent with a role of A-G mismatch and noncontiguous helixes in PKR dsRBM-RNA interactions (53Bevilacqua P.C. George C.X. Samuel C.E. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6303-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of brain RNA demonstrated significant expression, in all five of the rat brain regions examined, of the principal components known to be involved in the editing of 5-HT2CR RNA. These included pre-mRNA encoding 5-HT2CR, the bona fide substrate for deamination reaction, as well as ADAR1 and ADAR2, the two ADAR enzymes thought to mediate the editing reaction (48Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Two ADAR1 splice variants, ADAR1-a and -b, as well as ADAR2, were expressed in all brain regions, whereas the ADAR1-c variant was not detectable in any of the brain regions examined (Fig. 5 A). ADAR1-a was the major form of ADAR1 detected in all regions of the brain. Curiously, however, expression of ADAR1-b and the 5-HT2CR showed a similar region-specific pattern. The greatest expression of ADAR1-b was observed in choroid plexus where the 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA was also most abundant (Fig. 5), as was found for mature 5-HT2CR mRNA (data not shown; Ref. 54Canton H. Emeson R.B. Barker E.L. Backstrom J.R. Lu J.T Chang M.S. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 799-807PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the likely presence of several other RNA species in addition to 5-HT2CR RNA that serve as substrates for ADAR editing, such as RNAs encoding GluR subunits (17Rueter S.M. Emeson R.B. Modifications and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 343-361Google Scholar,51Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5070-5077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is not unexpected that there is no obvious correlation between the expression levels of ADAR enzymes and their 5-HT2CR RNA substrate. Based upon the study of inosine-containing RNA transcripts, it has been estimated that one adenosine out of every ∼17,000 nucleotides of mRNA in the brain undergoes A-to-I editing (55Paul M.S. Bass B.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The exp"

Such a function predicts that synaptotagmin III should be an obligatory synaptic vesicle protein, as would also be anticipated from its high homology to synaptotagmins I and II. To test this hypothesis, we studied the distribution, developmental expression, and localization of synaptotagmin III and its closest homolog, synaptotagmin VI. We find that synaptotagmins III and VI are present in all brain regions in heterogeneous distributions and that their levels increase during development in parallel with synaptogenesis. Furthermore, we show by immunocytochemistry that synaptotagmin III is concentrated in synapses, as expected. Surprisingly, however, we observed that synaptotagmin III is highly enriched in synaptic plasma membranes but not in synaptic vesicles. Synaptotagmin VI was also found to be relatively excluded from synaptic vesicles. Our data suggest that synaptotagmins III and VI perform roles in neurons that are not linked to synaptic vesicle exocytosis but to other Ca2+-related nerve terminal events, indicating that the functions of synaptotagmins are more diverse than originally thought.

C2-domains are general Ca2+-binding motifs that function as Ca2+-binding modules in most synaptotagmins (reviewed in Ref. 6Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In some synaptotagmins, however, the C2-domains contain sequence changes that probably abolish Ca2+ binding (e.g. synaptotagmins IV and XI; Refs. 3Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N.

Synaptotagmins I and II, the first molecularly characterized synaptotagmins (8Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 9Geppert M. Archer III, B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are abundant synaptic vesicle proteins that are differentially expressed; synaptotagmin I is primarily present in rostral regions, and synaptotagmin II is primarily present in caudal brain regions (9Geppert M. Archer III, B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Knockout experiments in mice revealed that synaptotagmin I is essential for fast Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release but is not required for exocytosis as such; slow Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release and Ca2+-independent release were still functional in the knockout animals (11Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). These results indicated that synaptotagmin I functions as a Ca2+ sensor for fast synaptic vesicle exocytosis in upper brain regions. Synaptotagmin II probably performs an equivalent role in lower brain regions because it is very homologous to synaptotagmin I and is also enriched in synaptic vesicles (9Geppert M. Archer III, B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Similar to synaptotagmins I and II, synaptotagmins III-XII are expressed primarily in brain (3Li C. Ullrich B.

However, the mRNAs of most of these other synaptotagmins are detectable at low levels outside of the brain (3Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 12Mizuta M. Inagaki N. Nemoto Y. Matsukura S. Takahashi M. Seino S. J. Biol.

Although the enrichment of synaptotagmins III-XII in brain and their homology to synaptotagmins I and II led to the notion that synaptotagmins III-XII may also reside on the synaptic vesicle, their localizations and potential functions have not been investigated in detail. Synaptotagmin III is particularly interesting because it is the most abundant synaptotagmin after synaptotagmins I and II and because it exhibits Ca2+-binding characteristics that resemble the Ca2+ requirements of the slow component of Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release (18Li C. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12942-12946Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the hypothesis that synaptotagmin III may mediate the slow component of neurotransmitter release (18Li C. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, synaptotagmin III is enriched in synapses, detectable in purified synaptic vesicles, and heteromultimerizes with synaptotagmin I in vitro (10Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in pancreatic β-cells, synaptotagmin III is present on secretory granules and may mediate Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of these granules (22Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If synaptotagmin III indeed functions as an exocytotic Ca2+ sensor similar to synaptotagmins I and II, it should also be on the secretory vesicles that undergo exocytosis. However, the localization of synaptotagmin III (or other synaptotagmins except for synaptotagmins I and II) was not investigated systematically and quantitatively, and its precise distribution is unknown. In the current study, we have examined the subcellular localization of synaptotagmin III and its closest relative, synaptotagmin VI. Surprisingly, we find that synaptotagmins III and VI are not enriched in synaptic vesicles. Instead, synaptotagmin III is highly concentrated on synaptic plasma membranes, and synaptotagmin VI is widely present in membranes. Our data suggest that synaptotagmins may be functionally more diverse than previously envisioned. Specificity tests revealed that our previously raised antibodies against the C2-domains of synaptotagmins III and VI (L181 and I471, respectively) weakly cross-react with other synaptotagmins, presumably because their C2-domains are so similar. Therefore we generated a new set of antibodies to the sequence between the transmembrane region and the C2A-domain of synaptotagmins III and VI (residues 88–296 and 86–229 of synaptotagmins III and VI, respectively (3Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 12Mizuta M. Inagaki N. Nemoto Y. Matsukura S. Takahashi M. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11675-11678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Rabbits were immunized with glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins (produced in the pGEX-KG vector (23Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar)), and the resulting sera (S754 and S756 for synaptotagmins III and VI, respectively) were affinity-purified on immobilized maltose-binding protein fusion proteins containing the same sequences of synaptotagmins (in pMal-C2; New England Biolabs). The specificity of all antibodies was tested by probing extracts from COS cells transfected with individual synaptotagmins and by comparing their reactivities with brains from wild type and knockout mice that lack either synaptotagmin III or VI. 1R. Fernandez Chacon, R. E. Hammer, and T. C. Südhof, unpublished observation. Cryostat sections (5–15 μm) from rat and mouse brains or bovine retina were probed with affinity-purified synaptotagmin antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled or biotin-labeled secondary antibodies and development of the signal with the StreptABComplex/HRP kit (DAKO) or by metal enhancement essentially as described previously (24Rosahl T.W.

The specificity of the signals was ascertained by two controls: 1) blocking of the signal with the recombinant protein used for antibody production, and 2) analysis of brains from knockout mice lacking synaptotagmin III.1 Rat brain homogenates were subfractionated into crude synaptic vesicles, mitochondria, myelin, and synaptic plasma membranes by the method of Jones and Matus (27Jones D.H. Matus I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). For this purpose, whole brains including cerebella, olfactory bulbs, and brain stem from 4–6-week-old rats were homogenized in ice-cold 0.32m sucrose using a motorized glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and debris, and the resulting supernatant was re-centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 20 min to obtain synaptosomes and the synaptosomal supernatant. The synaptosomes in the pellet were washed once in 0.32 m sucrose, lysed hypotonically, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to isolate large synaptosomal membranes in the pellet, whereas the free synaptic vesicles remained in the supernatant under these conditions. The synaptosomal membranes were resuspended in dH2O, sucrose was added to 1.1 m, and the solution was placed at the bottom of a Beckman SW28 rotor tube. The sample was overlaid with 0.855 and 0.32 m sucrose solutions and centrifuged for 2.5 h at 19,000 rpm, resulting in the isolation of myelin (in the 0.32/0.855 m sucrose interface), synaptic plasma membranes (in the 0.855/1.1 msucrose interface), and mitochondria (in the pellet). For the purification of synaptic vesicles, hypotonically lysed synaptosomes were used as a starting point for the isolation of crude synaptic vesicles that were further purified by velocity-density gradient centrifugation and controlled pore glass chromatography essentially as described previously (28Nagy A. Baker R.R. Morris S.J. Whittaker V.P. Brain Res. 1976; 109: 285-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). For organelle immunoisolation, beads with immobilized monoclonal antibodies to synaptotagmin I (Cl41.1) or synaptobrevin II (Cl69.1) and control beads containing only immobilized glycine were prepared as described previously (30Burger P.M. Hell J. Mehl E. Krasel C. Lottspeich F. Jahn R. Neuron. 1989; 7: 287-293Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Walch-Solimena C. Takei K. Daniels L. Khokhlatchev A. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 319-326PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brains were homogenized in 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.32 msucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 mg/liter pepstatin A, and 10 mg/liter aprotinin. The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 7,800 × g to generate a postnuclear supernatant. Beads were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C under rotation with the postnuclear supernatant and washed four times, and bound proteins were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using 125I-labeled secondary antibodies. To quantitate the relative levels of proteins in various fractions for the purification of synaptic vesicles by subcellular fractionation or by immunobead precipitation, we reacted immunoblots of the various fractions with125I-labeled secondary antibodies and measured the respective signals in a phosphorimager. All blots were probed simultaneously with antibodies to the protein under study and antibodies to synaptogyrin as an internal vesicle protein standard (32Stenius K. Janz R. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 131: 1801-1809Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The synaptotagmin signals were then normalized for the synaptogyrin signal by designating the ratio of the two signals observed in starting brain homogenates or postnuclear supernatants as 1.0. For the immunobead experiments, the signals obtained in pulldowns with glycine control beads were subtracted from the values from the immunobead pulldowns before the ratios were calculated. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed using standard procedures (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence except for the quantitative experiments described above. We raised multiple antibodies to synaptotagmins III and VI, affinity-purified the antibodies, and tested their specificity using COS cells transfected with various synaptotagmins (data not shown). Our initial antibodies were directed against the C2-domains of synaptotagmins III and VI. These antibodies, however, exhibited cross-reactivity with the more abundant synaptotagmins I and II, thereby limiting their usefulness. Therefore, we subsequently raised more specific antibodies using the sequence that connects the transmembrane region with the C2-domains and varies considerably between different synaptotagmins (7von Poser C.

At least one of these antibodies for each synaptotagmin was specific for that particular isoform, based on the following evidence: 1) as shown for synaptotagmin III in Fig.1, the antibodies specifically reacted with the cognate protein expressed in COS cells and recognized a single band (synaptotagmin III) or two closely co-migrating bands (synaptotagmin VI; see below) in total brain extract; and 2) immunoblots of total brain homogenates from wild type mice and from knockout mice lacking either synaptotagmin III or synaptotagmin VI were analyzed (Fig. 2). The generation and analysis of these knockout mice will be reported in a later, more detailed report.1 The mouse immunoblots confirmed that the synaptotagmin III antibodies reacted with a single band and that the synaptotagmin VI antibodies reacted with a set of two closely spaced bands in brain. In the knockouts that contain all other synaptotagmins, the reactivity was abolished (Fig. 2).Figure 2Definition of antibody specificity to synaptotagmins III and VI by immunoblot analysis of brains from wild type mice and from knockout mice lacking synaptotagmins III (A) or VI (B). Brain homogenates from the indicated mice were immunoblotted with affinity-purified antibodies to synaptotagmins III (A) and VI (B). Note that the immunoreactive bands are absent in the knockout mice, indicating that the antibodies we raised are highly specific for those particular isoforms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Using these antibodies, we examined the regional distribution of synaptotagmins I, III, and VI in rat brain (Fig.3). As described previously (9Geppert M. Archer III, B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synaptotagmin I was expressed in much higher levels in upper brain regions than in hindbrain and spinal cord (which in turn synthesize higher levels of synaptotagmin II). CASK as a general synaptic marker was uniformly present in all brain regions (35Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hsueh Y.-P. Yang F.-C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The expression of synaptotagmins III and VI, however, exhibited a different pattern: both synaptotagmins were present in all brain regions but displayed large regional variations. Synaptotagmin III was almost undetectable in the cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb but was highly expressed in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, it was present at moderate levels in spinal cord and hindbrain (Fig. 3). Synaptotagmin VI was synthesized at rather low levels in all brain areas except for the olfactory bulb, which contained exceptionally high levels of this isoform. Previous data suggested that synaptotagmin III is localized to synapses (10Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This result was supported in the current study by two independent observations. First, we examined the developmental expression profile of synaptotagmins. The level of synaptic vesicle proteins goes up dramatically postnatally in parallel with synaptogenesis (37Daly C. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we analyzed brain proteins from rat forebrain as a function of age, we found that synaptotagmin I levels increased postnatally, as expected (10Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). By contrast, the general trafficking protein rab5 exhibited only a moderate developmental change. Synaptotagmins III and VI, similar to synaptotagmin I, experienced a striking postnatal increase in levels that paralleled the time course of synaptotagenesis (Fig. 4). In adults, the levels of synaptotagmin VI, but not synaptotagmins I and III, decreased slightly. Two closely migrating bands were observed for synaptotagmin VI that may be due to alternative splicing; the molecular basis for this heterogeneity is unclear. The second observation confirming a synaptic localization of synaptotagmin III was obtained by immunocytochemistry. Unfortunately, the quality of our synaptotagmin VI antibodies precluded a morphological localization; even the signal for synaptotagmin III in immunocytochemical stains was insufficient to allow immunoelectronmicroscopy. At the light level, however, synaptotagmin III was present in a pattern strongly suggestive of a synaptic localization (Fig. 5; data not shown). This was most clear in the retina, which contains two sharply delineated synaptic layers, the thin outer plexiform layer composed of photoreceptor synapses and the broader inner plexiform layer comprising multiple sublayers of synapses (38Dowling J. The Retina. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1987Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin III was highly concentrated in the two synaptic layers in the retina, similar to synaptotagmin I (Fig. 5). The only difference between synaptotagmins I and III was that in the inner plexiform layer, synaptotagmin I was present throughout the synaptic zone, whereas synaptotagmin III was enriched in a few sharply delineated sublayers (Fig. 5). These data confirm that synaptotagmin III is highly enriched in synapses. Because synaptotagmins I and II are known stoichiometric components of synaptic vesicles (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and are highly homologous to synaptotagmins III and VI (3Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 12Mizuta M. Inagaki N. Nemoto Y. Matsukura S. Takahashi M. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11675-11678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a logical presumption is that synaptotagmins III and VI are also vesicle proteins. This is supported by the finding that all synaptotagmins are co-enriched in brain, where they appear to be concentrated in the synapses, and that at least some synaptotagmin III protein can be detected in the vesicles (10Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Mizuta M. Inagaki N. Nemoto Y. Matsukura S. Takahashi M. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11675-11678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the relative distributions of synaptotagmins between various brain fractions was never quantitatively examined. Therefore, we studied this question systematically by subcellular fractionation (Fig.6). As expected, synaptotagmin I was enriched in two fractions: 1) free synaptic vesicles (Fig. 6,lane 6), and 2) synaptic plasma membranes that contain active zones with firmly docked vesicles (lane 7). Synaptotagmin III was also detectable in free synaptic vesicles but, surprisingly, was not enriched in the vesicles (Fig. 6, lane 6). Instead, it was highly concentrated in synaptic plasma membranes (lane 7). The pattern of synaptotagmin III closely resembled that of neurexins, which are known components of the presynaptic plasma membrane (39Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin VI was evenly present in all fractions and was also not particularly enriched in synaptic vesicles. The distributions of synaptogyrin I as an additional synaptic vesicle marker (32Stenius K. Janz R. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 131: 1801-1809Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and of complexins as a marker for the cytosol (40McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) were analyzed as controls in the same blots and found to be localized in the appropriate fractions (Fig. 6). The subcellular fractionation data raised the possibility that synaptotagmin III, although present in synapses, may not actually be a synaptic vesicle protein. To test this hypothesis, we performed systematic studies on the enrichment of synaptotagmins with synaptic vesicles. We used two complementary techniques in these studies: 1) purification of synaptic vesicles by CPG 2The abbreviation used is: CPG, controlled pore glass.chromatography (Fig.7), which is widely accepted as the method that yields the most highly purified vesicles (28Nagy A. Baker R.R. Morris S.J. Whittaker V.P. Brain Res. 1976; 109: 285-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J.

A, immunoblots of the starting homogenate (postnuclear supernatant) and the pellets obtained with beads coated with glycine or with antibodies to synaptotagmin I or synaptobrevin II. Pictures shown represent equivalent exposures of blots reacted with 125I-labeled secondary antibodies.B, ratios of synaptotagmins I, III, and VI to synaptogyrin I in immunobead pellets from multiple independent experiments. Analysis was performed as described for Fig. 7, except that the signal obtained with glycine beads was subtracted as background. Note that the enrichment value of ≈1 found for synaptotagmin I in these experiments shows that synaptotagmin I is present in synaptic vesicles in the same ratio to synaptogyrin as in brain homogenates, whereas the ratio decreases dramatically for the other synaptotagmins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) First, we examined the levels of various synaptotagmins by quantitative immunoblotting in four fractions obtained during the isolation of highly purified vesicles. In this purification procedure, starting homogenate (Fig. 7, lane 1) is used to purify synaptosomes (lane 2) that yield free synaptic vesicles (lane 3; see also Fig. 6) that are further purified by CPG chromatography (lane 4). Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-gels revealed that the protein composition of synaptic vesicles changed dramatically upon purification of the vesicles by CPG chromatography (data not shown). We then measured the relative enrichment of various synaptotagmins by immunoblotting with 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and phosphorimager detection; all blots were probed for synaptogyrin as an internal standard. Data were calculated as the signal ratios of the protein of interest to synaptogyrin I. For the purpose of normalization, the ratio observed in the starting fraction was set as 1.0. As expected, the abundance of synaptotagmin I and synaptogyrin I, two known vesicle proteins, increased in parallel during purification; thus, their ratio remained constantly close to 1.0 (Fig. 7 B). Synaptotagmins III and VI, however, did not increase with synaptotagmin I during synaptic vesicle preparation; their ratio to synaptogyrin decreased significantly in pure synaptic vesicles (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that synaptotagmins III and VI are not obligatory vesicle components but de-enrich from the vesicles. To confirm this unexpected result by an independent method, we performed experiments in which organelles were immunoisolated from rat brain homogenates with beads coated with antibodies to either synaptotagmin I or synaptobrevin II, which are known synaptic vesicle proteins. As a control, incubations were performed with beads that were coated only with glycine (30Burger P.M. Hell J. Mehl E. Krasel C. Lottspeich F. Jahn R. Neuron. 1989; 7: 287-293Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Walch-Solimena C. Takei K. Daniels L. Khokhlatchev A. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 319-326PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 A). The resulting fractions were again analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting, and the signals obtained for glycine beads were subtracted from the synaptotagmin I or synaptobrevin II bead signals. As in the biochemical preparations, we normalized all results for synaptogyrin analyzed on the same gels. As before, immunoisolation dramatically increased the levels of synaptotagmin I and synaptogyrin I in the samples, and their ratio remained constant. In contrast, a quantitative loss of synaptotagmins III and VI from the immunoisolated vesicles was observed; their ratio to synaptogyrin decreased significantly in the immunisolated samples. (Fig. 8 B). The two kinds of beads coated with the different antibodies gave identical results, thereby confirming each other. Synaptotagmins are a large family of homologous proteins that are enriched in brain and thought to function in Ca2+-regulated membrane traffic. Although synaptotagmins I and II have known functions in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, little is known about the localizations, properties, and functions of the other synaptotagmins. In the current study, we examined the localizations of synaptotagmins III and VI. Unexpectedly, we have found that synaptotagmin III, although synaptic, is not on synaptic vesicles, and that synaptotagmin VI also fails to co-purify with synaptic vesicles. Our data suggest that the functions of nerve terminals must involve other, as yet unidentified Ca2+-regulated membrane trafficking pathways that involve these synaptotagmins. The high concentration of synaptotagmin III in synaptic plasma membranes raises the possibility that this isoform may, in fact, not be on an intracellular vesicle but may be localized to the plasma membrane. One possibility is that synaptotagmin III is a plasma membrane protein that could regulate the expansion of presynaptic plasma membranes as a function of activity; another possibility is that an as yet unidentified organelle co-purifies with synaptic plasma membranes and represents the true localization of this isoform. Future experiments will have to test this and other possible hypotheses about what the functions of these proteins might be in synapses that do not directly involve synaptic vesicles."

When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the methyllycaconitine (MLA)- and α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt)-sensitive homomeric α7 receptor is noncompetitively inhibited by the transmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)) and exhibits fast desensitization, pronounced inward rectification of ACh-evoked current, and low affinity for ACh (7Couturier S.

The L247T mutation of the highly conserved leucine residue in the M2 channel domain of the α7 receptor converts 5HT from antagonist to agonist, abolishes inward rectification, enhances the apparent binding affinity for ACh 100-fold, and considerably decreases the rate of desensitization (18Palma E.

Using the idiosyncratic properties of the L247Tα7 receptor as a tool to investigate whether β3 can participate in functional receptor formation, we injected β3 andL247Tα7 cDNAs into the nuclei of Xenopusoocytes and studied the functional properties of the expressed nAChRs. We report here that coinjection of β3 and L247Tα7 cDNAs causes the formation of an heteromeric nAChR with functional properties clearly different from those of the homomericL247Tα7 receptor. We also show that β3 co-assembles with wild type α7 (WTα7), but that the resulting heteromeric nAChR is insensitive to ACh. The cDNAs encoding chick WTα7 andL247Tα7 neuronal nAChR subunits were cloned into the Flip vector, where transcription is under the control of the SV40 early promoter (7Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). To maximize expression of the chick β3 subunit, its cDNA was subcloned in the pMT3 expression vector (21Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) under the control of the efficient adenovirus major late promoter. The same vector was used to express the V250Tβ3 and theS243Cβ3 mutant subunits. Mutagenesis of β3 was carried out using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). We induced the point mutations using high performance liquid chromatography-purified mutant oligonucleotides with 15–16 nucleotides flanking the mutated bases. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis based on the Sanger dideoxy termination method (manually or with an ABI 377 sequenator). To verify the absence of undesired nucleotide changes, the entire coding region was sequenced. Methanethiosulfonate ethylamine hydrobromide (MTSEA), methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium bromide (MTSET), and sodium methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES) freshly dissolved in oocyte Ringer's medium (see voltage-clamp recordings) were added to the oocytes at concentrations of 2.5, 1, and 10 mm,respectively, as detailed elsewhere (22Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 23Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The 2-min application of MTS derivatives to the oocytes in the presence or absence of 100 μm ACh was preceded and followed by a 5-min perfusion with oocyte Ringer's medium (2Ramirez-Latorre J. Yu C.R. Qu X. Perin F. Karlin A. Role L. Nature. 1996; 380: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 22Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The α7 plasmids were coinjected with WTβ3,V250Tβ3, and S243Cβ3 subunit cDNAs at α7/β3 ratios ranging between 1:3 and 1:0.5 (0.2–0.8 ng of injected cDNA). Preparation of oocytes and nuclear injection procedures are detailed elsewhere (24Bertrand D. Cooper E. Valera S. Rungger D. Ballivet M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 4: 174-193Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Stage VI oocytes were injected intranuclearly with cDNA clones using a pressure microinjector (Eppendorf) and a Singer micromanipulator. Membrane currents were recorded in the voltage-clamp mode 1–4 days after injection using 2 microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl. The oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (0.1 ml) perfused continuously with oocyte Ringer's medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmKCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) at controlled room temperature (20–21 °C). During most experiments, the oocytes were held at −60 mV to reduce the possible contribution of endogenous Ca+2-activated Cl−currents. To construct dose-response relationships, oocytes were held at −60 mV, and the drugs were applied at 3-min intervals. Current-voltage relationships were determined using repetitive exposures to ACh at various potentials, stepping the holding potential from −60 mV to the desired voltage 5 to 10 s before transmitter application. Drugs were dissolved in oocyte Ringer's solution and applied by superfusing the oocyte at a flow rate of 12 ml/min. In particular, MLA was applied for 30 min before testing ACh responses (25Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Solution exchange was achieved by using electromagnetic valves (Type III, General Valve). Drugs and chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except MLA (Research Biochemicals International) and the MTS derivatives (Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada). The current records were digitized at 50–200 Hz using an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1200 Interface, Axon) and stored on a computer for subsequent analysis using pClamp 6.0.2 routines (Axon).

To determine the half-dissociation constant (EC50) of ACh, data were fitted using nonlinear fitting routines (included inSigma Plot, Jandel), to the Hill equation:I/Imax=[ACh]nH/([ACh]nH+EC50nH)Equation 1 where [ACh] is the transmitter concentration,n H is the Hill coefficient, andI max is the maximum response. To assess the functional behavior of nAChRs, we defined some parameters as listed below. Receptor sensitivity to the transmitter was estimated by calculating the ratio (in percentage) of current elicited by 0.2 μm ACh (I 0.2) to that elicited at 100 μm ACh (I 100), which concentrations, respectively, correspond to the EC50 and to the I max of L247Tα7 (12Palma E.

The time to half-decay (T 0.5) of the inward current activated by ACh (I ACh), defined as the time taken for the current to decay from peak to half-peak value and the time to 10% decay (T 0.1), were used to estimate the rate of receptor desensitization. The deviation of the I-V curve from linearity was estimated by the ratio of slope conductances at +30 mV and −60 mV. This rectification coefficient (n γ) (12Palma E. Eusebi F. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) ranges between 100% (i.e. linear I-V relationship) and 0% (i.e. full rectification). Single-channel currents were recorded from the animal pole of the oocytes using the patch-clamp technique in the cell-attached mode, as reported (26Methfessel C. Witzemann V. Takahashi T. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 27Palma E. Maggi L. Eusebi F. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9915-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the ACh concentrations used were in the range 3–5 μm. At these concentrations, the open-channel frequency was variable in the range 2–20 Hz. Recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon). The patch was discarded if no events were detected within 60 s after seal formation at 0 to 40 mV pipette potential or if opening frequency was below 0.5 Hz. Typically, a successful patch was stable for 5–15 min and had >200 opening transitions. No channel openings were observed in uninjected oocytes or in injected oocytes examined with a patch pipette filled with an ACh-free solution. Current recordings were filtered at 2 kHz, sampled at 10 kHz, and analyzed by pClamp 6.0.2 routines (Axon) using a threshold-crossing criterion. Events briefer than 0.2 ms were incompletely resolved and were excluded from the open-time histograms, which thus represent apparent open times. Histograms of amplitudes, apparent open times, and log (shut times) were fitted with a single Gaussian function or with the sum of exponentials as appropriate. Each histogram included from 500 to 2000 events. Burst duration was studied by grouping openings separated by a specific critical time, which was calculated for each patch from the fitted parameters of the shut-time distribution. For each patch, slope conductances were obtained by least squares linear fitting of current-voltage relationships constructed by polarizing the patch potential in the range −80 mV to 100 mV.

Oocytes that had been injected with WTα7 cDNA or with mixtures of WTα7 and β3 cDNAs were electrophysiologically tested with 2 mm ACh (28Williams B.M. Temburni M.K. Levey M.S. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Jacob M.H. Nature Neurosci. 1998; 1: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and assayed for plasma-membrane α-Bgt binding. To measure binding, control and injected oocytes were incubated singly for 2 h in 70 μl of oocyte Ringer's medium containing 20 nm [125I]α-Bgt (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation, the labeled medium was removed, and the oocytes were washed five times with Ringer's medium (250 μl each time) and counted individually on a Beckman gamma counter. Oocytes injected with the L247Tα7 subunit cDNA responded to ACh with an inward current whose peak amplitude depended on transmitter concentration. ACh at 100 μmelicited a current (I 100) with mean peak amplitude of −7.13 μA (18 oocytes, 3 donors [18/3]; range, −4.36 μA to −8.32 μA), whereas at 0.2 μm ACh the current (I 0.2) averaged −4.03 μA ([12/3]; range, −3.1 to −5.87 μA) (Fig. 1,A–B, left). The ratioI 0.2/I 100, used as a parameter of receptor sensitivity to ACh (27Palma E. Maggi L. Eusebi F. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amplitude of I AChincreased linearly with hyperpolarization and showed a slight rectification at positive potentials. The rectification coefficient (n γ) ranged from 53.9 to 88.0% (76.6 ± 2.9%; [12/2]), indicating that the I-V relationships inL247Tα7 was nearly linear (Fig.2 A) (18Palma E. Mileo A.M. Eusebi F.

The maximum 5HT-evoked current amplitude (I 5HT = −6.63 μA; range, −3.21 to −8.01 μA; [7/2]) was obtained at 500 μm.Figure 2Oocytes injected with a mixture ofL247Tα7 and β3 cDNAs exhibit fast desensitization and current rectification at positive potentials.

They strikingly differed from theL247Tα7 receptor in a number of physiological parameters. Oocytes injected with the cDNA mixture expressed reduced nAChR activity compared with oocytes injected with L247Tα7 cDNA alone, the amplitude of the elicited currents being significantly impaired (I 100 = −1.62 μA, [24/5], and −7.13 μA, [18/3], respectively). The expressed nAChRs displayed a reduced transmitter sensitivity (I 0.2/I 100 = 3.2 ± 0.4%; [11/3], Fig. 1 B, right) and a faster rate of desensitization (T 0.5 = 1.97 ± 0.21 s; T 0.1 = 0.48 ± 0.05 s; [21/5], Fig. 1, A–C, right) than the homomericL247Tα7 nAChR. This fast rate of current decay was maintained at −30 mV (T 0.1 range, 0.28–1.3 s, [6/2]), close to the chloride reversal potential, suggesting that this property is not because of a contribution of Ca2+-activated Cl currents. 5HT (500 μm) acted as a weak agonist, eliciting an inwardI 5HT whose amplitude was only 5% that of the ACh response at 100 μm (I 100 = −1.72 μA; I 5HT = 88 nA, [17/3], Fig.1 C, right). In addition, when maintained in the bathing fluid for 20–60 s at 500 μm, 5HT reduced theI 100 response to ACh by 95% (94.6 ± 2.5%, [13/3], data not shown). Furthermore, nAChRs displayed a nonlinear I-V relationship (n γ=19.8 ± 4.7%; range, 5–25%, [11/3]) (12Palma E. Eusebi F. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2, which compares typical I-V relationships in oocytes injected with mixed cDNAs (Fig. 2 B) or with L247Tα7 cDNA alone (Fig. 2 A). Finally, the ACh dose-response relationships constructed in 9 oocytes from 2 donors yielded EC50 and n H of 3.4 μm and 1, respectively, thus showing an affinity for the transmitter decidedly lower than that of the homomeric L247Tα7 receptors (Fig.3) (18Palma E. Mileo A.M. Eusebi F. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The EC50 andn H values were obtained by fitting data to a single Hill plot, with no significant improvement resulting from fitting data with a sum of multiple Hill equations, an indication that the pure homomeric L247Tα7 population was poorly expressed and obscured by the dominant expression of an heteromeric receptor population. The ACh responses in mixture-injected oocytes were sensitive to MLA, as is the case for oocytes injected with L247Tα7. For instance, the I0.2 peak amplitude decreased by 34% at 100 pm MLA in L247Tα7 oocytes and by 85% in mixture-injected oocytes. Furthermore, I ACh peak amplitude in mixture-injected oocytes decreased by 30% at 3 μm ACh and 100 pm MLA, equal to the block onL247Tα7 nAChR when activated near its EC50 by 0.2 μm ACh (Fig. 3). Taken together these data indicate that MLA acts on both putative heteromeric and homomeric nAChRs in a competitive manner. It is well established that the clamp-holding current is far greater for cells injected with L247Tα7 than withWTα7. This observation, together with the fact that MLA reduces the holding current, has been explained by the spontaneous, ACh-independent activation of the mutant α7 receptor (29Bertrand S. Devillers-Thiery A. Palma E. Buisson B. Edelstein S.J. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In our experiments, oocytes injected with the cDNA mixture showed a spontaneous, MLA-sensitive inward current (2.4 ± 1.3% of theI 100 peak amplitude, [5/2]), quite similar to that estimated in oocytes injected with L247Tα7 (4.5 ± 1.6%, [9/2]; not shown). To investigate whether the ratio of cDNAs in the mixture could influence the functional properties of the resulting nAChRs,L247Tα7 and β3 cDNAs were injected into oocytes at α7/β3 ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:6. No obvious differences in current decay, ACh sensitivity, or I-V relationships were observed. In contrast, the amplitude of the elicited I ACh was significantly impaired as the α7/β3 ratio was increased (not shown). To investigate if the co-expression of β3 could alter the L247Tα7 channel parameters, we performed single-channel recordings on mixture-injected oocytes (ratio 1:1). Because the coinjection of β3 and L247Tα7 reducesI ACh, single-channel recordings were only successful in the subset of oocytes that had a high level of expression. A population of single-channel openings was revealed in the cell-attached mode at 3–5 μm ACh in the pipette and 30 mV pipette potential (PP). Its mean open-time (τop) was 4.7 ± 1.0 ms [7/3] and was made up of a single exponential component. Values of τop remained stable with moderate hyperpolarizations. For instance, at 50 mV PP, τop was 4.2 ± 0.5 ms [7/3], statistically equivalent to the value at 30-mV PP. No obvious channel-flickering activity was observed in our recording conditions, indicating that the transmitter is unable to effect an open channel block at the concentrations used. This was evidenced by opening bursts whose mean duration was only slightly longer (6.3 ± 0.8 ms; [7/3]) than τop. Channel activity (≃16 Hz at 30-mV PP) and amplitude were rather stable over time at a given PP. As the patch was hyperpolarized, the amount of voltage required to change the opening frequency e-fold was 27 mV. Analyses of unitary events revealed a single class of channels with a slope conductance of 18.8 ± 1.4 pS (range, 14–23 pS; [8/3]). Fig. 4 provides an example (representative of seven patches) of ACh-activated unitary events in an oocyte expressing the L247α7β3 receptor. A number of experiments were performed in oocytes injected with a mixture of β3 andWTα7 cDNAs to determine whether these subunits can co-assemble into functional nAChRs. In agreement with the experiments using a mixture of β3 and L247Tα7 cDNAs, the amplitudes of the current responses to ACh were considerably reduced in oocytes injected with β3 andWTα7 cDNAs, as compared with those injected withWTα7 cDNA alone. For instance, at 100 μm ACh the average I ACh recorded in oocytes injected with WTα7 cDNA was −693.4 nA [24/3], and −45.4 nA [21/3] with a mixture of WTα7 and β3 at 1:1. Despite this strong inhibition, no differences in the functional properties of the expressed nAChRs were observed. Furthermore, when estimating receptor sensitivity to nicotine by the ratio (in percentage) of the currents elicited by this agent at 10 μm and at 100 μm (which approximate the half-maximum and maximum current amplitudes for WTα7) (30Galzi J.L Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we found no significant difference betweenWTα7/β3 and WTα7 oocytes [4/1]. Other experiments tested the functional and pharmacological properties ofWTα7/β3 nAChRs (Table I).

Here, the mechanism of this inhibition is investigated using in vitroassays on isolated organelles and liposomes. Tamoxifen inhibited ATP-dependent acidification in organelles from a variety of sources, including isolated microsomes from mammalian cells, vacuoles from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and inverted membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli. Tamoxifen increased the ATPase activity of the vacuolar proton ATPase but decreased the membrane potential (V m) generated by this proton pump, suggesting that tamoxifen may act by increasing proton permeability. In liposomes, tamoxifen increased the rate of pH dissipation. Studies comparing the effect of tamoxifen on pH gradients using different salt conditions and with other known ionophores suggest that tamoxifen affects transmembrane pH through two independent mechanisms. First, as a lipophilic weak base, it partitions into acidic vesicles, resulting in rapid neutralization. Second, it mediates coupled, electroneutral transport of proton or hydroxide with chloride. An understanding of the biochemical mechanism(s) for the effects of tamoxifen that are independent of the estrogen receptor could contribute to predicting side effects of tamoxifen and in designing screens to select for estrogen-receptor antagonists without these side effects.

Yet, despite its widespread use, its mechanisms of action remain obscure. Tamoxifen is a known estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an antagonist or partial agonist. But it has also been reported to have many pleiotropic effects both in vivo and in vitro that cannot be explained by an interaction with the estrogen receptor (4). For example, tamoxifen has been shown to enhance drug sensitivity of multidrug-resistant cells (5Chatterjee M. Harris A.L. Br. J.

For example, the effects of tamoxifen on osteoporosis (19Sundquist K. Lakkakorpi P. Wallmark B. Vaananen K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This work addresses the mechanism(s) by which tamoxifen inhibits ATP-dependent in vitro acidification of organelles isolated from tissue culture cells, whole tissue, vacuoles from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and inverted vesicles isolated from Escherichia coli. The studies on yeast vacuolar acidification demonstrate that tamoxifen decreased both ATP-generated pH gradients and V m but increased the ATPase activity of the vATPase. These results suggest that tamoxifen affects ion permeability of a variety of biological membranes through interaction with either membrane proteins or the lipid bilayer. The possibility that tamoxifen acts directly on the lipid bilayer was addressed with studies of pure lipid vesicles in which tamoxifen increased the rate of dissipation of the pH gradient. The data suggest that this occurs by two distinct mechanisms. First, tamoxifen is a lipophilic weak base with a neutral form that can readily flip-flop between membranes, and a basic form that is relatively impermeable. Thus, tamoxifen would accumulate in acidic vesicles, bind protons, and increase lumenal pH. Importantly, tamoxifen is over 1000-fold more potent in increasing lumenal pH than the soluble weak base ammonium chloride. This may be explained by the predominant partitioning of tamoxifen into the lipid phase, increasing the effective concentration. However, this mechanism can only be involved in dissipation of a pH gradient when the lumen is acidic. Second, tamoxifen can mediate coupled transport of proton or hydroxide with chloride based on the following observations: 1) it mediates electroneutral dissipation of pH gradients that is dependent on the presence of chloride or other halides; 2) it mediates an increased dissipation rate of chloride gradients; 3) it mediates net proton influx when the external chloride concentration is greater than the lumenal chloride concentration. Acidification is crucial for the proper functioning of many cellular processes, and its disruption may account for many of the pleiotropic effects described for tamoxifen. The results presented here show that at low micromolar concentrations, tamoxifen can inhibit acidification and dissipate pH gradients in a variety of in vitro systems, supporting in vivo data (18Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4432-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whereas this concentration is higher than required to modulate the estrogen receptor, it is similar to those reported for many estrogen receptor independent effects. Importantly, this concentration can readily be achieved in the clinic. The elucidation of a biochemical mechanism for this estrogen receptor independent activity of tamoxifen could significantly contribute to the design of modulators of the estrogen receptor that lack these side effects. Bafilomycin A1, monensin, acridine orange (AO), pyranine (8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid), tamoxifen, Tris-ATP, and nigericin were from Sigma. BODIPY®-transferrin, lucigenin, and p-xylene-bispyridinium bromide (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Adriamycin was from Calbiochem. Concanamycin A was from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). Palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and cholesterol were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to confluence in 10-level cell factories (Nunc, Naperville, IL), trypsinized, washed 3× with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer (pestle A) in 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 16 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride mixed to 100× before use). The homogenate was centrifuged twice for 10 min at 3000 ×g to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was layered over 20 ml of 0.5 m sucrose (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mix) and 1 ml of 2 m sucrose and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g (Beckman Ti60 Rotor). Microsomes are collected at the 0.5 and 2 minterface. To monitor acidification of the total microsomal fraction, the quenching of AO fluorescence was monitored essentially as described previously (23Barasch J. Kiss B. Prince A. Saiman L. Gruenert D. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1991; 352: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Acidic vesicles accumulate AO to high concentrations resulting in the self-quenching of the dye and a decrease of the overall fluorescence. Fluorescence was measured on an SLM Aminco-Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer with λex = 488 nm and λem = 530 nm. Microsomes (80 μg of protein) were suspended in 2.5 ml of vesicle buffer (125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmNaN3), with 6 μm AO (5 mm stock in H2O) in a cuvette. To examine the ability of vesicles to generate a ΔpH in the presence of tamoxifen or bafilomycin A1, 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 μm tamoxifen (10 mm stock in EtOH) or 10 nm bafilomycin A1 (10 mm stock in 10% Me2SO) was added. After equilibration for 30 min at 25 °C, 1 mmTris-ATP was added to begin acidification (100 mm stock, titrated to pH 7.4 with 1 m Tris base before use). Twenty minutes later, 2.5 μm nigericin (10 mm stock in EtOH) was added to dissipate any ΔpH formation. To study the effects of tamoxifen and bafilomycin A1 on vesicles with a pre-existing ΔpH tamoxifen or bafilomycin A1 were added 10 min after the addition of Tris-ATP. Acidification from the recycling endosomal fraction was monitored by first incubating cells with FITC-transferrin for 30 min before lysis and isolation of microsomes. Acidification was monitored by excitation of the FITC fluorophore at 450 and 488 nm and measuring λem = 520 nm as described previously (18Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4432-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Vacuoles from S.cerevisiae were prepared from the protease-deficient strainBJ2407 (Yeast Genetic Stock Center, University of California, Berkeley) by sequential flotation through 12 and 8% Ficoll 400 cushion as described previously (24Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with the single modification that 1× protease inhibitor mix and 1 mm DTT was included in each step. This procedure produced a 25-fold enrichment of the vacuolar marker α-mannosidase (data not shown). Acidification was measured using AO as described above. For acidification in chloride-free solution, gluconate or glutamate was used in vesicle buffer instead of chloride. InV were prepared from the DH5α strain as described (25Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Acidification was measured using AO as described above. Oxonol V is a membrane-permeable anionic fluorescent probe that accumulates into the inner leaflet of vesicles with positive V m, resulting in quenching of fluorescence. Vacuoles were suspended in chloride or gluconate vesicle buffer with 1 μm oxonol V. Fluorescence was measured with a λex = 600 nm and λem = 630 nm. After fluorescence had equilibrated, vacuoles were added, and the fluorescence was allowed to re-equilibrate. Then, 1 mm Tris-ATP was added, and the resulting positive V m was manifested in fluorescence quenching. Vacuoles were diluted in KCl or potassium gluconate vesicle buffer. Each sample was split into two, and either 5 μm tamoxifen or carrier was added. Each of the four resulting samples was again split into two, and either carrier or 100 nm bafilomycin A1 was added. Next, 2 mm Tris-ATP was added to each sample, and the vacuoles were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. To measure the phosphate concentration from ATP hydrolysis, an equal volume of Taussky-Shorr Reagent (1% w/v ammonium molybdate, 2.7% v/v sulfuric acid, and 5% w/v ferrous sulfate hexahydrate) was added, and the samples were developed for 15 min. The A 660 was measured (Spectronic Genesys 2) which is linearly related to phosphate concentration. The bafilomycin-inhibitable ATPase activity was taken as the difference between the ATPase activity of each condition with or without 100 nm bafilomycin A1. The lumenal pH (pHL) of liposomes was assayed with pyranine, a fluorescent dye with a pK a ∼7.3 and a λex = 405 nm in its acid form (−3 charge) and a λex = 455 nm in its basic form (−4 charge). To prepare pyranine-loaded liposomes, lipids (2 mg of POPC, 1 mg of cholesterol) supplied in chloroform suspension were dried in a round bottom flask under argon for 2 h. The lipids were then resuspended in acidic or alkaline liposome buffer (300 mm KCl, 20 mm MES, 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm Tricine titrated with KOH to either pH 6.2 or pH 8.1) containing 0.5 mm pyranine. The suspension was incubated at room temperature overnight and then freeze-thawed 6 times. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared by extrusion 3 times through two stacked 100-nm Nucleopore (Corning/Costar Scientific, Acton, MA) polycarbonate filters in an Avestin (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) extruder at 600 pounds/square inch. More than 95% of external pyranine was separated from the liposomes by sequentially running through NAP-10 and NAP-25 desalting columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Internal pyranine leakage was <1% per day, and liposomes were used within 1 week of preparation. The pyranine fluorescence was calibrated as a function of pH by diluting the liposomes with pH 6.2 into a weakly buffered solution of identical pH (300 mm KCl, 1 mm MES, 1 mm MOPS, 1 mm Tricine, pH 6.2), 1 μm nigericin to allow rapid equilibration with external pH, and 5 mm DPX to quench external pyranine. The ratio of the fluorescence emission at λem = 510 nm was monitored with dual excitation wavelengths of λex = 405 and λex = 455 nm. Sequential aliquots of 0.1 mmglycylglycine, pH 8.4, were added to increase pH (see Fig. 5). The fluorescence was measured after each addition, and the pH was measured using a pH meter. The logarithm of the fluorescence ratio was linearly dependent on the pH. The curve generated by a least squares fit between pH 6.2 and 7.9 resulted in χ2 >0.99. The calibration curve for the liposomes of lumenal pH 8.1 was generated identically except sequential aliquots of 0.1 mm K-MES, pH 5.0, were added for titration, and the curve was generated between pH 8.1 and pH 6.4. To measure the rate of pH dissipation of liposomes with lumenal pH 6.2, the liposomes were diluted in weakly buffered solution of identical pH as described above but with no nigericin. Various agents (tamoxifen, valinomycin, and FCCP) were included as described in the text. The external pH was shifted to pH 7.3 by addition of 5 mmglycylglycine, pH 8.4, and the fluorescence ratio was monitored. After 10 min, 1 μm nigericin was added to dissipate the remaining pH gradient. The pHL was calculated using the equation pH = x·log(λex = 405 nm/λex = 405 nm) + c, where x andc are constants from the least square fit of the titration curve. To measure the rate of pH dissipation of liposomes with pHL = 8.1, the identical procedure was followed except 5 mm K-MES, pH 5.0, was added to shift the external pH to 6.9. To assay the effect of addition of NH4Cl or tamoxifen on liposome pH, liposomes with pHL = 6.2 were diluted into identical buffer (300 mm KCl, 20 mm MES, 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm Tricine, pH 6.2) containing 5 mm DPX, and the fluorescence ratio was followed after addition of NH4Cl or tamoxifen. Lucigenin is a fluorescent dye that is collisionally quenched by chloride and other halides but not by nitrate (26Biwersi J. Tulk B. Verkman A.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Lipids dried as described above were rehydrated in 300 mm KNO3, 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.3, and 0.5 mm lucigenin. 100 nm unilamellar liposomes were made, and external dye was removed as described above. To calibrate the fluorescence of lucigenin as a function of chloride, the liposomes were diluted in buffer (300 mmKNO3, 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.3) with 1 μm tributyltin (TBT) a Cl−-OH−exchanger, and 1 μm nigericin, a K+-H+ exchanger. This results in rapid net dissipation of KCl gradient. Aliquots of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mm KCl were added, and lucigenin fluorescence (λex = 370 nm/λex = 505 nm) was recorded. The fluorescence was fitted to the Stern-Volmer equation:F 0/F = 1 + k[Cl], where F 0 is the fluorescence in the absence of chloride. To measure the chloride permeability, the fluorescence was followed in liposomes after the addition of 50 mm KCl. After 10 min, 1 μm TBT and 1 μm nigericin were added. The chloride concentration was calculated using the Stern-Volmer equation with kcalculated from the titration curve. The concentration of tamoxifen was measured by its absorbance peak at 245 nm. TheA 245 of 20 μm tamoxifen in phosphate-buffered saline, HCl, pH 1, or KOH, pH 13, solution was acquired. Then, 1 μl of octanol was added, the solution was vortexed, and the A 245 of the aqueous phase was acquired. The mechanism by which tamoxifen inhibited acidification of intracellular organelles was first addressed by testing whether tamoxifen acted directly on the organelles or indirectly through soluble modulators. Acidification of organelles was assayed in vitro using microsomes isolated from MCF-7/ADR cells that are free of detectable soluble cytosolic proteins. Acridine orange (AO) was used as a probe for lumenal acidification (23Barasch J. Kiss B. Prince A. Saiman L. Gruenert D. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1991; 352: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). As vesicles acidify, they accumulate AO to self-quenching concentrations and deplete the extravesicular free AO, resulting in a decrease in total fluorescence. Acidification was initiated by the addition of ATP to a purified microsomal fraction in the absence of cytosol (Fig. 1 A, att = 300 s). Over the subsequent 1200 s, there was a reduction of the AO fluorescence, suggesting an accumulation of AO within the lumen of the microsomes. Nigericin, a K+/H+ exchanger that rapidly dissipates pH gradients, was added at the end of each reaction (t = 1500 s). In all experiments the AO fluorescence returned to its pre-ATP levels. This indicates that the decreased fluorescence was the consequence of the generation of a pH gradient. When MCF-7/ADR vesicles were pretreated with tamoxifen for 30 min, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of AO quenching (Fig.1 A). Inhibition was evident when using 1 μmtamoxifen, and acidification was totally blocked with 8 μm tamoxifen. To quantify the effects of tamoxifen on acidification, we plotted acidification (as assayed by quenching of AO fluorescence) as a function of tamoxifen concentration (Fig. 1 A, inset). The ID50 for maximal quenching is approximately 3 μm, which is in the same range that tamoxifen inhibits acidification in vivo (18Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4432-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we employed bafilomycin A1, a potent and specific inhibitor of the vATPase responsible for acidification of all intracellular compartments (27Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). To determine the time course for the inhibition of acidification by tamoxifen, the drug was added 10 min after addition of ATP (Fig.1 B). Addition of tamoxifen rapidly reversed acidification and caused an almost complete dissipation of the pH gradient within 5 min. Addition of bafilomycin A1 dissipated the pH gradient at a much slower rate, even when used at 100 nm, which is 10 times the concentration that blocked 95% of acidification (see Fig.1 A). Addition of nigericin (Fig. 1 B) and monensin (data not shown) dissipated the pH gradient significantly faster than tamoxifen. Thus, the time course of alkalinization by tamoxifen is distinguishable from both rapidly acting electroneutral protonophores and inhibitors of the vATPase. The fact that the in vitro acidification assay used purified microsomes in the absence of cytosolic or nuclear components indicates that the effects of tamoxifen on pH should be independent of cytosolic factors, such as the estrogen receptor, and of both transcription and translation. In addition, tamoxifen had similar effects on in vitro acidification of microsomes isolated from liver and kidney tissue from mice (data not shown). Therefore, the effect of tamoxifen on organelle acidification appears to be a general phenomenon. To specifically examine the acidification of the endosomes in vitro, we assayed in vitro acidification using FITC-transferrin which is constrained by the transferrin receptor to the endocytic pathway. MCF-7/ADR cells were incubated with FITC-transferrin before lysis and isolation of microsomes. Since this assay is not based on the redistribution of probes, it further serves as verification that AO quenching resulted from vesicular acidification. Upon addition of ATP, there was a decrease in the ratio of the FITC emission (Fig.1 C). This signal was judged to be the consequence of acidification since it was reversed upon the addition of nigericin. The addition of 2.5 μm tamoxifen partially reversed the acidification in these organelles. This was further reduced by raising the tamoxifen concentration an additional 2.5 μm. This indicates that the recycling endosomes were one of the compartments in this in vitro assay whose acidification was blocked by tamoxifen. Acidification of intracellular organelles utilizes an electrogenic proton pump (the vATPase) and chloride channels (28Glickman J. Croen K. Kelly S. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vATPase couples ATP hydrolysis to proton movement. The unidirectional movement of the proton generates an inside positive V m which limits acidification. The chloride channels allow passive chloride influx into the organelles, dissipating the V m. Tamoxifen could inhibit acidification by the following possible mechanisms: direct inhibition of the vATPase; indirect inhibition of the vATPase through modulation of the V m (such as blocking a chloride conductance); inhibition of acidification by a weak base effect or dissipation of pH gradients as a protonophore. There exists evidence in support of each of these mechanisms. Tamoxifen has been reported to inhibit acid secretion by avian osteoclasts through inhibition of the plasma membrane vATPase activity. This activity has been attributed to the antagonism by tamoxifen of the membrane-bound calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which regulates the vATPase (30Williams J.P. McDonald J.M. McKenna M.A. Jordan S.E. Radding W. Blair H.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen has been reported to inhibit the volume-activated chloride channel (11Zhang J.J. Jacob T.J. Valverde M.A. Hardy S.P. Mintenig G.M. Sepulveda F.V.G.D. Hyde S.C. Trezise A.E. Higgins C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A weak base (such as ammonium chloride) will rapidly cross the membrane in a neutral (i.e. NH3) form and bind protons in the interior causing an alkaline shift. The charged form of these molecules will accumulate according to the Henderson-Hasselbach equilibrium. Tamoxifen is a weak base with a pK a of 6.9 when measured by NMR in 10% Triton solution (31Bottega R. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9025-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At a free tamoxifen concentration of 8 μm, a pH 7.3–5.3 gradient will result in <200 μm lumenal concentration. This is less than the buffering capacity of the organelles, and this should not significantly perturb lumenal pH. Thus, we initially considered this mechanism unlikely. Tamoxifen partitions into lipids, increases membrane fluidity, and decreases lipid peroxidation (32Wiseman H. Quinn P. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). If the charged protonated form of tamoxifen were membrane-permeable, tamoxifen would act like a classic protonophore. This mechanism has been proposed for the ability of many amine local anesthetics to uncouple respiration (33Garlid K.D. Nakashima R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7974-7980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sun X. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19147-19154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these potential mechanisms has distinct consequences for ATPase activity and V m of the acidic organelle (TableI). If tamoxifen inhibits the vATPase, it would decrease the ATPase activity. In addition, it should decreaseV m of the organelles since the proton pumping is generating the V m. If tamoxifen inhibits the chloride channel, it would increase V m, since the chloride channel serves to dissipate V m. As a consequence of the increased V m, the vATPase cannot pump protons, resulting in a decreased rate of ATP hydrolysis. If tamoxifen is a protonophore, it should decrease V mby allowing protons to permeate and increase ATPase activity by decreasing the electrochemical gradient against which the vATPase must pump. A weak base should slightly increase V m and ATPase activity since it dissipates the proton gradient in favor of an electrical gradient.Table IPredicted effects of potential mechanisms of tamoxifen on Vm and ATPase activityV mATPase activityInhibit H-ATPaseDecreaseDecreaseBlock counter-ion transportIncreaseDecreaseIncrease proton permeabilityDecreaseIncreaseWeak base effectSame to slight increaseSlight increase Open table in a new tab The predictions of these mechanisms were tested on isolated vacuoles from S. cerevisiae.

Now, we have investigated the importance of adjacent surface-exposed helix 330–338 (162–170 in chymotrypsin numbering) of IXa in its interaction with VIIIa. IXWT, eight point mutants mostly based on hemophilia B patients, and a replacement mutant (IXhelixVIIin which helix 330–338 is replaced by that of factor VII) were expressed, purified, and characterized. Each mutant was activated normally by VIIa-tissue factor-Ca2+ or XIa-Ca2+. However, in both the presence and absence of phospholipid, interaction of each activated mutant with VIIIa was impaired. The role of IXa EGF1 domain in binding to VIIIa was also examined. Two mutants (IXQ50P and IXPCEGF1, in which EGF1 domain is replaced by that of protein C) were used. Strikingly, interactions of the activated EGF1 mutants with VIIIa were impaired only in the presence of phospholipid. We conclude that helix 330 in IXa provides a critical binding site for VIIIa and that the EGF1 domain in this context primarily serves to correctly position the protease domain above the phospholipid surface for optimal interaction with VIIIa.

A common cause of abnormal bleeding is either the deficiency of factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent protein, and during physiologic clotting it is activated to a two-chain, disulfide-linked IXa molecule by VIIa/Ca2+/tissue factor (TF) 1The abbreviations used are: TF, tissue factor; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IIa, α-thrombin; PL, phospholipid; S-2222, benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide; DEGR-ck, dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone; BSA, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin; DEGR-IXa, IXa inactivated with DEGR-ck; WT, wild type; NP, normal plasma; APC, activated protein C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl.1The abbreviations used are: TF, tissue factor; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IIa, α-thrombin; PL, phospholipid; S-2222, benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide; DEGR-ck, dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone; BSA, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin; DEGR-IXa, IXa inactivated with DEGR-ck; WT, wild type; NP, normal plasma; APC, activated protein C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl.and by XIa/Ca2+ (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 10363-10370Crossref Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The domain organization of factor IXa is similar to those of the other two enzymes (factors VIIa and Xa) involved in the TF-induced coagulation and to that of an anticoagulant enzyme termed activated protein C (APC) (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 10363-10370Crossref Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The light chain of IXa consists of an amino-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain (residues 1–40 out of which 12 are Gla residues), a short hydrophobic segment (residues 41–46), and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (EGF1 residues 47–85 and EGF2 residues 86–127), whereas the heavy chain contains the carboxyl-terminal serine protease domain with trypsin-like specificity (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 10363-10370Crossref Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 2Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Activation peptide of residues 145–180, which is released upon conversion of factor IX to IXa, is rich in carbohydrate and is the least conserved region in IX from different species (3Sarkar G. Koeberl D.D. Sommer S.S. Genomics. 1990; 6: 133-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Factor IXa hence formed converts factor X to Xa in the coagulation cascade; for a biologically significant rate, this reaction requires Ca2+, phospholipid (PL), and factor VIIIa (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 10363-10370Crossref Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Thus, to this extent essential to physiologic hemostasis is the interaction of Ca2+-bound factor IXa (activated hemophilia B protein) with factor VIIIa (activated hemophilia A protein) on the PL surface provided by the platelets. Based upon the crystal structure of the Gla domain of factor VIIa (4Banner D.W. D'Arey A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22037-22045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it would appear that this domain in IXa possesses several low to intermediate affinity Ca2+-binding sites. In addition, the EGF1 and the protease domain each possess one high affinity Ca2+-binding site (6Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D.

Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further, Ca2+binding to the EGF1 domain has been reported to promote enzyme activity and factor VIIIa binding (10Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees D.J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The role of EGF2 domain is not clear but may be involved in binding to platelets and in factor X activation (11Ahmed S.S. Rawala R. Cheung W.F. Stafford D.W. Walsh P.N. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, the protease domain is thought to play a primary role in binding to factor VIIIa (12Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J.

Recently, we have shown that mutations in the protease domain Ca2+-binding ligands decrease the affinity of factor IXa for factor VIIIa by ∼15-fold and that proteolysis at Arg-318–Ser-319 (150–151) 2For comparison, factor IX amino acid numbering system has been used.

Since residues in the protease domain Ca2+-binding loop as well as those in the autolysis loop may not directly participate in binding to factor VIIIa (2Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 17Hamaguchi N. Bajaj S.P. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that Ca2+ binding to the protease domain and integrity of the autolysis loop stabilize yet another region in this domain of factor IXa that directly interacts with factor VIIIa (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based upon this, we opted to examine the role of IXa helix 330–338 (162–170), which is adjacent to the autolysis loop in its interaction with VIIIa. All known sequences from different species in this surface-exposed helix of IXa are identical (15Bajaj S.P. Birktoft J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 96-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and point mutations in eight of the nine residues in this region cause hemophilia B (18Giannelli F. Green P.M.

Herein, we provide extensive data which indicate that this helix (residues 330–338) in IXa constitutes a critical binding site for VIIIa and that the reduced biologic activity of helix 330 (162) mutants in hemophilia B patients stems from their substantially reduced affinity for factor VIIIa. We also present data which indicate that a role of the EGF1 domain in this context is to correctly position the protease domain above the PL surface for optimal interaction of factor IXa with factor VIIIa.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15523-15530Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recombinant human factor VIIa was a generous gift of Novo-Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). Purified human factor VIII was obtained from Dr. Leon Hoyer (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). The preparation was free of all other coagulation factors and contained human albumin as a stabilizing agent. Purification of a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the interaction of factor IXa with factor VIIIa has been described (12Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor IX and factor IXa activities were measured in a one-stage assay with automated activated partial thromboplastin time reagent as described (24Spitzer S.G. Kuppuswamy M.N. Saini R. Kasper C.K. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Blood. 1990; 151: 1530-1537Crossref Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed using the Laemmli buffer system (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar). The acrylamide concentration was 12%, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. Gla and amino acid sequence analysis were performed by Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc., Richmond, VA. Automated Edman degradation of each factor IX protein (∼0.5 nmol) was performed using an Applied Biosystems gas phase sequencer. Gla analysis of each sample was performed by alkaline hydrolysis followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The amount of Gla was quantitated based upon the 46 residues of Asp and Asn present per mole of factor IX (26Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) was used for expression of wild-type and each mutant factor IX. In each caseHindIII and XbaI sites in the multiple cloning sites of the vector were used for ligation of the DNA. Construction of the wild-type factor IX (IXWT) and that of IXPCEGF1, in which residues 52–85 in the EGF1 domain of IXWT have been replaced by the residues 51–92 from the corresponding domain of protein C, have been described (27Zhong D. Bajaj S.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 874-878PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations in helix 330 (162) of protease domain of factor IX were introduced using the fragment elongation method of Nelson and Long (28Nelson R. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), as described previously for IXQ50P (9Zhong D. Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In each case the mutant primer was based upon factor IX gene sequence (26Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and corresponded to six codons (18 bases) with a mutant base at the desired position involving the third codon. The base substitution for each point mutant was: L330I (CTT → ATT), V331A (GTT → GCT), D332Y (GAC → TAC), R333L (CGA → CTA), R333Q (CGA → CAA), T335A (ACA → GCA), L337I (CTT → ATT), and R338Q (CGA → CAA). Factor IXhelix VII, in which 330–338 (162–170) residues of factor IX were replaced by the corresponding residues of factor VII, was constructed using a 63-base primer. The first 18 bases of this primer corresponded to factor IX gene sequence coding for residues 324–329 (156–161), followed by 27 bases from the factor VII gene sequence (29O'Hara P.J. Grant F.J. Haldeman B.A. Gray C.L. Insley M.Y. Hagen F.S. Murray M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5158-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) coding for residues (162–170), and the final 18 bases corresponded to the factor IX gene sequence coding for residues 339–344 (171–177). The PCR was performed in the same fashion as described previously for point mutants (9Zhong D. Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Nelson R. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All inserts were sequenced (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52242) Google Scholar) to confirm the mutations and to rule out any PCR errors. Expression of each factor IX recombinant protein and its purification was achieved exactly as described (9Zhong D. Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A modeled structure of human factor IXa was obtained using a homology model building approach described previously (15Bajaj S.P. Birktoft J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 96-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The starting template used was the structure of porcine factor IXa (Ref. 2Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1PFX). Inasmuch as the model structure of human factor IXa, for all purposes as it relates to this paper, was the same as porcine factor IXa and the residues involved at the mutational sites are identical between the two proteins (15Bajaj S.P. Birktoft J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 96-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we have used the x-ray structure of porcine factor IXa for analysis of our data. The model of IXaPCEGFI protein was constructed by replacing the EGFI domain of factor IXa with that of APC (Ref. 31Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar; code 1AUT) and is described elsewhere (32Bajaj S.P. Thromb. Haemostas. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). IXNP, IXWT, and each mutant factor IX at 200 μg/ml was activated by factor XIa (2 μg/ml) for 90 min. The buffer used was TBS, pH 7.4 (0.05 m Tris, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4), containing 5 mmCa2+. SDS-gel electrophoretic analysis revealed full activation to factor IXaβ without further degradation. DEGR-IXaNP, DEGR-IXaWT, and various DEGR-IXa mutant proteins were prepared as described previously (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and free DEGR-ck was removed as described previously (22Sabharwal A.K. Birktoft J.J. Gorka J. Wildgoose P. Petersen L.C. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15523-15530Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23696-23706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DEGR-APC was prepared similarly. Activation of factor VIII was performed as outlined previously (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 28 nm(40 units/ml) of factor VIII was incubated with 0.2 nm IIa in TBS/BSA, pH 7.4 (TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA), containing 5 mm CaCl2. In initial experiments, we established that the maximal increase (∼10-fold) in procoagulant activity occurred at 2 min, after which it steadily declined (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, at 2 min we routinely added recombinant hirudin (2.2 nm, final concentration) to inhibit IIa and the preparation was used immediately. Factor VIIIa potentiation of factor X activation by IXaNP, IXaWT, and each activated mutant was measured both in the presence and absence of PL. The buffer used was TBS/BSA, pH 7.4, and the reaction volume in each case was 50 μl. The activation was carried out at 37 °C for different time periods, at which point each reaction mixture received 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA to stop further generation of factor Xa. A 40-μl aliquot was then added to a 0.1-ml quartz cuvette containing S-2222 in 75 μl of TBS/BSA, pH 7.4. The final concentration of S-2222 was 100 μm. Thep-nitroaniline release was measured continuously (ΔA 405/min) for up to 20 min (5Sabharwal A.K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mathur A. Gorka J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22037-22045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Sabharwal A.K. Birktoft J.J. Gorka J. Wildgoose P. Petersen L.C. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15523-15530Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Factor Xa generated was calculated from a standard curve constructed using factor Xa prepared by insolubilized Russell's viper venom. Factor X activation measurements were made under four sets of different conditions. 1) Ca2+ and PL were present. In this system, activation was carried out for 5–15 min and the concentration of each IXa protein was 20 nm, PL was 25 μm, and factor X was 100 nm. 2) Ca2+, PL, and factor VIIIa were present. In this system, activation was carried out for 15–120 s and the concentration of each IXa protein was 0.5 nm, PL was 10 μm, VIIIa was 0.07 nm, and factor X was 15 nm. 3) Only Ca2+ was present. In this system, activation was carried out for 2–20 min, and concentration of each IXa protein was 400 nm and factor X was 1 μm. 4) Ca2+and VIIIa were present. In this system, activation was carried out for 15–120 s and the concentration of each IXa protein was 2 μm, VIIIa was 14 nm, and factor X was 400 nm. In all of the above factor X activation experiments, the incubation times chosen are those in which factor Xa generated was always less than 10 nm. This precautionary measure was taken to prevent activation of factor X by the generated factor Xa (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Link R.P. Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 215: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Further, in those incubation mixtures that contained factor VIIIa, we also performed control experiments in which factor VIIIa was omitted. The rates of factor X activation in these control experiments were <10% of the experimental values in the presence of factor VIIIa and were subtracted prior to analysis of the data. For reactions done in the presence of Ca2+ and PL, optimal concentrations of PL were determined. Rates of factor X activation versus PL showed a bell-shaped curve with a broad optima between 20 and 40 μm PL. 3A. Mathur, D. Zhong, and S. P. Bajaj, unpublished data. The rate increased linearly from 0–20 μm, and after 40 μm it showed a gradual decrease. Therefore, PL concentration in the absence of factor VIIIa was fixed at 25 μm. In the presence of factor VIIIa, 10 μmPL was used based upon previous observations (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of factor X selected for each set of reaction conditions are those which are below or at the K m values (35van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).3 In this region of the Michaelis-Menten curve, the rate of formation of factor Xa is proportional to the substrate factor X and therefore to the affinity of the factor IXa enzyme for factor X. Apparent Kd values of factor VIIIa binding to various active site-blocked factor IXa proteins were determined from inhibition experiments as detailed previously (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (50 μl) in the presence of PL contained 0.2 nm factor IXaWT, 0.48 μm factor X, 0.07 nm factor VIIIa, 5 mm Ca2+, 10 μm PL, and varying concentrations of DEGR-IXa proteins. Reaction mixtures in the absence of PL contained 0.1 μm factor IXaWT, 2 μm factor X, 14 nm factor VIIIa, 5 mm Ca2+, and varying concentrations of DEGR-IXa proteins. Reactions were carried out for 2 min, and the rates of factor X activation were measured as outlined above. In these experimental conditions, both in the presence and absence of PL, factor IXaWT concentrations are below the EC50 values at the factor X concentrations used. Further, in each case <10% of factor IXa is bound to factor VIIIa in the absence of the competitor and no measurable rates of activation of factor X were observed under these conditions in the absence of added factor VIIIa. For obtaining IC50 values (concentration of DEGR-IXa yielding 50% inhibition), the data were fitted to the IC50 four-parameter logistic equation of Halfman (37Halfman C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 74: 481-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) given below.y=a1+(x/IC50)s+backgroundEquation 1 y is the rate of Xa formation in the presence of a given concentration of DEGR-IXa protein represented by x,a is the maximum rate of Xa formation in the absence of DEGR-IXa, and s is the slope factor. Each point was weighted equally, and the data were fitted to Equation 1 using the nonlinear regression analysis program obtained from Erithacus Software (GraFit). The values of the slope factors were 0.9 ± 0.1 in all experiments, indicating competition for a single binding site. The background value represented <5% of the maximum rate of Xa formation in the absence of DEGR-IXa. To obtain theK d(app) values for the interaction of DEGR-IXa proteins with factor VIIIa, we used the following equation as described by Cheng and Prusoff (38Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12129) Google Scholar) and further discussed by Craig (39Craig D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 6: 68-71Google Scholar).Kd(app)=IC501+(A/EC50)Equation 2 A is the concentration of IXaWT, and EC50 is the concentration of factor IXaWT that gives a 50% maximum response in the absence of the competitor at a specified concentration of factor X used in the experiment. SDS- electrophoretic analysis of factor IX proteins using the Laemmli system (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig.1 A. Each protein is effectively homogenous in this system. Further, plasma factor IX and each recombinant protein had 11.5–12.5 Gla residues/mol. The NH2-terminal sequence of each protein was also determined. All recombinant proteins revealed a major and a minor sequence. The major sequence in each case was Tyr-Asn-Ser-Gly-Lys, and the minor sequence in each case was Thr-Val-Phe. The major sequence corresponds to the sequence of mature protein in plasma, and the minor sequence corresponds to the protein in which the prosequence has not been cleaved (26Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The minor sequence was not detected in plasma factor IX, and it amounted to less than 5% in each recombinant protein. The relative coagulant activity of each protein was: IXNP, 100% (180 ± 10 units/mg); IXWT, ∼90%; IXL330I, ∼8%; IXV331A, ∼6%; IXD332Y, ∼2%; IXR333L, ∼0.3%; IXR333Q, ∼0.5%; IXT335A, ∼40%; IXL337I, ∼1%; IXR338Q, ∼65%; and IXhelixVII, not measurable. The ability of the IX mutant proteins to bind to a mAb (12Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which interferes with the interaction of IXa and VIIIa, was studied using a coagulant based assay as described previously (40Usharani P. Warn-Cramer B.J. Kasper C.K. Bajaj S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For mutants that possessed ≤8% coagulant activity, a competition-based assay in which the mutant protein competed with the normal IX in binding to the mAb was used (40Usharani P. Warn-Cramer B.J. Kasper C.K. Bajaj S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each mutant protein bound to the mAb with an equal affinity (K d ∼15 ± 8 nm). The rates of activation of each protease domain mutant performed under conditions described previously (16Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1985082264,"We report here an interaction between the C terminus of the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) and a protein that has recently been identified as cortactin-binding protein 1 (CortBP1). Interaction is mediated by the PDZ (PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain of CortBP1. As shown by <i>in situ</i>hybridization, SSTR2 and cortactin-binding protein are coexpressed in the rat brain. The association between SSTR2 and the PDZ-domain of CortBP1 was verified by overlay assays and by coprecipitation after transfection in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Analysis by confocal microscopy indicates that CortBP1 is distributed diffusely throughout the cytosol in transfected cells and that it becomes concentrated at the plasma membrane when SSTR2 is present. This process is largely increased when the receptor is stimulated by somatostatin; as CortBP1 interacts with the C terminus of SSTR2, our data suggest that the binding of agonist to the receptor increase the accessibility of the receptor C terminus to the PDZ domain of CortBP1. Our data for the first time establish a link between a G-protein coupled receptor and constituents of the cytoskeleton."

Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) is comprised of three similar repeats approximately 90 residues each (3Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Dano K.

Limongi P. Crippa M.P. Conese M. Hernandez-Marrero L. Fazioli F. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The u-PAR plays an important role in many physiological and pathological functions including wound healing, tissue remodeling, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (5Romer J. Lund L.R. Eriksen J. Pyke C. Kristensen P. Dano K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Sillaber C. Baghestanian M. Hofbauer R. Virgolini I. Bankl H.C. Fureder W. Agis H.

The ability of the u-PAR to promote these biological effects is a consequence of its diverse function. First, urokinase bound to the u-PAR activates plasminogen much more efficiently than the fluid-phase plasminogen activator (9Ellis V. Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby facilitating basement membrane degradation. Second, u-PAR clears urokinase-inhibitor complexes from the extracellular space via an α2-macroglobulin receptor-dependent endocytotic mechanism (10Cubellis M. Wun T. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 11Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the u-PAR interacts with the extracellular domain of integrins allowing association with the cytoskeleton, thereby mediating cell adhesion and migration (12Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V.

Fourth, the u-PAR is chemotactic for human monocytes and mast cells, and this may contribute to inflammatory and tissue remodeling processes, which are also often observed in tumor infiltrated areas (6Sillaber C.

The spread of a cancer to distant sites is characterized by extensive tissue remodeling in which surrounding normal tissue and extracellular matrix are proteolytically degraded. Several lines of evidence have implicated the u-PAR in this process. Thus, the overexpression of a human u-PAR cDNA increases the invasion of human osteosarcoma cells through an extracellular matrix-coated porous filter (16Kariko K. Kuo A. Boyd D. Okada S. Cines D. Barnathan E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3109-3117PubMed Google Scholar), whereas down-regulating u-PAR levels using either antisense expression constructs, oligonucleotides, or synthetic compounds reduces the ability of divergent invasive cancers to invade in vitro andin vivo (17Kook Y.H. Adamski J. Zelent A. Ossowski L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Wilhelm O. Weilde U. Rettenberger S. Schmitt M. Graeff H.

Finally, clinical studies on colon and gastric cancers have revealed a correlation between high u-PAR expression and short survival times (20Ganesh S. Sier C.F.M. Heerding M.M. Griffioen G.

The level of surface-u-PAR is controlled mainly via the regulation of transcription of the seven-exon u-PAR gene located on chromosome 19q13 (22Vagnarelli P. Raimondi E. Mazzieri R. De Carli L. Migantti P. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 60: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Casey J.R. Petranka J.G. Kottra J. Fleenor D.E. Rosse W.F.

Regarding transcriptional regulation, Soravia et al. (27Soravia E. Grebe A. De Luca P. Helin K. Suh T.T. Degen J.L. Blasi F. Blood. 1995; 86: 624-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the basal expression of the gene was regulated via Sp1-binding motifs located proximal (−110/−24) to the transcriptional start site. Our laboratory showed that both the constitutive and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-inducible expression of the gene required a footprinted region (−190/−171) of the promoter containing an AP-1 motif (28Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A second region of the promoter (−152/−135) bound with an AP-2α-related protein was also demonstrated to be required for the constitutive u-PAR gene expression and moreover for u-PAR mediated extracellular matrix degradation (29Allgayer H. Wang H. Wang Y. Heiss M.M. Bauer R. Nyormoi O. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4702-4714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since the u-PAR is a key protein in promoting tissue remodeling, it is of essential importance to identify molecules regulating its expression. One possible candidate is the c-src gene, which encodes the pp60c-src protein-tyrosine kinase, since (a) its specific activity is higher in distant metastases as compared with the primary colonic tumors (30Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and (b) this protein-tyrosine kinase stimulates in vitro invasion of rat colonic cells (31Pories S.E. Hess D.T. Swenson K. Lotz M. Moussa R. Steele G. Shibata D. Rieger-Christ K.M. Summerhayes C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conducted the present study with the following objectives: 1) to determine whether a constitutively active Src regulates u-PAR gene expression, and 2) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs. Our data show, for the first time, that the urokinase-receptor gene is transcriptionally regulated by this protein-tyrosine kinase and that this induction requires an upstream sequence (−152/−135) bound with Sp1. The u-PAR CAT reporter consists of 449 base pairs of sequence stretching from −398 to +51 (relative to the transcription start site) cloned into theXbaI site of the pCAT-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The u-PAR-firefly luciferase reporter was generated by cloning the aforementioned sequence into the SmaI site of pGL3 (Promega). The R2 CAT reporter construct, consisting of an oligonucleotide spanning nucleotides −154/−128 of the u-PAR promoter, was as described previously (29Allgayer H. Wang H. Wang Y. Heiss M.M. Bauer R. Nyormoi O. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4702-4714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The urokinase CAT reporter included 2345 base pairs of 5′-flanking region of the urokinase promoter fused directly to the reporter. The c-srcY527F construct contained thec-src coding sequence (32Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) harboring a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at codon 527 and cloned into theHindIII/BamHI cloning site of pcDNA3. The β-actin-renilla-luciferase reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Menashe Bar-Eli (Department of Cancer Biology, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The v-mos expression construct was as described elsewhere (33Lengyel E. Singh B. Gum R. Nerlov C. Sabichi A. Birrer M. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2639-2648PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Oligonucleotides were supplied by Genosys Biotechnologies, The Woodlands, TX. SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable constitutively active Src-expressing SW480 clones were generated by transfecting SW480 cells with c-srcY527F using LipofectAMINE (34Ellis L.M. Staley C.A. Liu W. Fleming R.Y.D. Parikh N.U.

G418-resistant clones were generated and propagated in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. Nuclear extracts and EMSA were carried out as described elsewhere (28Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out as described (28Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E.

These were as described by us previously (35Wang H. Skibber J. Juarez J. Boyd D. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclei from approximately 6 × 107cells (SW480, 1D8, and 2C8) were isolated and incubated in the presence of [α-32P]UTP in transcription buffer (150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Nuclei were then treated with DNase I and proteinase K, and the RNA extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated. Radioactive RNA (6.6 × 107 cpm) was hybridized to nylon-immobilized u-PAR cDNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, and the linearized empty vector for the u-PAR cDNA (pBC12B1) as a control. Cells were transfected at 60% confluence using poly-l-ornithine as described previously (36Nead M.A. McCance D.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 668-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed as described by us previously (28Lengyel E. Wang H. Stepp E. Juarez J. Doe W. Pfarr C.M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23176-23184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Where indicated, transient transfections were performed in the presence of an RSV-driven luciferase expression vector (4 μg) for the determination of transfection efficiencies. The amount of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was determined using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. Luciferase assays for determining the effect of c-srcY527F on the β-actin promoter were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System by Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western blotting was performed as described previously (29Allgayer H. Wang H. Wang Y. Heiss M.M. Bauer R. Nyormoi O. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4702-4714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Gum R. Juarez J. Allgayer H. Mazar A. Wang Y. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted into a Triton X-100-containing buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the cell extract immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-u-PAR antibody. The immunoprecipitated material was subjected to standard Western blotting and the blot probed with 5 μg/ml of an anti-u-PAR monoclonal antibody (3931; American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the determination of u-PAR by ELISA, resected tissue was prepared and assayed as described by the manufacturer (American Diagnostica). These were carried out as described previously (38Schlechte W. Murano G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6064-6069PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested with 3 mmEDTA/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed twice, and seeded (500,000 cells) on radioactive laminin-coated (2 μg/dish) dishes. The cells were allowed to attach overnight. Subsequently, cell surface u-PAR were saturated by incubating the cells at 37 °C for 30 min with 5 nm urokinase and unbound plasminogen activator removed by washing. The cells were then replenished with serum-free medium with, or without, 10 μg/ml plasminogen (final concentration). After varying times at 37 °C, aliquots of the culture medium were withdrawn and counted for radioactivity. Solubilized laminin represents the degraded glycoprotein (38Schlechte W. Murano G. Boyd D.D. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6064-6069PubMed Google Scholar). A urokinase receptor binding antagonist (Å5) was developed based on the sequence of amino acids 20–30 of its ligand (urokinase). This peptide was synthesized and cyclized using a covalent linker, as described previously (39.Jones, T. R., Haney, D. N., and Varga, J. (1998) PCT Publication WO 98/21230.Google Scholar). Å5 was tested for its ability to inhibit the binding of 125I-DFP-urokinase to RKO cells. Cells (2 × 104/well) were seeded in a 48-well plate and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. The cells were chilled to 4 °C, washed three times with cold PBS, and Å5 (diluted in PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin) added to the wells at various concentrations (0.1–1000 nm).125I-DFP-urokinase (0.5 nm final concentration) was then added to each well. Unlabeled DFP-urokinase was used as a positive control to calibrate the assay. The plate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and the cells washed extensively, after which they were lysed using 1 m NaOH and radioactivity in each lysate counted using a γ counter. These experiments indicated the IC50 of Å5 to be approximately 11 nm. These assays were performed as described elsewhere (34Ellis L.M. Staley C.A. Liu W. Fleming R.Y.D. Parikh N.U. Bucana C.D. Gallick G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1052-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 250–500 μl of standard radioimmune precipitation buffer, and tumor and mucosal tissues were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY). Lysates were additionally homogenized using an 18-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g. 250 μg of protein was reacted with monoclonal antibody 327 (Oncogene Science Inc., Cambridge, MA) for 1 h for immunoprecipitation of Src. Immune complexes were formed using 6 μg of rabbit-anti-mouse IgG (Oreganon Teknika, Durham, NC) for 1 h, followed by 50 μl of formalin-fixed Pansorbin (Staphylococcus aureus, Cowan strain; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 30 min. Pellets were washed three times in 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm sodium phosphate. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm Mg2+, 10 μg of rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) as an exogenous substrate, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate in 20 mm HEPES. After 10 min, reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Products were separated in an 8% polyacrylamide gel and exposed to an x-ray film overnight. The amount of Src protein was determined by immunoblotting. Aliquots (50 μg of protein) of cell lysate were resolved in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. After blocking, the filter was incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with 1 μg/lane of mAb 327 (Oncogene Science Inc., Cambridge, MA) and washed subsequently. Then, the filter was incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG and reactive bands visualized with chemiluminescence (see “Determination of u-PAR Protein Amounts”). Statistical comparison of ELISA and CAT results was done using a two-sided Student's t test (SPSS for Windows statistical software, release 6.1.3, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The correlation between u-PAR amounts and specific or relative Src activity in tumor and colonic mucosa tissues was determined by linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was defined at p< 0.05. Since both Src activity (30Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and u-PAR mRNA/protein (20Ganesh S. Sier C.F.M. Heerding M.M. Griffioen G. Lamers C.B.H. Verspaget H.W. Lancet. 1994; 344: 401-402Abstract PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 35Wang H. Skibber J. Juarez J. Boyd D. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) amounts are elevated in invasive colon cancers, we hypothesized that this protein-tyrosine kinase could regulate the expression of this receptor. To test this hypothesis, we first transiently co-transfected SW480 cells with a CAT reporter driven by 398 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence of the u-PAR promoter and increasing amounts of an expression construct encoding a constitutively active Src (c-srcY527F) (Fig.1 A). A significant induction of promoter activity was observed with 0.1–10 μg of c-srcY527F, whereas the empty expression construct (pcDNA3) had minimal effect on reporter activity. To exclude the possibility that the effect of the constitutively active Src on u-PAR promoter activity was due to a general induction of transcriptional activity, we performed a control experiment comparing the effect of c-srcY527F transfection on a luciferase reporter regulated by either the u-PAR or β-actin promoter (Fig. 1 B). β-Actin is a principal component of microfilaments and abundantly expressed in non-muscle cells. In contrast to a strong dose-dependent induction of u-PAR promoter activity, the activity of the β-actin promoter was unchanged by the expression of the c-srcY527F construct. Thus, it is unlikely that the increased u-PAR promoter activity brought about by thesrc expression construct is due to a general effect on transcription. The dose dependence of the src expression construct on u-PAR promoter activity was more evident using the luciferase reporter compared with the CAT reporter. This is probably a consequence of substrate depletion of the radioactive chloramphenicol in the latter assays. To rule out the possibility that the induction of u-PAR expression by the constitutively active Src was due to the introduction of a transforming gene, we performed an experiment in which the u-PAR promoter CAT reporter was co-transfected into SW480 cells with a v-mos expression construct (33Lengyel E. Singh B. Gum R. Nerlov C. Sabichi A. Birrer M. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2639-2648PubMed Google Scholar). A CAT reporter driven by the urokinase promoter, which previously has been shown to be activated by this construct, served as a positive control (Fig.2). In contrast to the urokinase reporter, which was activated up to 4-fold, no effect of this non-membrane protein kinase on u-PAR promoter activity was observed. Thus, we consider it unlikely that the induction of u-PAR promoter activity in SW480 cells is a mere effect of expressing a transforming gene. We then asked whether the stable expression of the constitutively active Src induced endogenous u-PAR gene expression. Toward this end, we compared the amount of u-PAR protein in SW480 cells, characterized by its very low Src-activity, with two derived clones (1D8, 2C8) stably expressing an exogenous constitutively active Src (Fig.3 A). The growth rates of the untransfected and Src-transfected cells were indistinguishable. Analysis of cell extracts by ELISA indicated that the 2C8 clone expressing the highest level of Src activity (Fig. 3 A) had 8-fold more u-PAR protein (32 ± 5 ng of u-PAR protein/mg of cellular protein) compared with the parental SW480 cells (4 ± 1 ng of u-PAR protein/mg of cellular protein) (Fig. 3 B). The 1D8 clone, characterized by its intermediate Src activity, had an intermediate amount of u-PAR protein (10 ± 2 ng of u-PAR protein/mg of cellular protein). The ELISA data measuring u-PAR protein were corroborated by Western blotting (Fig. 3 C) in which the highest and lowest amount of u-PAR protein was evident in the 2C8 clone and the non-transfected SW480 cells, respectively. The diffuse nature of the immunoreactive bands is probably due to the heavily glycosylated state of the u-PAR protein (40Behrendt N. Ronne E. Ploug M. Luber D. Nielsen L. Schleuning W. Blasi F. Appella E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6453-6460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the increased u-PAR protein was due to a higher transcription rate, we performed nuclear run-on experiments comparing parental SW480 cells and SW480 cells stably expressing either neo (SW480 neo) or the constitutively active Src (1D8 and 2C8) (Fig.3 D). Hybridization of radioactive mRNA from isolated nuclei to a nylon filter-immobilized u-PAR cDNA yielded a signal with 2C8 cells, which was dramatically higher than that achieved with SW480 cells transfected with nothing (SW480) or the neo gene (SW480 neo). Thus, u-PAR gene transcription is induced by an activated Src. One of the functions of u-PAR is to accelerate plasminogen-dependent proteolysis via receptor-bound urokinase. Accordingly, we used laminin degradation as a biological end point to measure the effect of the src transfection on the display of the urokinase binding site. Toward this end, we performed laminin degradation assays comparing the activity of SW480, 1D8, and 2C8 cells. SW480 and 2C8 cells in serum-free medium (▪, ▴) demonstrated minimal solubilization of laminin in the absence of the zymogen, plasminogen (Fig. 4). After addition of plasminogen, SW480 cells showed a moderate degradation of laminin (50,000 cpm/106 cells) in the culture supernatant after 240-min incubation (×). However, addition of plasminogen to thesrc transfectants resulted in a much stronger increase in laminin solubilization indicating plasmin-dependent proteolysis. In this respect, the 2C8 clone, characterized by the highest Src activity, showed the highest amount of solubilized laminin in the supernatant (> 200,000 cpm/106 cells after 240 min; ●) with the 1D8 clone being intermediate (130,000 cpm/106cells; ■). These data suggested that the stable transfection of a low u-PAR-expressing colon cancer cell line with a plasmid encoding a constitutively active Src results in transcriptional activation of the u-PAR gene, the latter in proportion to the amount of Src activity detected in the individual clones. The results presented so far suggested that the expression of the u-PAR gene is transcriptionally induced by expressing a constitutively active Src cDNA in SW480 colon cancer cells. As a corollary to these experiments, we asked whether the inhibition of Src activity in the SW480 cells stably expressing the constitutively active Src would result in a decrease in u-PAR protein amounts, promoter activity, and laminin degradation. 2C8 cells (the SW480 transfected clone showing the highest Src activity) were treated with varying amounts of PD173955 (41Barvian M.R. Klutchko S. Hamby J.M. Kraker A.J. Moore C. Hartl B.G. Lu G.H. Panek R.L. Fry D.W. Doherty A.M. Showalter H.D.H. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 176Google Scholar), which specifically targets Src family members, and assayed for u-PAR protein by ELISA. Increasing amounts of the PD173955 led to a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of the urokinase receptor (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, an identical concentration range of the Src inhibitor repressed u-PAR promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). We did not observe changes in growth rate or morphological signs of cell toxicity using this concentration r"

Chem. 1997; 272: 17061-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It can occur in two different oligomeric states, a monomeric and trimeric form (4Hladik J. Sofrova D. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 29: 171-175PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Rögner M. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 40: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The molecular organization of trimeric PS I from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus was recently solved by x-ray analysis down to 4 Å resolution (6Schubert W. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The location of the primary electron donor P700, the primary electron acceptor Ao (chlorophyll a), and the secondary acceptors A1 (phylloquionone), FX, and FA/FB was determined. Furthermore, the location of 83 antenna chlorophyll molecules (Chl) out of about 90 was resolved in that study. Although the PS I complexes of green plants and cyanobacteria carry out the same function and show a similar organization, there are several differences between them. First, they differ in their subunit composition with PsaG and PsaH being present in higher plants and green algae and absent in cyanobacteria (2Chitnis P. Xu Q. Chitnis V. Nechushtai R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Second, higher plants contain an additional membrane-integral light-harvesting complex, which increases the number of PS I antenna Chls to about 200 in comparison with about 100 in cyanobacteria. Third, higher plants contain only monomeric PS I, whereas PS I complexes of cyanobacteria are organized as monomers and trimers (5Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Rögner M. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 40: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Tsiotis G. Haase W. Engel A. Michel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Shubin V.V.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 283-286Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It could be shown that PsaL is responsible for this specific trimerization of cyanobacterial PS I (11Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and that the ratio between trimers and monomers within the detergent-free cyanobacterial thylakoid membrane can be regulated through the ionic strength of the medium (5Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Rögner M. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 40: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Karapetyan N.V. Dorra D. Schweizer G. Bezsmertnaya I.N. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13830-13837Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Presumably, electrostatic interactions between the complexes are altered, causing the transformation of trimers into monomers at high salt and the reverse reaction at low salt conditions. The reason for the existence of PS I trimers in cyanobacteria is not yet clear. In general, cyanobacteria contain relative high amounts of the so called “red” Chls that show absorption at a longer wavelength than the reaction center P700 itself. The amount of red Chls in PS I varies from species to species. Synechocystis PCC 6803, for example, contains two Chls absorbing at 708 nm/monomeric complex (13Gobets B. van Amerongen H. Monshouwer R. Kruip J. Rögner M. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 75-85Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas PS I from S. elongatus contains more red Chls, which absorb at 708 (4–6 molecules) and 719 nm (4–6 molecules) (14Pallsson L. Dekker J. Schlodder E. Monshouwer R. van Grondelle R. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 48: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PS I trimers and monomers from Spirulina platensis differ in the composition of red Chls; although monomers and trimers have a similar set of Chl forms (12Karapetyan N.V. Dorra D. Schweizer G. Bezsmertnaya I.N. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13830-13837Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), only the trimers contain an extreme red shifted Chl, which absorbs at 735 nm (Chl 735). This Chl gives rise to a 760 nm fluorescence emission peak (F760) at 77 K. Under the same conditions, the monomer of S. platensis,which is similar to all other cyanobaceria, shows only emission peaks at 725–730 nm. Moreover, the intensity of the 760-nm emission band, which is visible only under reducing conditions, reflects directly the redox state of P700 (9Shubin V.V. Tsuprun V.L. Bezsmertnaya I.N. Karapetyan N.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Karapetyan N.V. Dorra D. Schweizer G. Bezsmertnaya I.N. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13830-13837Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The general role of these red Chls in photosynthesis is still completely unknown. It was suggested that the red Chls funnel light energy to P700 (14Pallsson L. Dekker J. Schlodder E. Monshouwer R. van Grondelle R. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 48: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Gillbro T. Sundstrom V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 1-65Crossref Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 16Shubin V. Bezsmertnaya I. Karapetyan N. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1995; 30: 153-160Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), increase the cross-section of light absorption (17Trissl H.-W. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 247-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), or are involved in radiationless dissipation of excess energy into heat, thereby protecting PS I against photodestruction (18Mukerji I. Sauer K. Briggs W. Progress in Photosynthesis. 8. Alan L. Liss, New York1989: 105-122Google Scholar). One of the approaches to investigate the mechanisms of trimer formation is the establishment of an in vitro reconstitution procedure. As n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM)-solubilized monomers do not trimerize and DM-solubilized trimers do not dissociate into monomers (19Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that for such an oligomerization to occur the existence of a lipid bilayer is necessary. Up to now several studies have reported the incorporation of PS I into liposomes for functional analysis. However, no study dealt with membrane protein oligomerization, although this is an important feature in the course of PS I biogenesis and possibly also in light adaptation processes of cyanobacteria. Here we report the liposome-based reconstitution of PS I trimers starting from isolated monomers of S. platensis. The reconstituted trimers show the same 760-nm emission band as PS I trimers in vivo indicating the functional intactness of these trimers. In addition, the appearance of the long wavelength emission band in proteoliposomes confirms the suggestion that the responsible Chls are present also in monomers and are located at the monomer periphery yielding a profound change in fluorescence upon trimerization. We also will show that the trimerization depends on the presence of the stroma-exposed subunits PsaC, -D, and -E. The implications for the trimerization, the possible role of trimers, and the origin of red Chls are discussed. Cells of S. platensis were grown in Zarouk medium (20Shubin V.V. Murthy S.D.S. Karapetyan N.V. Mohanty P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 28-36Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C until use. Trimeric and monomeric PS I complexes were isolated according to Ref. 3Kruip J. Chitnis P.R. Lagoutte B. Rögner M. Boekema E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17061-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar with major improvements. Briefly, cells were disrupted with a RibiCell Fractionator (Sorvall), cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (200,000 × g, 2 h, 4 °C). To remove phycobilins, membranes were washed two times by centrifugation (200,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). Membrane proteins were solubilized by the addition of solid DM (final concentration 1%). Remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (200,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). Pure, homogeneous PS I could be isolated by two rapid perfusion chromatography steps. An ion exchange chromatography (IEC) on Poros 50 HQ (PerSeptive Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany) was performed followed by a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) on Poros Butyl (PerSeptive Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany). For HPLC, a Waters system (2 pumps, model 510, fitted with preparative pump heads, pump control module, Rheodyne Injektor, model 9125) coupled to a Waters diode array detector (DAD 996) and operated under the Millenium software package was used. HPLC columns were kept at 10 °C in an oven compartment (Beckman Instruments). Solubilized membrane proteins were filtered (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and immediately loaded on a IEC column (Poros 50 HQ, bed volume 17.3 ml). Elution was done by a linear NaCl gradient (flow rate, 6.7 ml/min; 10-300 mm NaCl within 10 min). The fractions containing either monomeric or trimeric PS I were pooled and adjusted to 1.6 m ammoniumsufate. Final purification was achieved on an HIC column (Poros Butyl, bed volume 18.7 ml) using a linear gradient for elution (flow rate, 6.7 ml/min; 1.5-0 mammonium sulfate within 10 min). Upon concentration to 1 mg of Chl/ml (Centriprep 100, Millipore, Germany) and buffer exchange (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, EconoPac 10DG, Bio-Rad) monomeric or trimeric PS I was stored at −70 °C until use. Purified monomeric or trimeric PS I (200 μg of Chl/ml) was incubated for 30 min in 6.8 murea (20 mm CAPS, pH 10) similar to Ref. 21Golbeck J.H. Parrett K.G. Mehari T. Jones K.L. Brand J.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 268-272Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar. Excess urea and detached subunits were removed by repeated ultrafiltration (Microcon 100, Millipore, Germany). SDS-PAGE was done according to Schaegger and von Jagow (22Schaegger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Germany) was as described by Matsudaira (23Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by immunodetection using a secondary phosphatase-coupled antibody as in Ref. 24Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Boonstra A.F. Rögner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23353-23360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Primary antibodies against PsaL were kindly provided by Dr. P. Chitnis (Iowa State University). Chlorophyll concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 74,000 m−1 cm−1 at 679 nm. Proteoliposomes were prepared according to methods described in Refs. 25Gourovskaya K.N. Mamedov M.D. Vassiliev I.R. Golbeck J.H. Semenov A.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 26Cladera J. Rigaud J.-L. Bottin H. Dunach M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar with some modifications. Soybean phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid (molar ratio 9:1) were dispersed in Tris-buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl) to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. The mixture was sonicated (Transonic 460, Faust, Germany) for 3 min until the solution was optically clear. The resulting liposomes were completely dissolved by the addition of n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (3% (w/v)). PS I complexes were added to the solubilized liposomes at different Chl:lipid ratios ranging from 20 to 100 (w/w). After incubation of the mixture for 5 min at room temperature the detergent was removed by direct addition of SM-2 Bio-beads in three steps. 80 mg of wet beads/ml were added to the assay; after 1 h another 80 mg of wet beads/ml were added followed by a final 160 mg of beads/ml after an additional hour. The suspension containing proteoliposomes was pipetted off and stored at 4 °C. 77 K fluorescence emission spectra of cells, PS I complexes, and proteoliposomes were measured with an Aminco Bowman Luminescence spectrometer (SLM-Aminco Spectronic Instruments). Chlorophylls were excited at 440 nm, and emission was measured perpendicular to the exciting beam. The raw fluorescence spectra were corrected for the wavelength sensitivity of the detection system. Measurements were done at a Chl concentration of 1 μg/ml for cells and 6 μg/ml for isolated PS I. Before fluorescence measurements a sample preparation of trimeric PS I involved dilution in Tris buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 10.6), reduction by dithionite (20 mm), and after a short incubation the addition of glycerol (final concentration 60% (v/v)). The sample was transferred to a quartz tube (4 mm, inner diameter) and slowly frozen under illumination to reduce P700 and the acceptor side of PS I (12Karapetyan N.V. Dorra D. Schweizer G. Bezsmertnaya I.N. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13830-13837Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because incubation of PS I monomers with dithionite had no effect on the fluorescence spectra, PS I monomers were frozen in the dark without a dithionite addition. Proteoliposomes were centrifugated (10,000 rpm, 4 min) and resuspended in Tris buffer (200 mm, pH 10.6) to a Chl concentration of about 5 μg/ml. After the addition of dithionite and glycerol, proteoliposomes were frozen under illumination. To follow the effect of high salt treatment on PS I complexes in proteoliposomes, they were incubated with 150 mm MgSO4 or 300 mm NaCl for 5 min at room temperature and then dithionite and glycerol were added, and the samples were frozen under illumination. Proteoliposomes were solubilized for 10 min with 1% DM (w/v). The remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min), and the soluble fraction was applied on an analytical IEC column (Poros 50HQ, bed volume 1.8 ml). A linear NaCl gradient (10-300 mm; flow rate, 3.5 ml/min) was used for elution. The peak assignment as PS I monomers or trimers was based on size exclusion chromatography on a TSK-4000SWXL column. n-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside was purchased from Biomol (Germany). SM-2 Bio-beads were from Bio-Rad; soybean phosphatidylcholine (Type III-S) and phosphatidic acid were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased mostly from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany). Fig. 1 shows the purification of monomeric and trimeric PS I from the filamentous cyanobacterium S. platensis. The purification procedure was based on perfusion chromatography, which enables easy scaling up and works at extremely high flow rates without loss of resolution. We already published a purification procedure for PS I from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803, which included an IEC perfusion chromatography step (27Kruip J. Bald D. Hankamer B. Nield J. Boonstra A.F. Barber J. Boekema E.J. Rögner M. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. 3. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 405-408Google Scholar). In this report we further succeeded in speeding up the purification protocol by replacing the second HPLC step with a perfusion chromatography. This enables us to purify large amounts (over 20 mg of protein) of pure and homogeneous monomeric and trimeric PS I from the filamentous cyanobacteriumS. platensis within 2 days. Fig. 1 shows the elution profiles of the different columns used for purification. The first IEC column yields two peaks (Fig. 1 A), which represent a monomeric (first peak) and a trimeric (second peak) form of PS I. Monomeric PS I elutes at around 100 mm NaCl; trimeric PS I elutes at around 180 mm. With a second purification step, consisting of a HIC column, extremely pure and homogeneous monomeric (at around 900 mm ammonium sulfate, Fig. 1 B) or trimeric (at around 650 mm ammonium sulfate, Fig.1 C) PS I could be obtained. As the monomeric PS I after IEC is already quite pure, only traces of impurities like PS II are removed by the second perfusion step (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the trimeric fraction after IEC still contains some residual monomeric PS I as well as higher aggregates that are separated by HIC (Fig.1 C). The purity and identity of the trimeric and monomeric preparations were confirmed by HPLC size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). Fig. 2 A shows typical SDS-PAGE profiles of trimeric (left) and monomeric (right) PS I preparations. All of the major PS I subunits are present in both monomeric and trimeric PS I from S. platensis. The reaction center subunits PsaA and -B are evident at the top of the gel, whereas other major subunits were assigned by immunodetection as (fromtop to bottom): PsaD, -F, -L, -E, and -C. Differences in staining intensities of subunits E, F, and C are within variations of various preparations and not representative of monomers or trimers. Subunit C shows routinely a diffuse, weak staining band. Smaller subunits are also visible but were not assigned in this report. Of special interest is the PsaL subunit, which is required for trimer formation. By using immunodetection it can clearly be seen that this subunit is present in roughly equal amounts in monomers and trimers (Fig. 2 B). SDS-PAGE analysis of trimeric preparations sometimes shows a band around 30 kDa, which, according to immunodetection, must be attributed to PsaL. In these preparations the normal band for PsaL, just beneath PsaF, is reduced in staining intensity. Fig. 3 A shows the 77 K steady state fluorescence emission spectra of purified monomeric and trimeric PS I upon excitation at 440 nm. The spectrum of monomeric PS I contains only one emission peak at about 730 nm (Fig. 3) and no PS II typical emission around 695 nm, indicating the high purity and homogeneity of the sample. The trimeric PS I sample also shows an emission band around 730 nm, but the spectrum is dominated by the strong emission at 760 nm. This band is characteristic for trimers and completely absent in monomers. In addition, both particles show almost no emission at 680 nm, indicating the absence of uncoupled Chl. This was also confirmed by comparison of fluorescence emission spectra upon excitation of Chls at 440 nm or carotenoids at 500 nm, because energy absorbed by carotenoids migrates only to coupled Chls (data not shown). Whole Spirulina cells frozen under illumination in the presence of dithionite show a high fluorescence emission band around 760 nm at 77 K similar to the emission spectrum of isolated trimeric PS I (Fig. 3 A). This indicates that around 90% of PS I in intact cells grown at moderate light intensities is present as trimers (Fig. 3 B), confirming earlier reports about a (mainly) trimeric in vivo organization of PS I in cyanobacterial cells (5Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Rögner M. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 40: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Shubin V.V. Tsuprun V.L. Bezsmertnaya I.N. Karapetyan N.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The emission spectrum of cells without dithionite (dashed line) shows that some PS I trimers in dark incubated cells contain P700, which has already been reduced by internal reductants. Fluorescence peaks at 685 and 695 nm, indicative of PS II, appear more prominent in the dashed curve as this one has been normalized with the maximum peak of the full line curve and not with the 730 nm peak. For a detailed study of the factors controlling the reversible process of PS I trimerization, it is necessary to develop an in vitro system. We therefore tried to reconstitute PS I trimers from monomers in an artificial lipid membrane, i.e. in proteoliposomes. Based on the work of Rigaud et al. (28Rigaud J.-L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), we developed a procedure to incorporate PS I in large liposomes. In principle, the protein of interest is added to completely solubilized lipids, and proteoliposomes are generated by selective removal of excess detergent using Bio-beads. Among different detergents tested for solubilization of lipids, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside turned out to be the most effective one (data not shown). After incorporation of pure monomeric or trimeric PS I, proteoliposomes were characterized by fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K. Fig. 4 A shows fluorescence emission spectra of proteoliposomes after reconstitution with monomeric PS I. An additional emission band around 760 nm can be seen, which indicates the formation of PS I trimers out of monomers within the proteoliposomes. According to the F760:F730 ratio for purified (Fig. 3) and for reconstituted (Fig. 4 A) trimers, up to 40% of the monomers were oligomerized into trimers. If trimeric PS I is incorporated into liposomes, the 760 nm emission is still the predominant peak in the spectrum, but emission at 730 nm has increased (Fig. 4 B). This indicates the desintegration of some trimers into monomers. Both emission spectra show an additional peak at about 680 nm, which could be attributed to uncoupled Chl. This Chl uncoupling is caused by the high concentration of n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside used during the reconstitution procedure (data not shown). To confirm the formation of stable structural trimers, the proteoliposomes were extracted with DM. The extract was analyzed immediately by IEC perfusion chromatography (Fig.5). The purity of the starting material was checked (Fig. 5 A). Both the monomeric and the trimeric PS I preparations are homogeneous without any trace of other oligomeric forms. In addition it was shown that the preparations are stable and that the oligomeric nature is not altered by time or by salt treatments for 5 days (data not shown). A HPLC analysis of proteoliposomes prepared from monomers (Fig. 5 B) shows a monomer peak and a smaller trimer peak in addition to uncoupled Chl. This confirms the conclusion that PS I trimers have been reconstituted from monomers. In the case of trimers (Fig. 5 C), HPLC analysis of proteoliposomes also shows three peaks: uncoupled Chl, monomeric PS I, and trimeric PS I (main peak), confirming the spectroscopic finding that some trimers dissociate into monomers within the proteoliposomes. To investigate the effect of different lipid:protein ratios on the reconstitution process, two different ratios have been tested. The trimer:monomer ratio in the proteoliposomes was monitored by noninvasive fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig.6) and is reflected by the ratio of the fluorescence bands at 760 and 730 nm. In proteoliposomes prepared from monomers this ratio was 1.6-fold higher when the protein content in the reconstitution mixture was increased by a factor of five (Fig.6 A). In conclusion, the amount of trimers formed depends on the protein concentration. A higher protein concentration increases the amount of trimers. If proteoliposomes were prepared from trimers, a 5-fold increase in the protein concentration had no effect on the ratio of the emission bands at 730 and 760 nm, indicating that the dissociation of trimers is independent of the protein concentration at least within the concentration range tested. The monomer:trimer ratio can be shifted in isolated thylakoid membranes by simple salt incubation as published before (12Karapetyan N.V. Dorra D. Schweizer G. Bezsmertnaya I.N. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13830-13837Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,24Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Boonstra A.F. Rögner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23353-23360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this is possible with the reconstituted complexes, we incubated the proteoliposomes with different salt concentrations and determined the monomer:trimer ratio directly by measuring the fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 7). Proteoliposomes made from monomers show a distinct decrease of the 760 nm peak upon a shift from 10 to 150 mm MgSO4(Fig. 7 A). Conversely, an increase of the fluorescence emission intensity at 730 nm relative to the decreasing intensity at 760 nm can be seen in proteoliposomes prepared from trimers upon increasing the salt concentration from 10 to 150 mm (Fig.7 B). The reduction of the 760 nm emission peak and the increase of the 730 nm emission peak indicate the salt-induced dissociation of trimers. Other salts like the monovalent NaCl (up to 300 mm) induced a similar behavior of the photosystems (data not shown). To determine the decisive factors for the trimerization, we first investigated the role of the stromal subunits PsaC, -D, and -E. A central r"
https://openalex.org/W2056581302,"Recent work has indicated that sigma receptor ligands can modulate potassium channels. However, the only sigma receptor characterized at the molecular level has a novel structure unlike any other receptor known to modulate ion channels. This 26-kDa protein has a hydropathy profile suggestive of a single membrane-spanning domain, with no apparent regions capable of G-protein activation or protein phosphorylation. In the present study patch clamp techniques and photoaffinity labeling were used in DMS-114 cells (a tumor cell line known to express sigma receptors) to investigate the role of the 26-kDa protein in ion channel modulation and probe the mechanism of signal transduction. The sigma receptor ligandsN-allylnormetazocine (SKF10047), ditolylguanidine, and (±)-2-(N-phenylethyl-N-propyl)-amino-5-hydroxytetralin all inhibited voltage-activated potassium current (I K). Iodoazidococaine (IAC), a high affinity sigma receptor photoprobe, produced a similar inhibition inI K, and when cell homogenates were illuminated in the presence of IAC, a protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa was covalently labeled. Photolabeling of this protein by IAC was inhibited by SKF10047 with half-maximal effect at 7 μm. SKF10047 also inhibited I K with a similar EC50 (14 μm). Thus, physiological responses to sigma receptor ligands are mediated by a protein with the same molecular weight as the cloned sigma receptor. This indicates that ion channel modulation is indeed mediated by this novel protein. Physiological responses were the same when cells were perfused internally with either guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) or GTP, indicating that signal transduction is independent of G-proteins. These results demonstrate that ion channels can be modulated by a receptor that does not have seven membrane-spanning domains and does not employ G-proteins. Sigma receptors thus modulate ion channels by a novel transduction mechanism. Recent work has indicated that sigma receptor ligands can modulate potassium channels.

Physiological responses were the same when cells were perfused internally with either guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) or GTP, indicating that signal transduction is independent of G-proteins. These results demonstrate that ion channels can be modulated by a receptor that does not have seven membrane-spanning domains and does not employ G-proteins. Sigma receptors thus modulate ion channels by a novel transduction mechanism. Sigma receptors are widely distributed in neuronal and nonneuronal tissue and are distinguished by their ability to bind a broad range of chemically unrelated ligands, including (+)-opiates, neuroleptic drugs, ditolylguanidine (DTG), 1The abbreviations used are: DTG, ditolylguanidine; I K, voltage-activated potassium current; IAC, iodoazidococaine; G-protein, guanine-nucleotide binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PPHT, (±)-2-(N-phenylethyl-N-propyl)-amino-5-hydroxytetralin; GDPβS, 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate).and phencyclidine-related compounds (1Su T.-P.

Ther. 1998; 286: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar) and the neurohypophysis (5Wilke R.A. Lupardus P.J. Grandy D.K. Rubinstein M. Low M.J. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 391-406Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed that sigma receptor ligands inhibit voltage-activated potassium current (I K), but the signal transduction pathways associated with sigma receptor activation remain unknown. Molecular characterization of sigma receptors has raised intriguing questions about how these receptors generate cellular responses. The high affinity sigma receptor photoprobe iodoazidococaine (IAC) has labeled a 26-kDa protein in rat liver, rat brain, and human placenta (6Kahoun J.R. Ruoho A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cloning studies have confirmed that both human and rodent sigma receptor cDNAs encode a 25.3-kDa protein (7Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The protein encoded for by these cDNAs binds sigma receptor ligands, but physiological responses of expressed sigma receptors have yet to be demonstrated. The amino acid sequence deduced from these clones is not easily reconciled with a physiological function of ion channel modulation. The vast majority of receptors that couple to separate ion channel proteins contain seven putative membrane-spanning segments and require G-proteins for signal transduction (11Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Evidence both for (1Su T.-P. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 187-203PubMed Google Scholar, 4Soriani O. Vaudry H. Mei Y.A. Roman F. Cazin L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar) and against (12Morio Y. Tanimoto H. Yakushiji T. Morimoto Y. Brain Res. 1994; 637: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) a role for G-proteins in sigma receptor responses has been presented, but hydropathy analysis of the deduced sigma receptor sequence indicated that this protein contains a single putative membrane-spanning domain, with no regions known to interact with G-proteins. In fact, the proteins encoded for by sigma receptor cDNAs are novel. There are no vertebrate homologues, and the only known proteins with significant homology are fungal sterol isomerases. Furthermore, the sigma receptor contains an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence. Thus, the structure of the sigma receptor raises the question of whether it is found on the plasma membrane and whether it is physically capable of modulating ion channels. A number of clonal cell lines contain sigma receptors (13Wu X.-Z. Bell J.A. Spivak C.E. London E.D. Su T.-P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kahoun J.R. Ruoho A.E.

One of these, DMS-114, is derived from human small cell lung carcinoma and has been shown to release neurohypophysial peptides (17Pettingill O.S. Sorenson G.D. Wurster-Hill D.H. Curphy T.J. Noll W.W. Cate C.C. Maurer L.H. Cancer. 1980; 45: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Sorenson G.D. Pettingill O.S. Binck-Johnson T. Cate C.C. Maurer L.H. Cancer. 1981; 47: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because our own work on sigma receptors began in the neurohypophysis (5Wilke R.A. Lupardus P.J. Grandy D.K. Rubinstein M. Low M.J. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 391-406Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we became interested in using DMS-114 cells to investigate molecular aspects of sigma receptor function in greater detail. We found that DMS-114 cells are amenable to both photolabeling and patch clamp recording. This enabled us to test the hypothesis that the 26-kDa protein is involved in the modulation of I K by sigma receptor ligands. Further experiments showed that G-proteins do not mediate this response. Thus, this novel receptor protein employs a signal transduction mechanism not yet encountered in the ligand-induced modulation of ion channels. DMS-114 cells were obtained from the ATCC, Manassas, VA and maintained in Waymouth Medium 752/1 (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) with 10% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Flasks were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air and subcultured regularly by mechanical dissociation. [125I]IAC was prepared according to Kahoun and Ruoho (6Kahoun J.R. Ruoho A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For photolabeling, DMS-114 cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation (200 × g) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) diluted 10-fold in distilled water. (PBS had the following composition: 140 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3.) Recombinant DNase (1 IU) was then added, and cells were homogenized with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was resuspended in PBS and divided into 100-μl aliquots. Sigma receptor ligands such as SKF10047 were then added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice. [125I]IAC (1 nm) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 7.5 min, at which point illumination was then performed for 5 s with a high pressure AH-mercury lamp. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide) and scanned for [125I]IAC photolabeling on a PhosphorImager. Permanent autoradiograms were developed on x-ray film for all experiments included in this study. DMS-114 cells were plated on coverslips for voltage clamp recording. 2 h prior to recording, coverslips were transferred from the CO2/air incubator to a superfusion chamber containing physiological salt solution (115 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 1.25 mmNaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Individual cells were visualized with an upright differential interference contrast microscope (Diastar, Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo, NY) and a × 40 water immersion, long working distance objective. Voltage clamp recordings were made with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (InstruTECH Corp., Port Washington, NY) interfaced to a MacIntosh computer. Whole-cell currents were recorded using patch pipettes filled with 130 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 4 mm MgATP, 100 μm NaGTP, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Pipettes were fabricated from thin walled borosilicate glass, and the pipette shanks were coated with Sylgard to reduce electrode capacitance (19Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). Prior to approaching the cell membrane, pipette resistances typically ranged from 4 to 8 megaohms. Immediately after breaking in, cell capacitance and series resistance were determined with the transient cancellation capability of the EPC-9. In cases where the series resistance exceeded 15 megaohms, this value was partially compensated electronically. Sigma receptor ligands (other than IAC) were obtained from Research Biochemicals, International (Natick, MA). These compounds were dissolved in physiological buffer and added to the bathing solution by direct pipette injection or through the use of a simple gravity-feed system (rate, ∼2 ml/min). Prior to the addition of drugs, I K was recorded at 15-s intervals for 1–3 min to obtain a stable base line. I K was also recorded after the removal of any drug(s) to demonstrate viability of the cell and recovery of current to base line. In experiments conducted using highly lipophilic drugs such as (±)-2-(N-phenylethyl-N-propyl)-amino-5-hydroxytetralin (PPHT), the agent was first dissolved in Me2SO and then diluted into physiological saline to obtain the desired final drug concentration. The concentration of Me2SO never exceeded 0.1%; this vehicle, without drug(s), was tested previously and found to have no effect on I K (20Wilke R.A. Hsu S.-F. Jackson M.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). Current recordings were analyzed on a MacIntosh computer with the computer program Pulse + PulseFit (InstruTECH Corp.). This program was used to fit current decays to exponential functions. The computer program Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA) was used on a personal computer to fit concentration-response data to the following function:E = (100 − E max)/(1 +C/EC50) + E max, whereE denotes I K expressed as a percent of predrug control, C denotes the concentration of ligand in the superfusion medium, E max denotes response at saturating ligand, and EC50 denotes the concentration of drug producing a half-maximal effect (defined by the condition (E − 50)/E max = ½). Conductance-voltage plots were fitted to the following Boltzmann function: G=Gmin+(Gmax−Gmin)(1+e(V−V12)/k) (21Bielefeldt K. Rotter J.L. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 458: 41-67Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All four parameters, G min,G max, k, and V12 were varied to achieve the best fit. G min andG max represent conductance asymptotes at negative and positive prepulse potentials, respectively, kis the steepness factor, and V12 is the midpoint for voltage dependence. Simple statistical analyses were performed using the program Microsoft Excel. When arithmetic means were computed, they were presented with the S.E. All null hypotheses were subjected to a Student's t test, and a level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. DMS-114 cells displayed an outward current in response to depolarizing test pulses under voltage clamp (Fig.1). Voltage steps from −80 to 10 mV rapidly activated this current, which showed a slight exponential decline as the potential was held constant for 500 ms. Tail currents reversed direction at the K+ equilibrium potential, and this value shifted appropriately with changes in external K+ concentration, indicating that the outward current was carried by K+ (n = 3, data not shown). When DMS-114 cells were exposed to the sigma receptor agonist SKF10047, whole-cell I K was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 A). Kinetic analysis revealed that the current amplitude was uniformly reduced by this agent and that the time constants for channel activation and inactivation remained unaltered (control: τact = 9.7 ± 0.6 ms, τinact = 3.8 ± 1.7 s; 10 μm SKF10047: τact = 9.7 ± 3.2 ms, τinact = 3.8 ± 1.0 s; n = 3). Whole-cell I K was also potently inhibited by the sigma receptor ligand IAC (Fig. 1 B). A radiolabeled version of this agent was originally developed as a photoaffinity label for neuronal sigma receptors (6Kahoun J.R. Ruoho A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Kahoun J.R. Ruoho A.E. Kamenka J.-M. Domino E.F. Multiple Sigma and PCP Receptor Ligands: Mechanisms for Neuromodulation and Neuroprotection? NPP Books, Ann Arbor, MI1992: 273-286Google Scholar). Although significant inhibition ofI K was seen with 0.01 μm IAC, 1 μm IAC inhibited I K by more than 90%. The observation that IAC modulates I Kindicates that this compound is a potent sigma receptor agonist. To address the issue of ligand selectivity, additional chemically unrelated sigma receptor ligands were tested for inhibition ofI K. SKF10047 is the ligand for which sigma receptors were initially named (22Martin W.R. Eades C.G. Thompson J.A. Huppler R.E. Gilbert P.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976; 197: 517-532PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that this compound inhibits I K in a concentration-dependent manner, and Fig.2 shows that this effect is reversible. Like SKF10047, DTG binds to sigma receptors with aK D in the nanomolar range, and its affinity for members of other receptor families is on the order of 1000-fold lower (1Su T.-P. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 187-203PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates that DTG reduced I Kwith an efficacy and potency similar to SKF10047. Fig. 2 shows a similar result with PPHT, a drug that binds both sigma receptors and dopamine receptors (23Kebabian J.W. Tarazi F.I. Kula N.S. Baldessarini R.J. Drug Discovery Today. 1997; 2: 333-340Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and that has recently been shown to modulate neurohypophysial I K (5Wilke R.A. Lupardus P.J. Grandy D.K. Rubinstein M. Low M.J. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 391-406Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Wilke R.A. Hsu S.-F. Jackson M.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, four compounds known to bind sigma receptors, IAC, SKF10047, DTG, and PPHT, all inhibit I K in DMS-114 cells. [125I]IAC covalently labels sigma receptors upon illumination and was used to identify the receptor as a 26-kDa protein in rat brain and liver and in human placenta (6Kahoun J.R. Ruoho A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The labeling of this protein in each tissue could be blocked by haloperidol as well as other sigma receptor ligands. As noted above, IAC inhibited I K (Fig. 1). When DMS-114 cells were homogenized and illuminated in the presence of [125I]IAC, subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging demonstrated labeling of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa (Fig.3). Photolabeling of the 26-kDa band in DMS-114 cells was inhibited by two sigma receptor ligands, haloperidol (lane 2) and SKF10047 (lanes 4–6). This indicates that DMS-114 cells contain a protein with a similar molecular weight and that this protein has binding properties similar to previously characterized sigma receptors. A progressive increase in the block of [I125]IAC photolabeling of the 26-kDa band was evident as the SKF10047 concentration increased from 1 to 100 μm (Fig.4, top). The inhibitory effect of SKF10047 on the photolabeling of this band was plotted simultaneously with the inhibitory effect of SKF10047 onI K (Fig. 4, bottom). These effects had similar concentration dependences. When these data were fitted to a single-site saturation equation (see “Experimental Procedures”), an EC50 of 7 ± 3 μm was obtained for the inhibition of photolabeling, and an EC50 of 14 ± 3 μm was obtained for the inhibition ofI K. These two values are statistically indistinguishable, indicating that the inhibition ofI K is mediated by the 26-kDa sigma receptor identified by photolabeling. This is an important result because it links the 26-kDa sigma ligand binding protein to the functional response of I K modulation. Interestingly, the overall efficacy of SKF10047 appears to be identical for the two end points of inhibition of photolabeling and inhibition ofI K. At 100 μm, SKF10047 reduced whole-cell I K to 24 ± 5% of control (n = 3); this same concentration of SKF10047 reduced [125I]IAC photolabeling to 31 ± 8% of control (n = 3). This suggests that full occupation of sigma receptor binding sites produces a nearly complete block ofI K. Receptor-mediated modulation of voltage-gated ion channels often reflects a shift in the voltage dependence of the channel. Although this feature is not diagnostic of a particular transduction mechanism, it is still widely regarded as important. We therefore examined the voltage dependence of inhibition of I K by PPHT by varying test pulses used to activate I K from −60 to 30 mV. Current was recorded before and after a 3-min exposure to 30 μm PPHT. At all voltages tested, PPHT reduced I K by approximately proportional amounts, suggesting that sigma receptor ligands do not produce their inhibitory effect on K+channels by shifting the voltage dependence of activation. Current was converted to conductance using the relation, G K= I K/[V − εK], where G K is K+ conductance and εK is the Nernst potential for K+ computed for the bathing and patch pipette solution compositions. The plots ofG K versus pulse potential are shown in Fig. 5 along with best fitting Boltzmann functions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under control conditions, the conductance-voltage plot was characterized by a steepness factor (k) of 10 ± 1 mV and a voltage midpoint (V12) of −6 ± 1 mV. After exposure to PPHT, neither the steepness factor (6 ± 4 mV) nor the voltage midpoint (−9 ± 4 mV) had been altered (n = 3). The modulation of I K in neurohypophysial nerve terminals by sigma receptor ligands exhibits a similar voltage independence (5Wilke R.A. Lupardus P.J. Grandy D.K. Rubinstein M. Low M.J. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 391-406Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Wilke R.A. Hsu S.-F. Jackson M.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). DMS-114 cell I K exhibits a weak voltage-dependent inactivation, as indicated by the decay of whole-cell current (Fig. 1), and it was already noted above that the time constants for activation and inactivation remained the same during challenges with sigma receptor ligand. We also examined inactivation ofI K by varying the voltage at which cells were held prior to depolarizing test pulses (to 10 mV). PPHT produced no shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation (data not shown). These results indicate that sigma receptor-mediated modulation ofI K is not the result of shifts in voltage dependence. Extensive literature on receptor-mediated modulation of ion channels has shown that in most instances such responses are mediated by G-proteins (11Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Breitwieser G.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Schneider T. Igelmund P. Hescheler J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 8-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the deduced amino acid sequence of sigma receptors does not fit with a G-protein-coupled receptor motif (7Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). There have been reports that the binding activity of sigma receptors can be altered by GTP and guanosine nucleotides and that sigma receptor-mediated responses are attenuated by cholera toxin and GDPβS (1Su T.-P. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 187-203PubMed Google Scholar, 4Soriani O. Vaudry H. Mei Y.A. Roman F. Cazin L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar), but another study showed that cholera toxin had no effect (12Morio Y. Tanimoto H. Yakushiji T. Morimoto Y. Brain Res. 1994; 637: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both the size (1Su T.-P. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 187-203PubMed Google Scholar) and deduced amino acid sequence (7Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) of sigma receptors are difficult to reconcile with that of known G-protein-coupled receptors. We therefore tested the role of G-proteins by adding GDPβS (100 μm) to the patch pipette filling solution and allowing it to diffuse into the cell interior during whole-cell recordings. Base-line currents were first collected for at least 3 min after break in, allowing ample time for a molecule of this size to perfuse the cell interior (26Pusch M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). G-protein-mediated responses in neurons have been shown to be attenuated 75% by this mode of GDPβS addition 2 min after break in (27Trussell L.O. Jackson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3306-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that responses to SKF10047 were not reduced by GDPβS. Both 10 and 100 μm SKF10047 showed equal efficacy for the inhibition of I K regardless of whether cells were perfused with 100 μm GDPβS or 100 μm GTP (Fig. 6). It therefore appears that sigma receptor-mediated modulation ofI K can occur independently of G-protein activation. Similar results have been obtained with sigma receptor-mediated modulation of I K in rat neurohypophysial nerve terminals. 2P. J. Lupardus, R. A. Wilke, Y. Chen, R. E. Ruoho, and M. B. Jackson, submitted for publication. In these experiments GDPβS also failed to block the modulation ofI K by SKF10047. The entry of the guanine nucleotide GTPγS into neurohypophysial terminals was verified by monitoring current through Ca2+-activated K+channels. GTPγS triggers the G-protein-mediated dephosphorylation of this channel in the neurohypophysis (28Bielefeldt K. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475: 241-254Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and 50 μmGTPγS added to the patch pipette filling solution reduced current to 79 ± 3% of the original level at break in, with a half-time of 29 ± 4 s (n = 11). These studies demonstrate that sigma receptor activation reduces voltage-dependent I K by binding to a protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa. Four chemically distinct sigma receptor ligands (SKF10047, DTG, PPHT, and IAC) inhibitedI K in a reversible, concentration-dependent fashion. IAC also photolabeled a protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa, and this photolabeling was blocked by concentrations of SKF10047 similar to those that inhibitedI K in patch clamp recordings. These studies provide the first link of a protein with sigma ligand binding activity to K+ channel modulation. Thus, despite the presence of a putative endoplasmic reticulum sequence and the absence of putativeN-glycosylation sites (7Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.-J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Flandorfer A. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J. Kempner E. Glossman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the physiological function of the sigma receptor indicates a location in or near the plasma membrane. The modulation of voltage-dependent K+ channels by membrane-bound receptors has been extensively studied in many systems. In general, transduction of these responses requires the activation of a G-protein (11Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Breitwieser G.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Schneider T. Igelmund P. Hescheler J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 8-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our observation that the inhibition of I K is mediated by a receptor with an apparent molecular mass of only 26 kDa is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that G-proteins are involved in the transduction of this response. Many G-protein-coupled receptors are similar in size to rhodopsin, with molecular weights of roughly 40–50 kDa (plus carbohydrate) (29Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although G-protein-coupled receptors with higher molecular weights are quite common (30Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), homologous receptors with molecular masses as low as 26 kDa have yet to be identified. Furthermore, the seven transmembrane segments found in all known G-protein-coupled receptors are inconsistent with the single membrane-spanning segment implied by the hydropathy plots constructed from the deduced sigma receptor amino acid sequence (7Kekuda R.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Efforts to establish a role for G-proteins in sigma receptor function have met with mixed results. Cholera toxin reduced responses to sigma receptor ligands in one study (4Soriani O. Vaudry H. Mei Y.A. Roman F. Cazin L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar) but not in another (12Morio Y. Tanimoto H. Yakushiji T. Morimoto Y. Brain Res. 1994; 637: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In melanotrophs, the guanine nucleotide analogue GDPβS has been shown to prevent the inhibition of I K by DTG (4Soriani O. Vaudry H. Mei Y.A. Roman F. Cazin L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 163-171PubMed Google Scholar). These results may reflect the existence of another molecular species of sigma receptor that is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. In the present study, cells perfused internally with GDPβS exhibited the same response to SKF10047 as control cells perfused internally with GTP, and GDPβS is known to be a very potent inhibitor of G-protein-dependent processes (11Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Breitwieser G.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Schneider T. Igelmund P. Hescheler J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 8-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Trussell L.O. Jackson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3306-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This result therefore indicates that the recently cloned 26-kDa receptor modulates K+ channels without coupling to G-proteins. In this regard it is relevant that the concentration dependences of both ligand binding and I K inhibition by SKF10047 were similar (Fig. 4). In contrast to G-protein-coupled receptors, where spare receptors and other variations in the efficiency of coupling can cause large discrepancies between the apparentK D and the physiological EC50 (29Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the modulation of K+ channel function by sigma receptor ligands appears to be tightly coupled to receptor binding. If G-proteins do not mediate the inhibition ofI K by sigma receptor activation, then these results may indicate that sigma receptor-mediated signal transduction depends on other molecular factors. An interesting possibility is that sigma receptors alter K+ channel activity through a direct protein-protein interaction with the channel, analogous to the actions of auxiliary β subunits (31Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and MinK proteins (32Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 33Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), both of which can modulate the function of voltage-gated K+channels without forming channels themselves. Another possibility is that sigma receptors interact with a protein kinase (by a G-protein-independent mechanism) and that this enzyme modifies channel function. These mechanisms have not been demonstrated previously in ligand-induced ion channel modulation, indicating that sigma receptors inhibit I K by a new transduction process. It is noteworthy that DMS-114 cells are tumor cells derived from a neuroendocrine progenitor (34Devita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. 5th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997Google Scholar). These cells retain many properties of an excitable cell line, including the expression of voltage-dependent ion channels (35Pancrazio J.J. Tabbara I.A. Kim Y.I. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1231-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 36Morton M.E. Cassidy T.N. Froehner S.C. Gilmour S.C. Laurens R.L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The coupling between sigma receptors and I K described here in DMS-114 cells is very similar to that found in neuroendocrine neurohypophysial nerve terminals (5Wilke R.A. Lupardus P.J. Grandy D.K. Rubinstein M. Low M.J. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 391-406Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DMS-114 cells exhibit ectopic release of the neurohypophysial hormone vasopressin (17Pettingill O.S. Sorenson G.D. Wurster-Hill D.H. Curphy T.J. Noll W.W. Cate C.C. Maurer L.H. Cancer. 1980; 45: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Sorenson G.D. Pettingill O.S. Binck-Johnson T. Cate C.C. Maurer L.H. Cancer. 1981; 47: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The coexpression of these distinctive properties in both DMS-114 cells and the neurohypophysis may reflect a link in the mechanisms of regulation of different cellular functions that is operating both in this tumor cell line and in the native hypothalamic neurohypophysial system. In vivo, tumor-related secretion of ectopic neurohypophysial hormones is responsible for inducing derangements of fluid and sodium homeostasis in as many as 30% of patients with primary small cell lung carcinoma (37Johnson B.E. Chute J.P. Rushin J. Williams J. Tram Le P. Venzon D. Richardson G.E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The finding that sigma receptors are functionally linked to membrane excitability in such cells indicates that this protein may represent a useful therapeutic target for the curtailment of ectopic hormone secretion. We thank Dr. Bradford Schwartz for providing the DMS-114 cells and Drs. Gerard Ahern and Sujata Swaminathan for help in the design of the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2048318355,"The endogenous formation ofN-nitrosoindoles is of concern since humans are exposed to a variety of naturally occurring and synthetic indolic compounds. As part of a study to evaluate the genotoxicity ofN-nitrosoindoles, the reactions of three model compounds with purine nucleotides and 2′-deoxyguanosine at physiological pH were investigated. The profiles of reaction products were identical for each of the N-nitrosoindoles and three distinct pathways of reaction could be discerned. These pathways were: (i) depurination to the corresponding purine bases, (ii) deamination, coupled with depurination, to give hypoxanthine and xanthine, and (iii) formation of the novel nucleotide 2′-deoxyoxanosine monophosphate and its corresponding depurination product oxanine in reactions with 2′-deoxyguanosine monophosphate. 2′-Deoxyoxanosine and oxanine were observed in reactions with 2′-deoxyguanosine. Further studies showed that formation of all of these products could be rationalized by an initial transnitrosation step. These results suggest that, in contrast to many other genotoxic N-nitrosocompounds which are known to alkylate DNA, the genotoxicity ofN-nitrosoindoles is likely to arise through transfer of the nitroso group to nucleophilic sites on the purine bases. All of the products resulting from transnitrosation byN-nitrosoindoles are potentially mutagenic. These findings reveal a new pathway for N-nitrosocompounds to exert genotoxicity.

All of the products resulting from transnitrosation byN-nitrosoindoles are potentially mutagenic. These findings reveal a new pathway for N-nitrosocompounds to exert genotoxicity. N-Nitrosation frequently transforms innocuous nitrogen-containing compounds into toxic compounds (1Bartsch H. O'Neill I.K. Chen J. Bartsch H. Relevance to Human Cancer of N-Nitroso Compounds, Tobacco Smoke and Mycotoxins. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon1991: 1-8Google Scholar). Depending on the structure of the N-substituents the resultingN-nitrosocompounds can either decompose spontaneously to give alkylating intermediates or do so after metabolic activation to α-hydroxy derivatives (Fig. 1). Alkylating agents such as alkyldiazonium ions react with DNA to give adducts which can be mutagenic upon replication. Among the many hundreds of nitrogenous compounds that have been studied a number of 3-substituted indoles have been found to produce mutagenic products upon treatment with nitrous acid (2Wakabayashi K. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Cancer Surv. 1989; 8: 385-399PubMed Google Scholar). 3-Substituted indoles occur widely in nature as natural products, such as tryptophan, or the plant growth hormone, indole-3-acetic acid, and this has lead to a concern that endogenous nitrosation of indoles in the acidic environment of the stomach could contribute to the risk of gastric cancer.

The mono-N-nitroso derivative, 1-nitrosoindole-3-acetonitrile (NIAN), is a direct acting mutagen toward Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and Chinese hamster lung cells (3Wakabayashi K. Nagao M.

Wakabayashi K. Kitagawa Y. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 1905-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but no attempt was made to characterize the products. Marked inductions of ornithine decarboxylase and DNA synthesis in rat stomach mucosa have been reported, after administration of NIAN, suggesting that NIAN also has potential tumor promoting activity in carcinogenesis in the glandular stomach (6Furihata C. Sato Y. Yamakoshi A. Takimoto M. Matsushima T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. (Gann). 1987; 78: 432-435PubMed Google Scholar). Two other indole compounds, 4-methoxyindole-3-acetonitrile and 4-methoxyindole-3-aldehyde have also been isolated from Chinese cabbage as nitrosatable mutagen precursors (7Wakabayashi K. Nagao M. Ochiai M. Tahira T. Yamaizuma Z. Sugimura T. Mutat. Res. 1985; 143: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Wakabayashi K. Nagao M. Tahira T. Yamaizuma Z. Katayami M. Marumo S. Sugimura T. Mutagenesis. 1986; 1: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition there are around 20 naturally occurring indole compounds, mostly 3-substituted, that have been demonstrated to be mutagenic toward Salmonellastrains without S9 mix after nitrite treatment (9Ohta T. Isa M. Suzuki Y. Yamahata N. Suzuki S. Kurechi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Gatehouse D. Wedd D. Mutat.

Wakabayashi K. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Mutat. Res. 1986; 172: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Despite consistent evidence that N-nitrosoindoles are mutagenic in a range of test systems and some evidence that they are DNA-damaging agents, little attention has been paid to their mechanism of action. The direct acting mutagenicity ofN-nitrosoindoles suggested that spontaneous decomposition of these compounds gives rise to DNA-reactive intermediates, possibly involving diazonium ions. In this study, reactions of a series of 3-substituted nitrosated indoles with 2′-deoxyadenosine-3′- and 5′-monophosphates (dAp and dpA), 2′-deoxyguanosine-3′- and 5′-monophosphates (dGp and dpG) and 2′-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) were investigated. The results suggest that, unlike many other mutagenicN-nitroso compounds, N-nitrosoindoles react with DNA bases primarily as potent transnitrosation agents. The evidence for this surprising conclusion is presented in this paper. NIAN is mutagenic and should be handled with extreme caution. 1-Nitrosoindole-3-acetamide (NIAM) and 1-nitrosoindole-3acetic acid methyl ester (NIAAME) are suspected mutagens and should be handled with extreme caution. IAN (Fluka), indole-3-acetamide (Sigma), or indole-3-acetic acid methyl ester (IAAME) (Sigma), dissolved in the minimum amount of acetonitrile (ACN), were reacted with a 15-fold molar excess of aqueous 50 mmnitrous acid (pH 3) at 37 °C in the dark for 3 h. Reaction mixtures were extracted 3 times with 3 volumes of dichloromethane and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The resulting filtrates were dried in a stream of nitrogen. The crude products were purified by HPLC using a Gilson-gradient controlled system equipped with either a dual-wavelength 116 Gilson UV detector or an Applied Biosystems Inc., 1000s diode array detector. Analyses were performed using a Hypersil C18 BDS, 5μ, 250 × 10-mm reverse-phase Shandon preparative column employing the following elution program: 0 min, 40% B, 20 min, 100% B, 25 min, 100% B, 30 min, 40% B (solvent A water; solvent B methanol) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min with UV detection at 260 and 328 nm. The pure nitrosated indole was dried in a stream of nitrogen to give yellow crystalline product in around 50% yield; the main impurity being unreacted starting material.1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 250 MHz instrument.

The reaction mixtures were extracted 3 times with 3 volumes of diethyl ether to remove unreacted NIAN, dried down in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator (DNA 110, Savant), and redissolved in 500 μl of water prior to HPLC analysis. Control incubations were set up of NIAN, IAN, or dAp/dpA alone. Diethyl ether extracts were also dried down and redissolved in 1500 μl of ACN prior to HPLC analysis. NIAN at molar ratios ranging from 1:0.5 to 1:20 (dGp/dpG:NIAN, NIAN = 0.133, 0.265, 0.53, 1.325, 2.65, 3.975 and 5.3 mg in 250 μl of ACN) were incubated with solutions of dGp or dpG (0.5 mg: 1.44 μmol in 250 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4) as described for reactions of dAp with NIAN. NIAM (4.8 mg in 250 μl of ACN) or NIAAME (4.65 mg in 250 μl of ACN) were reacted with dpA or dpG (0.5 mg in 250 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4) as described for reactions of dpA with NIAN. Both these concentrations correspond to a 15 m fold excess of nitrosated indole over nucleotides. NIAN, NIAM, or NIAAME at molar ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:15 (dGuo:nitrosated indole) were incubated with solutions of dGuo (0.5 mg: 1.87 μmol in 250 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4) as described for reactions of dpA with NIAN. HPLC-UV analyses were performed using a Hypersil C18 BDS, 5μ, 250 × 4.6-mm reverse-phase Shandon analytical column on the Gilson gradient-controlled system equipped with either a dual-wavelength 116 Gilson UV detector or to obtain UV spectra, an Applied Biosystems Inc., 1000s diode array detector. 100-μl injection volumes of aqueous reaction mixture were analyzed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using the following elution program: 0 min, 0% B, 25 min, 20% B, 35 min, 50% B, 40 min, 0% B (solvent A: 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 5.4; solvent B: methanol). Column eluants were monitored at 260 and 290 nm. For the separation of NIAN, NIAM, or NIAAME extracts after reaction, 30-μl aliquots were analyzed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using the elution program described for the purification of the nitrosated indoles. Column eluants were monitored at 260 and 328 nm. The fractions corresponding to reaction products were collected from multiple HPLC runs, pooled together, and dried down in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator for further analysis by ESI-MS. Reaction products were identified from their UV spectra, obtained by diode array analysis, and retention times which were compared with those of the authentic standards. Further evidence for structural assignment was obtained from the ESI-MS and ESI-MS-MS spectra of the pooled fractions. Off-line ESI-MS and ESI-MS-MS characterization of reaction products was carried out using a VG Autospec-Ultima Q. Dried fractions previously collected from the HPLC were resuspended in 50:50 ACN/water and inserted into the ESI via 20-μl “loop” injection or continuous infusion, at a flow rate of typically 8 μl/min. The cone voltage was in the range 8–23 V and full scan mass spectra were obtained by scanning from m/z 1650 to 50 at a scan speed of 10 s/decade. ESI-MS-MS product ion spectra were obtained by selecting the desired precursor ion with MS1 and allowing collision induced dissociation to occur in the collision cell using air as the target gas, typically at 10% transmission of the precursor ion with a collision energy of 48 eV. The resulting product ions were analyzed in MS2. NIAN, NIAM, and NIAAME (Fig.2) were obtained as crystalline products by treatment of the parent compounds with acidified nitrite followed by HPLC purification. Spectral data agreed well with data previously published by Wakabayashi et al. (3Wakabayashi K. Nagao M. Tahira T. Saito H. Katayama M. Marumo S. Sugimura T. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Sci. Ser. B. 1985; 61: 190-192Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). NIAN, NIAM, and NIAAME are isomeric compounds. The E/Z isomerization of the NO group is reflected in the nmr data, affecting principally the 2-H, 7-H, and -CH2- resonances; essentially the indole nucleus remains the same for the series of nitrosated indoles. The ratio of the two isomers was consistent for all three compounds at approximately 2:1. The disappearance of the -NH signal (as -NNO is produced) is evident in all nmr spectra. Satisfactory microanalytical data could not be obtained for NIAM, despite repeated preparations, with precautions taken to reduce denitrosation. However, spectral data for NIAM were consistent with that obtained for NIAN and NIAAME. Reaction of NIAN with dpA at pH 7.4 in buffered 50% aqueous acetonitrile yielded 3 products not seen in control incubations, hypoxanthine, adenine (Ade), and N 6-acetyl adenine with retention times of 7.7, 11.4, and 15.5 min, respectively (Fig.3). Identification of hypoxanthine was based on comparison of the retention time and UV spectrum with authentic hypoxanthine analyzed under the same conditions. When ESI-MS was performed on this fraction, a molecular ion with m/z 137 (M + H)+ was observed. Identification of adenine was again based on comparison of the retention time and UV spectrum with adenine standard. When ESI-MS was performed a main molecular ion withm/z 136 (M + H)+ was observed. A molecular ion with m/z 332 (M + H)+ was also observed suggesting the presence of unreacted dpA. Adenine and dpA co-elute under the HPLC conditions described. The identification of reaction product N 6-acetyl adenine was based on ESI-MS results. A molecular ion with m/z 178 (M + H)+was observed for this fraction. When ESI-MS was performed under conditions promoting cone voltage induced dissociation, a fragment ion with m/z 136 corresponding to protonated adenine was observed, confirming the structure as an adenine adduct. When deuterated ACN was used as co-solvent, a molecular ion withm/z 181 (M + H)+ was observed for the fraction, corresponding to N 6-acetyl (d 3)-adenine. All 3 reaction products increased in concentration with accompanying increases in the molar ratio of NIAN to dpA. Analogous reaction products with similar dose-related responses were seen with reactions of NIAM and NIAAME with dpA and NIAN with dAp (data not shown). Reaction of NIAN with dpG at pH 7.4 in buffered 50% aqueous acetonitrile yielded 6 products, guanine (Gua), xanthine, oxanine, 2′-deoxyoxanosine-5′-monophosphate (dpO),N 2-acetyldeoxyguanosine-5′-monophosphate (N 2-AcdpG), andN 2-acetylguanine (N 2-AcGua), not seen in control incubations, with retention times of 7.8, 8.7, 11.4, 12.1, 19.6, and 20.1 min, respectively (Fig. 4). Identification of reaction products guanine and xanthine was based on comparison of retention times, UV spectra, and ESI-MS results compared with standards analyzed using the same systems and conditions. The identification of reaction productsN 2-acetyldeoxyguanosine-5′-monophosphate andN 2-acetylguanine was based on ESI-MS results and comparison of retention time and UV spectrum for authenticN 2-acetylguanine. A molecular ion withm/z 194 (M + H)+ was observed for the fraction corresponding to N 2-acetylguanine. When conditions were employed to promote cone voltage induced dissociation, a fragment ion with m/z 152 corresponding to protonated guanine was observed, confirming the structure as a guanine adduct. Replacement of acetonitrile in the reaction mixture by the deuterated solvent gave a molecular ion with m/z 197 (M + H)+ for this fraction confirming it asN 2-(d 3)-acetylguanine. Similarly, ESI-MS analysis for the fraction corresponding toN 2-acetyldeoxyguanosine-5′-monophosphate afforded a molecular ion with m/z 388 (M + H)−and again by exchanging the solvent as described above, an increase of 3 units to m/z 391 (M + H)− was observed for the molecular ion. The concentration of xanthine increased with accompanying increases in the molar ratio of NIAN to dpG, while the concentration of guanine decreased as conversion to reaction products occurred. The results indicate that depurination occurs independently of the other pathways and is more evident at the higher molar ratios. This is illustrated by the dose-response behavior of the N 2-acetyl adducts. The formation ofN 2-acetyldeoxyguanosine-5′-monophosphate increased with an increase in the molar ratio of NIAN to dpG up to a ratio of 10:1. As the molar ratio increased to 20:1, the concentration of the product decreased in the system, and an increase in the depurinated adduct N 2-acetylguanine was observed. The identification of reaction products 2′-deoxyoxanosine-5′-monophosphate and the depurination product oxanine (Fig. 5) was based on comparison of retention time, UV spectra, and ESI-MS results when compared with oxanine derived from the hydrolysis of theN-glycosidic bond of authentic 2′-deoxyoxanosine (dOxo, 13). dOxo was hydrolyzed as described by Suzuki et al. (14Suzuki T. Kanaori K. Makino K. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 313-314Google Scholar). dOxo (0.37 mm) was incubated in 0.1 m acetate buffer at pH 4.0 for 4 h. At hourly intervals, 100-μl aliquots were injected onto the Gilson gradient-controlled HPLC system exactly as described previously for the analysis of aqueous reaction mixtures. As the dOxo peak (retention time = 19.9 min) decreased, a new peak (retention time = 11.4) appeared in the chromatogram, corresponding to oxanine; λmax 240, 287 nm (8% MeOH). The UV spectra of the novel products are very similar (Fig. 4): oxanine, λmax 240, 287 nm (8% MeOH); dpO, λmax 245, 288 nm (8.5% MeOH). Thus the retention time and UV spectrum of the hydrolysis product of dOxo was identical to that of reaction product oxanine. Upon ESI-MS analysis of the HPLC fraction corresponding to dpO, a molecular ion with m/z 347 (M + H)− was observed (Fig.6 a). ESI-MS-MS analysis produced fragment ions with m/z 151, 79 (PO3)−, 97 (H2PO4)−, and 195 (C5H8PO6)− (Fig.6 b). These results alone would sensibly suggest the formation of 2′-deoxyxanthosine-5′-monophosphate, however, the retention time and UV spectrum of the reaction product are not consistent with this suggestion. ESI-MS analysis on the fraction corresponding to oxanine resulted in a molecular ion withm/z 153 (M + H)+, corresponding to the same mass as xanthine and suggesting this product as the depurination product of dpO. The replacement of the N atom at N-1 of guanine with an O atom increases the relative molecular mass by one and coincidentally oxanine has the same mass as xanthine and 2′-deoxyoxanosine-5′-monophosphate has the same mass as 2′-deoxyxanthosine-5′-monophosphate. The dose-response behavior of these novel reaction products was similar to that found for the N-acetyl adducts previously described, lending further support to their identification. Analogous reaction products with similar dose-related responses were seen with reactions of NIAM and NIAAME with dpG and NIAN with dGp (data not shown).Figure 6Mass spectrometric analyses of HPLC fraction corresponding to dpO . a, ESI-MS; and b,ESI-MS-MS spectrum with precursor ion of m/z 347 selected with MS1; resulting product ions analyzed in MS2. Chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Reaction of NIAN, NIAM, or NIAAME with dGuo at pH 7.4 yielded the same 4 products, guanine, xanthine, oxanine, andN 2-acetylguanine with the same retention times as described for reactions of nitrosated indoles with dpG or dGp. The absence of reaction products 2′-deoxyoxanosine-5′-monophosphate andN 2-acetyldeoxyguanosine-5′-monophosphate is expected, as these are nucleotide adducts. All products exhibited analogous dose-response relationships to those described above. When diethyl ether extracts of reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC, denitrosation was the major pathway of decomposition for all the nitrosated indoles. N-Nitrosoindoles gave a positive result in the Liebermann test (15Furniss B.S. Hannorford A.J. Smith P.W.G. Tatchell A.R. Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry. Fifth Ed. Longmans, London1989: 1216Google Scholar) for a nitrosamine orN-nitroso compound, without the addition of acid and at room temperature. Under the usual conditions of the test, the nitrosamine is warmed with phenol and acid. The nitrosating species is liberated from the nitrosamine and nitrosates phenol to form ρ-nitrosophenol. Another molecule of phenol combines with ρ-nitrosophenol to form indophenol which is colored red. Under alkaline conditions, the red indophenol yields a blue indophenol anion. When reactions were repeated in the presence of azide ion, a scavanger of nitrosating agents (azide ion: N-nitrosoindole, 1:1 molar ratio), the formation of any reaction products was completely inhibited (data not shown). Identical nucleotide reaction products, which are structurally independent of the 3-substituted nitrosated indoles, were seen for reactions of nitrosated indoles with nucleotides and dGuo. Modification via depurination, deamination, and the formation of 2′-deoxyoxanosine monophosphate and the depurination product oxanine were apparent.N-Acetyl adducts were also observed, with the source of acetyl groups being the co-solvent used in the monophasic reaction system. All these pathways of modification can be rationalized by a transnitrosation mechanism. Depurination is probably catalyzed by N-nitrosation at the N-7 atom of guanine or adenine residues and/or the N-3 atom of adenine, imparting a destabilizing positive charge on the purine ring system. Cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond neutralizes this charge and gives the depurination products. The correspondingN-nitrosopurine is then rapidly hydrolyzed to generate the observed base (Fig. 7). The formation of deamination products can be explained by transnitrosation to exocyclic amino groups of purine bases. Nitrogen is readily displaced from the purine diazonium ion generated via transnitrosation. In this case, simple hydrolysis affords the deamination product, namely hypoxanthine from adenine and xanthine from guanine (Fig. 8). The mechanism for the formation of dOxo from dGuo by nitrous acid or nitric oxide has been reported (14Suzuki T. Kanaori K. Makino K. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 313-314Google Scholar, 16Glaser R. Son M.-S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10942-10943Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By using guanosine and its methyl derivatives, Suzuki et al. (14Suzuki T. Kanaori K. Makino K. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 313-314Google Scholar) demonstrated that reaction at N-2 to give the diazonium ion is followed by cleavage of the N-1-C-6 bond and that the exocyclic amino nitrogen of dOxo originates from the imino nitrogen (N-1) of dGuo. Consequently, the mechanism for the formation of dOp/dpO and oxanine would logically follow the same route starting with transnitrosation to N-2 of dGp/dpG or dGuo (Fig. 8). The transnitrosating potential of the three substituted nitrosoindoles is further highlighted by the formation of N-acetyl adducts. The replacement of ACN with d 3-ACN resulted in the formation of d 3-acetylated products, thus confirming the co-solvent as the source of acetyl groups. One possible explanation involves a slow hydrolysis step of acetonitrile to acetamide followed by transnitrosation to the amino nitrogen to produce reactive acetyldiazonium ion. However, when acetamide was added to the reaction mixtures at varying concentrations, no increase in the amount of acetylated products was observed, suggesting that this pathway may be at best, a minor pathway. Direct transnitrosation to the tertiary nitrogen atom of ACN followed by hydrolysis may be the more likely pathway and there is some evidence for this possibility (17Crookes M.J. Williams D.L.H. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1998; : 571-572Google Scholar). When reactions were carried out using methanol and ethanol as co-solvents, no reaction products were seen. The rate of denitrosation was slightly higher in alcohols than in ACN, and it is likely that the free nitrosating agent was used up in the formation of volatile alkyl nitrites. Reaction of alcohol with nitrous acid is used as the route for their preparation (18Furniss B.S. Hannorford A.J. Smith P.W.G. Tatchell A.R. Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry. Fifth Ed. Longmans, London1989: 413-414Google Scholar). The procedure depends on the fact that the alkyl nitrite has a lower boiling point than the alcohol and can be distilled out from the equilibrium mixture. It would appear therefore, that most, if not all of the products formed by reaction of N-nitrosoindoles with isolated purine nucleotides and deoxyguanosine, are the result of transnitrosation, that is, the ready transfer of the nitroso group to nucleophilic nitrogen atoms in the purines. In the case of guanine this results in formation of a diazonium ion at C-2. The solvolysis product of this diazonium ion to give xanthine is a well known reaction in purine chemistry but it is only recently that a more profound consequence of this pathway has been discovered. The interesting observations by Suzuki et al. (13Suzuki T. Yamaoka R. Nishi M. Ide H. Makino K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2515-2516Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that treatment of dGuo, oligodeoxynucleotides, and DNA with nitrous acid resulted in the formation of dOxo due to a rearrangement of the C-2-diazonium ion (14Suzuki T. Kanaori K. Makino K. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 37: 313-314Google Scholar) (Fig. 8), have important mutagenic implications. The presence of an oxygen atom in place of N-1 of guanine is likely to have a profound effect on Watson-Crick base pairing and recent results on the misincorporation of 2′-deoxyoxanosine triphosphate into oligonucleotides suggests that it is likely to be a potent mutagenic lesion (19Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dOxo is considerably more stable to depurination than dGuo suggesting that it is also likely to be a persistent lesion in the absence of a specific repair pathway (20Suzuki T. Matsumura Y. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8013-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the riboside of oxanine, oxanosine, is a natural product with a range of biological activities (21Shimada N. Yagisawa N. Naganawa H. Takita T. Hamada M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. 1981; 34: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Nakamura H. Yagisawa N. Shimada N. Takita T. Umezawa H. Iitaka Y. J. Antibiot. 1981; 34: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A further consequence of the formation of purine diazonium ion in double-stranded DNA is that this may lead to the formation of interstrand cross-links by displacement of nitrogen by the exocyclic amino group of guanine on the opposing strand (23Kircher J.J. Sigurdsson S.Th. Hopkins P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4021-4027Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Current studies are directed at investigating the relevance of this pathway forN-nitrosoindoles. In postlabeling studies such a G-G dimer would probably appear as a bulky adduct and this may explain the results of Yamashita et al. (5Yamashita K. Wakabayashi K. Kitagawa Y. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 1905-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) who observed adducts formed by reaction of NIAN with calf thymus DNA. Transnitrosation has been invoked, without any direct evidence, to explain direct-acting mutagenicity of N-nitrosoindoles (24Venitt S. Crofton-Sleigh C. Ooi S.L. Bonnett R. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mechanism of denitrosation of N-nitrosoindoles under weakly acidic or neutral conditions (pH 4–7) has been studied and may involve intramolecular transfer of the nitroso group to C-3 of the indole prior to transnitrosation of weakly basic amines and other nucleophiles (25Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I. 1974; : 962-964Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Meyer T.A. Williams D.L.H. Bonnett R. Ooi S.L. J. Chem. Soc.

Perkin II. 1986; : 1165-1168Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results presented in this paper demonstrate that, at neutral pH, N-nitrosoindoles transfer the nitroso group to nucleophilic sites on DNA bases resulting in depurination, deamination, and the formation of the novel products dOp/dpO and oxanine. All of these processes are potentially mutagenic events if they occur in DNA (28Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 29Wink D.A.

These observations represent a new pathway for N-nitrosocompounds, exemplified by theN-nitrosoindoles, to exert genotoxicity mediated by transfer of the nitroso group to DNA bases. In the wider perspective, this pathway may be operative for many agents which release nitric oxide.

Previous work showed that the C-terminal region of TnI, when linked to the “inhibitory region” (residues 98–116), possesses the major regulatory functions of the molecule (Farah, C. S., Miyamoto, C.

To investigate these functions in more detail, serial deletion mutants of the C-terminal region of TnI were constructed. These experiments showed that longer C-terminal deletions result in lower inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase activity and weaken the interaction with the N-terminal domain of troponin C (TnC), consistent with the antiparallel model for the interaction between these two proteins. The conclusion is that the whole C-terminal region of TnI is necessary for its full regulatory activity. The region between residues 137 and 144, which was shown to have homology with residues 108–115 in the inhibitory region (Farah, C. S., and Reinach, F. C.

The troponin complex is composed of three subunits: troponin I (TnI), 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; TM, tropomyosin; WT, wild-type; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.troponin C (TnC), and troponin T (TnT) (6Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three subunits are necessary for the complete regulation by calcium of muscle contraction. TnC possesses two low affinity Ca2+ binding sites (I and II) located in the N-domain and two high affinity Ca2+binding sites (III and IV) located in the C-domain (7Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In physiological conditions, the C-domain of TnC always has Ca2+ bound, whereas Ca2+ binding to the N-domain triggers muscle contraction (8Johnson J.D. Charlton S.C. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3497-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TnT, the tropomyosin (TM) binding subunit, is necessary for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of the Tn complex (9Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is required for complete inhibition of the ATPase activity of actomyosin (10Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A.

TnI is the subunit that inhibits the actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase in the presence of TM, and its inhibition is removed by TnC. The inhibitory action of TnI has been associated with a central part of its amino acid sequence (residues 98–116) named the “inhibitory region” (11Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Models suggest that TnI domains movement from TnC to thin filament are involved in the regulation of muscle contraction (reviewed in 4 and 5). By studying N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of TnI, Farah et al. (10Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol.

The C-terminal region is involved in both the TnC-TnI and actin-TnI interactions. These interactions are responsible for both the calcium regulation of the inhibitory action of TnI and the maintenance of TnI inhibition in the presence of TnC and in the absence of Ca2+ (10Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this time, little is known about the TnI structure, even though information from low resolution structures is available (12Olah G.A. Trewhella J.

The problem studied here is to map the functions of the C terminus of TnI by constructing serial deletion mutants of this region. The understanding of the mechanism of actomyosin ATPase inhibition by TnI can be improved by studying how these deletion mutants interact with proteins in the thin filament (actin-TM). The measurement of how these deletions affect the inhibition by TnI of the actomyosin ATPase activity and how they affect the binding of TnI to TnC shows that the entire C-terminal region of TnI is important for maintaining the properties of TnI.

A “yes” means co-sedimentation, and a “no” means no co-sedimentation. The TnC mutant F29W was produced in a Trp-defective Escherichia coli strain, resulting in a protein containing 5-hydroxy-Trp (TnCF29W5OH). 2F. F. Valência, M. F. Lee, C. H. I. Ramos, R. B. Quaggio, C. S. Farah, and F. C. Reinach, manuscript in preparation. The preparation of TnCF29W5OH and details of its fluorescence behavior are described elsewhere.2 5-Hydroxy-Trp has red-shifted excitation wavelength when compared with the Trp residue, which allows the fluorescence spectrum of TnC 5OHTrp to be distinguished from TnI Trp. Fluorescence measurements using TnCF29W5OH were collected on an F-4500 Hitachi spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was 315 nm (slit band with 5 nm), and the emission wavelength was 335 nm (slit band with 5 nm). TnC mutant F29W5OH alone or combined with TnI was diluted with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 6.5 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT to a final concentration of 3 μm. CaCl2 was added to give the free Ca2+ concentration desired. The fluorescence data were analyzed using the equation,F=f·[Ca]n/(Kdn+[Ca]n)Equation 1 where F is the relative fluorescence observed,f is the change in fluorescence caused by binding Ca2+ to the low-affinity sites, [Ca] is the free calcium concentration, n is the Hill coefficient, andK d is the apparent dissociation constant (28Pearlstone J.R.

Investigation of the amino acid sequences of the inhibitory and C-terminal regions of TnI from different organisms (Fig. 1) shows that there are two domains where the homology is high: the inhibitory region (residues 101–115) and the region between residues 137 and 144 (see also Ref. 5Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To study the C-terminal functions, mutants were constructed to produce serial deletions in this region (Fig. 1). The proteins were purified, and their solubilities are as follows. WT-TnI and TnI103–156 remain soluble in 0.5m NaCl, and TnI1–165, TnI1–156, TnI1–147, and TnI1–107 remain soluble in 1.0m NaCl. TnI1–136 and TnI1–129 are soluble in 1.0 m NaCl only at low concentrations. Tn complexes remain soluble in 6.5 mm NaCl. The binding of TnI deletion mutants in actin and actin-TM was tested by co-sedimentation. The presence of TnI mutants in the pellet after ultracentrifugation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), and a description of the results is given in Table I. Neither TnI or TM is present in the pellet in the absence of actin. WT-TnI is present in the pellet in the presence of actin, and its concentration in the pellet increases when TM is present, as seen by a stronger band in the presence of TM than in its absence (data not shown). The deletion mutants TnI1–165, TnI1–147, TnI1–136, TnI1–129, and TnI103–156 show behavior similar to WT-TnI. TnI1–107 deletion mutant, which lacks part of the inhibitory region, is not present in the pellet. This experiment shows that the whole inhibitory region is necessary to bind TnI to actin. The inhibitory properties of TnI deletion mutants were tested by measuring their effects in the actomyosin ATPase activity (Fig.2). Maximum inhibition of WT-TnI (about 80%) was reached when its concentration was 4 μm (1 actin: 1 TnI). The deletion mutants TnI1–165, TnI1–156, and TnI103–156 showed behavior similar to WT-TnI. Maximum inhibition of TnI1–147 (about 80%) was reached around 6 μm (1 actin: 1.5 TnI). The TnI1–147 curve of inhibition showed a much more cooperative shape than the WT-TnI curve. The deletion mutants TnI1–136 and TnI1–129 did not show the same behavior as WT-TnI, because the inhibition is weaker at the concentrations tested; testing at higher concentrations was not possible due to poor solubility of these mutants. The deletion mutant TnI1–107 did not show any inhibition at all concentrations tested. This experiment shows that there is a region between residues 147 and 156 that is important to achieving inhibition of the ATPase activity at the same levels show by WT-TnI. Fig. 3 shows release of the TnI inhibitory effect by increased concentrations of TnC in the absence (Fig. 3 A) or in the presence (Fig. 3 B) of Ca2+. The TnI deletion mutants used in this test were the ones that reached the maximum inhibition of ATPase activity shown by WT-TnI; the concentration used was 6 μm (1 actin:1.5 TnI), where this inhibition is maximum even for TnI1–147(see above). TnC did not release the inhibition of WT-TnI in the absence of calcium: inhibition of the ATPase activity was about 60% in all TnC concentrations tested. Total liberation of the inhibitory activity of WT-TnI, in the presence of calcium, occurred when TnC/inhibitor ratio is 1. The mutants TnI1–165, TnI1–147, and TnI1–156 failed to inhibit the ATPase activity in the absence of calcium: TnC can release most of the inhibition when the TnC/inhibitor ratio is 0.5. In the presence of calcium, the TnI1–165, TnI1–147, and TnI1–156 inhibition was released at a lower TnC concentration than shown by WT-TnI. In the absence of calcium, the deletion mutant TnI103–156 inhibited the ATPase activity in a manner similar to WT-TnI. In the presence of calcium, however, the inhibition caused by TnI103–156 was released at a lower TnC concentration than observed for WT-TnI. This experiment shows that in the presence of the N-terminal region, the region between residues 166 and 182 of TnI is necessary to maintain the ATPase inhibition in the presence of TnC and in the absence of calcium. The effect of TnI deletion mutants on the Tn complex was studied by testing its regulation of the ATPase activity of actomyosin as a function of calcium concentration (pCa) (Fig.4 A). WT-Tn complex inhibited the ATPase activity about 70% at pCa 9.0 and activated to about 20% at pCa 4.5. At pCa 9.0, Tn complex reconstituted with TnI103–156 (Tn-TnI103–156) showed the same inhibition as WT-Tn. Tn-TnI1–165, Tn-TnI1–156, or the Tn-TnI1–147 complex inhibited the ATPase activity about 55%, Tn-TnI1–136inhibited the ATPase activity about 35%, and the Tn-TnI1–129 inhibited the ATPase activity about 25%. Tn-TnI1–107 did not inhibit the ATPase activity at any pCa tested. At pCa 4.5, Tn-TnI1–147, Tn-TnI103–156, and the Tn-TnI1–136 complex showed a little lower activation than WT-Tn, whereas Tn-TnI1–156 and Tn-TnI1–165 showed a little higher activation of the ATPase activity than WT-Tn. The midpoints of the transition between inhibition and activation for Tn complexes reconstituted with TnI deletion mutants occurred around the same pCa as for WT-Tn, the exception being Tn-TnI1–107, which did not activate. Fig. 4 B shows actomyosin ATPase inhibition (pCa 9.0) and activation (pCa 4.5) as a function of TnI chain extension and includes results for Tn-TnI1–98 and Tn-TnI1–116 described by Farah et al.

The greater the TnI chain extension, the greater the inhibition at pCa 9.0. This experiment shows that in the presence of the N terminus, deletions in the C terminus of TnI decrease the inhibitory action of the Tn complex at pCa 9.0. Tn complexes were ultracentrifugated with actin-TM in the presence and in the absence of calcium, to test the effect of the TnI deletion mutants on the binding of Tn in the thin filament.

During the last year, the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns3,5P2) was identified in yeast, fibroblasts, SV40-transformed kidney (COS-7) cells, and platelets. The discovery of this novel phospholipid has increased the complexity of the metabolism relating to the generation of biologically active inositol-containing lipids. We describe here the identification of PtdIns3,5P2 in the CTLL-2 mouse T-lymphocyte cell line using two in vivo radiolabeling protocols. Treatment of the cells with UV radiation led to an increase in the cellular content of PtdIns3,5P2. In contrast, preincubation of the cells with wortmannin or treatment with hypertonic medium (high concentration sorbitol) led to the opposite effect. Herein we demonstrate that interleukin-2 (IL-2), the growth factor required for CTLL-2 cell proliferation, was able to increase the level of PtdIns3,5P2 with similar kinetics to that of the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns3,4P2). An increase in this novel 3-phosphorylated lipid in response to IL-2 seems to be a general property of this cytokine because a similar result was obtained when the pre-B cell line BaF/3 expressing the high affinity IL-2 receptor was used. Using a constitutively active regulatory subunit of type I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and cells expressing a deletion of the serine-rich domain of the IL-2 receptor β chain, which is required for IL-2-stimulated type I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, we demonstrate that IL-2-induced generation of PtdIns3,5P2 is related to the activation of this enzyme. The results show for the first time the identification of PtdIns3,5P2 in both T- and B-lymphocytes and indicate its positive regulation by the mitogen IL-2.

In the last decade there has been a large increase in the number of reports describing the phosphorylation on the 3′-hydroxyl of inositol giving rise to a small family of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate; PtdIns3,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns3,4P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns3,4,5P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PtdIns4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GroPIns3,5P2, glycerophosphoinositol 3,5-bisphosphate; GroPIns3,4P2, glycerophosphoinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; GroPIns4,5P2, glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GroPIns4P, glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate; GroPIns3P, glycerophosphoinositol 3-phosphate; GroPIns, glycerophosphoinositol; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IL-2, interleukin-2; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; SAX, strong anion exchange; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase; Jak/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transduction.1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate; PtdIns3,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns3,4P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns3,4,5P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PtdIns4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; GroPIns3,5P2, glycerophosphoinositol 3,5-bisphosphate; GroPIns3,4P2, glycerophosphoinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; GroPIns4,5P2, glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GroPIns4P, glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate; GroPIns3P, glycerophosphoinositol 3-phosphate; GroPIns, glycerophosphoinositol; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IL-2, interleukin-2; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; SAX, strong anion exchange; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase; Jak/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transduction. PtdIns3,4,P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns3,4,5P3). These 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides are not substrates for activated phospholipase C isoenzymes, but they have biological activity per se as they are able to activate downstream effectors such as PKB/Akt and modulate several metabolic processes (1Michell R.H.

Currently there are three families of mammalian PI3-K enzymes (type I, II, and III), the former two consisting of multiple isoforms (4Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). The substrate specificities of the PI3-Ks show some differences. Type I PI3-Ks preferentially phosphorylate PtdIns4,5P2 (over PtdIns and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P)) in vivo (5Vanhaesebrock B. Leevers S.J. Panayatou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), whereas the type II PI3-Ks prefer PtdIns and PtdIns4P as substrates, and PtdIns4,5P2 is poorly used (6Brown R.A.

Additionally, other PtdIns kinases involved in the regulation of the levels of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides have been characterized; these include isoforms of the PtdIns4P 5-kinase family which are able to synthesize the 3-phosphoinositides PtdIns3,4P2 and PtdIns3,4,5P3 (9Zhang X.

One of the latest developments in the phosphoinositide field has been the identification in vivo of the novel phospholipid PtdIns3,5P2 in yeast, fibroblasts, COS-7 cells, and platelets (11Whiteford C.C.

Its signal transduction mechanisms have been studied in depth revealing that multiple signal transduction cascades are initiated after just seconds of receptor ligation (14Miyazaki T. Liu Z.J.

IL-2 stimulation of T-cells induces the rapid elevation of PtdIns3,4P2 and PtdIns3,4,5P3, but to this date, no analysis of PtdIns3,5P2 either in resting or proliferating lymphocytes has been reported. The present study describes the presence of PtdIns3,5P2 in both T- and B-lymphocytes. We also report here for the first time that mitogenic stimulation by IL-2 increases the level of this novel PtdInsP2 isoform. Human recombinant IL-2 was a generous gift from Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. (Nutley, NJ). [32P]Orthophosphate, [γ32P]ATP, myo-2-[3H]PtdIns,myo-2-[3H]PtdIns4P,myo-2-[3H]PtdIns4,5P2, andmyo-2-[3H]inositol were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.myo-2-[3H]inositol-1,4-bisphosphate andmyo-2-[3H]inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Fetal calf serum and all cell culture media/supplements were bought from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 1000-Da molecular-cut off fetal calf serum, ammonium phosphate, EDTA, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, unlabeled myo-inositol, PtdIns, PtdIns4P, PtdIns4,5P2, and wortmannin were from Sigma. Anti-p85 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All organic solvents were supplied from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). CTLL-2 cells were maintained and grown for experiments according to previously published work (23Jones D.R. Flores I. Diaz E. Martinez-A C. Mérida I.

When necessary, the CTLL-2 cells were transfected according to the protocol described by Jimenez et al. (24Jimenez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez-Viciana P. González-Garcia A. Leonardo E. von Wennstrom S.

Murine IL-3-dependent BaF/3 cells expressing the full-length human IL-2 receptor β chain (Bafα/β) or a deletion mutant of the IL-2 receptor β chain lacking the serine-rich domain (amino acids 267–322) (Bafα/βSD1) were generated as described previously (21Mérida I. Williamson P. Kuziel W.A. Greene W.C. Gaulton G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6765-6770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin buffered to a pH of 7.2 with 10 mm HEPES, with either 50 units/ml recombinant IL-2 or 10% WEHI.3-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3, respectively. When cells reached a density of approximately 106/ml, they were washed twice in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin buffered to a pH of 7.2 with 10 mm HEPES before reincubating during a starving period of 6 h in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Forin vivo radiolabeling, 600 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate was included during the last 2 h of the starving period. After this period, the cells were challenged with control medium, medium containing recombinant IL-2, or other stimuli for varying times. For in vivo metabolic radiolabeling with myo-2-[3H]inositol, CTLL-2 cells were grown for a period of 6 days in RPMI 1640 medium that contained a reduced concentration (5 μm) of unlabeledmyo-inositol supplemented with 10% v/v 1000-Da molecular weight-cut off fetal calf serum, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 units/ml IL-2. myo-2-[3H]inositol was included in the medium during days 2–6 at a concentration of 10 μCi/ml. At the end of cell treatments, the cells were pelleted, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately frozen on dry ice. Approximately 15 × 106 cells were used for each incubation/extraction, yielding a total incorporation of [32P] radioactivity into phospholipids of approximately 4.5 × 106 cpm and 5 × 105 cpm in the case of [3H]. In vivo production of 3-phosphorylated lipids was determined essentially as described previously (39Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipids were extracted using CHCl3/MeOH/HCl in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, and 10 μg of a mixture of unlabeled PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns4,5P2 to act as cold carriers. The isolated lower organic phases were washed once with freshly prepared artificial acidified aqueous methanolic top phase containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate. Washed organic phases were transferred into a screw-capped glass vial and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. 500 μl of freshly prepared methylamine reagent (1-butanol, methanol, 25% aqueous methylamine, 11.5/45.7/42.8, v/v) containing 1 mm EDTA was added to the glass vials before heating at 53 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the contents of the vials were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and vacuum-dried at room temperature. After resuspending the mixture in 500 μl of H2O, fatty acids and any undeacylated lipids were removed by washing twice with 500 μl of the freshly prepared solvent mixture consisting of 1-butanol, petroleum ether, ethyl formate (20:4:1, v/v). More than 95% of the radioactivity routinely partitioned into the aqueous phase, indicating almost complete phospholipid deacylation. The aqueous phase was vacuum-dried before storage at −70 °C. Separation of all the deacylated phospholipids was performed by HPLC employing a Partisphere SAX column (4.6 × 235 mm, 5 μm, Whatman) with a gradient of 0–1 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.75, over 120 min. The gradient consisted of 0–10 min 100% for pump A, 10–70 min linear rise to 25% for pump B, 70–120 min steep linear rise to 100% for pump B. The pump and column washout was from 120 to 130 min with 100% for pump A (H2O). Radiolabeled deacylated phospholipids were detected by on-line radiochemical monitoring (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA and EG & G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Peak-associated radioactivity was expressed as % of total radioactivity detected to eliminate any inter-sample variation. 3-Phosphorylated phosphoinositide HPLC standards ([32P]GroPIns3P, [32P]GroPIns3,4P2, and [32P]GroPIns3,4,5P3) were prepared by the action of PI3-K (immunoprecipitated from 108 CTLL-2 cells using an anti-p85 antibody) on the substrates PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns4,5P2 in the presence of [γ32P]ATP followed by their deacylation as described previously (24Jimenez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez-Viciana P. González-Garcia A. Leonardo E. von Wennstrom S. Kobbe C. Toran J.R.-L. Borlado L. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gasparm M.L. Diez E. Marcos M.A. Downward J. Martinez-A C. Mérida I. Carrera A.-C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, [3H]GroPIns, [3H]GroPIns4P, and [3H]GroPIns4,5P2 were prepared by deacylation of commercially availablemyo-2-[3H]PtdIns,myo-2-[3H]PtdIns4P, andmyo-2-[3H]PtdIns4,5P2. Authentic [3H]GroPIns3,5P2 and [14C]GroPIns3,5P2 standards were provided by Dr. Stephen Dove and Prof. R. H. Michell, University of Birmingham (Birmingham, UK). Using SAX-HPLC methodology, we were able to achieve base-line separation of the three radiolabeled deacylated isomers of PtdInsP2 ([3H]GroPIns3,5P2, [32P]GroPIns3,4P2, and [3H]GroPIns4,5P2) known at this time. This separation of the standards is shown in Fig.1. Metabolic radiolabeling of CTLL-2 cells with [32P]orthophosphate introduced radioactivity into GroPIns3,4P2 and the GroPIns4,5P2 isomer. In addition, radioactivity was also found in a third peak, which eluted approximately 2 min before that of the GroPIns3,4P2 isomer (Fig. 1). This peak coincided with the [3H]GroPIns3,5P2 standard and was well separated from the internal standardsmyo-2-[3H]inositol 1,4-bisphosphate,myo-2-[3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate andmyo-2-[3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate which were also injected. This observation was completely reproducible and suggested that PtdIns3,5P2 was present in CTLL-2 cells. To confirm the identification of GroPIns3,5P2 in the HPLC profile, we used long term myo-2-[3H]inositol metabolic labeling of CTLL-2 cells to show the presence ofmyo-inositol in the peak putatively identified as PtdIns3,5P2. Indeed, 3H radioactivity was found in a peak co-eluting with an authentic [14C]GroPIns3,5P2 standard and before the [32P]GroPIns3,4P2 standard (data not shown). The structure of GroPIns3,5P2 was confirmed by its deglyceration to Ins(1,3,5)P3 and its separation from the standards Ins(1,3,4)P3 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 by isocratic SAX-HPLC using 510 mmNaH2PO4 at 1 ml min (data not shown). Thus, on the basis of these preliminary experiments, we positively identified the presence of PtdIns3,5P2 in CTLL-2 cells. It has been reported that treatment of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells with agents that induce stress result in the modulation of the levels of PtdIns3,5P2 (12Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To study the regulation of PtdIns3,5P2 in CTLL-2 cells, we treated the cells with various defined agents to determine their effects on the level of PtdIns3,5P2, PtdIns3P, PtdIns3,4P2, and PtdIns3,4,5P3. Cells that were treated with UV radiation for 20 min increased their PtdIns3,5P2 by approximately 75% above control (Fig. 2). Furthermore, UV radiation caused an approximately 2-fold increase in the radioactivity associated with PtdIns3P, a small (15%) decrease in the level of PtdIns3,4P2, and a large decrease (80%) in PtdIns3,4,5P3 compared with control-treated cells (Fig.3). In response to hypertonic shock (high concentration sorbitol), a decrease (to approximately 65% of control) in the radiolabeling associated with PtdIns3,5P2 was observed (Fig. 2), which was in agreement with that seen in COS-7 cells (12Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 also indicates that the action of sorbitol on the levels of PtdIns3P, PtdIns3,4P2, and PtdIns3,4,5P3 was slight, as only slight (10–30%) decreases in their levels were observed. In addition to agents that induce stress, the level of PtdIns3,5P2 has also been shown to be sensitive to the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin (11Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To further characterize our cell system and to determine whether PtdIns3,5P2 in CTLL-2 cells showed similar wortmannin sensitivity, we treated the cells with the PI3-K inhibitor. The radioactivity associated with PtdIns3,5P2 fell to approximately 25% of control (Fig. 2). In addition, the levels of PtdIns3P, PtdIns3,4P2, and PtdIns3,4,5P3 were affected by treatment with wortmannin. The former two phospholipids suffered moderate decreases (between 20 and 50%), whereas PtdIns3,4,5P3 was reduced by more than 90% (Fig. 3).Figure 3Environmental and pharmacological manipulation of the levels of PtdIns3P , PtdIns3,4P2, and PtdIns3,4,5P3 in CTLL-2 cells. Arrested cells were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated as follows: with control medium (20 min), with UV light (20 min), or preincubated (1 h) with wortmannin (50 nm) followed by treatment with control medium (20 min) and sorbitol (1 m) for 20 min. Phospholipids were extracted, deacylated, and analyzed by SAX-HPLC. Representative SAX-HPLC profiles corresponding to the regions containing PtdIns3P (from 38 to 42 min), PtdIns3,4P2 (from 81 to 84 min), and PtdIns3,4,5P3 (from 103 to 106 min) after distinct cell treatments (see symbol key) are shown inpanels A, B, and C, respectively. Inpanel D the percentage increases and decreases in the levels of PtdIns3P, PtdIns3,4P2, and PtdIns3,4,5P3 with respect to control cell treatment are indicated The results are mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the light of the discovery of PtdIns3,5P2 (11Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), it has now become important to completely separate all three isomers (PtdIns3,5P2, PtdIns3,4P2, and PtdIns4,5P2) of PtdInsP2 to determine their cellular levels before and after cell stimulation. For that reason we decided to investigate whether IL-2 affected the level of PtdIns3,5P2 in CTLL-2 cells by using our SAX-HPLC system capable of high resolution PtdInsP2 isomer separation. Fig.4 shows that IL-2 stimulated an early and transient increase in the PtdIns3,4,5P3 content of the cells (approximately 75% above control). This finding is in contrast to the slow rise in the amount of PtdIns3,4P2(approximately a 2-fold increase above control at 20 min). As is the case for other mitogens, IL-2 caused no consistent perturbation of the amount of PtdIns3P in CTLL-2 cells at all the time points examined (data not shown). Our results agree with those reported by Remillard and co-workers (18Remillard B. Petrillo R. Maslinski W. Tsudo M. Strom T.B. Cantley L. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14167-14170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to IL-2, there was a gradual accumulation of PtdIns3,5P2 (approximately 75% above control at 20 min). This increase in PtdIns3,5P2 displayed kinetics similar to those in the accumulation of PtdIns3,4P2. The increase in PtdIns3,4,P2 at 20 min was approximately 50% higher than for PtdIns3,5P2. To demonstrate that the mitogenic activity of IL-2 correlated with the generation of PtdIns3,5P2, we determined the accumulation of this novel lipid in Baf/3 cells expressing either the wild-type human β chain of the IL-2 receptor or a deletion of the serine-rich domain within the human β chain of the IL-2 receptor, which abolishes IL-2-stimulated PI3-K activity and cell proliferation. In Bafα/β cells, IL-2 caused an approximately 2-fold increase in the radioactivity associated with both PtdIns3,5P2 and PtdIns3,4P2 after 20 min of incubation, which was completely inhibited by wortmannin (Fig.5). These IL-2-stimulated increases in PtdIns3,5P2 and PtdIns3,4P2 were not observed in Bafα/βSD1 cells (Fig. 5). Both types of cells responded to UV radiation in a manner similar to that seen in CTLL-2 cells by increasing the radioactivity found in the PtdIns3,5P2fraction (approximately 2-fold) and decreasing by approximately 30% that found in PtdIns3,4P2 (Fig. 5). So far, the results suggested that IL-2-activated type I PI3-K activity was a prerequisite for an increase in the cellular PtdIns3,5P2 content. To consolidate these findings, we chose to take advantage of the recently described constitutively active regulatory subunit of type I PI3-K p65 (24Jimenez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez-Viciana P.

In vivo metabolic radiolabeling and HPLC analysis of p65-transfected cells indicated virtually no increases in PtdIns3P compared with wild-type cells, despite the increase in the levels of both PtdIns3,4P2 and PtdIns3,4,5P3 by approximately 50–60% (Fig. 6), which was in agreement with previous results (24Jimenez C.

When the level of PtdIns3,5P2 was analyzed in CTLL-2 cells expressing p65, a dramatic increase in the level of this lipid, more than 3-fold compared with empty vector-transfected cells, was observed (Fig.7). When both cell types were stimulated with IL-2 for 20 min, the PtdIns3,5P2 content of empty vector-transfected cells and p65 vector-transfected cells was increased by approximately 80 and 110%, respectively (Fig. 7).Figure 6Stable p65-transfection increases the PtdIns3,4P2 and PtdIns3,4,5P3 content of CTLL-2 cells without affecting the level of PtdIns3P .

In addition to lymphocytes, PtdIns3,5P2 has been identified (11Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Dove S.K. Cooke F.T.

The mechanism for the formation of PtdIns3,5P2 appears to be through the enzymatic conversion of PtdIns3P by a 5-kinase. Evidence for this hypothesis has come from in vivo radiolabeling procedures indicating that the last phosphate group attached to the PtdIns3,5P2 is the group that has the highest specific activity (11Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this activity is, at least in mouse fibroblasts, sensitive to wortmannin (11Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The responsible enzyme, Fab1p, has recently been described in yeast (28Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To date no information is available concerning its mammalian counterpart. Treatment of cells with UV radiation is considered to be a stress signal that immediately causes the activation of various enzymes including the c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (JNK) cascade (30Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Because UV irradiation of cells is anti-mitogenic, it is consistent with the observation in our cells of a decrease in phospholipids considered to be mitogenic (PtdIns3,4P2 and PtdIns3,4,5P2). Our results indicated that the enzyme activated in response to UV radiation was a PI3-K specific for the phosphorylation of PtdIns, most likely a type III PI3-K. The rise in PtdIns3P was far greater than the rise in PtdIns3,5P2, which suggests that only a small proportion of the PtdIns3P is used for PtdIns3,5P2 synthesis, leaving the majority for other roles that could include regulation of endocytosis, membrane trafficking, and protein sorting (31De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 32Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4930-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Another possible role of the PtdIns3P generated in response to UV radiation could be that of the activation of the JNK cascade. In this regard, JNK activation has been shown to be mediated by a PI3-K exhibiting wortmannin/LY294002 sensitivity (33Lopez-Ilasaca M. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2505-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The proliferation of T-lymphocytes is a process primarily controlled by IL-2. It activates various signal transduction pathways including the ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3-K/Akt, and Jak/STAT cascades (14Miyazaki T. Liu Z.J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. Barsoumian E.L. Permutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1995; 81: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). IL-2 is a strong stimulator of the PI3-K pathway, and it is essential for IL-2-driven cell proliferation. IL-2-stimulated PI3-K has been relatively well characterized and has involved the use ofin vivo metabolic radiolabeling experiments to demonstrate increases in PtdIns3,4P2 and PtdIns3,4,5P3(18Remillard B.

However, to date no analysis of PtdIns3,5P2generation in lymphocytes in response to IL-2 has been performed. IL-2 stimulation of CTLL-2 cells also increases PtdIns3,5P2levels, although the mechanism responsible for the elevation of this novel lipid is not completely clear. Results from our experiments using Bafα/β cells and Bafα/βSD1 cells have helped to clarify this point. Within the β chain of the IL-2 receptor is a serine-rich cytoplasmic domain that is responsible for the association of Jak1 (34Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Deletion of this domain abolishes PI3-K activation following IL-2 binding (21Mérida I. Williamson P. Kuziel W.A. Greene W.C. Gaulton G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6765-6770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kanazawa T. Keeler M.I. Vartikovski L. Cell Immunol. 1994; 156: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), probably because of the role of Jak1 in p85 association (36Migone T.-S. Rodig S. Cacalano N.A. Berg M. Schreiber R.D. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6416-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Bafα/βSD1 cells, no such domain is present, and no increase in the PtdIns3,5P2 content of the cells was found in response to IL-2 stimulation. This finding suggests that type I PI3-K activity is required for IL-2-stimulated PtdIns3,5P2 generation. As a consequence of irradiation with UV light, both cells types were able to elevate the cellular level of PtdIns3,5P2 to approximately the same level, thereby demonstrating that their response to a non-receptor-mediated event was identical and fully independent of the type of IL-2 receptor β chain that they expressed. We have previously demonstrated that CTLL-2 cells stably transfected with a mutant form of the regulatory subunit of PI3-K, p65, induces constitutive activation of PI3-K (24Jimenez C. Jones D.R. Rodriguez-Viciana P. González-Garcia A. Leonardo E. von Wennstrom S. Kobbe C. Toran J.R.-L. Borlado L. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gasparm M.L. Diez E. Marcos M.A. Downward J. Martinez-A C. Mérida I. Carrera A.-C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We have used this model herein to determine its effects on the accumulation of PtdIns3,5P2. In these cells the PtdIns3,5P2content was elevated with respect to empty vector-transfected cells. In addition, IL-2 stimulation of these cells induces an approximately two-fold elevation of the level of PtdIns3,5P2, as it does in wild-type CTLL-2 cells. It can be concluded from these experiments that in CTLL-2 cells expressing a constitutively active allele of PI3-K, there is a constitutive elevation of the PtdIns3,5P2level. This observation coincides with recent work by Klippel and co-workers (27Klippel A. Escobedo M.-A. Wachowicz M.S. Apell G. Brown T.W. Giedlin M.A. Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5699-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) who have demonstrated that an inducible constitutively activated PI3-K was able to increase the levels of PtdIns3,4P2 and PtdIns3,4,5P3 and that of a peak in the HPLC profile putatively identified as PtdIns3,5P2. Interestingly, IL-2 stimulation of CTLL-2 and Bafα/β cells as well as control-treated p65-transfected CTLL-2 cells results in the generation of PtdIns3,5P2 without increases in PtdIns3P. Although the increase in PtdIns3,5P2provoked by IL-2 was approximately the same as seen in response to UV irradiation, the apparent lack of PtdIns3P production suggested that the pathway for the formation of PtdIns3,5P2 did not totally overlap that initiated by UV radiation, despite the fact that IL-2 stimulates JNK activation (37Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Generation of PtdIns3P is usually attributable to type III PI3-K activity, which has been described as having constitutive activity in both resting and actively growing cells (4Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). It has been generally accepted that PtdIns is not a good substrate for type I PI3-K in vivo. These observations are based on the fact that no accumulation of PtdIns3P is detected following mitogen stimulation. However, when p65 is transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, its PI3-K activity is extremely high, which forces the in vivo elevation of PtdIns3P, PtdIns3,4P2, and PtdIns3,4,5P3levels. 2D. R. Jones and I. Mérida, unpublished observations. In this situation the degradation of PtdIns3P is delayed as compared with p65 stably transfected cells. This observation would suggest that the PtdIns3P generated in vivo following type I PI3-K activation, either by IL-2 receptor ligation or p65 cell transfection, is removed rapidly by one or more of the following enzymes: a PtdIns3P 3-phosphatase, a PtdIns3P 4-kinase, or a PtdIns3P 5-kinase. It could be envisaged that in response to IL-2, and for that matter other ligands, no net increases in PtdIns3P are observed because of its rapid removal via one or more of the three enzymes mentioned above. PtdIns3,5P2 represents a new member of the family of 3-phosphoinositides, which are known to be essential for the regulation of numerous cellular activities. However, to date PtdIns3P and PtdIns3,5P2 have not been assigned definitive roles. Observations of the involvement of phosphoinositides during protein translocation and membrane reorganization or protein trafficking events are the possibilities so far proposed (31De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 32Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D.

PtdIns3,5P2 may be a strong candidate for a true second messenger. To substantiate this claim, work focusing on its generation through a PtdIns3P 5-kinase, its subcellular site of synthesis, its possible relocalization, and its interaction with proteins, which may or may not contain pleckstrin homology domains (which bind polyphosphoinositides), will lead the way to understanding why cells have a requirement for yet another isomer of PtdInsP2, particularly in the case of mitogenic signals such as that delivered by IL-2 in T-lymphocytes. We extend our thanks to Dr. S. Dove and Prof. R. H. Michell from the University of Birmingham (Birmingham, UK) for supplying the authentic [3H]GroPIns3,5P2and [14C]GroPIns3,5P2 standards and for valuable discussions before and during the preparation of this manuscript."

To resolve this controversy, we have prepared a ferric α-hydroxyheme-heme oxygenase-1 complex and titrated the complex with O2 under strictly anaerobic conditions. The formation of verdoheme was monitored by optical and electron spin resonance spectroscopies.

The results obtained from these titration experiments indicate that α-hydroxyheme can be converted to verdoheme by an approximately equimolar amount of O2 without any requirement for exogenous electrons.

As shown in SchemeFS1, the first step in the heme degradation catalyzed by HO is the oxidation of heme to α-hydroxyheme, a process requiring O2 and reducing equivalents from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (1Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second step is the formation of verdoheme with the concomitant release of the hydroxylated α-meso-carbon as CO (2Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem.

This step is also O2-dependent. In the third step, biliverdin is formed from verdoheme in a reaction that again requires O2 and reducing equivalents from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (1Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our early stoichiometric study employing a reconstituted HO system suggested that 3 mol of O2 and 4–5 mol of NADPH were consumed during the degradation of 1 mol of heme by HO (4Noguchi M. Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, for the second and third steps the stoichiometry with respect to O2 and reducing equivalent(s) from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase is not fully established. In particular the requirement for an exogenous electron for the conversion of α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme (the second step) is currently controversial. On the one hand, Matera et al. (5Matera K.M.

About 130 mg of soluble and catalytically active rHO-1 can be routinely obtained from a 10-liter culture (8Omata Y. Asada S. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Noguchi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The ferric α-hydroxyheme bound to HO-1 is five-coordinate (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

The α-hydroxyheme-HO complex exists in three resonance forms: a ferric enolate ion (Scheme FS2, 1), a ferric keto anion (2), and a ferrous π neutral radical (3) (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H.

In light of several lines of evidence accumulated thus far and in line with our present finding, it is likely that among the three resonance forms only the ferrous radical species (3), because of its radical nature, is able to interact with oxygen. Here we propose a possible mechanism for the conversion of α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme (Scheme FS2). First, dioxygen electrophilically attacks the ring carbon adjacent to the α-oxy group without oxygenation of iron. In fact, the α-hydroxyheme-rHO-1 complex in the presence of CO (Fig.3 F) was converted into the ferrous verdoheme-rHO-1 complex by O2 alone, in a manner similar to that depicted in Fig. 2(data not shown). Second, rearrangement of a dioxygen adduct (4) occurs through an unknown mechanism producing CO and ferrous verdoheme (5). A similar mechanism has been proposed by Liu et al. (6Liu Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and indeed our findings agree with their report with respect to the requirement for O2 but not for electrons. However, there is a discrepancy concerning the oxidation state of the verdoheme iron. Liu et al. (6Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

The obvious experimental difference between Liu et al. (6Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Hence, it is rather likely that the ferrous verdoheme generated in their system was spontaneously oxidized by atmospheric O2.Matera et al. (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K.

According to their description, the addition of O2 to the ferric α-hydroxyheme-HO complex resulted in the generation of a radical adduct analogous to 4 in Scheme FS2, but to generate verdoheme from this radical adduct the addition of an electron was required. Thus, they concluded that the catalytic conversion of ferric α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme by HO requires O2 plus one electron and proposed two alternative pathways for this conversion; one is the reaction of oxygen with ferrous α-hydroxyheme-HO complex and the other involves the aerobic reaction of the ferric complex with the reducing agent (refer to Scheme 3 in Ref. 5Matera K.M.

In fact, we also observed that α-hydroxyheme bound to rHO-1 in the presence of 1 eq of NADPH and a catalytic amount of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was converted to verdoheme by the addition of O2 (data not shown). This observation, however, does not necessarily imply that both oxygen and its reducing equivalent are required for conversion of α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme. Why they were unable to obtain verdoheme from ferric α-hydroxyheme by adding O2 alone is not clear. Nevertheless the pathways requiring an exogenous electron suggested by Matera et al. (5Matera K.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) still deserve to be examined, because under physiological conditions HO should be always ready to accept electrons from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. In this context, direct comparison of the reaction rates between electron transfer from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to the ferric iron in α-hydroxyheme bound to HO and electrophilic attack of O2 to porphyrin radical should be valuable. For this purpose, an anaerobic multiwavelength stopped-flow apparatus is under construction.It should be noted that the ESR signal of the ferrous π radical is accurately isotropic and has a g value essentially identical with the free electron, that its peak-to-trough width is 1.6 millitesla, and that it is readily saturated (Fig. 3). This requires that the unpaired electron be substantially delocalized over the macrocycle, thus allowing hyperfine coupling to protons and/or nitrogen to contribute to the line width, which is substantially larger than that observed with porphyrin π cation radicals (22Fajer J. Davis M.S. The Porphyrins. IV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 197-256Google Scholar). Furthermore the heme iron must be in the low-spin ferrous state, a circumstance that implies the heme is six-coordinate. This is naturally the case in the presence of CO but raises the question of the identity of this sixth ligand in the absence of this molecule.We should consider two possibilities. First, although we conducted the series of titration experiments under conditions as anaerobic as possible, we cannot completely exclude the presence of a residual amount of O2 and thus the production of CO by oxidation of α-hydroxyheme because of this contaminating O2. Thus the π neutral radical seen before starting titration (Fig. 3,A-C) might be liganded with O2 or CO at the sixth position. Relevant to this, Sano et al. (11Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) observed that when anaerobic solution of the ferric α-hydroxyheme-myoglobin complex was allowed to come into contact with a trace amount of air (much less than 1 eq of oxygen), the rhombic signal (g = 6.3) decreased and the major free radical signal (g = 2.004) appeared, although they assigned the signal to an oxygen adduct of α-hydroxyheme analogous to 4 in Scheme FS2. Second, the hydrogen-bonding network formed between the oxygen bound to the heme-HO complex and the distal amino acid residues seems important for oxygen activation and for regiospecific oxidation of the α-meso-carbon (23Gorst C.M. Wilks A. Yeh D.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8875-8884Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Fujii H. Dou Y. Zhou H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8251-8252Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the case of the α-hydroxyheme-HO complex, the heme moiety of a portion of the complex may interact with one of the distal residues, leading to the low-spin ferrous π neutral radical.Although there are several discrepancies among studies using HO systems, our conclusion is consistent with chemical model studies such as the coupled oxidation of pyridine hemin by ascorbate and oxygen. It has been established that the resonance hybrid of hydroxyheme in the complex with pyridine is converted to ferrous verdoheme with O2 alone (11Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Morishima I. Fujii H. Shiro Y. Sano S. J. Am. Chem.

The stoichiometry of the reaction, however, requires expulsion of an oxidizing equivalent. Fuhrhopet al. (25Fuhrhop J.-H. Besecke S. Subramanian J. Mengersen C. Riesner D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 7141-7152Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) postulated that an oxidizing species with the formal stoichiometry of (½)H2O2 would be expelled in the coupled oxidation system. The difference between the chemical and enzymic systems is the coordination state of heme iron; six-coordinate in the model system and five-coordinate in the enzyme system. The half-time of verdoheme formation was 8 min for the α-hydroxyheme-pyridine complex, whereas it was only 100–120 ms for the α-hydroxyheme-myoglobin complex (five-coordinate model) (11Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the relatively higher reactivity of the five-coordinate model, although the low-spin ferrous π neutral radical (six-coordinate) is considered the immediate precursor for verdoheme, is of great interest for the HO reaction. Heme oxygenase (HO), 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; rHO-1, truncated rat heme oxygenase-1; W, watt; ESR, electron spin resonance.1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; rHO-1, truncated rat heme oxygenase-1; W, watt; ESR, electron spin resonance. a microsomal enzyme that oxidizes protoheme to biliverdin IXα, plays a key role in physiological heme metabolism. As shown in SchemeFS1, the first step in the heme degradation catalyzed by HO is the oxidation of heme to α-hydroxyheme, a process requiring O2 and reducing equivalents from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (1Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second step is the formation of verdoheme with the concomitant release of the hydroxylated α-meso-carbon as CO (2Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Yoshinaga T. Sudo Y. Sano S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This step is also O2-dependent. In the third step, biliverdin is formed from verdoheme in a reaction that again requires O2 and reducing equivalents from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (1Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our early stoichiometric study employing a reconstituted HO system suggested that 3 mol of O2 and 4–5 mol of NADPH were consumed during the degradation of 1 mol of heme by HO (4Noguchi M. Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, for the second and third steps the stoichiometry with respect to O2 and reducing equivalent(s) from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase is not fully established. In particular the requirement for an exogenous electron for the conversion of α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme (the second step) is currently controversial. On the one hand, Matera et al. (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have claimed that the reaction requires both O2 and one electron; on the other hand, Liuet al. (6Liu Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have reported that the reaction only needs O2. Recently we have established a system for expressing and purifying a truncated version of the inducible rat enzyme (HO-1) consisting of Met-1 through Pro-267 (rHO-1); the sequence (1–267) of this truncated protein is completely identical to the corresponding sequence of the rat HO-1 (7Shibahara S. Müller R. Taguchi H. Yoshida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7865-7869Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). About 130 mg of soluble and catalytically active rHO-1 can be routinely obtained from a 10-liter culture (8Omata Y. Asada S. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Noguchi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 1017-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In an attempt to resolve the discrepancy arising from the work of Matera et al. (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H.

DISCUSSIONWe conclude from the results obtained by the titration experiments that the conversion of α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme can be accomplished with an almost equimolar amount of O2 in the absence of added reducing equivalents and that the verdoheme so formed is in the ferrous oxidation state. The ferric α-hydroxyheme bound to HO-1 is five-coordinate (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The α-hydroxyheme-HO complex exists in three resonance forms: a ferric enolate ion (Scheme FS2, 1), a ferric keto anion (2), and a ferrous π neutral radical (3) (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H.

In light of several lines of evidence accumulated thus far and in line with our present finding, it is likely that among the three resonance forms only the ferrous radical species (3), because of its radical nature, is able to interact with oxygen. Here we propose a possible mechanism for the conversion of α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme (Scheme FS2). First, dioxygen electrophilically attacks the ring carbon adjacent to the α-oxy group without oxygenation of iron. In fact, the α-hydroxyheme-rHO-1 complex in the presence of CO (Fig.3 F) was converted into the ferrous verdoheme-rHO-1 complex by O2 alone, in a manner similar to that depicted in Fig. 2(data not shown). Second, rearrangement of a dioxygen adduct (4) occurs through an unknown mechanism producing CO and ferrous verdoheme (5). A similar mechanism has been proposed by Liu et al. (6Liu Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and indeed our findings agree with their report with respect to the requirement for O2 but not for electrons. However, there is a discrepancy concerning the oxidation state of the verdoheme iron. Liu et al. (6Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Why they were unable to obtain verdoheme from ferric α-hydroxyheme by adding O2 alone is not clear. Nevertheless the pathways requiring an exogenous electron suggested by Matera et al. (5Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) still deserve to be examined, because under physiological conditions HO should be always ready to accept electrons from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. In this context, direct comparison of the reaction rates between electron transfer from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to the ferric iron in α-hydroxyheme bound to HO and electrophilic attack of O2 to porphyrin radical should be valuable. For this purpose, an anaerobic multiwavelength stopped-flow apparatus is under construction. It should be noted that the ESR signal of the ferrous π radical is accurately isotropic and has a g value essentially identical with the free electron, that its peak-to-trough width is 1.6 millitesla, and that it is readily saturated (Fig. 3). This requires that the unpaired electron be substantially delocalized over the macrocycle, thus allowing hyperfine coupling to protons and/or nitrogen to contribute to the line width, which is substantially larger than that observed with porphyrin π cation radicals (22Fajer J. Davis M.S. The Porphyrins. IV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 197-256Google Scholar). Furthermore the heme iron must be in the low-spin ferrous state, a circumstance that implies the heme is six-coordinate. This is naturally the case in the presence of CO but raises the question of the identity of this sixth ligand in the absence of this molecule. We should consider two possibilities. First, although we conducted the series of titration experiments under conditions as anaerobic as possible, we cannot completely exclude the presence of a residual amount of O2 and thus the production of CO by oxidation of α-hydroxyheme because of this contaminating O2. Thus the π neutral radical seen before starting titration (Fig. 3,A-C) might be liganded with O2 or CO at the sixth position. Relevant to this, Sano et al. (11Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) observed that when anaerobic solution of the ferric α-hydroxyheme-myoglobin complex was allowed to come into contact with a trace amount of air (much less than 1 eq of oxygen), the rhombic signal (g = 6.3) decreased and the major free radical signal (g = 2.004) appeared, although they assigned the signal to an oxygen adduct of α-hydroxyheme analogous to 4 in Scheme FS2. Second, the hydrogen-bonding network formed between the oxygen bound to the heme-HO complex and the distal amino acid residues seems important for oxygen activation and for regiospecific oxidation of the α-meso-carbon (23Gorst C.M. Wilks A. Yeh D.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8875-8884Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Fujii H. Dou Y. Zhou H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8251-8252Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the case of the α-hydroxyheme-HO complex, the heme moiety of a portion of the complex may interact with one of the distal residues, leading to the low-spin ferrous π neutral radical. Although there are several discrepancies among studies using HO systems, our conclusion is consistent with chemical model studies such as the coupled oxidation of pyridine hemin by ascorbate and oxygen. It has been established that the resonance hybrid of hydroxyheme in the complex with pyridine is converted to ferrous verdoheme with O2 alone (11Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Morishima I. Fujii H. Shiro Y. Sano S. J. Am. Chem.

The stoichiometry of the reaction, however, requires expulsion of an oxidizing equivalent. Fuhrhopet al. (25Fuhrhop J.-H. Besecke S. Subramanian J. Mengersen C. Riesner D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 7141-7152Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) postulated that an oxidizing species with the formal stoichiometry of (½)H2O2 would be expelled in the coupled oxidation system. The difference between the chemical and enzymic systems is the coordination state of heme iron; six-coordinate in the model system and five-coordinate in the enzyme system. The half-time of verdoheme formation was 8 min for the α-hydroxyheme-pyridine complex, whereas it was only 100–120 ms for the α-hydroxyheme-myoglobin complex (five-coordinate model) (11Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the relatively higher reactivity of the five-coordinate model, although the low-spin ferrous π neutral radical (six-coordinate) is considered the immediate precursor for verdoheme, is of great interest for the HO reaction. 1H NMR spectra were obtained through the auspices of the Kyushu National Industrial Research Institute."

To provide a detailed understanding of how KDR is activated, we analyzed the kinetics of ligand-receptor interaction using BIAcore. Both predimerized (KDR-Fc) and monomeric (KDR-cbu) receptors were examined with vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) homodimers and VEGF/placental growth factor (PlGF) heterodimers. VEGF binds to KDR-Fc with ka = 3.6 ± 0.07e6, kd = 1.34 ± 0.19e−4, and KD = 37.1 ± 4.9 pm. These values are similar to those displayed by monomeric KDR where ka = 5.23 ± 1.4e6, kd = 2.74 ± 0.76e−4, and KD = 51.7 ± 5.8 pm were apparent. In contrast, VEGF/PlGF bound to KDR-Fc with ka = 7.3 ± 1.6e4,kd = 4.4 ± 1.2e−4, andKD = 6 ± 1.2 nm. Thus, the heterodimer displays a 160-fold reduced KD for binding to predimerized KDR, which is mainly a consequence of a 50-fold reduction in ka. We were unable to detect association between VEGF/PlGF and monomeric KDR. However, nanomolar concentrations of VEGF/PlGF were able to elicit weak calcium mobilization in endothelial cells. This latter observation may indicate partial predimerization of KDR on the cell surface or facilitation of binding due to accessory receptors.

The expression levels of VEGF in the embryo are critical for development: even loss of a single VEGF allele is lethal in the mouse embryo and results in abnormal blood vessel development (4Ferrara N.

Currently, six isoforms of VEGF have been identified that are produced by alternative splicing, namely VEGF115, VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206 (2Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L.

The crystal structure of VEGF reveals a symmetrical antiparallel homodimer, which presents KDR/Flt-1 binding determinants at both poles of the dimer (8Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A.

Placental growth factor (PlGF), another member of the family, is portrayed by high affinity binding to Flt-1 but not KDR (9Kendall R.L. Wang G. DiSalvo J. Thomas K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The KDR and Flt-1 receptor tyrosine kinases belong to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family and are characterized by the presence of seven immunoglobulin-like folds in their extracellular domains (13De Vries C.

Targeted disruption of each receptor results in a distinct lethal phenotype. While Flk-1 is essential for development of hematopoietic and endothelial cells, Flt-1 deficiency results in a disorganized vasculature (15Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M.

Further, the co-crystal structure of VEGF with domain 2 of Flt-1 has revealed the receptor amino acids that directly contact VEGF (21Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C.

For KDR, crucial VEGF binding determinants extend through immunoglobulin-like domain 3 (22Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol.

Although KDR binds VEGF with lower affinity than Flt-1, it appears to be the main receptor through which VEGF mediates mitogenic signaling (14Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D.

This is further demonstrated in vivo where endothelial expression of a dominant-negative Flk-1 mutant inhibits tumor angiogenesis (25Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is the process whereby new blood vessels develop from the existing vasculature (26Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the adult, physiological angiogenesis is limited but occurs for example during corpus luteum development and wound healing. However, pathological angiogenesis is a component of many diseases such as solid tumor growth, retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis (27Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). In these situations VEGF expression is up-regulated. Thus, in recent years, much effort has been placed on identifying inhibitors of the VEGF/receptor interaction. A compound that inhibits the association of VEGF with its receptor would conceivably be more effective than one that enhances dissociation. In order to gain a more detailed profile of VEGF binding to its receptors, we have initiated a real time kinetic study using the BIAcore. We chose to concentrate on the KDR receptor due to the key role that it plays in endothelial cell mitogenesis and performed a focused study with VEGF and VEGF/PlGF. Our work reports a detailed kinetic analysis for both monomeric and dimeric forms of KDR with these ligands using surface plasmon resonance. Ligand/receptor interactions were performed on a BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). Protein A or calmodulin was cross-linked to the dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip. Protein A was immobilized using amine coupling with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride andN-hydrosuccinimide to a density of 1000–2000 response units (RU). Calmodulin was immobilized using thiol coupling chemistry to a similar density. The hetero-bifunctional cross-linker Sulph-m-Maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydoxysuccinimide ester was attached to the dextran surface through ethylenediamine following 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride andN-hydrosuccinimide activation. A mutant calmodulin with a free cysteine residue at position 18 (a gift from Dr. J. Putkey) was subsequently cross-linked to the surface. Recombinant receptor extracellular domains, fused to either the constant region of the mouse heavy chain IgG2a (KDR-Fc) or possessing a calmodulin binding tag (KDR-cbu), were captured to approximately 100 RU. For KDR-Fc, interaction of VEGF homodimer and VEGF/PlGF heterodimers was achieved at concentrations between 0.625 and 70 nm in HEPES-buffered saline consisting of: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20. For association, ligand was applied using the kinject program at 20–60 μl/min for 3 min. Dissociation was effected with HEPES-buffered saline applied over the surface at 60 μl/min for 10 min. When KDR-cbu was utilized, it was necessary to perform the experiments in a calcium-containing buffer to maintain capture of the receptor to the calmodulin surface. Experiments were conducted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Tween 20. The receptor/ligand complex was stripped from the protein A surface using 10 mm glycine, 200 mm NaCl, pH 1.8, and from the calmodulin surface using 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.005% Tween 20. For both protocols, it was necessary to follow with a brief pulse of 0.025% SDS to obtain full regeneration. The chip was allowed to stabilize for at least 10 min prior to subsequent use. Sensorgrams were subjected to global analysis using BIAevaluation software 3.0. Global fitting analyzes association and dissociation data for all VEGF concentrations simultaneously, and by doing so allows a more accurate description ofka/kd. A simple 1:1 Langmuir model was employed to fit the data, where A +B [dharrow] AB; A = analyte (VEGF), B = ligand (KDR), AB = complex;ka = association rate constant (m−1 s−1),kd = dissociation rate constant (s−1). Data were also analyzed with a 1:1 model, where mass transfer (kt = rate constant for mass transfer, s−1) or drift was taken into consideration. The fitting model was chosen based on the closeness of the calculated fit to the actual data (sensorgram overlay) and an examination of residual plots (data not shown).

Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), first three immunoglobulin-like domains of KDR. For dimeric secreted receptors, the KDR extracellular domain was subcloned into the pBacPak9 vector, which contained the constant region of murine IgG2A as described previously (18Cunningham S.A. Stephan C.C. Arrate M.P. Ayer K.G. Brock T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Cunningham S.A. Tran T.M. Arrate M.P. Bjercke R. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the KDR extracellular domain was modified by polymerase chain reaction to generate a KpnI site immediately prior to the transmembrane sequence. This was accomplished by amplifying a 181-base pair segment located at the C terminus of the extracellular domain using sense 5′- TGTAGAATTCTCAGGCATTGTA -3′ and antisense primers 5′ - GAATGGTACCTTCCAAGTTCGTCTTTTC-3′. The product was digested at an internal SphI site and at the introduced KpnI site, and ligated to the remaining extracellular domain (KDR was a previous gift from Dr. B. Terman). Recombinant dimeric fusion protein (KDR-Fc) was expressed in Sf21 cells and purified from the culture media using standard protein A affinity chromatography. For monomeric secreted receptors, a calmodulin-binding tag was subcloned into the KpnI site of pFastBac1 using the following annealed primers: sense, 5′- CAAGCGCCGCTGGAAGAAGAACTTTATCGCCGTGAGCGCCGCCAACCGCTTCAAGAAGATCAGCTCCAGCGGCGCCCTGCGTAC-3′; and antisense, 5′- GCAGGGCGCCGCTGGAGCTGATCTTCTTGAAGCGGTTGGCGGCGCTCACGGCGATGAAGTTCTTCTTCCAGCGGCGCTTGGTAC-3′. This resulted in deletion of the KpnI site at the 3′ end of the tag. The full KDR extracellular domain was subcloned from the pBacPak9 vector using BamHI and KpnI and ligated upstream of the tag. Recombinant monomeric fusion protein (KDR-cbu) was expressed in Sf21 cells and purified from the culture media using calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene). The protein was eluted from the column in calcium-free buffer, using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 300 mm. KDR-cbu fusion eluted at approximately 150 mm NaCl. HUVECs were detached from monolayers and loaded with 2 μm FURA-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were washed and resuspended at a final count of 1.0 × 106cells/ml. For inhibition with anti-KDR antibody, polyclonal serum at 1:100 was preincubated with the cells prior to stimulation (28Cunningham S.A. Tran T.M. Arrate M.P. Bjercke R. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence was monitored at 340 and 380 nm and [Ca2+]i estimated as described previously (28Cunningham S.A. Tran T.M. Arrate M.P. Bjercke R. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each experiment, a base-line resting fluorescence was measured for 100 s prior to stimulation with 0.05 nmVEGF165 or 18 nm VEGF/PlGF heterodimer. The kinetic experiments were performed on a BIAcore 2000, which has four flow cells allowing simultaneous measurements. This allows accurate monitoring of nonspecific binding to a control surface throughout the association/dissociation phases of ligand/receptor interaction. Amine coupling is the standard procedure used to achieve immobilization of ligand or receptors to the sensor chip surface. We specifically chose not to immobilize the VEGF ligand nor the KDR receptor directly to the surface in order to avoid modifying residues directly involved in the KDR/VEGF interaction. Our approach was to capture the KDR receptor in a manner that would allow VEGF full access to the binding interface. The experimental set-up for the series of studies conducted in this report is shown in Fig.1. The first sequence of experiments was performed on the KDR-Fc fusion protein, which presents a covalently dimerized receptor surface to the VEGF ligand. Dimerization occurs through a disulfide bond located in the hinge of the constant region of mouse IgG. Similar receptor constructs have been utilized extensively in the literature to assess VEGF interactions. Initial experiments were performed using a rabbit anti-mouse antibody as capture for the KDR-Fc fusion protein. This former was covalently cross-linked to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix of the CM5 sensor chips. However, an upward drift in the sensorgram following receptor interaction complicated the kinetic analysis. The use of protein A as capture eliminated this trend and was used for all subsequent experiments. Due to the very high affinity of VEGF for its receptor, KDR-Fc fusion was captured at low density, i.e.approximately 100 RU. This minimized mass transport effects due to VEGF165 rebinding following its dissociation from the receptor. To further reduce mass transport effects, VEGF165ligand was applied at a relatively fast flow rate of 60 μl/min. This ensured that binding was not limited due to inefficient delivery of VEGF to the receptor surface (29Fivash M. Towler E.M. Fisher R.J. Curr. Opin. Bio/Technol. 1998; 9: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Each concentration of VEGF165 was passed simultaneously over two flow cells, one in the presence and one in the absence of captured receptor. This allowed the subtraction of nonspecific binding effects and bulk refractive index. The sensorgrams shown reflect the data subtracted from the control flow cell and shows the closeness of the calculated fit. Fig. 2 shows a typical sensorgram overlay for varying VEGF concentrations. Since the off rate is extremely slow, dissociation was recorded over an extended period of 10 min to improve the accuracy of kd determination. Global analysis was performed on the data using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (30BIAcore AB BIAevaluation, Version 3. BIAcore AB, Piscataway, NJ1997Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis of VEGF binding to KDR-Fc fusions shows that one dimeric ligand binds one dimeric receptor even in the presence of excess VEGF (22Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In keeping with this study, our data points fit well to a simple 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model. Further, the apparent binding stoichiometry = (RU VEGF/RU KDR-Fc) × (M r KDR-Fc/M r VEGF), where RU VEGF represents the level of VEGF bound to the sensor chip surface at saturation, and RU KDR, the level of immobilized receptor. The precise amount of KDR captured on the surface varied 20–30% between experiments. However, in generalizing for KDR(1–7)-Fc, stoichiometry 64 (20/100) × (220/42), i.e.approximately 1:1. Due to experimental optimization, it was not necessary to include mass transport into the calculation. Evaluation of the data with either a 1:1 or 1:1 + mass transfer model resulted in calculation of similar association and dissociation rate constants (data not shown). We evaluated the association rate constant,ka at 3.6 ± 0.07e6 (1/Ms) and the dissociation rate constant kd at 1.34 ± 0.19 e−4 (1/s) (Table I). The dissociation constant (KD) averages at 37.1 pm, which falls within the range of values published in numerous reports using radiolabeled VEGF165 binding to recombinant receptors in vitro. Having defined the conditions required to measure the kinetic parameters, we wished to address whether a monomeric receptor would bind VEGF with the same affinity as the dimerized species. For this purpose, we made recombinant KDR extracellular domain without the Fc tag. For affinity purification purposes, a calmodulin binding peptide tag was added to the C terminus to generate KDR-cbu. Fig.3 shows a representative experiment. Analysis of the data shows that the interactions of VEGF with the receptor monomer are very similar to those seen with a dimeric receptor. Over four experiments, ka averages at 5.23 ± 1.4e6 (1/Ms) and the kdat 2.74 ± 0.76e−4 (1/s); theKD = 51.7 pm (Table I). Since we are working at the lower limits of BIAcore sensitivity, we refrain from performing a statistical analysis on these numbers in order not to over interpret small differences. Our results are consistent with the model for VEGF/receptor interactions presented by the co-crystal structure (21Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar): the contact sites between each receptor monomer with either pole of the VEGF head to tail dimer, are identical. If one VEGF dimer bound to each KDR-cbu captured on the sensor chip surface, then some 50 RU of VEGF would be expected to bind at saturation (KDR-cbu mass = 92 kDa). We were unable to achieve this level. This may be explained by the ability of a VEGF dimer to bind to two receptor monomers and/or the presence of some inactive receptors. It has been reported that heterodimers of VEGF with PlGF can be cross-linked to KDR expressed as a soluble extracellular domain (12Coa Y. Chen H. Zhou L. Chiang M.-K. Anand-Apte B. Weatherbee J.A. Wang Y. Fang F. Flanagan J.G. Tsang M.L.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In order to study the kinetics of this interaction, we had to considerably reduce the flow rate and increase the heterodimer concentrations relative to the studies conducted with VEGF. Fig.4 depicts a representative sensorgram. A downward drift prior to VEGF addition is apparent. This decaying surface, due to receptor dissociation from the protein A surface, occurred sporadically throughout the study. It is likely related to the number of regenerations the surface has been exposed to. Nevertheless, the data can be easily fit with a 1:1 Langmuir model that incorporates drift into the analysis (provided in BIAevaluation 3.0 software). TableI shows that the ka is considerably reduced and the kd is somewhat enhanced. Global analysis of the data reveals a ka of 7.3 ± 1.6e4 (1/Ms) and kd of 4.4 ± 1.2e−4 (1/s); KD = 6 ±1.2 nm. Thus, the nanomolar KD is described by a 50-fold reduction in the rate of association with only an approximate 3-fold increase in the dissociation rate. Surprisingly, under similar conditions to those described above, we were unable to obtain an interaction of the heterodimer with the KDR monomer (Table I, sensorgram not shown). Neither, increasing the VEGF/PlGF concentration 4-fold, nor reducing the flow rate to 5 μl/min for 60 min, nor increasing receptor capture density 10-fold resulted in a detectable interaction (data not shown). This would suggest that the heterodimer would be unable to activate KDR receptors on the cell surface. In order to address this possibility, we performed calcium mobilization studies on HUVECs with VEGF homodimers and VEGF/PlGF heterodimers. Fig. 5(panel A) shows a typical response to VEGF; following a 1-min delay, a rapid and transient rise in intracellular calcium occurs. This is almost completely inhibited by a neutralizing KDR antibody (panel B) showing that KDR is the main receptor through which calcium signals are relayed (28Cunningham S.A. Tran T.M. Arrate M.P. Bjercke R. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 (panel C) shows the very small but perceptible calcium mobilization obtained with the VEGF/PlGF heterodimer. It was necessary to stimulate the cells with a 250-fold increased concentration compared with VEGF in order to obtain a measurable response. That this weak effect was achieved through VEGF/PlGF activating the KDR receptor is shown by a lack of mobilization following cell preincubation with neutralizing KDR antibody (panel D). Based on binding to the predimerized KDR-Fc, one may predict that an equivalent calcium mobilization would occur at VEGF/PlGF concentrations 160-fold greater than VEGF,i.e. at 8 nm. This is clearly not the case. Thus, this cellular assay and the inability of KDR-cbu to interact with VEGF/PlGF suggest that the heterodimer is inefficient at promoting receptor dimerization. Most recently, several reports have described that the first three immunoglobulin-like domains of KDR are sufficient for high affinity VEGF binding (22Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A.

Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further, a neutralizing antibody directed against this region is sufficient to inhibit VEGF-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization. Nevertheless, although the overallKD may be similar, the individual rate constants may vary. In order to assess this, we constructed the first t"

The ABC transporter superfamily (ATP-binding cassette transporters, also called traffic ATPases) comprises prokaryotic and eukaryotic ATP-energized transporters that share a conserved nucleotide-binding domain and have similar architectural organization (1Ames G.F.-L.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ABC transporters have the same overall topological organization, with two hydrophobic domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). In prokaryotes these domains are usually composed of separate protein subunits, whereas in eukaryotes they are usually fused into a single polypeptide.The periplasmic histidine permease is an excellent model system to study the mechanism of action of the ABC transporter superfamily in general. It is composed of a soluble receptor, the periplasmic histidine-binding protein, HisJ, and a four-subunit membrane-bound complex (HisQMP2) composed of HisQ and HisM (the two hydrophobic subunits) and of two identical HisP subunits that carry the highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain (10Ames G.F.-L.

The membrane-bound complex of the histidine permease has been purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes (PLS), and shown to hydrolyze ATP and translocate histidine in a manner that is strictly dependent on the presence of the binding protein (12Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound complex must interact with the liganded soluble receptor in order to achieve translocation (13Ames G.F.-L. Noel K.D. Taber H. Spudich E.N. Nikaido K. Afong J. Ardeshir F. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ames G.F.-L. Lever J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the absence of the binding protein, the complex hydrolyzes ATP at a low rate (intrinsic activity), which is stimulated by the liganded or unliganded binding protein; the level of stimulation is highest when HisJ is liganded (15Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Numerous lines of evidence suggest that ATP binding and hydrolysis is performed by the NBDs, HisP in the case of the histidine permease, with the hydrophobic subunits controlling the rate of hydrolysis. HisP is photolabeled by azido-ATP analogs (16Hobson A.C. Weatherwax R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7333-7337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); mutations in the ATP-binding pocket lose the ability to bind azido-ATP (17Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the membrane complex does not hydrolyze ATP when depleted of HisP, and hydrolysis is resumed after purified HisP is reconstituted back into the complex (18Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and purified soluble HisP hydrolyzes ATP in the absence of HisQ and HisM (19Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The recent resolution of the three-dimensional structure of HisP at 1.5 Å clearly shows the presence of an ATP-binding pocket containing an ATP molecule (20Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).HisP has a hydrophilic sequence, yet it is tightly associated with the membrane; however, it behaves neither like a classical integral membrane protein nor like a peripheral membrane protein (21Kerppola R.E. Shyamala V.K. Klebba P. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9857-9865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HisP is accessible to proteases and impermeant biotinylating reagents from both the cytoplasmic and the periplasmic sides of the membrane, indicating that it spans the lipid bilayer (22Baichwal V. Liu D. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This membrane-spanning property has also been demonstrated for other ABC transporters, such as MalK (23Schneider E. Hunke S. Tebbe S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5364-5367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ATP-binding domain of CFTR (24Ko Y.H. Delannoy M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5053-5064Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Gruis D.B. Price E.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7739-7745Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and KpsT (26Bliss J.M. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the hydrophilic sequence of HisP, its membrane-spanning properties are likely to depend on a close interaction with the integral membrane subunits, HisQ and HisM (HisQM), with the strength of this interaction being important for regulating its ATPase activity. In this respect, there is evidence that HisQ and HisM are involved in the transmission of the transmembrane signal initiated by the soluble periplasmic receptor, HisJ, and in the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by HisP (18Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,27Petronilli V. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16293-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Physical contact between HisJ and HisQ has been demonstrated by chemical cross-linking experiments (28Ames G.F.L. Liu C.E. Joshi A.K. Nikaido K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Direct contact between HisP and HisJ is not expected and was not found.Permease mutations in the ATP-binding subunit (HisP*) were characterized that allow ligand translocation (29Ames G.F.-L. Spudich E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1877-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Speiser D.M. Ames G.F.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ATP hydrolysis in the absence of the binding protein (27Petronilli V. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16293-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating an altered signaling mechanism. To understand further these mechanisms and their regulation during a functional cycle, the biochemical properties of these HisP* mutants were analyzed in detail, and several novel characteristics were defined. HisQMP*2 complexes have a looser structure, with the mutant HisP* being “disengaged” from HisQM; they have lower affinity for ADP than the wild type; and their ATPase activity displays no cooperativity for ATP. Based on these observations, we propose a mechanistic model for ATP hydrolysis and ligand translocation which may be applicable to other ABC transporters.DISCUSSIONWe show that the interaction between the ATP-binding subunit (HisP) and the integral transmembrane subunits (HisQ and HisM) is weaker in mutant HisQMP*2 complexes than in the wild type, indicating that the integrity of the complex is compromised by these mutations. We refer to this phenomenon as “disengagement of HisP from HisQM.” Concomitantly, these mutant complexes display a higher rate of constitutive ATP hydrolysis. The behavior of these mutant HisP*s resembles that of peripheral membrane proteins, so that they could be viewed as interaction mutants. Such a notion is consistent with the recent resolution of the crystal structure of HisP, which was shown to have an “L” shape, with two separate arms: arm I is mostly dedicated to forming the ATP-binding pocket, whereas arm II is likely to form the domain that interacts physically with HisQM (20Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The formation of the correct quaternary structure of the complex would be expected to be dependent upon the nature of the interaction between arm II of HisP and HisQM. Such a quaternary structure is likely to be essential not only for the correct enzymatic activity of the complex but also for creating the signaling pathway that regulates its ATPase activity. The fact that all of the mutations considered in this paper, which simultaneously result in a looser complex structure and in signal-independent ATPase activity, are clustered and located in arm II is consistent with the idea that arm II interacts with HisQM and that the mutated residues are involved either directly or indirectly in an interaction with HisQ and/or HisM.If the hypothesis of an interaction between arm II and HisQM is correct, it should be possible to identify mutants in arm II that have completely eliminated the interaction between HisP and HisQM, resulting in a complex that is altogether unable to insert into the membrane. Mutants of this type are likely to exist but would have gone unrecognized through our selection procedures because they would be inactive in transport activity. It is worthwhile stressing the fact that all of the mutations analyzed here had been isolated with the requirement that transport activity be maintained (in the absence of the periplasmic binding protein). Thus, they all have modified the function of the complex but have not inactivated it. It also should be mentioned that mutations with properties equivalent to those of HisP* mutants but located in the hydrophobic subunits should also exist. Likely candidates indeed have been identified both in HisQ 4G. F.-L. Ames, unpublished results. and in the hydrophobic components of the maltose permease (38Covitz K.M. Panagiotidis C.H. Hor L.I. Reyes M. Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1752-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The observation that HisP* is disengaged has important implications for the mechanism of ATPase activation. ATP hydrolysis by HisP during the transport cycle is regulated by HisQ and HisM through a balanced counterforce of stimulation and suppression (15Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). HisQM, through its physical association with HisP, would exercise such a dual role and regulate the ATPase activity, thus preventing useless ATP consumption and promoting a swift response when a ligand is presented. During a cycle of ATP hydrolysis, HisQ and HisM may alternate between an activating and a suppressing mode, with HisQM assuming the activating mode when liganded HisJ is present and the suppressing mode in the absence of HisJ. The fact that a tight complex structure is associated with low ATPase activity suggests that engagement of HisP leads to suppression of the ATPase. Such a suppression (when the complex is in the resting stage, see below) could be exercised in a variety of ways. HisP might come in direct contact with phospholipids that inhibit the ATPase activity (19Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or its nucleotide-binding pocket may be disrupted or not be fully accessible, or HisQM might increase the affinity for ADP, thus slowing down the rate of ADP release (HisQMP2 indeed has higher affinity for ADP than soluble HisP, with IC50 values of 0.1 versus 0.7 mm ADP, respectively).The proposed cycle of membrane disengagement/reengagement is reminiscent of SecA, the E. coli translocation ATPase, which undergoes ATP-dependent membrane insertion and deinsertion (39Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, ATP binding and hydrolysis have been modeled to achieve different goals in the process of membrane cycling. Upon ATP hydrolysis, SecA releases the preprotein peptide and deinserts from the membrane, whereas in the case of HisP, ATP binding causes the disengagement of HisP and reengagement occurs after hydrolysis. The fundamental difference between HisP and SecA may be related to the difference in transport direction: SecA translocates peptides from inside to outside (39Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 40Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5827-5833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), whereas the histidine permease translocates substrate from outside to inside.The fact that the ATPase activity of wild type HisQMP2shows positive cooperativity for ATP, whereas that of the HisQMP* mutants does not, provides some insight into the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. Since such cooperativity is observed both for the HisJ-stimulated and intrinsic activities (15Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it must be independent of HisJ signaling. Because mutant HisQMP*2 is already disengaged in the absence of ATP and shows no cooperativity for ATP, the positive cooperativity observed for the wild type may be explained by an initial binding of ATP to a low affinity site that induces HisP disengagement, with the disengaged complex subsequently binding the second ATP with higher affinity. It is also relevant that HisP dimer in the soluble form, which can be viewed as fully disengaged, also shows no cooperativity (19Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The two identical HisP molecules within a complex may acquire different ATP-binding and -hydrolyzing properties because of an asymmetric interaction with the two different subunits, HisQ and HisM. It should be noted, however, that the two cooperative binding sites could also be one in HisQ and the other in one of the HisP subunits, since HisQ is known to bind ATP (16Hobson A.C. Weatherwax R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7333-7337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,42Ames G.F. Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Shyamala V. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 1-47PubMed Google Scholar). 5V. Shyamala and G. F.-L. Ames, unpublished data. The lack of cooperativity in HisQMP*2 is in contrast with the results presented in the equivalent type of binding protein-independent mutants in the maltose system, which retain cooperativity (43Davidson A.L. Laghaeian S.S. Mannering D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4858-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. It is possible, although we consider it unlikely, that the two permeases differ in the mechanism of transport; alternatively, the fact that the mutations causing constitutivity occur in a hydrophobic subunit in the maltose system and in the ATP-binding subunit in the histidine system might result in different behavior.Although HisP disengagement appears to be a priming mechanism for ATPase activation, it is not sufficient to activate ATP hydrolysis. The presence of ATP alone disengages wild type HisP but does not result in ATP hydrolysis in the absence of HisJ. Hydrolysis is not necessary for disengagement because several mutant complexes that bind ATP normally, but cannot hydrolyze it, display an ATP-induced disengagement (as measured by urea extraction) identical to that of wild type HisP (data not shown). Although HisJ stimulates ATP hydrolysis, it was not found to induce HisP disengagement by itself. Soluble HisP (i.e.fully disengaged) does not hydrolyze ATP at a rate as high as its potential, i.e. as high as that of fully stimulated HisQMP2 (19Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be other events or determining factors regulating the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the wild type complex. The fact that soluble HisP* mutants hydrolyze ATP at a higher rate than soluble wild type HisP (Table II) suggests that this other factor(s) reflects an intrinsic property of HisP. A possible factor is suggested by the finding that the mutants have a poorer affinity for ADP than the wild type, both in the soluble and complex form (Table II); thus, their higher level of ATP hydrolysis may result from an accelerated rate of ADP release.In light of our results, we propose a revised model for binding protein-dependent ABC transporters (Fig.9). In the resting stage (stage I) HisP is engaged and inactive. Upon binding ATP, the complex assumes a different quaternary structure, in which the ATP-binding subunit becomes loosely attached (disengaged; stage II). ATP hydrolysis follows upon signaling by the soluble receptor, which alters the conformation of HisQM (stage III), followed by the opening of a passageway within the complex thus allowing substrate translocation (stage IV). In stage II, despite disengagement of HisP, ATP is hydrolyzed at a low rate (intrinsic ATPase activity), because HisQM is still in the suppression mode and HisP has a high affinity for ADP, which is therefore released slowly. In stage III, the liganded binding protein converts HisQM to an activating mode, which enables rapid ADP release. HisQMP*2mutants already have a disengaged structure in the resting stage, in which HisP* mimics stage III of the wild type even in the absence of the binding protein and with HisQM in the stage I/II conformation. These mutants are always in a primed state for hydrolysis, because HisP* is constantly in an activated form and has a lower affinity for ADP.Although this model provides a mechanism specific for the binding protein-dependent ABC transporters, these results could be extrapolated to other members of the superfamily. This may be particularly true because the structure of the HisQMP2* mutants is reminiscent of that of eukaryotic ABC transporters in that neither relies on a soluble receptor for ATP hydrolysis and transport. In this respect it is interesting to compare the properties of HisQMP*2 mutants with those of the most common mutation, ΔPhe-508, in CFTR in which a phenylalanine residue (Phe-508 in NBD1) has been deleted. Upon alignment of the sequence of CFTR with that of HisP, Phe-508 is found to be located in a position in the crystal structure very similar to that of the HisP* mutants described here (20Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is that ΔPhe-508 is defective in the interaction between NBD1 and its respective hydrophobic domain(s), and as a consequence its overall folded structure is incorrect. This proposal is compatible with the finding that among the characteristics of ΔPhe-508 are its inability to reach its final site of action and the fact that the defect can be obviated by protein-stabilizing conditions, such as the presence of glycerol or growing the cells producing ΔPhe-508 at low temperature (44Cheng S.H.

Presumably, the formation of a defective folded structure during CFTR synthesis affects its insertion into the membrane and results in mislocation of the protein. It should be stressed that the defect of ΔPhe-508 is not in its activity and that this situation is similar to that of HisP* mutants which, although defective in the structure of the complex, are still functional in ATP hydrolysis and transport (27Petronilli V.

The ABC transporter superfamily (ATP-binding cassette transporters, also called traffic ATPases) comprises prokaryotic and eukaryotic ATP-energized transporters that share a conserved nucleotide-binding domain and have similar architectural organization (1Ames G.F.-L.

The equilibrium dialysis experiments reveal that the drug binds cooperatively to both the chromatin fractions and to the DNA counterpart within the range of ionic strength used in this study. A significant decrease in the binding affinity was observed at 75 mm NaCl. At any given salt concentration, daunomycin exhibits higher binding affinity for DNA than for linker histone-depleted chromatin or chromatin (in decreasing order). Binding of daunomycin to DNA does not significantly affect the sedimentation coefficient of the molecule. This is in contrast to binding to chromatin and to its linker histone-depleted counterpart.

Daunomycin is an anthracycline antibiotic widely used as a potent chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of various cancers (1Arcamone F. Doxorubicin: Anticancer Antibiotics.

The structure of this pharmacologically active drug consists of two distinct domains (Fig.1): a planar aglycon chromophore that intercalates between adjacent base pairs of DNA and an amino sugar ring that lies in the minor groove of the DNA double helix (3Quigley G.J.

JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 141-167Google Scholar). However, in the cell, DNA does not exist as a naked structure but is associated with histones and other nuclear proteins in a complex that is known as chromatin (12Kornberg R.D. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 13van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Thus, chromatin, not DNA, is the major target for daunomycin in vivo. How the presence of chromosomal proteins might modulate the binding of this drug to DNA and how in turn chromatin structure is affected by the binding of the drug are important questions that need to answered to understand the biological mechanism of action of daunomycin. Although several attempts in this direction have already been carried out using isolated nucleosome (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Pearlman L.F. Chuang R.Y. Israel D. Simpkins H. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 341-346PubMed Google Scholar) and crude chromatin fractions (16Zunino F. Dimarco A. Zaccara A. Ganbetta R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 607: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Sen D. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Rabbani A. Davoodi J. Gen. Pharmcol. 1994; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the mechanism of daunomycin binding to chromatin and the conformational transitions involved are still poorly understood. In this paper we report several experiments designed to address these questions in more detail. We have studied the ionic strength dependence of the binding of daunomycin to a well defined fraction of chicken erythrocyte chromatin consisting of an average number of 43 nucleosomes. The results are compared with those obtained with the same chromatin fraction upon depletion of linker histones and with the purified constitutive DNA counterpart. Chicken blood was obtained from a slaughter house (Lilydale, Victoria, BC, Canada) and processed immediately after collection as described below. Micrococcal nuclease was obtained from Worthington. CM-Sephadex C-25 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Daunomycin hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions of this drug were prepared in sterile distilled water at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and stored at 20 °C until further use. Dilutions of the drug stocks in the appropriate buffers were prepared immediately before use, and the concentration of daunomycin was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 11,500 m−1 cm−1 at 480 nm. Chicken erythrocyte nuclei were prepared as described elsewhere (19Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The nuclear suspension at anA 260 = 120 was digested with 6 units of micrococcal nuclease/ml at 37 °C for 5 min. After digestion, the suspension was brought to 10 mm ETDA on ice and was immediately centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), and the nuclei were lysed by gently stirring at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the chromatin in the supernatant was fractionated by centrifugation using 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradients in 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA. Centrifugation was carried out in a SW28 Beckman rotor at 82,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. One-ml fractions were collected, and their absorbance at 260 nm was determined. After analysis of the DNA size distribution of the different fractions by agarose gel electrophoresis, the fractions of interest were combined and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C. A protease inhibitor mixture (“Complete” from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then added (1 tablet/100 ml), and the sample was stored on ice until further use. Histone H1 depletion was carried out as described previously (20Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, chromatin was prepared as described above and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm NaCl. 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, concentrated with a Centriprep 50 concentrator (Amicon Inc.) and loaded onto a (3 × 15 cm) CM-Sephadex C25 column that had been pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 6 ml/h at 4 °C, and the fractions of the H1-stripped chromatin peak were pooled together and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. The dialysate was treated with a mixture of protease inhibitors (“Complete”) as described above and stored on ice. DNA was obtained by proteinase K digestion (1 μg of enzyme/10 μg of DNA) of the chromatin samples described above. After digestion at 37 °C for 3–4 h, the DNA was extracted first with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylic alcohol (25:24:1 v/v) followed by a chloroform:isoamylic alcohol (24:1 v/v) extraction. The DNA from the aqueous phase was then ethanol-precipitated at −20 °C, and the precipitate was rinsed with 70% ethanol, centrifuged, air-dried, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 12,824 m−1cm−1 at 260 nm. Agarose (1–1.2% w/v) gel electrophoresis was carried out in 45 mm Tris-borate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) buffer according to Maniatis et al. (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar). Native 4% polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair; S, Svedberg units; s 20,w, coefficient corrected to standard conditions (20 °C and water).for DNA analysis were performed as described by Yager and van Holde (22Yager T.D. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4212-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic analysis of proteins was carried out on SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Chromatin, H1-depleted chromatin, and their corresponding DNA at 40–45 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA plus NaCl were dialyzed against the same buffer containing increasing amounts of daunomycin. Three concentrations of NaCl were analyzed: 5, 25, and 75 mm. Dialysis was carried out at 4 °C using Spectra/Por 2 (Spectrum companies). Equilibrium was reached within 72 h with no detectable binding of drug to the membrane. The concentration of free drug (c f) in the dialysate was measured directly from the absorbance at 480 nm. Binding parameters were determined from the plot of r/c f versus raccording to Scatchard method (24Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar), where r is the ratio of bound drug to total base pair concentration, and c fis the amount of free drug. In this representation, n (the apparent number of binding sites), is the intercept of the linear region of the binding curve with the horizontal axis, and K(apparent binding constant) corresponds to the negative value of the slope of the curve. For the sedimentation velocity analysis, the chromatin, linker histone-depleted chromatin, and DNA samples at the desired salt concentration (5, 25, or 75 mmNaCl) in Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 0.2 mm EDTA were mixed with different amounts of drug in the same ionic strength buffer, so that in all cases the same final concentration corresponded to 43 ± 2 μg/ml, as determined from the absorbance at 260 nm (A 260 = 0.86 ± 0.04). The input ratior i (mol of drug/mol of bp) can then be calculated from r i =c D·M bp/c s·M D, where c D = concentration of daunomycin (μg/ml),c s = concentration of sample (μg/ml),m b = molecular weight of a base pair (663), andM D = molecular weight of daunomycin (527). Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an aluminum An-55 rotor and double sector aluminum-filled Epon centerpieces. All runs were routinely performed at 20 °C. The boundaries were analyzed according to the method of van Holde and Weischet (25van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using an XL-A Ultra Scan-origin version 2.93 sedimentation data analysis software (B. Demeler, Missoula, MT). To estimate the average number of nucleosomes of the chromatin samples, the sedimentation coefficient distribution of the corresponding DNA was determined as described elsewhere (26Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the molecular weight was estimated using the following empirical equations 20,w = 2.68 + 1.263 × 10−2m0.455 (27Rinehart F.P. Hearst J.E. Biopolymers. 1971; 10: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To calculate the average number of nucleosomes, an average nucleosome repeat length of 210 bp was used for chicken erythrocyte chromatin (13van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The major goal of this paper is the characterization of the interactions of daunomycin with chromatin. We have specifically looked at the individual role played by the core and linker histones. To this purpose, we used a well defined chromatin fraction from chicken erythrocytes that either contained the full native complement of linker histones (histones H1 and H5) or had been artificially depleted of them. The binding of daunomycin to either fraction under different ionic strengths was analyzed and compared with that of their constitutive DNA under the same conditions. Fig.2 shows the biochemical composition of these chromatin samples in terms of their constitutive DNA (Fig.2 A) or protein (Fig. 2 B) counterparts. Fig.2 C displays the salt-dependent folding characteristics of the chromatin fraction used in comparison to its constitutive DNA, as analyzed by sedimentation velocity analysis in the ultracentrifuge. The sedimentation coefficients of chromatin and linker histone-depleted chromatin increase with the ionic strength. Such an increase is because of the folding of the chromatin fiber (20Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The extent of this increase depends on the presence (26Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or the absence (20Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of linker histones. The salt dependence of the sedimentation coefficient observed for the chromatin fraction before and after stripping of the linker histones is in agreement with earlier results (26Ausió J.

Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) corresponds to a chromatin fraction with an average nucleosome number of N w = 43. The binding isotherms obtained from equilibrium dialysis experiments under different ionic conditions for the binding of daunomycin to chicken erythrocyte chromatin containing or lacking linker histones, in comparison to those of its constitutive DNA, are shown in Fig. 3. In 5 mm sodium chloride, all samples exhibit a cooperative binding behavior, as illustrated by the positive slope observed in the low r regions of the binding isotherms (see Fig.3 A). The curves reach a maximum at a value r= 0.1 (DNA), r = 0.22 (linker histone-depleted chromatin), and r = 0.34 (linker histone-containing chromatin). A decreasing slope is observed at higher rvalues. DNA and linker histone-depleted chromatin exhibit similar, albeit not identical, binding isotherms in contrast to chromatin that shows lower r/c f values and a higherr max and which are indicative of a much lower binding affinity of daunomycin in the later case. Indeed, the binding constant (K) of chromatin 4.6 × 104m-'1 is relatively lower than that of the linker histone-depleted (K = 6.4 × 104m−1) or DNA (K= 7.7 × 104m−1) counterparts. The higher binding affinity of daunomycin by free DNA is consistent with early data (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Cera C. Palu G. Marciani Magno S. Palumbo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When the ionic strength is increased to 75 mm sodium chloride (Fig. 3 C), the Scatchard plots still retain their positive cooperativity; however, the r/c f is reduced considerably compared with 5 mm (Fig. 3 A) or 25 mm (Fig.3 B) salt conditions, indicating an overall decrease in the binding affinity of daunomycin at this ionic strength. Indeed, the binding constants for daunomycin experience a significant decrease, which affects the chromatin fractions. The values calculated wereK = 5 × 104m−1 for naked DNA, 1.98 × 104m−1 for linker histone-depleted chromatin, and 1.76 × 104m−1 for chromatin. In parallel with the equilibrium experiments, we also carried out a sedimentation velocity analysis of the binding of daunomycin to chromatin. We have chosen the range of ionic strength from 5 to 75 mm NaCl because chromatin and its linker histone-depleted counterpart exhibit a well established pattern of folding under these conditions (26Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as monitored by sedimentation velocity analysis. Therefore any perturbation in the hydrodynamic parameters of the chromatin sample arising from titration with the drug under these conditions must reflect changes in their intrinsic conformation and folding. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The sedimentation behavior of DNA seems to be affected relatively little by the binding of daunomycin under any of the ionic strengths analyzed. Upon increasing the drug concentration, a consistent small decrease in s 20,w is observed that is almost within the experimental error limits of the technique. In contrast, the chromatin counterparts exhibit a bimodal trend in which the sedimentation coefficients first decrease upon initial binding of the drug followed by an increase and aggregation upon further binding. Thus it appears that histones and their hierarchical folding of DNA in the chromatin fiber are responsible for this hydrodynamic and aggregation behavior. In the case of chromatin containing the full complement of linker histones this bimodal transition is more pronounced at the highest salt concentration studied (75 mmNaCl) (see Fig. 4 D), i.e. when chromatin, to be titrated with the drug, is in its naturally folded state. A decrease in the sedimentation coefficient of the sample without changes in its molecular/chemical composition reflects a conformational transition in which the sample becomes more extended (unfolded) as the sedimentation coefficient decreases, or it becomes more compact (folded) as this value increases. Linker histones are dynamically associated to chromatin and are known to be very mobile at ionic strengths above 25 mm NaCl (31Caron F. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 513-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To ensure that no histone H1/H5 was lost during the drug titration, we analyzed the histone composition of some of the chromatin precipitates, see Fig. 5. As seen in Fig.5 A, the stoichiometric amount of linker histones (histone H1 and H5) relative to the core histones remained the same at each salt concentration and at the drug concentration(s) responsible for the aggregation. Furthermore, the relative stoichiometry of the core histone (histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) also stayed constant both in chromatin (Fig. 5 A) and in the linker histone-depleted counterparts (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that no significant selective displacement of histone H2A-H2B dimers by the drug (32McMurray C.T. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8472-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) had taken place before aggregation occurred. It is important to point out here that the input ratio r i (mol of drug/mol of bp) at which the folding transition and aggregation occurred, decreased with the salt and with the presence of linker histones (see Fig. 4). However, even at the lowest salt (5 mm) and in the absence of linker histone, precipitation took place at r i ≤ 1. Daunomycin is an anthracycline antibiotic that binds to the DNA by forming a complex in which the aglycon chromophore intercalates between DNA base pairs (4Wang A.H.J. Ughetto G. Quigley G.J. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 33Di Marco A. Arcamone F. Zunino F. Antibiotics. Springer-VerlagNew York Inc., Berlin1974Google Scholar, 34Neidle S. Prog. Med. Chem. 1979; 16: 151-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the amino sugar (see Fig. 1) that lies in the minor groove without forming any bonds to DNA (4Wang A.H.J. Ughetto G. Quigley G.J. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), although eventually it may also form covalent adducts with DNA (36Phillips D.R. White R.J. Cullinane C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Zeman S.M. Phillips D.R. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11561-11565Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The results of the equilibrium dialysis experiments in Fig. 3 are in agreement with earlier data on the binding of daunomycin to different DNAs using phase-partitioning techniques (9Graves D.E. Krugh T.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3941-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). They are in disagreement with the work from Crothers and co-workers, who found no cooperativity of binding for either DNA (8Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3933-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) or calf thymus nucleosomes (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); however, different techniques of analysis and different experimental conditions were used. Consistent with our data, however, their studies have also shown that binding of daunomycin to 175 bp (histone H1-depleted) of nucleosomes is strongly reduced relative to its affinity for free DNA (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Their findings also agree with our results that the affinity of daunomycin for different nucleo-histone complexes increases in the following order: nucleosome core particle < 175 bp nucleosome < DNA (38Fritzsche H. Wähnert U. Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Schlessinger R.B. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus it appears as if the affinity of the drug for the chromatin complexes decreases with the decrease of the number of base pairs in the DNA region flanking the DNA coils protected by the histone octamer. A salt-dependent decrease on the affinity of binding was also observed in earlier chromatin studies (16Zunino F. Dimarco A. Zaccara A. Ganbetta R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 607: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At low salt (5 mm NaCl) and in the absence of drug (see Fig. 4 A), the linker histone-depleted fraction sediments with an s 20,w = 53 S as compared withs 20,w = 78 S for the chromatin-containing linker histones. The former corresponds to a polynucleosome fiber in which approximately 145 bp of DNA are wrapped around each histone octamer, and these are interconnected by extended DNA linker regions of approximately 65 bp (20Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the ionic strength of the medium increases, the nucleosome particles come close together with an important part of the linker DNA regions sequestered between the closely packed histone octamers. In the case of the chromatin fraction containing a full complement of linker histones, the sedimentation coefficient at low salt is close to that of the linker histone-depleted counterpart at high salt (39Howe L. Iskandar M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11625-11629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, in this instance, the polynucleosome fiber at low salt has a three-dimensional zigzag organization (40Leuba S.H. Yang G. Robert C. Samori B. van Holde K.E. Zlanatova J. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11621-11625Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 41Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Grigoryev S.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Kohster A.H. Woodcock C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) in which approximately 145 bp of DNA interact with the histone octamer, and an extra 20–30 bp adopt a stem-like (42Hamiche A. Schultz P. Ramakrishnan V. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) structure as a result of interaction with the linker histones. This zigzag arrangement persists as the ionic strength increases to yield a compact fiber (40Leuba S.H. Yang G. Robert C. Samori B. van Holde K.E. Zlanatova J. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11621-11625Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 41Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Grigoryev S.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Kohster A.H. Woodcock C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) in which the extended linker DNA regions and the nucleosomes are closely packed together. Upon interaction with daunomycin, the sedimentation coefficient of the linker histone-depleted chromatin exhibits a similar pattern in all three ionic strengths (5, 25, and 75 mm NaCl) analyzed (see Fig. 4). At each salt concentration, the sedimentation coefficient initially decreases as the drug concentration increases. However, at a certain drug concentration, which is smaller at higher ionic strength, the trend changes, and the sedimentation coefficient increases in anticipation of the aggregation and precipitation of the sample, that also takes place at higher drug concentrations for the lower ionic strengths. This fact is indicative of a preferential interaction of daunomycin with linker DNA, as the amount of exposed linker DNA decreases with increasing ionic strength because of the concomitant folding of the chromatin fibers described above. This result is in agreement with the strong preference of daunomycin for free DNAversus nucleosomal DNA (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The initial decrease ins 20,w observed at the different ionic strengths corresponds to the intercalation of the drug with this linker region. Such intercalation results in alterations of the linker twist, which affect the way in which the fiber is folded (43Krajewski W.A. Ausió J. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 14: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), bringing it to a more extended open conformation, in which some of the histone domains are able to establish cross-links with adjacent fibers (18Rabbani A. Davoodi J. Gen. Pharmcol. 1994; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (reflected by a small increase in s 20,w), and this eventually leads to a complete aggregation of the sample. The decrease in the sedimentation coefficient as a result of the drug interactions with DNA could also be partly ascribed to an unfolding of the nucleosome core particle (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which can occur at extremely low ionic strengths (see Ref. 13van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar for a review). It could also be that stiffening of the linker DNA because of the drug intercalation leads to partial dissociation of the DNA-flanking regions at the entry and exit points to the nucleosome core particle. Although our data does not allow us to distinguish between either model, we prefer the last, as subnucleosome core particles with DNA smaller that 125 bp tend to aggregate (44Tatchell K. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2871-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the linker histone-containing chromatin, the number of binding sites are reduced, as part of the linker DNA is occupied by linker histones. Furthermore, the extent of unfolding of the fiber is even more dramatic and occurs over a narrower range at 25 and 75 mm NaCl. This is consistent with the highest compaction of these chromatin fibers at these salt concentrations and also with the more rigid nucleosomal structure organization imposed by the interaction of the linker histones with the linker DNA (42Hamiche A. Schultz P. Ramakrishnan V. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast with previous chromatin studies, our results do not need to invoke any salt-induced alteration in the DNA conformation (16Zunino F. Dimarco A. Zaccara A. Ganbetta R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 607: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which is very unlikely to occur at these relatively low ionic strengths. Our results also indicate that daunomycin has a destabilizing rather that inhibiting (17Sen D. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) effect on chromatin folding. Our results are consistent with the early interpretation by Chaireset al. (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) on the in vivo significance of thein vitro data. Accordingly, it is probable that daunomycin recognizes and exerts its primary action on those regions of chromatin that are more unfolded and have a reduced number of nucleosome structures, such as found in transcription or replication active domains. Also, the aggregation behavior observed in vitrocould account for the in vivo cytological effects of the drug observed in HeLa cells (14Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Dorigotti L. Tumori. 1964; 50: 117-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1983520152,"Antigen recognition through T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex transduces signals into T cells, which regulate activation, function, and differentiation of T cells. The TCR-CD3 complex is composed of two signaling modules represented by CD3ζ and CD3e. Signaling through CD3ζ has been extensively analyzed, but that via CD3e, which is also crucial in immature thymocyte development, is still not clearly understood. We isolated cDNA encoding a novel CD3e-binding protein CAST. CAST specifically interacts in vivo and in vitro with CD3e but not with CD3ζ or FcRγ via a unique membrane-proximal region of CD3e. CAST is composed of 512 amino acids including a single tyrosine and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation. Overexpression of two dominant-negative types of CAST, a minimum CD3e-binding domain and a tyrosine-mutant, strongly suppressed NFAT activation and interleukin-2 production. These results demonstrate that CAST serves as a component of preformed TCR complex and transduces activation signals upon TCR stimulation and represents a new signaling pathway via the CD3e-containing TCR signaling module."

Muscle contracts when a molecular motor protein, myosin, hydrolyzes MgATP and uses the energy so released to pull past filaments of its partner protein, actin. Although the mechanism of contraction appears to be broadly similar between muscle types, the way in which it is controlled is not. The universal trigger for contraction is a rise in the intracellular free calcium concentration, but the way in which this is sensed and the way in which the message is transmitted to the active site of myosin varies considerably (see Refs. 1Szent-Györgyi A.G.

The ELC of vertebrate striated muscle exist in two isoforms: alkali 1 (A1)-like and alkali 2 (A2)-like (6Frank G. Weeds A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 7Wagner P.D. Weeds A.G. J. Mol Biol. 1977; 109: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and the presence of one, or the other, isoform appears to fine tune the contractile properties of the myosin molecule carrying it. This effect has been demonstrated in single muscle fibers (8Bottinelli R. Betto R. Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), in in vitro motility assays (9Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20414-20418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in enzyme assays (10Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), where experiments are generally carried out with the more biochemically amenable myosin subfragment 1 (S1, a soluble, proteolytic fragment of myosin that retains the actin binding and MgATPase activities of the intact molecule). S1 prepared by chymotryptic digestion carries only one ELC and a fragment of the heavy chain (10Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Thus, there are two possible S1 isoenzymes, S1(A1) and S1(A2), depending on which ELC isoform is associated with the heavy chain. Recent mutagenesis studies have established that the extreme N-terminal residues of A1-type ELCs (which differ from A2-like ELCs by having 40-odd additional amino acid residues at the N terminus) encode an actin binding site. We have shown by deletion mutagenesis studies that the site lies within the first 11 residues and that actin binding by these residues results directly in modulation of the kinetic properties of S1 (11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The remaining residues of the N-terminal extension of A1-type ELCs are highly proline-rich and form an extended structure (12Bhandari D.G. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Yeadon M.E. Eur. J.

This has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis where these residues have been substituted and the mutants tested for their ability to cross-link to actin and their effects on K m and k catof the actin-activated ATPase of S1 hybrids. Removal of the positive charge at position 3 and 4 gave a kinetic phenotype that was more S1(A2)-like than the wild-type hybrid (which is S1(A1)-like; Ref. 11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur.

These studies show that the k cat is directly controlled by the apparent K m for actin, further supporting the view that actin binding by A1-type ELCs result directly in kinetic modulation of the myosin motor. All mutant proteins were expressed from plasmids derived from the T7-based overexpression vector pET-11c (18Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Duhn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction (19Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar) was used to amplify the HmAtELC cDNA (kindly supplied to us by Dr. A. Starzinski-Powitz, Universität Frankfurt Klinikum, Senckenberg Zentrum Pathologie, D-6000, Frankfurt, Germany) in the vector pUC-19, and the various mutations were introduced by using different 5′ oligonucleotide primers that incorporated changes in the appropriate codons. In all cases the primers were designed so as to introduce an NdeI restriction enzyme site 5′ to the coding sequence and a BamHI site 3′ to it. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with these two enzymes and the product of this reaction ligated into NdeI/BamHI-cut pET-11c. Plasmids containing these inserts were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein overexpression as described previously for the wild-type HmAtELC (13Timson D.J. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Overexpression was monitored by comparing the SDS-PAGE profiles of cell extracts from cells before and after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside The sequence of all mutant ELC constructs were verified by double stranded dideoxynucleotide sequencing (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal sequence checked by amino acid sequencing. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the first 10 residues of the wild-type and mutant proteins were: HmAtELC, APKKPEPKKE … ; HmAtELC(A1V), VPKKPEPKKE … ; HmAtELC(K4R), APKRPEPKKE … ; HmAtELC(K4A), APKAPEPKKE … ; HmAtELC(K4D), APKDPEPKKE … ; HmAtELC(K3A), APAKPEPKKE … Unless otherwise stated, all protein manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Actin was prepared from muscle acetone powder according to standard techniques (21Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was stored as G-actin freeze-dried from buffer A (5 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm calcium chloride, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol) at −20 °C until required. F-actin was prepared from this as described in Ref. 11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar. Chymotryptic myosin S1 was prepared according to the method of Weeds and Taylor (10Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) except that SP-Tris Acryl™ (IBF Biotechnics, France) was used to separate the isoenzymes (S1(A1) and S1(A2)) (22Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5718-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the purified isoenzymes were shell frozen at −80 °C in the presence of 4 mg of sucrose/mg of S1 and 2 mm dithiothreitol and stored at −70 °C until required. Recombinant ELCs were purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exactly as described previously for the wild-type HmAtELC (11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar,13Timson D.J. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified ELCs were stored as freeze-dried powders at −20 °C until required. The effect of each mutation on the steady state MgATPase kinetics of S1 was assessed by hybridizing the light chain into rabbit skeletal S1(A2) using the ammonium chloride dissociation method (7Wagner P.D. Weeds A.G. J. Mol Biol. 1977; 109: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) as modified in Ref.23Ueno H. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and using SP-Tris Acryl to separate the mutant hybrid from the residual S1(A2) (11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J.

Hybrids were concentrated by precipitation in 70% (mass/volume) ammonium sulfate before being taken up in about 1 ml 5 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed against this buffer overnight. In order that control experiments with rabbit skeletal S1(A1) and S1(A2) would match closely as possible the experiments with hybrid S1, material for controls was obtained by pooling the residual S1(A1) and S1(A2) in hybridization experiments. The synthesis of peptides representing the N-terminal 10 residues of rabbit skeletal A1-type ELC 1–10, NH3+-APKKDVKKPA-CONH2; 1–6, NH3+-APKKDV-CONH2; and 5–10, N-acetyl-DVKKPA-CONH2, was carried out by Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom They were synthesized by standard Fmoc-protected solid phase methods and were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Their purity was confirmed by protein sequencing and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and their concentrations determined by amino acid analysis. MgATPase activities were determined by measuring phosphate release (24Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar) in a stopped enzyme assay at 25 °C. Various concentrations of F-actin (in buffer A supplemented with 2.0 mm magnesium chloride; the amount of supplemented buffer A plus F-actin solution was kept constant at 40 μl/ml of assay mix) were mixed with mutant hybrid S1s (concentrations of which varied between 0.04 and 0.17 μm) in 5 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was initiated by addition of magnesium chloride to 2.5 mm and ATP to 2.0 mm and then processed and analyzed as described in Ref.11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar. The procedure used for cross-linking ELCs to actin was based on Ref. 25Andreev O.A. Borejdo J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14829-14833Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar as detailed in Ref. 11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar. The 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)-cross-linked products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and identified on the basis of their size and by comparison to previously assigned bands (11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Timson D.J. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). S1 hybrids were cross-linked to actin using a similar protocol except that S1:actin molar ratios were typically 1:4, since increasing the saturation of F-actin with S1 decreases the amount of ELC-actin product (25Andreev O.A. Borejdo J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14829-14833Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All 1H NMR experiments were collected on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer. For one-dimensional binding titration experiments, the solution conditions were 500 μm peptide, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm DSS, pH 7.2, at 285 K, with ratios of added F-actin varied between 30:1 and 5:1. Binding was monitored by standard one-dimensional experiments (data not shown) and by Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiments with a single spin echo (90°-τ-180°-τ) and a 60-ms refocusing delay (26Meiboom S. Gill D. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1958; 29: 688-691Crossref Scopus (4829) Google Scholar, 27Levine B.A. Moore G.R. Ratcliffe R.G. Williams R.J.P. Offord R.E. Chemistry of Macromolecules. 24. MTP Press, Lancaster, UK1979: 77-141Google Scholar). A two-dimensional TOCSY experiment was collected for 3.5 mmpeptide 1–10 and 325 μm F-actin (ratio 11:1; conditions as above, except KCl was added to 42 mm and the experiments were carried out at pH 6.8). For each peptide, resonances were assigned using a 500 μm sample of peptide and the following two-dimensional experiments; TOCSY (MLEV-17 mixing pulse of 60-ms duration at a spin locking field of 10 kHz) (28Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), COSY (data not shown), NOESY (data not shown) (500-ms mixing time), ROESY (data not shown) (continuous mixing pulse of 250-ms duration, 3.2-kHz locking field). A very weak presaturation pulse was applied to the water peak during the relaxation delay (1.5 s) and also during the mixing time for NOESY and ROESY experiments. 12% SDS-PAGE gels were run at between 35 and 50 mA (constant current) and stained with Coomassie Blue (29Weeds A.G. Hall R. Spurway N.C. FEBS Lett. 1975; 49: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). N-terminal protein sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 473A automated protein sequencer by Alta Bioscience, School of Biochemistry, University of Birmingham. Protein concentrations were estimated from absorbance measurements using the following values:A 280,1mg/ml(HmAtELC) = 0.22 mg−1·ml; A 290,1mg/ml(Actin) = 0.63 mg−1·ml and molecular masses: HmAtELC, 21 kDa; actin, 42 kDa. The mutations described in this study were not expected to alter the absorption characteristics or molecular mass of the light chain significantly, and so these values were used for all mutant ELCs. All striated muscle Al-type ELCs that have been analyzed contain N-terminal Ala (most) or Pro (some cardiac isoforms) that have been post-translationally modified by methylation (15Henry G.D. Trayer I.P. Brewer S. Levine B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 2C. A. Fruin and I. P. Trayer, unpublished observations. The recombinant proteins used in this study are not modified in any way (and have been compared with synthesized peptides with a free N terminus). The 9 proton NMR signal arising from the trimethylalanine of rabbit skeletal S1(A1), however, was readily visible in the 1H NMR spectrum of this protein and broadened significantly upon addition of actin (15Henry G.D. Trayer I.P. Brewer S. Levine B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,17Trayer I.P. Trayer H.R. Levine B.A. Eur. J.

The CPMG spectra of the N-terminal 10 residues of rabbit skeletal Al-type ELC is shown in Fig.1. The peaks were assigned as described in the Experimental Procedures. Broadening of specific peptide resonances was induced by incremental additions of F-actin and can be attributed to a reduction in their T2 relaxation time. This not only leads to a broadening of peaks but also to a reduction in peak amplitude in CPMG spectra (which are after all a ‘measure’ of T2). Exchange between the free and bound peptide species allows us to observe a weighted mean of the T2 for the two species in the free peptide. Those residues involved in binding (i.e. are immobilized) have a much shorter T2 in the bound state and hence in the observed state. The residues most notably broadened occurred at the N terminus of the 10 residue peptide: Ala 1The abbreviations used are: ELC, myosin essential light chain; S1, myosin subfragment 1; S1(A1) and S1(A2), myosin subfragment 1 carrying an alkali 1 (A1)- or alkali 2 (A2)-type essential light chain, respectively; HmAtELC, human atrial essential light chain; RLC, myosin regulatory light chain; EDC, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; CPMG, Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DSS, 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy. (β-CH3 and α-CH, whereas Ala10 resonances are largely unaffected), Pro2 (α-CH and δ-CH2, note Pro9α-CH is largely unaffected), ε-CH2 of Lys (from these data it cannot be determined which Lys are most affected) and, to a lesser extent, resonances arising from Asp5 and Val6 (Fig. 1). The interaction between the peptide and actin is largely ionic since addition of 100 mm KCl to the complex considerably weakens the interaction and the spectrum resembles that of the peptide alone. These data (and those in Fig. 3) confirm earlier observations (31Trayer I.P. Keane A.M. Murad Z. Rüegg J.C. Smith K.J. Rüegg J.C. Peptides as Probes in Muscle Research. Springer Verlag, Berlin1991: 56-68Google Scholar) that trimethylation is not prerequisite for actin binding. A clearer idea of which residues in the peptide were contributing to complex formation with actin was found by comparing the binding of a peptide containing residues 1–6 with one containing residues 5–10 (Figs. 2 and3). The peptide 1–6 clearly bound to actin with resonances arising from Ala 1The abbreviations used are: ELC, myosin essential light chain; S1, myosin subfragment 1; S1(A1) and S1(A2), myosin subfragment 1 carrying an alkali 1 (A1)- or alkali 2 (A2)-type essential light chain, respectively; HmAtELC, human atrial essential light chain; RLC, myosin regulatory light chain; EDC, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; CPMG, Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DSS, 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy., Pro2, Lys3 and Lys4 being the most significantly broadened. Asp5 and Val6 were hardly affected. Binding to actin appeared to be weaker with the shorter peptide since a higher concentration of actin was required to achieve significant broadening (Fig. 2). On the other hand, titration of peptide 5–10 with the same range of actin concentrations did not reveal that any significant interaction was occurring (Fig. 3). This result was interesting in two respects. Firstly, it showed that Lys3and Lys4 were involved in the interaction with actin rather than Lys7 and Lys8. Secondly, since the two shorter peptides are virtually ‘palindromic’ (and certainly contain the same number of charges), the data in Fig. 3 acted as good controls for those described in Figs. 1 and 2. Further confirmation of this is shown in Fig. 4. In this two-dimensional TOCSY, the signals of the 4 Lys residues in the larger peptide are well resolved. Addition of F-actin causes those cross-peaks arising from Lys3 and Lys4 to be considerably reduced in intensity, without anywhere near as much effect on Lys7 and Lys8. The TOCSY also shows reduced T2 for the ‘immobilized’ residues, i.e. those which disappear.Figure 41 H two-dimensional TOCSY spectra of A1-type ELC peptide 1–10 in the absence and presence of F-actin.

When hybridized into rabbit skeletal S1, the HmAtELC(A1V) mutant gave actin-activated MgATPase kinetic parameters which were identical to the wild-type (Table I, Fig.5A). Furthermore, this mutant light chain (both free and hybridized into S1) cross-links to F-actin (Fig. 5B). The amount of HmAtELC(A1V)-actin product produced is similar to the amount of wild-type HmAtELC product under the same conditions (see also 11, 13). Thus, we conclude that the size of the side chain is unimportant in kinetic modulation and actin binding.Table IActin-activated MgATPase kinetic constants for hybrid S1s formed between rabbit skeletal S1 and various mutant ELCsHybridK M for actinaValues are shown ± standard error.k cataValues are shown ± standard error.n bNumber of separate determinations.μms−1S1(A1)cValues for rabbit skeletal S1(A1) and S1(A2) are taken from Ref. 11.4.2 ± 0.613.7 ± 1.120S1(A2)cValues for rabbit skeletal S1(A1) and S1(A2) are taken from Ref. 11.31.9 ± 9.934.6 ± 9.524S1(HmAtELC)5.4 ± 1.515.3 ± 2.832S1(HmAtELC(A1V))5.2 ± 0.815.7 ± 1.524S1(HmAtELC(K4R))3.5 ± 0.414.3 ± 0.922S1(HmAtELC(K4A))10.8 ± 1.620.6 ± 2.324S1(HmAtELC(K4D))22.8 ± 6.728.3 ± 7.024S1(HmAtELC(K3A))9.4 ± 0.915.7 ± 1.122a Values are shown ± standard error.b Number of separate determinations.c Values for rabbit skeletal S1(A1) and S1(A2) are taken from Ref. 11Timson D.J.

Open table in a new tab A series of mutants were prepared in which the positive charge at position 4 was varied from positive (wild-type HmAtELC and HmAtELC(K4R)), through neutral (HmAtELC(K4A)) to negative (HmAtELC(K4D)). When these were hybridized into rabbit skeletal S1, the kinetic parameters of the hybrids became progressively more S1A2-like (Table I, Fig. 6). Interestingly, the results for HmAtELC(K4R) hybrid showed a lower apparentK m for actin than the wild-type, suggesting that this ELC may even have a higher affinity for actin. Abolition of the positive charge at position 3 (HmAtELC(K3A)) gives very similar results to the same change at position 4 (Table I, Fig. 6). All four mutant ELCs can be cross-linked to F-actin (Fig.7). However, there are clear differences in the amount of cross-linked product produced: HmAtELC(K4R) cross-linked to the same extent as wild-type HmAtELC but to a greater extent than HmAtELC(K4A), which in turn cross-linked better than HmAtELC(K4D). HmAtELC(K4A) and HmAtELC(K3A) cross-linked to similar extents. The results with S1 hybrids of these mutants are similar (not shown). It should be emphasized that cross-linking does not report on the equilibrium situation but rather it captures equilibrium complexes once formed and prevents them from dissociating; depending on the binding constant, the efficiency of the cross-linking reaction and experimental variables. Nevertheless, the results in Fig. 7 are qualitatively in agreement with the apparent K mvalues derived from kinetic analysis which suggest that the mutant ELCs bind actin in the following order of affinity: HmAtELC(K4R) > HmAtELC(K4A) ≈ HmAtELC(K3A) > HmAtELC(K4D). If the apparent K m for actin is plotted against kcat for all these mutants then a clear correlation is seen (Fig. 8). The correlation is significant at the 1% level (r2 = 0.98, degrees of freedom = 6). This suggests that theK m controls kcat up to a limit defined by S1(A2). This strengthens our belief that actin binding (reflected byK m) by the wild-type A1-type ELC results directly in kinetic modulation (reflected by kcat): if the first is weakened, so is the second. The NMR data strongly suggest that the major interaction between F-actin and the A1-type ELC occurs mainly in the N-terminal APKK … sequence. The slight broadening of the Asp5and Val6 signals in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, which do not occur in Fig. 3, probably reflect the fact that the peptide is being immobilized by binding to actin directly N-terminal to them, restricting their motion and so broadening their resonances. It should also be noted that the N-terminal sequences of all vertebrate striated muscle Al-type ELC so far sequenced (see Swiss Protein Data base) begin with either the sequence APKK. . . . . or PPKK … It was surprising that the A1V mutant had no effect on the ELC-actin interaction, given the results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The most plausible explanation for this is that the side chain itself is not involved in the contact with actin and thus increasing its size does not interfere with the interaction. However, the NMR data suggested that some feature of Ala 1The abbreviations used are: ELC, myosin essential light chain; S1, myosin subfragment 1; S1(A1) and S1(A2), myosin subfragment 1 carrying an alkali 1 (A1)- or alkali 2 (A2)-type essential light chain, respectively; HmAtELC, human atrial essential light chain; RLC, myosin regulatory light chain; EDC, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; CPMG, Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DSS, 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy. was important for binding to actin. It could be that all that is required for actin interaction is a positive charge on the N terminus, which will be provided by both the trimethylation in the native light chain or a free amino terminus in the peptides. Some support for this comes from our observation (11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that it was impossible to detect a free N-terminal group in the actin/recombinant HmAtELC cross-linked adduct. (Note that the native actin N-terminal amino acid is acetylated.) This would explain the selective broadening of theN-trimethyl groups and the Ala 1The abbreviations used are: ELC, myosin essential light chain; S1, myosin subfragment 1; S1(A1) and S1(A2), myosin subfragment 1 carrying an alkali 1 (A1)- or alkali 2 (A2)-type essential light chain, respectively; HmAtELC, human atrial essential light chain; RLC, myosin regulatory light chain; EDC, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; CPMG, Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DSS, 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy. methyl in the NMR spectra as this residue takes on the correlation time of the actin polymer. It is worth commenting further on the possible significance of the N-terminal trimethylation. The addition of three methyl groups to the N terminus must be an energetically costly exercise for the organism, and we would, therefore, expect it to serve some purpose in vivo. We suggest two possible explanations for this paradox. The measurements we make are steady state ones in order to determine the apparent K m for actin and the kcat for MgATP turnover. It may be that the main influence of the trimethylation is on the initial pre-steady state steps in the pathway whose influence is not reflected significantly in K m and kcat. Alternatively, as we have suggested above, it could be that trimethylation or a free amino group contribute approximately equally to actin binding but that the function of the post-translational modification is to protect the N terminus of the ELC from degradation within the cell (32Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Trimethylation may have been selected over other alternative (less energetically costly) N-terminal modifications (such as acetylation) as it retains a positive charge at the N terminus. It is interesting to note in this context that A2-like ELCs (which do not interact with actin (16Henry G.D. Winstanley M.A. Dalgarno D.C. Scott G.M.M. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 830: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) are N-terminally acetylated (as are all other myofibrillar proteins). It is clear, however, that a positive charge at both positions 3 and 4 is required for full actin binding and kinetic modulation. Indeed it is possible that actin binding requires merely a concentration of positive charge in the correct orientation in the N-terminal region with contributions from the N terminus and Lys3, 4, with Pro2providing the scaffold. The results are in agreement with the recent work of Sweeney (33Sweeney H.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 112-119PubMed Google Scholar), which showed that the mutation of the equivalent Lys residues in rabbit fast skeletal muscle A1-type ELC resulted in increased shortening velocities when the ELCs were reconstituted into permeabilized muscle fibers. This is entirely consistent with our data which shows that the equivalent changes in our system result in increased maximal MgATP turnover. Furthermore, by showing that these mutations also resulted in decreased affinity for actin by the ELC (as reflected in the increasedK m values and the cross-linking data) we have established a direct, causal relationship between actin binding and the modulation of the kinetics of S1. Recent work from the laboratory of Solaro and co-workers (34Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.J. von Geldern T.W. Wu-Wong J.S.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol.

These workers found that low concentrations of a peptide from the N-terminal region of ventricular A1-type ELC induced a supramaximal increase in MgATPase activity only at submaximal Ca2+ levels when added to rat cardiac myofibrils. This effect required a full complement of thin filament regulatory proteins and occurred in a highly cooperative manner that could involve activation of the whole thin filament at low peptide to thin filament ratios. We have established in this and previous work (11Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 255: 654-662Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Timson D.J. Trayer I.P.

This modulation results directly from these residues binding to actin and these two events are tightly coupled. What remains to be discovered is how this actin binding event some 8 to 10 nm from the active site of myosin (as judged from the models of acto-S1 derived from the crystal structures of the proteins (35Rayment I.

In this context, the results with HmAtELC(K4D) are particularly interesting. Although the light chain cross-links to actin (but to a lesser extent than the other mutants and the wild-type), its kcat is essentially S1(A2)-like. This suggests that the free energy of binding resulting from the ELC-actin interaction is used to drive conformational changes which influence the active site. The much weakened interaction in the case of HmAtELC(K4D) is insufficient to drive this process. In the case of HmAtELC(K3A) and HmAtELC(K4A), the binding energy is only sufficient to drive the process part-way. Communication between the light chain binding domain and the motor domain is a common feature of all muscle myosin types (1Szent-Györgyi A.G. Szentkiralyi E.M. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2067394407,"The interaction of a 20-residue-long peptide derived from the calmodulin-binding domain of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase with calcium-free calmodulin (apocalmodulin) was studied using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. We showed that: (i) a significant binding between apocalmodulin and the target peptide (RS20) exists in the absence of salt (K a = 106m−1), (ii) the peptide interacts with the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin and adopts a partly helical conformation, and (iii) the presence of salt weakens the affinity of the peptide for apocalmodulin, emphasizing the importance of electrostatic interactions in the complex. Based on these results and taking into account the work of Bayley et al. (Bayley, P. M., Findlay, W.A., and Martin, S. R. (1996) Protein Sci. 5, 1215–1228), we suggest a physiological role for apocalmodulin.

(1996) Protein Sci. 5, 1215–1228), we suggest a physiological role for apocalmodulin. Calcium is considered as one of the most important cellular second messengers. Variations of calcium concentration are monitored by calcium detectors in the cell (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Among them, calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; SynCaM, synthetic calmodulin; apocalmodulin, calcium-free calmodulin; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry. is the most ubiquitous, being present in all eukaryotic cells where it interacts with and activates numerous proteins, some of them being antagonists. To explain such specificity and diversity of actions is a challenge for structural and cell biologists. Numerous studies have addressed the mechanism of calcium binding to CaM, its interaction with target proteins, and finally activation of such proteins. Although the mechanism of calcium or enzyme binding to CaM appears to be qualitatively similar, small variations in ionic concentrations or changes in primary structure modify quantitative parameters of binding mechanisms. In addition, to analyze the interaction between CaM and a CaM-binding protein, the CaM-binding peptides were obtained from the CaM-binding domain of specific enzymes. For example, RS20 peptide, the 20-residue peptide corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, is derived from the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (2Lukas T.J. Burgess W.H. Prendergast F.G. Lau W. Watterson D.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1458-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and M13 is derived from the skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (3Klevit R.E. Blumenthal D.K. Wemmer D.E. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8152-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Numerous other peptides able to bind to CaM are used for such studies. Although these peptides fold as an amphiphilic α-helix, their primary structures are highly diverse (4DeGrado W.F. Prendergast F.G. Wolfe Jr., H.R. Cox J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An accepted hypothesis is that the mechanism of binding is qualitatively the same for different peptides but the quantitative parameters of the binding mechanism rely on the primary structure of the peptide and CaM. Although most published works were done in the presence of saturating calcium concentrations, some target proteins, such as melittin and seminal plasmin (5Milos M. Schaer J.J. Comte M. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9218-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), significantly interacted also with the apoform of calmodulin or only with the apoform as neuromodulin (6Urbauer J.L. Short J.H. Dow L.K. Wand A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, in all cases, when the thermodynamic parameters were measured, the binding was mainly entropically driven because the enthalpy of the process was about zero. In the cell, CaM oscillates between the apoform and the calcium saturated form. The characterization of this overall system in thermodynamic terms requires investigation of the apoCaM thermodynamic state in the absence or presence of an interacting peptide. Concerning CaM, we have shown that a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry allows one to pinpoint the thermodynamic properties of this exquisitely tuned system (7Protasevich I.

Makarov A. Briand C. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this report, we analyze the thermodynamic parameters of the RS20-apoSynCaM complex. Our results suggest a physiological role for apocalmodulin that contributes both diversity and specificity to the calmodulin interaction and activation processes. Synthetic calmodulin (SynCaM) was produced and purified as described previously (9Craig T.A. Watterson D.M. Prendergast F.G. Haiech J. Roberts D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein purity was checked by SDS gel electrophoresis, high performance capillary electrophoresis, and ESI mass spectrometry. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically with molar extinction of 1560m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (10Kilhoffer M.C. Roberts D.M. Adibi A. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6086-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For all experiments, ultrapure water (milli-Q apparatus, Millipore Inc.) and plasticware washed in 1 n HCl were used to minimize calcium contamination. Calcium was removed from protein with trichloroacetic acid (11Haiech J. Klee C.B. Demaille J.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3890-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A 20-residue peptide (RS20) corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase was synthesized and purified as described previously (2Lukas T.J. Burgess W.H. Prendergast F.G. Lau W. Watterson D.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1458-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 12Guimard L. Afshar M. Haiech J. Calas B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Peptide concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, assuming molar extinction of 5600 m−1 cm−1at 280 nm as determined by comparing UV spectrum and amino acid analysis. Other commercially available chemicals were of the highest grade. Protein solutions were prepared in 10 mm sodium cacodylate (some samples also in 50 mm Hepes to compare with the standard medium) buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmEGTA or 1 mm CaCl2. The SynCaM-RS20 complex used in DSC and CD experiments was prepared by mixing the protein with approximately 2-fold molar excess of RS20. The RS20 peptide binding to SynCaM was analyzed by ITC using a MicroCal MCS ITC instrument. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C. SynCaM concentration (in the 1.34-ml calorimetric cell) ranged from 0.02 to 0.06 mm, whereas RS20 concentration (in the syringe) varied from 0.2 to 0.6 mm. SynCaM was titrated up to the peptide/protein concentration ratio of about 2. The heat of dilution was measured by injecting the peptide into the protein-free buffer solution or by additional injections of peptide after saturation; the value obtained was subtracted from the heat of reaction to obtain effective heat of binding. Data were analyzed using the MicroCal Origin software and were fitted with a “one set of sites” model to obtain values for the stoichiometry of binding and the thermodynamic parameters of interaction: enthalpy of binding (ΔH) and association constant (K a), and, consequently, free energy change (ΔG) and entropy change (ΔS). Microcalorimetric measurements of SynCaM and its complex with RS20 peptide were carried out on a MicroCal VP-DSC instrument in 0.51-ml cells at a heating rate of 1 K/min. Protein concentration varied from 0.6 to 1.9 mg/ml. The heating curves were corrected for an instrumental baseline obtained by heating the solvent used for protein solution. The reversibility of unfolding was checked routinely by sample reheating after cooling in the calorimetric cell. The calorimetric denaturation enthalpy (ΔH cal) and the partial molar heat capacity of the protein (C p) were determined as described elsewhere (13Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), assuming that the molecular mass of SynCaM is 16628 Da and the partial specific volume is 0.72 cm3g−1 (7Protasevich I. Ranjbar B. Lobachov V. Makarov A. Gilli R. Briand C. Lafitte D. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To analyze functions of excess heat capacity, the MicroCal Origin software was used. The calorimetric denaturation enthalpy values are accurate within ±8%, andC p values at 20 °C are accurate within ±1.5 kJ K−1 mol−1. The errors in the parameters of individual transitions obtained by deconvolution of complex endotherms did not exceed ±10% for transition enthalpy and ±0.6 °C for transition temperature. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. The cell had a light path of 0.02 cm, and protein concentration was 0.4–0.5 mg/ml. The results were expressed as molar ellipticity, [Θ] (deg cm2 dmol−1), based on a mean amino acid residue weight of 112.4 for calmodulin, 112.6 for calmodulin-RS20 complex and 114.7 for RS20 peptide. The molar ellipticity was determined as [Θ] = (θ × 100 mean amino acid residue weight)/(cl), where c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, l is the light pathlength in centimeters, and θ is the measured ellipticity in degrees. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to monitor the RS20 binding to apoSynCaM at pH 7.5 in the presence of 10 mm EGTA (Fig. 1). There was no ITC signal upon apoSynCaM titration with EGTA. Cacodylate buffer (10 mm) was used because we have shown that this buffer concentration does not induce a major change in the secondary structure of apoprotein (7Protasevich I. Ranjbar B. Lobachov V. Makarov A. Gilli R. Briand C. Lafitte D. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Some experiments were done in 50 mmHepes. Despite the different heats of ionization for these buffers (−2 kJ/mol for cacodylate and 20.5 kJ/mol for Hepes), the measured enthalpy of binding has no buffer dependence, as was also shown for Ca2+-CaM (14Wintrode P.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, the effect of protonation/deprotonation events is absent, and we obtain true intrinsic enthalpy of binding. Thermodynamic data show that there is a one-to-one complex between RS20 and apocalmodulin (Fig. 1). The RS20 binding to apoCaM is an enthalpically driven process and is entropically unfavorable (Table I). The same was concluded for the peptide binding to Ca2+-CaM (14Wintrode P.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Salt increases ordering of the bound state (Table I). In the absence of salt, the association constant was of the order of 106m−1 with the interaction enthalpy of −38.9 kJ/mol and interaction entropy of −16 J/K mol. It should be noted that this is the first thermodynamic characterization of a significant binding between apocalmodulin and RS20 in the absence of salt.Table IThermodynamic parameters of RS20 peptide binding to ApoSynCaM at pH 7.5 (10 mm cacodylate buffer, 10 mm EGTA)SampleAdded saltK aΔHΔGΔSm−1kJ/molkJ/molJ/K molApoSynCaMNone1.0 × 106−38.9−34.2−16ApoSynCaM100 mm NaCl4.2 × 103−106.6−20.7−288ApoSynCaM150 mm KCl1.2 × 103−142.1−17.6−418ApoSynCaM150 mm KCl3.6 × 103−154.7−20.3−4515 mm MgCl2 Open table in a new tab We used 150 mm KCl and 5 mm Mg to approach intracellular conditions. Salt strongly decreases the peptide affinity for apoSynCaM and increases enthalpy and entropy of interaction (TableI). That is probably why previous studies did not report any interaction between RS20 and apoCaM (14Wintrode P.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This result demonstrates the importance of electrostatic interactions in the RS20-apoCaM complex. Addition of magnesium ions in the presence of salt has little effect on the peptide binding thermodynamic parameters. In the presence of calcium and the absence of salt, the interaction enthalpy is equal to −84 kJ/mol, which is twice higher than in the absence of calcium. Temperature dependence of the partial molar heat capacity of apoSynCaM-RS20 complex considerably differs from that of free apoSynCaM (Fig.2 A); although the asymmetry of the curve is retained, the pronounced shoulder at lower temperatures is absent. Reheating the samples after cooling from 90 to 5 °C demonstrates that denaturation is highly reversible (90–95%). As seen in Fig. 2 A, partial molar heat capacities of apoSynCaM and its complex with RS20 at 20 °C are the same, i.e. the apoSynCaM flexibility does not change upon complex formation. Free and complexed apoSynCaM do not differ in calorimetric denaturation enthalpies (Table II). The differences appear when we deconvolute both thermograms to two-state transitions; although the number of deconvoluted peaks and the second transition melting temperature do not change, the temperature of the first transition in the complex is 15 °C higher than in the free protein (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table II). The effect was also observed in Hepes buffer, although the change in the first transition temperature upon complex formation was not so pronounced (Table II). Evidently, RS20 does not contribute to the melting curve. Indeed, as was demonstrated by CD, we were not able to observe any cooperative transition for peptide melting in trifluoroethanol where it assumes the α-helical conformation (data not shown). The first deconvoluted peak corresponds to the C-terminal lobe melting, and the second one is assigned to N-terminal lobe unfolding (7Protasevich I. Ranjbar B. Lobachov V. Makarov A. Gilli R. Briand C. Lafitte D. Haiech J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Tsalkova T.N. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, the peptide influences only the stability of C-terminal lobe. Consequently, RS20 binds to the C-terminal lobe of apoSynCaM. The twice lower enthalpy of binding for the apoCaM complex with RS20 than for Ca2+-CaM-peptide complex (see above), where both lobes interact with the peptide, supports this conclusion.Table IIScanning calorimetry thermodynamic parameters of temperature-induced denaturation of ApoSynCaM, SynCaM, and their complexes with RS20 peptide at pH 7.5 (10 mm cacodylate buffer)SampleAdded saltΔH calaTotal calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation.First transitionbTransitions were determined by deconvolution analysis of the heat absorption curves to two-state transitions.Second transitionbTransitions were determined by deconvolution analysis of the heat absorption curves to two-state transitions.T t 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; SynCaM, synthetic calmodulin; apocalmodulin, calcium-free calmodulin; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry.ΔH t 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; SynCaM, synthetic calmodulin; apocalmodulin, calcium-free calmodulin; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry.T t2ΔH t2kJ/mol°CkJ/mol°CkJ/molApoSynCaMNone34838.912459.6224ApoSynCaM-RS20None33553.911858.7217ApoSynCaM100 mmNaCl35850.113465.4224ApoSynCaM-RS20100 mm NaCl40549.717364.4232ApoSynCaM150 mmKCl36147.414765.0214ApoSynCaM-RS20150 mm KCl35347.813864.8215ApoSynCaM150 mmKCl34865.613180.72175 mmMgCl2ApoSynCaM-RS20150 mmKCl36964.514379.72265 mmMgCl2ApoSynCaMcIn 50 mm Hepes buffer.None29741.411060.8210ApoSynCaM-RS20cIn 50 mm Hepes buffer.None34147.112660.9222SynCaM150 mmKCl33680.2129103.4250SynCaM-RS20150 mm KCl557100.4170105.2486ApoSynCaM is in the presence of 10 mm EGTA, and SynCaM is in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2.a Total calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation.b Transitions were determined by deconvolution analysis of the heat absorption curves to two-state transitions.c In 50 mm Hepes buffer. Open table in a new tab ApoSynCaM is in the presence of 10 mm EGTA, and SynCaM is in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Temperatures of apoSynCaM denaturation are increased in the presence of salts, and the highest stabilization is achieved with the combination of KCl and MgCl2 (Table II). In parallel with the ITC results indicating an abrupt drop of the RS20 affinity to apoSynCaM, the DSC data demonstrate that salts abolish the selectivity of RS20 effect on the temperature of the first calorimetric peak (Table II), although ITC suggests the existence of a weak complex. A possible explanation is that the dissociation of the complex takes place in the temperature region before the first transition temperature. In the Ca2+-CaM-peptide ternary complex the two domains of Ca2+-CaM interact simultaneously with opposite ends of the peptide (16Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Fig.3 demonstrates melting of this complex and free Ca2+-SynCaM in 150 mm KCl. The presence of salt allows recording much better thermograms of Ca2+-SynCaM and its complex with RS20, which are easily deconvoluted to two two-state transitions (Table II). The peptide binding to Ca2+-SynCaM strongly decreases the partial molar heat capacity at 20 °C (Fig. 3). Hence, Ca2+-SynCaM bound to RS20 is more compact than the unbound form, in accordance with Ref. 16Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar. In contrast to the apoprotein, RS20 in the presence of calcium influences thermodynamic parameters of both transitions. For the first transition, temperature is increased by 20.2 °C and its enthalpy by 30%. For the second transition, temperature is increased by 1.8 °C and its enthalpy is almost doubled. The significant increase of the second peak enthalpy confirms the tight interaction of RS20 with the N-terminal lobe of calmodulin. Binding of RS20 to SynCaM in the presence of calcium is too strong to allow the association constant to be determined by ITC (12Guimard L. Afshar M. Haiech J. Calas B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Wintrode P.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectra of apoSynCaM, RS20, and their complex at pH 7.5 are shown in Fig.4. CD spectrum of free peptide (curve 1) is typical of an unordered conformation. In general, the spectra of SynCaM and its complex with RS20 are similar to each other and to the α-helical type with characteristic minima near 208 and 222 nm. The peptide addition has no effect on the CD spectrum of Ca2+-saturated SynCaM (data not shown) but results in a noticeable increase of CD minima of apoSynCaM (Fig. 4, curves 2 and 3), raising the helicity from 36% (apoSynCaM) to 42% (apoSynCaM-RS20). The α-helical content was calculated from the ellipticity of the samples at 222 nm according to Ref. 17Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar. As is known, the two domains of Ca2+-CaM remain essentially unchanged upon complex formation with RS20, whereas the central helix of the native calmodulin unwinds, and the bound peptide acquires an α-helical conformation from residues 4–18 (18Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The identity of CD spectra of Ca2+-SynCaM and its complex with RS20 demonstrates that the increase in CD resulting from the secondary structure formation in the peptide is compensated by the decrease of CD effect because of partial destruction of the central helix of calmodulin. As is shown above, in the apoSynCaM-RS20 complex the peptide is bound only to the C-terminal lobe of the protein. This type of binding does not require large conformational changes as for Ca2+-SynCaM. Hence, the 6% increase in helicity for the apoSynCaM-RS20 complex in comparison to apoSynCaM is caused by a conformational change in the peptide from a random coil state to about 50% helical conformation upon binding to apoSynCaM. The interaction and activation of a set of target enzymes by calmodulin has raised the question of selectivity of these processes. It has been proposed that different CaM-enzyme complexes may exist depending on the extent of calcium saturation of calmodulin (11Haiech J. Klee C.B. Demaille J.G.

To analyze such structures, model peptides are used such as those derived either from the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (RS20) or from the skeletal myosin light chain kinase (M13).

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have described the existence of a peptide-CaM complex when two calcium ions are bound to CaM. This complex involves contacts between the C-terminal lobe of CaM and the N-terminal part of the peptide. The results presented in this report show the existence of the RS20-apoCaM complex that is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions. Therefore, besides the existence of the peptide-CaMCa2 described in Ref. 20Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and the RS20-CaMCa4 described in Ref. 18Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, we propose the third physiological relevant complex, namely the RS20-apocalmodulin. The sensitivity of these complexes to ionic strength and magnesium ion is probably different and allows a fine tuning in the interaction with the diverse CaM-binding domains under different ionic conditions. Such tuning is due to an exquisite equilibrium between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in the CaM-peptide complexes (22Afshar M. Caves L.S. Guimard L. Hubbard R.E. Calas B. Grassy G. Haiech J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 554-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such equilibrium is modulated by calcium binding, sequence diversity, and ionic conditions of the medium. The apoSynCaM-RS20 complex is mainly driven by electrostatic interaction, whereas RS20-SynCaM-Ca4 is driven by hydrophobic forces. Similar results concerning the calmodulin-binding domain of cyclic phosphodiesterase appeared in the paper of Yuan et al. (23Yuan T. Walsh M.P. Sutherland C. Fabian H. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1446-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) when our work was almost finished. This reinforces our conclusion that the target proteins interact with apoCaM, but the affinity is quantitatively modulated. In conclusion, the existence of a complex between apoCaM and target proteins allows us to propose that such preformed complexes may exist in the cell and that calmodulin is not free to diffuse in the cytoplasm. Therefore, the role of cell architecture in the function of a given protein is as important as that of kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms. We thank R. Toci, J. Rouvier, and M.

In the present study, the sequence specificity for DNA alkylation by Me-lex was determined in the p53 cDNA through the conversion of the adducted sites into single strand breaks and sequencing gel analysis. In order to establish the mutagenic and lethal properties of Me-lex lesions, a yeast expression vector harboring the human wild-type p53 cDNA was treated in vitro with Me-lex, and transfected into a yeast strain containing the ADE2 gene regulated by a p53-responsive promoter. The results showed that: 1) more than 99% of the lesions induced by Me-lex are 3-MeA; 2) the co-addition of distamycin quantitatively inhibited methylation at all minor groove sites; 3) Me-lex selectively methylated A's that are in, or immediately adjacent to, the lex equilibrium binding sites; 4) all but 6 of the 33 independent mutations were base pair substitutions, the majority of which (17/33; 52%) were AT-targeted; 5) AT → TA transversions were the predominant mutations observed (13/33; 39%); 6) 13 out of 33 (39%) independent mutations involved a single lex-binding site encompassing positions A600–602 and 9 occurred at position 602 which is a real Me-lex mutation hotspot (n = 9, p < 10−6, Poisson's normal distribution). A hypothetical model for the interpretation of mutational events at this site is proposed. The present work is the first report on mutational properties of Me-lex. Our results suggest that 3-MeA is not only a cytotoxic but also a premutagenic lesion which exerts this unexpected property in a strict sequence-dependent manner.

Our results suggest that 3-MeA is not only a cytotoxic but also a premutagenic lesion which exerts this unexpected property in a strict sequence-dependent manner. Most carcinogens and alkylating antineoplastic agents react with DNA to afford a diverse mixture of DNA lesions (1, 2Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This complexity is a barrier to being able to quantitatively and qualitatively dissect out the biological role(s) of the individual DNA lesions relative to the mutagenic and/or toxic potency of the agent. Most methylating agents, for example, transfer methyl groups to as many as 10 nucleophilic nitrogens and oxygens in DNA (2Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar).O 6-Methylguanine represents one of the few lesions extensively studied for which the mutagenic and toxic potential have been documented in detail (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In order to exercise some regulation over the alkylation pattern, we have prepared groove and sequence selective DNA damaging agents that provide significant control over the types of DNA lesions that are generated (4Konakahara T. Wurdeman R.L. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8606-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5Church K.M. Wurdeman R.L. Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Gold B.

One such compound is Me-lex 1The abbreviations used are: Me-lex, {1-methyl-4-[1-methyl4-(3-methoxysulfonylpropanamido)pyrrole-2-carboxamido]-pyrrole-2-carboxamido}propane; 3-A, N3 position of adenine; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate ester; MNU, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea; CENU(s), N-chloroethyl-N-nitrosourea(s); lex, lexitropsin; N 3-Alkyl-A, N 3-alkyladenine; CCNU, N-(2-chloroethyl-N-cyclohexyl-N-nitrosourea; O 6-Alkyl-G, O 6-alkylguanine; 3-MeA, N 3-methyladenine; 3-MeG, N 3-methylguanine; 7-MeG, N 7-methylguanine; EC, electrochemical; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Me, methyl; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.(Fig.1), which is a methyl sulfonate ester appended to a neutral N-methylpyrrolecarboxamide-based dipeptide (6Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The dipeptide equilibrium binds in the minor groove of DNA at (A/T)n sequences (5Church K.M. Wurdeman R.L. Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6827-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on empirical observation, Me-lex has the following binding preference: 5′-ATT > TTA > TAA (6Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Reactivity at those sites is consistent with the mode of lex-DNA interaction determined by a series of structural studies (cited in Ref.6Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While such information on lex binding to DNA provides a basis to rationalize experimentally verified binding domains, it is not possible to predict a priori which A/T-rich regions will be preferred binding sites within large DNA fragments. As a consequence of the dipeptide's binding affinity, the Me-lex efficiently methylates DNA in the minor groove at the N3 position of adenine (3-A) (6Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,8Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the methylation pattern induced by simple methylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate ester (MMS), dimethyl sulfate, and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), which predominantly yield the major grooveN 7-methylguanine (7-MeG) adduct (2Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). For comparison, the ratio of 3-MeA to 7-MeG is approximately 1:10 for MMS based on in vivo and in vitro assays (1, 2Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), while it changes to 100:1 for Me-lex (8Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The strong methylation preference of Me-lex for 3-A is also observed when it is incubated with cells in culture: under these conditions the only lesion detected is 3-MeA while MMS gives the traditional 3-MeA to 7-MeG 1:10 ratio (9Engelward B.P. Allan J.M. Dreslin A.J. Kelly J.D. Wu M.M. Gold B. Samson L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5412-5418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The significant increase in 3-MeA formation closely parallels the increased cytotoxicity of Me-lex versus MMS. This is consistent with the observation that Me-lex cytotoxicity is magnified in alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase (Aag) null ES cells (10Engelward B.P. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and in repair-deficient (tagA) bacteria (11Dinglay S. Gold B. Sedgwick B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Aag protein repairs a variety of DNA lesions including 3-alkyladenine (12Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) while tagA is specific for 3-alkyladenine. Recently, by combining a chemical and a genetic approach it has been shown that unrepaired 3-MeA have the potential to induce sister chromatid exchanges, chromosome aberrations, cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary, p53 induction, and apoptosis (9Engelward B.P. Allan J.M. Dreslin A.J. Kelly J.D. Wu M.M. Gold B. Samson L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5412-5418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but exactly how this is achieved is not yet clear. Those combined results point toward 3-MeA being mainly a lethal lesion (10Engelward B.P. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,13Karran P. Lindahl T. Ofsteng I. Evensen G. Seeberg E. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). If this were true the 3-MeA specific inducer Me-lex can be considered a new potential antineoplastic agent. Furthermore, it might be expected that such a compound would combine a high cytotoxicity and a low mutagenicity, avoiding (or diminishing) the undesired and well documented carcinogenic property of alkylating agents used in cancer therapy (14Henry-Amar M. Dietrich P.Y. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1993; 7: 369-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Marselos M. Vainio H. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1751-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, Me-lex may potentially have a higher therapeutic index with respect to other antineoplastic compounds. In this light, we wanted to investigate the relationship between A-specific DNA lesions and mutations induced by Me-lex at the nucleotide level. Using the human p53 tumor suppressor gene cDNA inserted in a yeast expression vector as a target (16Inga A. Iannone R. Monti P. Molina F. Bolognesi M. Abbondandolo A. Iggo R. Fronza G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the sequence specificity for DNA alkylation by Me-lex was determined through the conversion of the adducted sites into single strand breaks by sequential neutral thermal hydrolysis and exposure to base. These results are compared with the lethal and mutagenic effects of Me-lex using an in vitro mutagenesis protocol for plasmid DNA modification, and exploiting a DNA repair-proficient haploidSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain for the processing of DNA lesions into mutations (17Flaman J.M. Frebourg T. Moreau V. Charbonnier F. Martin C. Chappuis P. Sappino A.-P. Limacher J.-M. Bron L. Benhattar J. Tada M. van Meir E.G. Estreicher A. Iggo R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, reagents of the highest purity were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Me-lex was prepared as described previously (6Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, phosphatases, kinases, and DNA polymerases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Calf thymus DNA (1 mm) was incubated with 100 μm Me-lex or 5 mm MMS in 10 mm buffer Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) for 24 h at room temperature, in the presence or absence of 100 μm distamycin. The DNA was precipitated, washed, and dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The solution was heated at 100 °C for 30 min to selectively release N-alkylpurines from DNA. The solution was then treated with ice-cold 0.1 nHCl to precipitate the DNA, and the supernatant collected and analyzed for 3-MeG, 7-MeG, and 3-MeA using reverse phase HPLC: column, ODS C18 YMC (5 mm × 25 cm); column temperature, 40 °C; solvent: 95% 0.1 mNaOAc (pH 5.2), 5% MeOH; UV (λ, 270 nm) and electrochemical (EC) (3-MeG and 7-MeG) detection. The preparation of the 5′-32P-labeled restriction fragments from the plasmid DNA was performed as described previously (18Inga A. Chen F.-X. Monti P. Aprile A. Campomenosi P. Menichini P. Ottaggio L. Viaggi S. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 689-695PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid pLS76 containing the p53 cDNA, was restricted to obtain fragments including positions 169 to 1037 (PshAI site (position 169), NcoI site (position 476), Bsu36I (position 667), StuI (position 1037)). The PshAI/NcoI DNA fragment (5′-32P-labeled on the transcribed (noncoding) strand at the NcoI site) was obtained using NcoI restriction endonuclease, phosphatase, and kinase treatments, followed by a final PshAI digestion and polyacrylamide gel purification. The 5′-32P-end-labeledNcoI/Bsu36I DNA fragment (5′-32P-labeled on the nontranscribed (coding) strand at the NcoI site) was obtained by initial endonuclease restriction with NcoI, followed by sequential treatment with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, phosphorylation with T4 kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The DNA was then restricted with Bsu36I and the labeled fragment isolated from a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The same procedure was used to prepare the 5′-32P-end-labeled Bsu36I/NcoI DNA fragment (5′-32P-labeled on the transcribed (noncoding) strand at the Bsu36I site), except that the order of enzyme digestion was reversed. The 5′-32P-end-labeledStuI/Bsu36I DNA fragment (5′-32P-labeled on the transcribed (noncoding) strand at the StuI site) was obtained by initial endonuclease restriction with StuI, followed by sequential treatment with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, phosphorylation with T4 kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The DNA was then restricted with Bsu36I and the labeled fragment isolated from a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The p53 5′-labeled restriction fragment (200,000 cpm) and sonicated calf thymus DNA (83 μm final concentration) in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.6) were incubated with Me-lex (final concentrations in figure legends) in the presence or absence of 100 μm distamycin for 2 h at 37 °C. The DNA was EtOH/NaOAc precipitated, and washed with cold 70% EtOH. The DNA was dissolved in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.0), and heated at 90 °C for 15 min. The DNA was then re-precipitated, washed as described above, and dried under vacuum. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1 mpiperidine and heated at 90 °C for 30 min. The piperidine was removed by repeated lyophilization and the DNA resuspended in 10 μl of 80% formamide (v/v), 50 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3), 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol (w/v), and 0.1% bromphenol blue (w/v). The radioactivity of an aliquot from each sample was determined; the remaining sample was denatured (3 min at 90 °C) and then chilled in ice-water. An equivalent amount of radioactivity for each reaction was loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel (7.78 murea) and run at 65 W constant power. For sequence markers, lanes containing Maxam-Gilbert G and G + A (and in some cases C and C + T) reactions were included in each gel. The gels were dried and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In all cases cleavage bands were assigned by underexposing the gel so that the identification of the site was unequivocal. The yeast expression vector pLS76 harboring a human wild-type p53 cDNA under the control of an ADH1 promoter and containing the LEU2 selectable marker, the plasmid pRDI-22 used for gap repair assay, and the haploid S. cerevisiae strain yIG397 (MATa ade2-1 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his3-11, 15 can1-100 ura3-1 URA3 3xRGC::pCYC1::ADE2) used as recipient of pLS76 and for gap repair assays were previously described (16Inga A. Iannone R. Monti P. Molina F. Bolognesi M. Abbondandolo A. Iggo R. Fronza G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The p53-dependent reporter ADE2 gene allowed the phenotypic selection of p53 mutants (17Flaman J.M. Frebourg T. Moreau V. Charbonnier F. Martin C. Chappuis P. Sappino A.-P. Limacher J.-M. Bron L. Benhattar J. Tada M. van Meir E.G. Estreicher A. Iggo R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Standard yeast manipulations were performed as described (19Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Me-lex was dissolved in absolute EtOH immediately before the treatment. 1.5 μg of plasmid pLS76 DNA was treated with different Me-lex concentrations in 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 50% EtOH for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified by 3 EtOH precipitations, washed with 70% EtOH, and resuspended in sterile water. Damaged or undamaged vectors were then transfected into yIG397 cells by electroporation and transformants were plated on selective synthetic medium containing 1 m sorbitol. After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C colonies appeared. The selection for the plasmid marker (LEU2) allowed an indirect determination of the lethal effect of the damaging treatment as the number of transformants scored in transfections with damaged plasmids with respect to that obtained with undamaged vector. As transformation plates contained a minimal amount of adenine, adenine auxotrophs were able to achieve only a few cell divisions and thus produced smaller red colonies. Spontaneous and induced mutant frequency were defined as the number of small red colonies with respect to the total number of transformants. The fold of mutant induction was defined as the ratio between the mutant frequency observed with damaged vector with respect to the spontaneous frequency. Phenotypic mutant clones were purified and characterized at the molecular level as described previously (16Inga A. Iannone R. Monti P. Molina F. Bolognesi M. Abbondandolo A. Iggo R. Fronza G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Only independent mutants were included in the mutation spectrum; those carrying the same genetic alterations were considered independent only if they were isolated from different transfections. To study the biological consequences of 3-MeA, a synthetic compound was developed to target alkylation to the N3 position of adenine (3-A). Me-lex is composed of an S N2 methyl donating domain and a lexitropsin dipeptide, which equilibrium binds in the minor groove at A:T-rich regions in double-stranded DNA. Specific minor groove binding at A:T base pairs limits alkylation to the minor groove atoms and enhances alkylation at 3-A that are in a lex-binding domain. After in vitro DNA alkylation with Me-lex (100 μm) and MMS (5 mm), the yields of the major (7-MeG) and the minor groove (3-MeG and 3-MeA) adducts were determined using reverse phase HPLC coupled with UV and EC detection. EC detection was required to measure the 3-MeG and 7-MeG adducts when formed in very low yields. More than 99% of the lesions induced by Me-lex were 3-MeA, while 7-MeG represents the major adduct induced by MMS (82%) (TableI). Similar results were obtained with MNU (data not shown). The absolute amount of 3-MeG was the same for the two methylating agents. The specificity for alkylation at adenines by Me-lex was judged by determining the relative abundance of 3-MeAversus 7-MeG. As expected, the ratio of 3-MeA to 7-MeG was >120:1 for Me-lex while it was 1:5 for MMS. Thus, the relative abundance of minor to major groove adduction is ∼600-fold increased with Me-lex compared with MMS. Assuming a linear dose/lesion relationship, it can be calculated that at equimolar concentration Me-lex caused a 1500-fold increase in the absolute yield of 3-MeA and approximately a 30-fold increase in minor groove G-lesion compared with MMS. Therefore, it appears that while Me-lex may enhance the delivery of methyl groups to potential nucleophilic atoms in the minor groove, there is an overwhelming selection for the 3-A site. Interestingly, the co-addition of distamycin, which binds to the same recognition sites as the lex peptide (5Church K.M. Wurdeman R.L. Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6827-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), quantitatively inhibited methylation by both Me-lex and MMS at all minor groove sites, i.e. 3-MeA and 3-MeG (Table I).Table IIn vitro methylation of calf thymus DNACompoundAdduct yieldsaPicomoles of adduct/μg of DNA.Adduct ratio3-mA7-mG3-mG3-mA/7-mG3-mA/3-mGmmMeOSO2(CH2)2-lexbIncubation time, 24 h at ambient temperature.0.120.35 ± 1.710.16 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.01127.2407.00.1 + 0.1 DistamycinNDcND, not detected, i.e. less than, 0.008 and 0.005 pmol of adduct/μg of DNA for 3-mA and 3-mG, respectively.0.24 ± 0.16NDMMSbIncubation time, 24 h at ambient temperature.5.00.68 ± 0.083.47 ± 0.340.08 ± 0.020.28.55.0 + 0.1 DistamycinND3.54 ± 0.24NDa Picomoles of adduct/μg of DNA.b Incubation time, 24 h at ambient temperature.c ND, not detected, i.e. less than, 0.008 and 0.005 pmol of adduct/μg of DNA for 3-mA and 3-mG, respectively. Open table in a new tab The sequence-dependent DNA alkylation by Me-lex in different restriction fragments is shown in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5. The assignment of the cleavage sites was done using gels analyzed under conditions of lower exposure. In order to generate strand breaks at potential 7-MeG and 3-MeA adduction sites, the DNA was subjected to neutral thermal hydrolysis. This procedure to release N-alkylpurine lesions is identical to that described for the quantitative HPLC adduct analysis. Consistent with the HPLC-based adduct studies, the sequencing gels demonstrate that DNA methylation by Me-lex was almost exclusively at A, with virtually no G bands being observed.Figure 4Cleavage of the 5′-32P-end-labeledBsu36I/NcoI DNA fragment (5′-32P-labeled (*) on the nontranscribed (coding) strand at the NcoI site) of the p53 cDNA, induced by Me-lex at the indicated concentrations in the presence or in the absence of distamycin (dis), by sequential heating at neutral pH and exposure to hot piperidine.

The strongest adduction sites in the restriction fragments are at A398, A402, A403, A441, A445 (Fig.2), A601, A602, A616, A617, A635, and A636 (Fig.3), A598, A583, A553 (Fig. 4), and A982 (Fig. 5). In addition to the preference for A/T-rich regions, there is a strong preference for specific A's within the binding sites. For example, the bands at A635 and A636 are of equal intensity, while the two adjacent A's (A633 and A634) are not methylated at all. Plasmid pLS76 was damaged in vitro with increasing Me-lex concentrations (TableII). Damaged or undamaged plasmids were transfected into yIG397. Transformants were selected on plates lacking leucine but containing sufficient adenine for adenine auxotrophs to grow and turn red. Survival showed a Me-lex concentration-dependent decrease while the mutant frequency increased in a concentration dependent way (Table II). Only 5 mm induced mutants were purified for the molecular analysis as the level of induction (47-fold above background) guaranteed that 97% of the mutants were actually drug-induced.Table IISurvival and mutation induction in undamaged and Mc-lex damaged pLS76 after passage through yIG397 strainMe-lexSurvivalp53 mutant frequencyF aF, mutant frequency of Me-lex damaged/mutant frequency of undamaged DNA.mm%01001.8 × 10−41(n = 6)bn, number of independent transfections,i.e. number of transfections performed with DNA from different damaging treatments.(6/32,601)0.557 ± 223.3 × 10−41.8(n = 10)bn, number of independent transfections,i.e. number of transfections performed with DNA from different damaging treatments.(15/45,669)229 ± 622 × 10−412(n = 4)bn, number of independent transfections,i.e. number of transfections performed with DNA from different damaging treatments.(36/16,366)414 ± 460 × 10−433(n = 5)bn, number of independent transfections,i.e. number of transfections performed with DNA from different damaging treatments.(99/16,466)58.5 ± 6.384 × 10−447(n = 9)bn, number of independent transfections,i.e. number of transfections performed with DNA from different damaging treatments.(121/14,397)a F, mutant frequency of Me-lex damaged/mutant frequency of undamaged DNA.b n, number of independent transfections,i.e. number of transfections performed with DNA from different damaging treatments. Open table in a new tab After purification by successive platings, 90 Me-lex-induced mutants were cultured for plasmid recovery. Twenty-eight mutant clones were negative for p53 cDNA amplification. To determine whether adenine auxotrophy was due to p53 mutations rather than, for example, mutations in the promoter, the p53 open reading frame from nucleotides 125 to 1122 was PCR amplified from the remaining 62 ade− leu+ clones and tested by gap repair. Unpurified PCR product and HindIII-StuI linearized pRDI-22 (16Inga A. Iannone R. Monti P. Molina F. Bolognesi M. Abbondandolo A. Iggo R. Fronza G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were co-transfected by electroporation into yIG397. The HindIII-StuI digested pRDI- 22 gapped plasmid has two regions homologous to the terminal regions of the PCR product. After co-transfection and followed by homologous recombination in vivo (gap repair) a p53 expression vector is reconstituted having the wild-type promoter region (derived from pRDI-22) and the core region of the p53 open reading frame (derived from the PCR product). If the clone was initially ade− due to a mutation in the promoter region, the gap repaired transformants will originate almost exclusively white normal size colonies on limiting adenine plates (no small red colonies, gap repair negative), since the promoter in the gap-repaired plasmid, derived from pRDI-22, is wild-type. On the contrary, in case the PCR product contains a single mutation, approximately 100% of the derived transformed clones will give rise to small red colonies (gap repair positive) (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 16Inga A. Iannone R. Monti P. Molina F. Bolognesi M. Abbondandolo A. Iggo R. Fronza G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PCR fragments from 27 clones gave a low percentage of red colonies, suggesting that the mutation causing adenine auxotrophy lay outside the region tested by gap repair. The remaining 35 gave 100% red colonies after gap repair, and p53 mutations were found by DNA sequencing in every case. However, two mutants could not be considered independent because both derived from the same damaging treatment and showed the same mutation. Only one of these two mutants was considered for further analysis. All of the remaining 34 independent mutants but one (X272) contained a single mutation (TableIII).Table IIIMe-lex induced mutation spectra at the p53 cDNA after in vitro treatment of plasmid pLS76 and passage into yIG397 cellsMutant n"

The K+ATP channels play an essential role in nutrient-induced insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cell. We have cloned and characterized the promoter region of the mouse SUR1 gene, and have shown that it lacks CAAT and TATA boxes or an initiator element. Studies of transcription initiation in several tissues showed that there is a common SUR1 promoter in brain, heart, and pancreas and in the pancreatic β-cell line, βTC3. The SUR1 gene uses multiple transcription start sites with the major site located 54 base pairs 5′-upstream of the translation initiation site. Transient transfection experiments in pancreatic β-cell lines showed that the proximal promoter fragment −84/+54 is sufficient for significant transcriptional activity. The proximal promoter region contains multiple SP1-binding sites, and cotransfection experiments of the SUR1 promoter-luciferase vector with SP1 expression vector inDrosophila SL2 cells demonstrated a stimulatory effect of SP1 on SUR1 transcriptional activity. The mobility shift assays confirmed the interaction of the SP1 transcription factor with the proximal promoter region of the SUR1 gene. Together, these results indicate that SP1 may mediate transcription initiation of the SUR1 gene. In addition, we have described the coordinate regulation of the gene expression of both K+ATP channel subunits by glucocorticoids. SUR1 and Kir6.2 mRNA levels are down-regulated by ∼40–50% in response to glucocorticoid treatment. Interestingly, the extent of the inhibitory effect as well as the kinetics and sensitivity are very similar for both mRNAs. Studies of mRNA turnover demonstrate that glucocorticoids most likely decrease the transcriptional activity of both SUR1 and Kir6.2 genes since glucocorticoids failed to affect the stability of each mRNA.

Three isoforms of SURs have been cloned, SUR1 and two spliced variants of SUR2, SUR2A and SUR2B. The SUR1-Kir6.2 complex generates K+ATP channels with electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of pancreatic β-cell and neuronal-type channels, while SUR2A-Kir6.2 and SUR2B-Kir6.2 or Kir6.1 reconstitute the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle-type channels, respectively. The pancreatic β-cell K+ATP (SUR1-Kir6.2) channels play a critical role in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (10Cook D.L. Satin L.S. Ashford M.L. Hales C.N. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the K+ATP channels in the β-cells are sensors of the ATP/ADP ratio. Following glucose metabolism, the increase in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio inactivate the K+ATP channels resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of the voltage-dependentl-type Ca2+ channels with a subsequent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, initiating insulin secretion (see review by Bryan and Aguilar-Bryan; Ref. 11Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The specific functional and regulatory role of each subunit in the overall channel activity is being established by mutational analysis studies. While the Kir6.2 subunit forms the ion conducting pathway (11Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Shyng S. Ferrigni T.

Furthermore, studies expressing a truncated form of Kir6.2 suggest that Kir6.2 may demonstrate some intrinsic sensitivity to ATP (6Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The essential role of both subunits in regulating insulin secretion is supported by the characterization of mutations in either subunit that abrogate channel activity and cause persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (16Thomas P.M.

Genet. 1996; 5: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) characterized by constitutive insulin secretion despite severe hypoglycemia. Regulation of transcriptional activity of either SUR1 or Kir6.2 genes is important for determining the level of expression and therefore the activity of the K+ATP. In the present study, we have characterized the proximal promoter region of the mouse SUR1 gene and shown that there are no CAAT and TATA boxes or initiator element that may mediate initiation of transcription. Multiple transcription start sites exist with the major site located 54 bp 5′-upstream of the translation start site. Transient transfection experiments with different constructs of varying lengths of the SUR1 promoter region revealed that the basic elements required for significant basal transcriptional activity are located in the first 140 bp of the 5′-flanking region. In this particular region, there are multiple SP1 binding sites that are responsible for SP1 activation of SUR1 transcriptional activity. In addition, we show that glucocorticoids down-regulate the K+ATP channel levels by decreasing the SUR1 and Kir6.2 gene expression. Interestingly, the kinetics, sensitivity, and magnitude of inhibition of both genes are very similar. Moreover, dexamethasone does not affect the stability of either mRNA, suggesting an inhibition of transcriptional activity of both genes. Cell culture and reagents were purchased from Biofluids, Inc.

The mouse MIN6 cells (20Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki (Osaka, Japan) and Dr. Joel Habener (Boston, MA) and cultured in DMEM, 25 mm glucose supplemented with antibiotics, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, β-mercaptoethanol, and 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. βTC3 and MIN6 cells were incubated at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity. Drosophila Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells, provided by Dr. Carl Wu (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), were grown in HyQ-CCM3 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) at room temperature without CO2. A BAC mouse genomic library (Genome System, St. Louis, MO) was screened for the SUR1 gene with a 334-bp mouse SUR1 cDNA probe, corresponding to the 5′-region of the mouse SUR1 that includes part of the N terminus and the first two putative transmembrane domains (3Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P. IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). This 334-bp cDNA fragment was obtained by reverse transcription followed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into a TA cloning vector as described previously (21Hernandez-Sanchez C. Wood T.L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The positive SUR1 BAC clone, which contained ∼120 kb, was subcloned into three different sublibraries, usingBamHI, EcoRI, and HindIII restriction enzymes, with the pBluescriptII KS+ vector. Each sublibrary was screened for clones that contain the 5′ region of the SUR1 gene with the 334-bp SUR1 probe. The positive clones were characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. The 5′ RACE procedure was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA from βTC3 cells and mouse pancreas and heart were used as templates for a reverse transcriptase reaction with the SUR1 5′-ACAGAGGTGATGGCAGCCATG-3′ primer for βTC3 cells and 5′-AAGTTAGAGGTCTCAATG-3′ for the tissues. These primers are located 340 and 355 bp downstream of the translation start site, respectively. For the PCR reaction, the first and nested primers were, respectively, 5′-ATGTGTACCTTGGAGCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-GCACTACGTTGAGCGCGTCC-3′, which are located 157 and 82 bp downstream of the translation start site, respectively. The PCR products were analyzed in a 2% agarose gel and subcloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 17 clones from βTC3 cells, 4 from pancreas, and 1 from heart were analyzed by sequencing. Total RNA from βTC3 cells and mouse brain and heart was isolated using RNazol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of total RNA from βTC3 cells and 50 μg from brain and heart were hybridized with a mouse genomic SUR1 antisense riboprobe (2 × 105 dpm) that includes 605 bp of the 5′-flanking region, the first exon, and 200 bp of intron 1. The mouse genomic SUR1 riboprobe was generated by subcloning the 1000-bp BamHI to BamHI genomic fragment from the BAC mouse genomic clone into pBluescript-II KS+ atBamHI site. 32P-Labeled antisense riboprobe was synthesized by the T7 polymerase. Solution hybridization-RNase protection assays were carried out as described previously (22Werner H. Woloschak M. Adamo M. Shen-Orr Z. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7451-7455Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To create the −1136/+54 SUR1 promoter-luciferase construct, the 1370-bp fragment immediately upstream of the translation start site was generated by PCR using aEcoRI subclone of the BAC clone as template and 5′-TTCCATCAATGAGGAGCAGG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-AAGGCCAAGGC CATGGTGG-3′ as reverse primer. The reverse primer introduced a single mutation (underlined) immediately 5′ upstream of the ATG to create an NcoI site (bold) that allowed the subcloning of this fragment immediately upstream of the ATG of the luciferase expression vector. To minimize the possibility of introducing errors during PCR, the high fidelityPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used and a low number of cycles (15Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dorschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were performed. The resulting single PCR fragment was subcloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase expression vector, between the HindIII and NcoI sites. The identity and orientation of the PCR fragment was then characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. The −605/+54, −441/+54, and −84/+54 SUR1 constructs were generated by BamHI,NheI, and PvuI digestions of the −1136/+54 construct, respectively. The −4500/+54 construct was originated by subcloning the HindIII 3500-bp 5′-flanking fragment upstream of the −1136/+54 construct. βTC3 and MIN6 cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent according to manufacture's recommendations. βTC3 and MIN6 cells were plated in six-well plates prior transfection; each well received 1.5 and 1 μg of a given SUR1 promoter-luciferase construct, respectively, and 10 ng of the pCMVRenilla vector to correct for the variable transfection efficiencies. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection with the dual luciferase system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. To examine transactivation of SUR1 promoter with Sp1,Drosophila SL-2 cells were cotransfected with SUR1 promoter-luciferase and SP1 expression vector. SL2 cells were transfected using the lipofectin reagent according to manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty-four hours before transfection, SL2 cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks, then transfected with 2 μg of SUR1 luciferase constructs mixed with different amounts of pPacSP1 expression vector. Total DNA content (up to 3 μg/flask) was normalized to pPac0 vector devoid of SP1 coding sequence. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection. The protein content of cell extracts was quantitated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Nuclear extract from βTC3 cells was prepared according to Dignam et al. (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Briefly, βTC3 cells were rinsed and scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and homogenized. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation and resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). The salt concentration of the nuclear suspension was adjusted to 0.3 m KCl, which releases soluble nuclear proteins. The extracted nuclear proteins were collected as the supernatant after centrifugation and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The concentration of the nuclear extract was quantitated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Double-stranded oligonucleotides for mobility shift were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides (1 ng) were added to 4 μg of βTC3 cell nuclear extract in a final volume of 15 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DNA-protein complexes were separated from the free DNA by electrophoresis through a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in a 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Reaction mixtures with Sp1 protein included 1.0 footprint unit of purified Sp1 (1 footprint unit is defined as the amount of Sp1 needed to give full protection against DNase1 digestion on the SV40 early promoter). Competition experiments included a 100-fold excess of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides, while supershift analysis included the addition of 1 μg of anti-SP1 antibody to the mix and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Mouse genomic P1 clone (Genome System Inc., St. Louis, MO) and mouse genomic DNA were digested with the indicated restriction enzymes. DNA digestion fragments were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel and transfer to a nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was hybridized with the mouse Kir6.2 RNA probe described below. After stripping, the membrane was re-hybridized with the mouse 3′ SUR1 antisense riboprobe described previously (21Hernandez-Sanchez C. Wood T.L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). βTC3 and MIN6 cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to incubation with dexamethasone. Serum-free DMEM plus 25 mm glucose containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, antibiotics, and glutamine was used during serum starvation and dexamethasone stimulation. Total RNA (10–20 μg) was hybridized with a32P-labeled mouse antisense RNA Kir6.2 and SUR1 probes (2 × 105 dpm). The mouse 5′ SUR1 riboprobe was generated as described previously (21Hernandez-Sanchez C. Wood T.L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mouse Kir6.2 antisense RNA probe, corresponding to the putative pore segment and the second transmembrane domain (2Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. IV Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was generated by reverse transcription followed by PCR. Briefly, the reverse transcription (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reaction was performed with 3 μg of MIN6 cell total RNA according to the manufacturer's directions. A 217-bp PCR product was obtained and subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The identity and orientation of the construct was verified by sequence analysis. After linearization of this construct withHindIII, the 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe was generated with T7 RNA polymerase. The normalization to total RNA was performed by co-hybridizing with an 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) probe (Ambion, Austin, TX). A mouse β-actin antisense riboprobe (Ambion, Austin, TX) was also included. βTC3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated with DRB (final concentration 100 μm) alone or DRB plus 10 or 100 nmdexamethasone for various times. Total RNA was isolated as described above, and the levels of SUR1 and Kir6.2 mRNA were measured by the solution hybridization/RNase protection assay. Anti-SUR1 antiserum was raised in rabbits using a synthetic rat SUR1 peptide extending from amino acids 1569–1581 (CKDSVFASFVRADK). Anti-Kir6.2 antiserum was also raised in rabbits using a synthetic mouse Kir6.2 peptide extending from amino acids 352–370 (CDRSLLDALTLASSRGPLRK). βTC3 and MIN6 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated with 100 nm dexamethasone for 16 and 24 h, respectively. Cells were lysed in the presence of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). 30–40 μg of protein were reduced by β-mercaptoethanol and fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). For SUR1 experiments, the upper part of the membrane was incubated with anti-SUR1 antibody (1:1,000 dilution). The bottom part of the membrane was incubated with β-actin or α-tubulin antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:5,000 and 1:10,000 dilution, respectively) using the ECL system. For Kir6.2 experiments, membranes were first incubated with anti-Kir6.2 antibody (1:500 dilution) detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin 1:5,000 and then stripped and reblotted with β-actin antibody as described above. SUR1, Kir6.2, β-actin, and α-tubulin bands were scanned by Fotolook version 2.08 (Agfa) and quantify by MacBas version 2.31 (Fuji Photo Film Co). To characterize the promoter region of the mouse SUR1 gene and study the possible regulatory elements that control SUR1 transcriptional activity, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SUR1 gene. One genomic clone from a mouse BAC library was isolated and subcloned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Computer analysis using the MatInspector program (24Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar) of the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SUR1 revealed that there is no TATA box, CAAT box, or initiator element (Fig.1; GenBank accession number AF037274), items that commonly specify the transcription start site. However, the proximal 5′-flanking region (−86 to +24) contains several GC boxes (GGCG) that predict multiple SP1 binding sites. SUR1 gene is expressed in the pancreatic islets as well as other tissues (21Hernandez-Sanchez C. Wood T.L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar): mainly brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. To study whether these tissues utilize the same promoter or there are distinct promoter regions, we examined the transcription start site in mouse pancreas, brain, and heart as well as in the mouse pancreatic β-cell line βTC3, using the 5′ RACE and solution hybridization RNase protection assay methods. The 5′ RACE procedure is a sensitive method for cloning the 5′ end of a particular mRNA. We performed this procedure on RNA from the βTC3 cells and mouse pancreas and heart RNA. As shown in Fig.2 A, a 270–280-bp initial PCR product was obtained in βTC3 cells and pancreas. The subsequent nested PCR displayed an ∼194-bp product in the three cases. All of these PCR products were cloned and subsequently sequenced. Identical sequences were obtained from the βTC3 cells and pancreatic and cardiac tissues, although some diversity in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) length was noted, extending between 82 and 21 bp of the 5′-flanking region. We found the variability mainly in the βTC3 cells. To determine the exact transcription start site of the SUR1 gene, we hybridized 20 and 50 μg of total RNA from βTC3 cells and brain and heart, respectively, with a mouse genomic antisense riboprobe corresponding to 200 bp of intron 1, the complete first exon, and 605-bp of the 5′-flanking region, in a solution hybridization/RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a major 204-bp protected band was obtained in all cases. In the case of the βTC3 cells, other signals were seen, suggesting the presence of other minor protected bands. When other genomic probes extending further upstream, up to 2800 bp, were used, no additional protected bands were seen (data not shown). These data suggest that there is a common promoter and similar transcription start sites in βTC3 cells, mouse pancreas, heart, and brain tissues. It is likely that the 5′-UTR of SUR1 is similar in the other tissues expressing SUR1 (21Hernandez-Sanchez C. Wood T.L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The major transcription start site is located approximately 54-bp 5′ to the ATG translational codon. Other minor start sites for transcription were mapped between 82 and 21 nucleotides 5′ to the ATG translational codon. The presence of multiple transcription start sites is characteristic of TATA-less GC-rich promoters (25Reynolds G.A. Basu S.K. Osborne T.F. Chin D.J. Gil G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L.

The mammalian flap endonuclease (mFEN) is a single-strand flap-specific endonuclease (Harrington, J. J., and Lieber, M. R.

The DF-specific flap endonuclease and 5′-exonuclease activities have not yet been reported. Therefore, this is the first report of the specific endo/exonuclease activities of phFEN. The DF-specific 5′-exonuclease activity degraded the downstream primer of 3′ single-flap structure and was 15 times higher than the activities against nicked substrates without 3′ flap strand. DF-specific flap endonuclease cleaved the 5′ double-flap strand in DF and the lagging strand in RF at the junction portion. Because the RF appears to be the intermediate structure, due to the arrest of the replication fork, the double strand breaks after the arrests of the replication forks are probably caused by phFEN.

Hyperthermophilic microorganisms live in marine and terrestrial volcanic environments, habitats as extreme as might have been found on ancient earth. As such, these microorganisms are of interest because they produce thermostable enzymes, and they allow us to examine the primitive mechanisms of life. The hyperthermophilic archaeonPyrococcus horikoshii can live in temperatures up to 102 °C; the optimal growth temperature is 95 °C. The genome sequencing project of P. horikoshii was performed at the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan. Hyperthermostable enzyme genes identified in the P. horikoshii genome were overexpressed inEscherichia coli in order to examine their structure/function relationship. Recently, a structure-specific endonuclease was purified and characterized in murine and yeast (1Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Thus, FEN activity is found in eucaryotes and procaryotes, but as yet there are no reports of FEN activity in Archaea. It is also unclear how replication and repair systems function in Archaea. Recently, it was suggested that Pyrococcus furiosus is highly resistant to γ-radiation and might have a special system to remove damaged DNA (35Robb F.T. Bogert A.P. DiRuggiero J. Nackerdien Z.

To investigate the repair system of P. horikoshii, the FEN homologue gene identified in the P. horikoshii genome was cloned, then overexpressed in E. coli, and the recombinant protein characterized. The ultracompetent E. coli XL2-Blue MR′ cells were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The vector pET-15b and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The Vent DNA polymerase was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets (EDTA-free), from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany), were also used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. RQ1 RNase-free DNase was purchased from Promega, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from Takara Shuzo (Otsu, Shiga, Japan). Aluminum oxide was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). The genome of P. horikoshii was sequenced using the method of Kaneko et al. (17Kaneko T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Kotani H. Sazuka T. Miyajima N. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The gene that encodes the flap endonuclease homologous enzyme was obtained using BLASTX (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The vector pET-15b (19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) was double-digested by NdeI and XhoI; the 7-kilobase pair fragment was purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). On the basis of the open reading frame of the flap endonuclease homologue in the P. horikoshii genome, DNA fragments containing the frame and restriction site were amplified using polymerase chain reaction with two primers, FEN-a, containing 42 bases (5′-GGGAATTCCTGCAGATCGCATATGGGTGTTCCTATCGGTGAC-3′) and FEN-b, also containing 42 bases (5′-ACTAATCCCGGGTACCTCGAGGCTATAGACTTTAGGGTTTCT-3′). The polymerase chain reaction products were purified using a QIAquick Spin polymerase chain reaction purification kit (Qiagen) and digested with two restriction enzymes, NdeI and XhoI. The digested 1032-base pair fragment coding phFEN was purified and ligated to the insertion sites of the vector pET-15b. Ultracompetent E. coli XL2-Blue MRF′ cells were transformed with the recombinant molecule. Transformants were screened on 2× YT plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) incubated at 37 °C overnight. The plasmid pET-15b/phFEN was purified using a Mini plasmid kit (Qiagen). The pET-15b/phFEN was double-digested with NdeI andXhoI; the insert length was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis. The absence of additional mutations within the coding region of phFEN was verified by sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer (Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit, Perkin-Elmer). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) was transformed with pET-15b/phFEN. Transformants were screened on 2× YT plates containing ampicillin. The transformant was propagated as a seed culture in 200 ml of 2× YT medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C overnight. The transformant was induced at A 600 = 0.8 with 1 mmof isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The induced cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. The frozen cells were thawed and disrupted by grinding for 20 min with an equal volume of aluminum oxide powder in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing a protease inhibitor mixture tablet. The cell paste was resuspended with 40 ml of the 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and heated at 85 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 2300 × g for 30 min. Bovine DNase I (100 units) and 10 mm MgCl2 (final concentration) were added to the supernatant and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was heated at 85 °C for 10 min, then centrifuged at 10,000 × G for 20 min to remove the inactivated DNase. The recombinant phFEN was subjected to affinity chromatography with Ni-conjugated Sepharose, using a stepwise elution from 5 mm to 1 mimidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mNaCl solution (His-bind Buffer Kit, Novagen). The phFEN was eluted with 60 mm imidazole. The eluted phFEN was then loaded on a HiTrap SP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) cation exchange column and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. phFEN was recovered with the buffer containing 200–300 mm NaCl. Next, it was applied to a heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted using a linear gradient with 0–0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The phFEN was collected with buffer containing 280 mm NaCl. The enzyme samples were analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) on a PhastSystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), the enzyme sample was mixed with SDS sample buffer containing marker dye and boiled for 5 min. The samples were applied to the gel (PhastGel, 10–15%); protein was detected using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining according to the manufacturer's recommendation. IEF was carried out on a PhastGel IEF 3-9 and visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Protein content was determined with Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. Protein sequencing of recombinant phFEN, resolved using SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, was performed by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., using a protein sequencer PSQ-1. As a control, E. coli host cells were transformed with the vector pET-15b, without the phFEN gene, and then the cell lysate was obtained using a similar overexpression procedure. The same purification steps were performed in order to compare with recombinant phFEN samples. The following oligonucleotides were designed, based on the sequence reported by Harrington and Lieber (1Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Oligonucleotides A–E, G–R, V–X, and c–g were radiolabeled at their 5′ terminus with the bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. One phosphate moiety was added to the 5′ end of oligonucleotides K and L with the T4 polynucleotide kinase and cold ATP. The oligonucleotides were then labeled at 3′ terminus with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P] ddATP. DNA substrates were obtained by annealing one of the radiolabeled oligonucleotides onto an unlabeled oligonucleotide. All DNA substrate structures are shown in Fig. 1. Annealing reactions were performed as follows: radiolabeled oligonucleotides (20 pmol) were mixed with non-radiolabeled oligonucleotides (40 pmol) in 50 μl of buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl); the tube was boiled for 2 min in 300 ml of water and slowly cooled to 10 °C in the same water. These substrates were used in our experiment. As a control, the annealing mixtures were run at 4 °C on 8% polyacrylamide gels. The region of gel containing the radiolabeled DNA substrate was excised; the DNA was eluted from the crushed gel slice for 1 h. The purified DNA was used as a substrate. The enzyme reactions were performed in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.6 pmol of the 5′ end-labeled substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 60 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 15 μl of 95% formamide containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min, loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel (35 cm × 42.5 cm) containing 7 murea and 10× TBE (89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)), and then electrophoresed for 2 h at 2000 V. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The size markers, oligonucleotides S1, S2, S4, S5, S19, S20, S21, S29, S30, S31, and S57 were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Oligonucleotide exonuclease activity was measured using the same procedure described for the flap substrate. To determine the optimum pH, the reaction was performed in an assay mixture (15 μl) containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.6 pmol of 5′ end-labeled substrate in 50 mm of one of the following buffers at 60 °C for 30 min. Three different 50 mm buffers were used to obtain a wide pH range as follows: sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0–5.5), phosphate buffer (pH 5.5–8.0), and borate buffer (pH 8.0–9.4). To determine the temperature dependence of the heat capacity, differential scanning calorimetry experiments were performed over a range of temperatures from 0 to 125 °C using nano differential scanning calorimetry (CSC 5100, Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Provo, UT) (22Privalov P.L. Khechinashvili N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 86: 665-684Google Scholar). Before measurement, the enzyme (0.34 and 0.5 mg/ml) was dialyzed using 50 mm sodiumphosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 and 0.05 m NaCl. A scan rate of 1 K·min−1 was applied. The residual activity of phFEN was measured after heating at 95 °C. The enzyme solution (0.3 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 m or 0.05 m NaCl) was placed in the microcentrifuge tubes and covered with mineral oil in duplicate. The tubes were incubated at 95 °C for the indicated time. As a control experiment, the buffer was incubated for the same time, and the pH was checked. The pH value was stable under these conditions. Tubes were removed at the indicated hours, chilled on ice, and sampled for enzyme assays. The native molecular weight (M r) was estimated using high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration at 0.5 ml·min−1 on a HiLoad Superdex G-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 or 0.5m NaCl. The standards used were blue dextran 2000 (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (14 kDa). Native molecular masses were interpolated from the plot of retention timeversus log M r. The complete nucleotide sequence of the P. horikoshii flap endonuclease (phFEN) gene consists of a single open reading frame of 1032 nucleotides (GenBankTM accession number AB005215). The putative ribosomal binding site (AGGGTGAT) at position −11 and a putative promoter consensus (TTATAA) at position −89 upstream from the ATG initiation site were found. The deduced amino acid sequence of the phFEN is composed of 343 residues. The calculated molecular mass of subunit (40,964 Da) corresponds well with the apparent molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE (41,000 Da). A sequence alignment of FEN from P. horikoshii, human, murine, Methanococcus jannaschii, RAD2 fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe, and YKL510 fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae is shown in Fig.2. The proposed alignment was constructed with the Gene Works program (IntelliGenetics) based on a PAM-250 scoring matrix. The primary sequence of P. horikoshii is highly similar to the FEN-1 from human (37% overall identity), murine (37%), YKL510 from S. cerevisiae (34%), and Rad2 fromS. pombe (37%). The N-terminal N and I regions, which are conserved among the Rad2 family containing FEN-1, are highly conserved in phFEN; likewise, the H region from 282 to 330 is conserved between phFEN and mammalian and yeast FEN-1. The phFEN is homologous to one of the eucaryotes in the N (51%), I (36%), and H (47%) regions. The C-terminal (C) region in the mammalian and yeast FEN-1 has a highly basic C-terminal tail. The sequence of KKKP was found in phFEN; however, the length of the C region was shorter than that of eucaryotes. A phFEN gene was cloned to pET-15b with a histidine tag at the N terminus and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Two percent of the total protein in the cell extract contained the recombinant phFEN. After heat treatment at 85 °C for 30 min, recombinant phFEN was detected as a major protein on SDS-PAGE following removal of E. coli proteins. After elution from the Ni-conjugated Sepharose column, the phFEN fraction contained other minor bands presumed to be the proteolytic products of phFEN and E. coli proteins, which were resistant to heat treatment and have an affinity for Ni-conjugated Sepharose. HiTrap SP column chromatography was effective in purifying the protein; however, the proteolytic products could not be completely removed. The phFEN was finally purified on a heparin column. The proteolytic product was completely removed, and a single band (41 kDa) was obtained on SDS-PAGE. The pI value of the phFEN is greater than 9.3; hence, phFEN is a basic protein. As a control, all purification steps were performed using the cell extract from the transformant harboring pET-15b. In final preparation of the control, neither the phFEN protein nor the FEN activity were detected. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant phFEN was as follows: GSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMGVPIG. This sequence completely matched the one deduced from the DNA sequence. The native molecular mass of phFEN (41 kDa), estimated using gel filtration on a calibrated Superdex G-200 column, matched well with the molecular mass (40,964 Da) calculated from the DNA sequence and with the molecular mass estimated using SDS-PAGE (41 kDa). These results indicate that it has a monomeric structure. The substrate specificity for endonuclease was measured using various DNA structures hybridized to 32P-labeled oligonucleotide with non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide. The activities are shown in Fig. 3. The recombinant protein cleaved the 5′ single-flap structure but did not cleave the pseudo-Y, bubble and 3′ single-flap structures. The recombinant phFEN cleaved the 5′-overhanging single-strand tail in the flap structure at, and around, the single structure-duplex junction. A major product of 20 nucleotides (80% of total), a minor product of 21 nucleotides (15% of total), and a trace product of 19 nucleotides (5% of total) was detected on a 15% polyacrylamide gel using PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 3 A). The amount of these nucleolytic products was proportional to the quantity of recombinant protein in the reaction mixture; the ratio of each cleavage product to total products was not dependent on the various amounts of the enzyme. The size of these cleavage products suggests that the major cleavage site is located at the single-strand-duplex junction. The minor sites are at one base inside the duplex region and at one base into the single-stranded region. In contrast, no cleavage of the pseudo-Y, bubble, and 3′ flap structures was detected even in the presence of the highest amount (80 ng of protein; data not shown). To determine the effect of the length of 5′-overhanging single-strand in the flap structure, 1 and 5 nucleotides of the 5′-overhanging single strand were used as the flap structure. Recombinant phFEN efficiently cleaved both 1 and 5-nucleotide flap structures. Cleavage products of 1 and 5 nucleotides were generated with no minor products detected, using high amounts of recombinant protein (Fig. 3 B). From these cleavage patterns, the cleavage site was deduced to be only at the single-duplex junction. The effects of pH on activity were also examined. phFEN was optimally active from pH 6.0 to pH 7.0. The activity of phFEN decreased immediately at pH values below 6.0 and over 7.0. The activity could not be detected at pH 5.0 and decreased to 24% at pH 9.4. Thus, the range of optimal pH was broad. The effects of divalent and monovalent metal ions were analyzed. Activity was detected at 0 mm salt, in which neither MgCl2 nor MnCl2 was added to the reaction mixture. The addition of 5 mm EDTA completely inhibited the reaction. From these results, it was deduced that phFEN bound the metal ions and that the metal ions were not removed during the purification steps. The addition of 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm MnCl2, however, increased the activity 1.4-fold (MgCl2) and 1.5-fold (MnCl2). MgCl2 (50 mm), MnCl2 (10 mm), and CaCl2 (10 mm) in the reaction mixture resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of phFEN. With up to 60 mm KCl concentration, the activity of phFEN increased 1.3-fold, but greater amounts of KCl (over 100 mm) also resulted in significant inhibition of activity. Over 60 mm NaCl significantly inhibited activity as well. Thus, the high concentration of divalent metal ions and monovalent ions resulted in inhibition of phFEN. The temperature was increased up to 90 °C in order to estimate the optimal reaction temperature. Even at 80 °C phFEN activity was detected, but the cleavage site did not change. The optimal temperature could not be determined since the activity peak could not be detected. The concentration of the flap substrate in the reaction mixture successively decreased with increasing temperature, whereas the substrate dramatically dissociated into oligonucleotides around the melting temperature (T m). The recombinant protein had a 5′-3′-exonuclease activity with a specificity for 5′-recessed ends (Fig. 3 C). The phFEN did not act on a blunt end or on single-strand DNA (data not shown). Separation of a 15% polyacrylamide gel revealed major monomer (85%) and minor dimer (15%) products. Monomer and dimer products were identified as 5′-nucleotides due to having the same mobility as standard 5′-nucleotides with the same sequence. The 5′ double-stranded flap structure was produced by annealing the D strand to C strand (Fig. 4). This structure has a nick between the B and D strands. The phFEN cleaved the C strand endonucleolytically and appeared to trim the D strand exonucleolytically, as shown in Fig. 4, lanes 1 and3. Mammalian FEN-1, however, reportedly does not cleave the double-strand flap structure (1Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzymatic characteristics of phFEN are quite different from those of mammalian FEN-1. The C and D strands were 5′ end-labeled using [32P]ATP. The 30-mer product of endonuclease activity was detected on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. The size of this cleavage product suggests that the cleavage site is located at the nick position of the C strand, between the B and D strand. The 2-nucleotides and 1-nucleotide cleavage products produced by 5′-exonuclease activity were detected (Fig. 4, lane 3), indicating that 5′-exonuclease activity reduced the D strand from the 5′ end or digested the 5′-recess end of the cleavage product formed by f"

Recent crystallization of the N-terminal region of the binding site revealed two large domains (L1, L2), each organized as a single-stranded right-handed β-helix, connected by a rod-shaped cysteine-rich domain. Here, we analyze two new naturally occurring mutations in a single β-sheet within L1, D59G and L62P, that we previously identified in a young woman with classic congenital insulin resistance (type A). Substitution of D59G, a β-sheet connecting loop residue, caused decreased hormone binding but did not disrupt overall folding, assembly, or movement to the cell surface. In contrast, replacement of the adjacent residue L62P, which is located within the β-sheet, and positioned in a hormone binding surface, completely disrupted intracellular folding, oligomerization, and trafficking and resulted in aberrant proteolytic degradation. Immunohistochemistry in combination with biosynthetic studies showed that misfolded receptors were retained in an incorrect cellular location and that they colocalized with the resident endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin. This study, together with other mutagenesis data, shows that formation of β-sheet elements within the L1 β-helix are critical for the folding of the entire extracellular domain of the receptor and that the hormone contact site is composed in part by residues in this domain.

Members of the tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily regulate central metabolic and growth processes through binding to their corresponding ligands (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Progress in defining the molecular basis of receptor activation has been hampered by a lack of detail regarding binding site structure. The recent determination of the crystal structure of three highly conserved domains in the N terminus of the IGF-I 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; IGF-IR, insulin-like growth factor I receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonal kidney; HIR, human insulin receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; WT, wild-type; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CNX, calnexin.receptor has begun to define the geometry of the unoccupied binding site and allows more precise biochemical testing to understand ligand-receptor interactions (3Garrett T.P.J.

The two flanking domains in the crystal (L1, L2) were previously identified through comparative sequence analysis and are organized as β-sheet segments that assume the overall shape of a loaf of bread (3Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 4Bajaj M.

The two domains are joined by a rod-shaped cysteine-rich region creating a central cavity with three putative hormone binding surfaces directed internally. Rotations about the connecting segment of the cysteine-rich region might reposition the L1 and L2 domains following hormone binding. Additional segments in the C terminus of the receptor extracellular domain implicated in hormone binding might also contribute to the final organization of the binding site (6Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29190-29197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mynarcik D.C.

Facing the central space formed by the L1-Cys-rich-L2 domains is a surface of the L1 domain containing a patch of residues that form a hormone-binding “footprint” based on alanine scanning mutagenesis (9Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The residues are located in four discontinuous positions in the primary sequence that occur on successive parallel β-strands of the β-sheet forming the base of the loaf of bread. The overall L1 domain architecture consists of a single-stranded sequence of β-sheets that assume a novel right-handed helical supersecondary structure, termed a β-helix (3Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The physicochemical properties of many of the amino acids comprising the β-strands are conserved, and several are invariant across the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Although the crystallized fragment did not bind ligand, evidence from both alanine scanning mutagenesis and naturally occurring mutations in the receptor, are consistent with the structure (9Williams P.F.

Recently, we identified two new naturally occurring mutations occurring in the third β-strand of the important ligand binding surface within the major L1 β-sheet (11Rouard M. Macari F. Bouix O. Lautier C. Brun J.F. Lefebvre P. Renard E. Bringer J. Jaffiole C. Grigorescu F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The maternally inherited allele, D59G, is located in a connecting segment that forms a right angle bend between the side walls of the helix, whereas the paternally inherited allele, L62P, is the central residue (and invariant) within the adjacent β-strand. Whereas Gly59 mutant receptors assemble normally and have slightly decreased affinity for insulin, Pro62 mutant receptors are completely misfolded and undergo intracellular proteolytic degradation. The positions of these two residues, and the characteristics of the substituting amino acids, account for the differential effects on receptor folding, trafficking, and function. These mutations therefore provide a further test of the current structural and biochemical data that have contributed to the emerging precision in our view of receptor tyrosine kinase architecture. Overlap polymerase chain reaction was used to generate both Gly59 and Pro62 exon 11+ mutant HIRs (two overlapping fragments, base pairs 127–405 and 385–713, were amplified from a full-length HIR cDNA, purified from low melting point agarose gels, and an overlapping fragment of 586 base pairs was generated by reamplification). The sequence of the 586-base pair fragment was confirmed and the Gly59 and Pro62HIR inserts were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 and pREP4 (Invitrogen), respectively. This allowed coselection with Geneticin for Gly59 (pcDNA 3.1) and hygromycin for Pro62(pREP4). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 12–24 h prior to transfection cells were seeded to 20–40% confluence. Transfection was performed using the polycationic liposome Dosper (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer, using 6 μg of DNA and 1 μl of Dosper for each 6-cm cell plate. Following transfection, cells were grown in regular medium minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% serum for 24 h, prior to the addition of selection medium. Cells expressing Gly59and Pro62 HIRs were selected for growth in the antibiotic Geneticin (800 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.), and resistant colonies were then cloned and expanded. Cells expressing both Gly59 and Pro62 HIRs were selected for growth in both Geneticin and hygromycin B (300 μg/ml, Sigma). HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type receptors were a generous gift of Dr. Jonathan Whittaker (Hagedorn Research Institute, Gentofte, Denmark) and were maintained in both Geneticin (800 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (300 μg/ml). Metabolic labeling was performed in poly-l-lysine-treated culture dishes (Sigma, P1274; 0.1 mg/ml in PBS). Cell labeling was performed following ∼1-h preincubation in methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Labeling was then performed by addition of methionine/cysteine-free medium containing 200–300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. After labeling, medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times in warm PBS followed by chase in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine (2 mm of each). At the completion of chase, cells were rinsed twice in cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.55), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. A protease inhibitor mixture containing 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin was included in the lysis buffer. Nuclei were pelleted at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf bench top microcentrifuge, and the soluble lysate fraction was processed for immunoprecipitation. The postnuclear supernatant was precleared with nonimmune serum followed by immunoprecipitation with antireceptor monoclonal antibody 8314 kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Siddle (Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The immune complex was sedimented with protein A-agarose (Pierce), washed twice in high salt buffer (300 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and once in the same buffer containing low salt (140 mm NaCl). The bound complex was either eluted with glycine (0.2 m (pH 2.5)) prior to dissolving in Laemmli sample buffer or directly redissolved in Laemmli sample buffer in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol or 10% β-mercaptoethanol, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and then analyzed either by 3–10% linear gradient SDS-PAGE (nonreducing gels) or 5/8% SDS-PAGE (reducing gels). For analysis under reducing conditions, washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in Laemmli buffer prior to application to the gels. After electrophoresis at 50 volts for 18–20 h, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 25% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Molecular mass estimates were made by comparing the relative mobility of the receptor bands to molecular mass standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm plates, washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with 1 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce catalog number 21217) for 30 min on ice. Monolayers were washed in PBS containing 15 mm glycine and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Receptors were immunoprecipitated, electrophoresed through 5/8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore) for blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:750 dilution). ECL was used to visualize the biotinylated receptors, and blots were subsequently stripped (at 55 °C for 1 h in 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 63 mmTris (pH 6.8)) and reprobed with an anti-HIR β-subunit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). HEK 293 cells were grown to confluence in poly-l-lysine-coated 10-cm culture plates and incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm insulin for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer as described above with the addition of 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm vanadate, and 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above, and samples were processed by SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting to Immobilon. Phosphorylated proteins were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and visualized by ECL. Blots were then stripped and reprobed with an anti-HIR β-subunit antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Confluent cells grown on poly-l-lysine treated 24 wells plates were washed three times with cold PBS and then incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with 20 pm [iodo-TyrA14]insulin in binding buffer (1× Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), and 10 mg/ml BSA) in the presence of varying concentrations of nonlabeled insulin. Following incubation, unbound insulin was removed, and cells were washed twice with cold PBS and solubilized in 0.25 n NaOH at room temperature for 2 h. Bound counts were counted in a γ counter and analyzed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) (12Bass J. Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19367-19375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 20–30% confluent cells monolayers, grown on poly-l-lysine-treated glass coverslips, were washed on the day of the experiment twice with cold PBS for 10 min. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized where indicated for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated for 30 min in a blocking solution 2% normal goat serum in PBS (NGS). Coverslips were then incubated with primary antibody diluted in 2% NGS overnight (dilution of anti-HIR 8314, 1:250 and anti-calnexin, 1:200 (Transduction Laboratories). After three washes for 10 min in 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T), secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody was added to the cells for 18 h at a 1:500 dilution in PBS/NGS (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were washed again with PBS-T and streptavidin-coupled FITC (for anti-calnexin primary; dilution 1:3000 in PBS/NGS) or Cy3 (for anti-HIR primary; dilution 1:3000 in PBS/NGS) was added. Cells were washed twice with PBS-T and chromogenic chromatin stain was applied (Hoechst 33342, 10 mg/ml in PBS). After two additional washes, coverslips were directly mounted on glass slides, and imaging was performed using an Axioplan microscope coupled to a CCD camera (Zeiss, Germany). Fluorescence intensity in both the FITC and Cy3 spectrum was pseudocolored, and montages of images were prepared by using ADOBE Photoshop® 4.0. Molecular modeling was carried out based on the x-ray structure of the L1 domain of the IGF-I receptor as described previously (3Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D.

The L1 and L2 domains of human IGF-IR and HIR were aligned, and the side chains for residues of IR were modeled on the IGF-IR structure.

To elucidate the effects of each mutation on the conformational maturation of the receptor, we followed movement of newly synthesized receptors through the secretory pathway and monitored the tertiary and quaternary changes by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Four conformational intermediates are characteristically detected by this analysis, and progress between each intermediate requires intact disulfide bond formation, exposure of a dimerization surface, and movement into the late trans Golgi apparatus for carbohydrate capping (14Olson T.S. Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7342-7351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bass J. Chiu G. Argon Y. Steiner D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The appearance of these four species in cell lines expressing wild-type receptors indicates both correct folding and movement to the cell surface (Fig. 1, WT HIR, the early monomer (EM), late monomer (LM), dimer (D), and tetramer (T)). Gly59 mutant receptors similarly demonstrated normal tertiary and quaternary conformational maturation based on the appearance of the four intermediates on nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, G59 HIR). In contrast, pulse-chase studies with cell lines expressing the Pro62 HIR mutant receptors revealed marked differences from that of either the wild-type or the Gly59 HIR. Analysis of the receptor by nonreducing gels showed the initial appearance of early monomer and late monomer species, however the LM did not progress to the dimer at late chase time points (Fig. 1, P62 HIR). Since dimerization has previously been shown to be necessary for export out of the ER, the failure of Pro62 to dimerize suggests that it is trapped in the early secretory pathway (14Olson T.S. Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7342-7351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in contrast to wild-type and Gly59 receptors, Pro62 mutant proreceptors did not undergo the same proteolytic cleavage and carbohydrate modification observed for wild-type receptors. Instead, Pro62 mutant proreceptors were proteolytically cleaved to generate two smaller fragments of ∼120 and ∼80 kDa and subsequently degraded without transport to the cell surface (see “Discussion”). HEK 293 cells expressing both Gly59 and Pro62 mutant HIRs demonstrated only partial conversion to the tetramer at late chase time points; however, it was not possible to quantitate the amount of pro-HIR processing in these cells due to the low expression level of the hybrid Gly59/Pro62 HIRs (data not shown). While biosynthetic studies provided biochemical evidence that Pro62 mutant receptors failed to undergo dimerization and ER export, direct visualization of the receptors was used to further examine their fate in the cell. Cell surface and intracellular receptor pools were distinguished by performing immunohistochemistry either in intact or permeabilized cells. Cells expressing the wild-type receptor showed abundant cell surface insulin receptors as detected by the red fluorescence signal in intact cells following incubation with a primary antireceptor antibody followed by a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig.2, WT HIR, panel 2). Similarly, in nonpermeabilized cells expressing Gly59 mutant receptors, the receptor was detected both on the cell surface in intact cells and intracellularly following permeabilization (Fig. 2, G59 HIR, panels 2 and5). However, the pattern of immunofluorescence in nonpermeabilized cells expressing Pro62 mutant receptors was markedly different. There was no fluorescence detected for the receptor in intact cells, rather, following permeabilization a robust receptor signal was visible (Fig. 2, P62 HIR , panel 2 versus panel 5). Following permeabilization, the FITC (green) CNX signal was detected in a diffuse reticular pattern throughout the cytoplasm, with the most intense signal found in the perinuclear area (Figs. 2, panel 6). Double immunofluorescence with both CNX and HIR antibodies indicated colocalization of Pro62 mutant receptors with CNX, consistent with retention of the receptor in the ER (Fig. 2, P62 HIR, panel 6). Overall, the immunocytochemical experiments provide visual evidence that Pro62 HIRs are trapped intracellularly and fail to progress to the cell surface. Biotinylation was used as an additional test to determine whether Pro62 mutant receptors were present on the cell surface. Intact cells expressing either Pro62 mutant or wild-type receptors were biotinylated, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and anti-β-subunit antibodies (data not shown). Densitometry of the blots was used to compare the levels of cell surface-biotinylated receptor with the total lysate receptor pool. Cells expressing Pro62 mutant receptors were found to have a 97% reduction in the relative ratio of cell surface to intracellular receptors compared with cells expressing the wild-type receptor. We previously showed that inheritance of a single Gly59 mutant receptor allele in the proband's mother resulted in marked insulin resistance, yet the biosynthetic and immunohistochemical studies reported here did not indicate any major abnormalities in conformational maturation. To assess Gly59 HIR function in more detail, we performed both insulin binding studies and analyzed insulin-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation in intact cells expressing Gly59 mutant receptors. EC50 values were similar for both the wild-type (∼2 nm) and Pro62 (∼3 nm) mutants. In contrast, the EC50 value for Gly59 HIR was decreased to ∼8 nm, showing a reduced affinity for ligand compared with the recombinant wild-type receptor. We used insulin-induced autophosphorylation to further examine the insulin sensitivity of mutant and wild-type receptors (Fig.3). Cells were stimulated with 0.1 μm insulin for 5 min, lysed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, immunoprecipitated, and electophoresed on reducing gels. Immunoblotting was first performed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by anti-HIR β-subunit antibody. As seen in Fig. 3, a robust signal was obtained for the wild-type receptor, indicating full hormone responsiveness. The same membranes were stripped and reprobed with an anti-HIR β-subunit antibody, which allowed comparison of the relative autophosphorylation of Gly59, Pro62, and recombinant wild-type receptors. Phosphorylation of wild-type receptors was quantitative with 0.1 μm insulin, a concentration that maximally stimulates the receptor. In contrast, autophosphorylation of the Pro62HIR was reduced following insulin stimulation, while total cellular receptor levels were equivalent to HIR levels in cells expressing recombinant wild-type HIR. The amount of pro-HIR was also higher in cells expressing the Pro62 HIR compared with the wild-type HIR (Fig. 3). Very little mature β-subunit was present in cells expressing Pro62 HIR, instead, multiple proteolytic fragments were detected that were immunoreactive with the anti-HIR antibody (Fig. 3, lower panel, lanes 5 and6). One of the proteolytic fragments of Leu62(∼80 kDa, Fig. 3, panel B, lanes 5 and 6) was close in position to that of the β-subunit of recombinant wild-type HIR (Fig. 3, panel B, lanes 1 and2). Although cells expressing Gly59 mutant receptors produced more mature β-subunit than Pro62 HIR, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gly59 HIR β-subunit was reduced compared with wild-type HIR based on densitometry of blots in Fig. 3, panel A. Together, these studies indicated decreased affinity of Gly59 HIR for insulin and correspondingly decreased insulin-induced autophosphorylation. The N-terminal L1-Cys-rich-L2 domains of the insulin and IGF I receptors constitute a major component of the hormone binding site and are organized in an independently folded superhelical topology (9Williams P.F.

Three hormone contact sites within the L1 domains form a central cavity that likely accommodates ligand (3Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and molecular modeling predicted the three-dimensional fold of this region with a high degree of accuracy (4Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The model of Bajaj et al. (4Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was also well supported by the finding that many naturally occurring mutations in conserved amino acids positioned in this fold caused defects in biosynthesis and function. The present study demonstrates that formation of a single β-strand within the major L1 domain β-sheet is vital for the folding and conformational maturation of the entire receptor and that its disruption results in severe clinical insulin resistance. Fig. 4 identifies the positions of both amino acids Asp59 and Leu62 within the L1-Cys-rich-L2 polypeptide fold. The topology of both L1 and L2 domains is that of a rectangle composed of β-sheets in the base and side walls (a β-helix). Residue Leu62 localizes to a central β-strand that forms part of the β-sheet on the base of the L1 domain, and substitution with proline alters the local conformation (Fig. 4 A). Proline is absent from most β-structural segments in proteins and stereochemical restrictions disfavor proline in β-sheets (23Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 110Google Scholar). In the case of the proline mutant, the main chain twists around forcing the previous carbonyl oxygen (residue 61) into the core. The Pro62 substitution also forces the carbonyl oxygen of the previous β-strand (residue 33) inwards, since the nitrogen of position 62 is occupied by the proline side chain. Local conformational strain in the L1 β-sheet induces misfolding throughout the entire extracellular domain and prevents dimerization or export out of the ER. In contrast residue Asp59 is semiconserved and located in the short right angle bend connecting the side-wall and base of the L1 domain (Fig. 4). Gly59 HIR showed a small decrease in both insulin-induced autophosphorylation (Fig. 3) and in insulin binding when compared with recombinant wild-type HIR. This result was consistent with clinical studies showing decreased binding affinity in erythrocytes from the proband's mother and with alanine substitution at the same position (9Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Rouard M. Macari F. Bouix O. Lautier C. Brun J.F. Lefebvre P. Renard E. Bringer J. Jaffiole C. Grigorescu F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Substitution with glycine at this position does not cause stereochemical restriction, particularly since this residue is not contained within a region of defined secondary structure (Fig. 4). Moreover, both glycine and aspartic acid have a high level of mutual replacements in globular proteins (23Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 110Google Scholar). This might explain the normal folding and processing of Gly59 HIR, although subtle conformational changes still prevent normal insulin binding. In summary, the effects of two new naturally occurring mutations in the insulin receptor analyzed here highlight unique aspects of the architecture of the extracellular domain and its biosynthesis. Since it was recently shown that fusion of L1-Cys-rich-L2 domains to 12 amino acids in the C terminus of the α-subunit conferred insulin binding to the three N-terminal domains, it is likely that these domains are in geometric proximity in the native receptor (8Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observation that substitution in the most N-terminal structural domain induces complete misfolding indicates that the L1 domain forms a scaffolding that is kinetically responsible for this process. In its native conformation, the L1 domain is also accessible for ligand binding, as evident from both the analysis of D59G mutant receptors and previous studies of mutant receptors (24van der Vorm E.R. van der Zon G.C.M.

Residues in L2 have also been implicated in ligand binding, yet in the crystal structure, L1 and L2 are not close enough to bind simultaneously to IGF I or insulin (5McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J.

The possibility remains that either ligand-induced rotation repositions L2 closer to L1 or that a second α-subunit contributes an additional binding surface. Studies are currently in progress to examine how misfolding of the L1 domain induces retention and degradation of the non-native conformer. Understanding the native organization of the receptor extracellular domain in the unoccupied state and elucidating the kinetics of domain folding will provide insight into the structural basis of ligand binding and conformational changes that lead to receptor activation.

To investigate the mechanism underlying the glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid specificity of the GR, we used a yeast model system to screen for GR ligand-binding domain mutants, substituted with MR residues in the segment 565–574, that can be efficiently activated by aldosterone. In all such increased activity mutants, valine 571 was replaced by methionine, even though most mutants also contained substitutions of other residues with their MR counterparts. Further analysis in yeast and COS-7 cells has revealed that the identity of residue 571 determines the behavior of other MR substituted residues in the 565–574 segment. Generally, MR substitutions in this region are only consistent with aldosterone binding if residue 571 is also replaced with methionine (MR conformation). If residue 571 is valine (GR conformation), most other MR substitution mutants drastically reduce interaction with both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones. Based on these functional data, we hypothesize that residue 571 functions as a regional organizer involved in discriminating between glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones.

The steroid hormone receptors belong to the nuclear receptor family (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar) of ligand-induced transcription factors. They are structurally and functionally related, and their structure can be divided into three main domains. A central domain binds to hormone response elements in the DNA, an N-terminal region mediates transactivation, and a C-terminal domain binds the steroid (2Carlstedt-Duke J. Strömstedt P.-E.

The unliganded steroid receptors are complexed with chaperone proteins, including a dimer of hsp90 (3Pratt W.B. Hutchison K.A. Scherrer L.C. Trends Endocrinol.

When ligand binds, the receptor dissociates from the complex and triggers a cascade of events that finally leads to the biological response of the steroid. The steroid hormone is an integral part of the transcriptionally active receptor complex and is almost completely buried within the folds of the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Binding of the steroid actively modulates the structure of the receptor into a DNA-binding transcriptionally active complex (4Parker M.G. White R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M.

The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and GR are two closely related members of this family with structural and functional similarities. The DNA- and ligand-binding domains are relatively well conserved (94 and 57% sequence identity, respectively), whereas the N-terminal domains are less well conserved (7Arriza J.L. Weinberger C.

There is also an overlap in function between the steroids, so that even though mineralocorticoids regulate renal sodium retention and are the main regulating components of salt balance, blood pressure, and intravascular volume, glucocorticoids also have a pronounced effect on these physiological processes, involving both MR- and GR-dependent mechanisms (13Miller W.L. Tyrrell J.B. Felig P. Baxter J.D. Frohman L.D. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 555-711Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids also specifically regulate a range of many other processes, including the development of specific tissues, glucose metabolism, and the immune response (13Miller W.L. Tyrrell J.B. Felig P. Baxter J.D. Frohman L.D. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 555-711Google Scholar). The ligand-binding domain of GR consists of about 250 amino acids, which is thought to fold into a hydrophobic pocket that binds the steroid. The crystal structure is not yet resolved, but it is likely to be quite similar to the structures of the ligand-binding domains of PR, ER, TR, retinoic acid receptor, and retinoid X receptor, which are all folded into three-layered antiparallel α-helical sandwich structures (5Brzozowski A.M.

The difference between the crystal structures of retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor LBD, as well as the structure of ER bound to various ligands, has clearly shown that the ligand actively induces a conformational change in the structure of the domain, particulary with regard to the positioning of helix 12. Mutational analysis has been used to analyze the importance of different amino acids in the binding of steroids, and most mutations lead to receptors with decreased affinity (17Danielsen M.

The differences in structure between the mineralocorticoids deoxycorticosterone, aldosterone, 18-OH-deoxycorticosterone, and 18-OH-corticosterone and the glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are at the 11β and 18 positions of the steroid. Thus, the regions of the LBD interacting with these positions would be expected to be important in the selective recognition of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. One segment possibly involved is that centered around Gly-567 in hGR, because it has been suggested that the corresponding residue in human PR (G722), is important in accommodating the bulky 11β-side chain of RU 486 (21Benhamou B. Garcia T. Lerouge T. Vergezac A. Gofflo D. Bigogne C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Science. 1992; 255: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Gly-722 in human PR to cysteine, which has a larger side chain, abolished binding of RU 486, but not binding of an agonist. Warriaret al. (25Warriar N. Yu C. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29010-29015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mutated Gly-567, Met-565, and Ala-573 in hGR LBD to the corresponding amino acids in the human MR sequence (Ala, Arg, and Gln, respectively). They found that mutants M565R and A573Q bound aldosterone and dexamethasone better than wild type, whereas binding of these steroids to the mutant G567A was almost completely abolished (25Warriar N. Yu C. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29010-29015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we have taken a broader approach to determining the role of the amino acid segment Met-565–Ala-574 of the hGR LBD in discriminating between glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding. Following in vitro mutagenesis of this segment, screening for mutants with increased activity with aldosterone was carried out in a yeast system. By further characterization of the mutants in COS-7 cells, we could show that residues in this region play qualitatively different roles in the discrimination between glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. [3H]TA was obtained from NEN Life Science Products, unlabeled steroids from Sigma, and cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin from Life Technologies, Inc. The single copy number yeast vector pRS315-NX expressing hGR, the yeast reporter vector pLGZ-TAT, the mammalian vector pCMV-hGR expressing hGR, and the mammalian reporter vector p19-luc-TK are described elsewhere (26Lind U. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1358-1370PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed according to the refined method of Kunkel (30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar, 31McClary J.A. Witney F. Geisselsoder J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant forms of pRS315NX were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to change the six amino acids in the segment 565–574 of hGR LBD that differ between GR and MR (Met-565, Gly-567, Arg-569, Val-571, Ala-573, and Ala-574) to the corresponding ones in MR (Arg, Ala, Lys, Met, Gln, and Val, respectively). By using a degenerate oligonucleotide, mutant receptors with mutation of one to six amino acids in all possible combinations were created. Only one base in each codon had to be changed in GR to create the equivalent MR amino acid, except at position 573, where two bases had to be changed. The oligonucleotide (see Fig. 1) was synthesized by adding equal amounts of the GR and MR base for each codon. At position 573, where two bases had to be altered, two more alternative amino acids, Pro and Glu, in addition to Gln, could be created. The resulting combination of different mutant plasmids was transformed into Escherichia coli by electroporation. A miniprep of DNA (Wizard miniprep, Promega, Madison, WI) was made from a pool of bacterial colonies and used to transform yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae strain FY 23 (MAT α, ura 3–52, trp 1-Δ 63, leu 2-Δ1); generously provided by Dr. Fred Winston) by the method of Gietz and Schiestl (32Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Screening was performed by replica plating approximately 1000 yeast transformants onto X-gal plates containing galactose and a battery of different hormones. Interesting yeast transformants from this screening were rescreened by spotting a suspension of each yeast transformant containing about 5 × 105 cells on X-gal plates. The activity of the different mutants relative to wild type was determined by the degree of blueness the colonies achieved. Directed mutagenesis was used to reconstruct the mutants that were selected for further studies after the yeast screen and to construct additional mutants that were characterized in the β-galactosidase assay. Kunkel mutagenesis was performed using oligonucleotides encoding the different amino acid substitutions and dideoxy sequencing was performed to confirm the mutations. Yeast cells were grown in galactose-containing medium for 18–24 h to a density ofA 600 0.2–0.8. They were then diluted toA 600 0.1, and 10-ml aliquots were incubated in a shaker at 30 °C with various concentrations of different hormones for 6 h. The cells were then harvested and assayed for β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration (29Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was expressed as nanomoles ofo-nitrophenyl-β-O-galactoside substrate converted/min/mg of protein. Preparation of DNA from yeast was made according to the method described by Kaiser and Auer (33Kaiser P. Auer B. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 552PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification that electroporated bacteria were plated out and allowed to form single colonies before growth in culture. DNA was then prepared with Wizard minipreps, and Sanger dideoxy sequencing was performed using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. When making dose-response curves, 6-cm plates containing cells at 60–80% confluency, plated out the day before transfection, were transfected with 0.1 μg of expression vector and 4 μg of p19TK luc, using DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 4.5 h after transfection, hormones were added to the cells, and 20–24 h later, a luciferase assay was performed. For ligand binding assays and competitive binding assays, 10-cm plates containing cells at 60–80% confluency, plated out 1–3 days before transfection, were transfected with 15 μg of expression vector using DOTAP. Cells were incubated 48 h after transfection before assays on cytosolic cell extracts were performed. Transfected cells from 6-cm plates were scraped into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Luciferase activity was measured in 30 μl of extract in a Bioorbit 1253 luminometer in a total volume of 500 μl containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 μm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 90 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, and 0.2 mg of luciferin/ml. The reaction was started by the addition of luciferin and enzyme activity was measured directly. The results are expressed as light units measured. All assays were performed in triplicate using three separate plates of transfected cells. Cells were washed with and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline and spun in a microcentrifuge. They were then resuspended in EPGMo buffer (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 20 mm sodium molybdate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and homogenized with a glass homogenizer, and the lysate was spun for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. For ligand binding assays, different concentrations of [3H]TA (0.1–2.5 nm) were added. For competitive binding assays, 2.5 nm [3H]TA and increasing concentrations of cold aldosterone were added. The extracts were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Bound and free [3H]TA were then separated by gel filtration on a nick column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the amount of [3H]TA bound was measured in a scintillation counter. Free [3H]TA was calculated as total minus bound [3H]TA. The level of unspecific binding was negligible as controlled by adding a 200-fold excess of cold TA to the different concentrations of [3H]TA. Analysis of variance was carried out using the Newman-Keuls test using the program STATGRAPHICS for Windows (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK). Curve fitting was carried out using the program Kaleidagraph. The following functions were used for curve fitting. Dose-response transactivation curves were calculated as follows,R=(Rmax·H)(EC50+H)+bEquation 1 where r = response, H = hormone concentration, and b = background. Competitive binding was calculated as follows,B=(Bmax·B)B+EC50·1+Hki+bEquation 2 where B = concentration bound radiolabeled hormone, H = concentration of free competing hormone, and b = background. k i values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation,ki=IC501+LKdEquation 3 where L = concentration tritiated steroid in competitive binding assays. To study the role of amino acids 565–574 in hGR LBD in discriminating between glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding, we performed in vitro mutagenesis of this segment. The six amino acids that differ between the two receptors in this segment were randomly mutated using a degenerate oligonucleotide that gave equal probability of having an MR or GR amino acid at each position (see Fig. 1). A pool of mutant plasmids was thus created, containing receptors with one to six mutations in different combinations. The mutant plasmids were transformed into yeast together with a GRE-Lac Z reporter and approximately 1000 yeast transformants were replica-plated to X-gal plates containing aldosterone, cortisol, progesterone, TA, or deoxycorticosterone. The primary aim was to find mutants with increased activity on aldosterone, but other hormones were also included in the screening to allow detection of mutants with altered specificity. 45 colonies that were more blue than wild type on all or some hormones were rescreened by spotting an equal number of cells from each clone onto X-gal plates containing different hormones, and of those, 30 still remained more active on all or some hormones. 22 of the most blue superactive clones on aldosterone plates were sequenced, and all 22 clones were found to contain the mutation V571M, either in isolation or in combination with other mutations (TableI). We also sequenced some randomly selected inactive mutations (white colonies) and found the single mutation M565R and the double mutations G567A/R569K and G567A/A574V, none of which contained the V571M mutation. Due to the design of the degenerate oligonucleotide (see under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1), two additional amino acids at position 573 were also possible, in addition to the GR- and MR-specific alanine and glutamine (glutamate and proline). Mutants containing these amino acid substitutions were not considered for further studies.Table IMutants superactive on X-gal plates containing aldosteroneMutants superactive with aldosteroneNo. of clonesV571M5V571M/A573E4V571M/A573Q2V571M/A574V3R569K/V571M3V571M/A573E/A574V4G567A/V571M/A574V1Around 1000 yeast-transformants containing mutations in the region Met-565–Ala-574 of the GR LBD were screened for increased activity on aldosterone.

Open table in a new tab Around 1000 yeast-transformants containing mutations in the region Met-565–Ala-574 of the GR LBD were screened for increased activity on aldosterone. Thirty mutants were found to be more active with aldosterone than wild type GR of which twenty-two were sequenced. For further characterization in yeast we chose the superactive mutants V571M, R569K/V571M, V571M/A573Q, and GM3AMV (cf.Fig. 1) detected in the plate screening. To minimize the risk that the mutants found in the screen contained nonprogrammed mutations elsewhere in the receptor, we recreated the mutations by directed mutagenesis. In addition, in order to analyze the influence of the single mutations in the receptors containing multiple mutations, we also created all six single mutations separately (including V571M, which was already found in the screen) and one receptor containing all six mutations in combination (GM6RAKMQV, cf. Fig. 1). The phenotypes of the selected mutants were tested in a β-galactosidase assay with the hormones TA, aldosterone, and corticosterone (Fig. 2). The mutations could be grouped into three groups with regard to their activity on aldosterone compared with wild type; those with lower activity (group 1), those with similar activity (group 2), and those with higher activity (group 3). Group 1 consists of the single mutations G567A, R569K, and A574V (Fig. 2 A), which had less activity than wild type on all three hormones, and M565R, which had about equal activity with TA, but clearly less activity on corticosterone and aldosterone. Group 2 consists of the double mutant R569K/V571M, which in this assay had less activity with TA, but about the same activity with corticosterone and aldosterone (Fig. 2 B). Finally, group 3 consists of the mutants having higher activity with aldosterone: V571M, A573Q, the double mutant V571M /A573Q, the triple mutant GM3AMV, and the mutant with all six amino acids changed GM6RAKMQV (Fig. 2 C). All mutants in this group were more active with all hormones, with the exception of V571M, which had the same activity with TA as wild type GR. To confirm the phenotypes of the mutants in COS-7 cells, we transferred wild type and mutant cDNA into a mammalian CMV-based expression vector and co-transfected these into the COS-7 cells together with a luciferase reporter vector consisting of two GREs and the tk-promoter upstream of the luciferase gene. Because our goal was to identify mutants with increased function on aldosterone, mutants with the same or lower activity compared with wild type could be eliminated from further studies. In order to identify mutants with lower activity than wild type GR in COS-7 cells, we made a first screen at one concentration of TA, aldosterone and corticosterone. In this assay M565R, G567A, R569K, and A574V (group 1) all had less activity on aldosterone (Fig.3), thus reflecting their behavior in yeast. G567A, R569K, and A574V had less activity than wild type with all hormones, whereas M565R had less activity with aldosterone and corticosterone and similar activity with TA. The mutant R569K/V571M was also excluded from further studies due to its similarity in activity to wild type in yeast (Fig. 2 B). The phenotypes of the remaining mutants (group 3 that were superactive in yeast), were first characterized with regard to their sensitivity to aldosterone by adding increasing amounts of aldosterone to plates containing transfected cells, thus creating dose-response curves (Fig.4). Four of the five mutants were more sensitive to aldosterone than wild type in this experiment (Fig.4 A), with EC50 values ranging from 3.4 to 12 times less than that of the wild type receptor (TableII). The decreases in EC50values were statistically significant compared with wild type GR for all four mutants. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the EC50 of the V571M mutant (3.4 times less than wild type GR) compared with the other three mutants V571M /A573Q, GM3AMV and GM6RAKMQV (7–12 times less than that of wild type GR). We have not been able to show any significant alteration in the sensitivity of the single point mutant GR A573Q (Fig. 4 B), compared with wild-type GR and thus this mutant was not studied further with TA or aldosterone.Table IITranscriptional activation and binding affinity for triamcinolone acetonide and aldosterone for wild type and mutant GRMutantEC50aldosteroneIC50 aldosteronek ialdosteroneEC50 TAK d TAnmWild type491 ± 215224 ± 4032 ± 5.80.33 ± 0.170.42 ± 0.07(n = 13)(n = 7)(n = 7)(n = 7)(n = 5)V571M143 ± 103aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).91 ± 27aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).13 ± 3.8aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).0.18 ± 0.0870.42 ± 0.14(n = 9)(n = 7)(n = 7)(n = 5)(n = 5)A573Q554 ± 251NDbND, not determined.NDNDND(n = 5)V571M/A573Q42 ± 18aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).91 ± 28aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).5.7 ± 1.7aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).0.07 ± 0.03aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).0.17 ± 0.03aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).(n = 11)(n = 7)(n = 7)(n = 5)(n = 5)GM3AMV51 ± 26aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).NDND0.25 ± 0.11ND(n = 5)(n = 5)GM6RAKMQV63 ± 17aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).NDND0.12 ± 0.08aSignificantly different from wild type GR (p < 0.05).ND(n = 5)(n = 7)Summary of transcriptional activation and binding affinity for wild type and mutant GR transiently expressed in COS-7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2131271627,"Chimeras of the catalytic subunits of the gastric H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase were constructed and expressed in LLC-PK1 cells. The chimeras included the following: (i) a control, H85N (the first 85 residues comprising the cytoplasmic N terminus of Na,K-ATPase replaced by the analogous region of H,K-ATPase); (ii) H85N/H356–519N (the N-terminal half of the cytoplasmic M4–M5 loop also replaced); and (iii) H519N (the entire front half replaced). The latter two replacements confer a decrease in apparent affinity for extracellular K+. The 356–519 domain and, to a greater extent, the H519N replacement confer increased apparent selectivity for protons relative to Na+ at cytoplasmic sites as shown by the persistence of K+ influx when the proton concentration is increased and the Na+concentration decreased. The pH and K+ dependence of ouabain-inhibitable ATPase of membranes derived from the transfected cells indicate that the H519N and, to a lesser extent, the H356–519N substitution decrease the effectiveness of K+ to compete for protons at putative cytoplasmic H+ activation sites. Notable pH-independent behavior of H85N/H356–519N at low Na+ suggests that as pH is decreased, Na+/K+ exchange is replaced largely by (Na+ + H+)/K+ exchange. With H519N, the pH and Na+ dependence of pump and ATPase activities suggest relatively active H+/K+ exchange even at neutral pH. Overall, this study provides evidence for important roles in cation selectivity for both the N-terminal half of the M4–M5 loop and the adjacent transmembrane helice(s).

Overall, this study provides evidence for important roles in cation selectivity for both the N-terminal half of the M4–M5 loop and the adjacent transmembrane helice(s). The gastric H,K-ATPase and ubiquitous Na,K-ATPase have the highest sequence similarity (62% amino acid sequence homology) of the phosphorylating class (P-type) of ion motive ATPases. The reaction sequence catalyzed by these enzymes involves ATP binding followed by cation-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of an aspartyl residue at the active site, as well as conformational and vectorial transitions of phospho- and dephosphoenzyme. These reactions transduce the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into cation binding at one side of the membrane followed by occlusion in an ion-binding pocket and then cation release at the opposite side of the membrane. Sequence similarity between these enzymes is greatest in the regions associated with ATP binding and phosphorylation (for review see Ref. 1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The basic structural and reaction sequence similarity notwithstanding, the catalytic subunit of each is associated with a distinct non-catalytic β subunit, and the two enzymes differ with respect to their cation selectivity and sensitivity to inhibitors. However, we showed earlier that the affinity or selectivity of these two enzymes for cations is not absolute. Although the selectivity and/or reactivity of the Na,K-ATPase for H+ (H3O+) and the H,K-ATPase for Na+ are low, nevertheless the Na,K-ATPase can pump protons in place of Na+ ions at acidic pH (2Polvani C. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16757-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the gastric H,K-ATPase, Na+ in place of protons at alkaline pH (3Polvani C. Sachs G. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17854-17859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This behavior underscores the similarities between these two enzymes and has the important implication that the cation binding domain probably involves a cluster of oxygen or possibly nitrogen atoms coordinating with either Na+ or hydrated protons (H3O+) reminiscent of complexes formed with cyclic polyethers as discussed by Boyer (4Boyer P.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 12: 5-7Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the structural basis for the distinct cation selectivity of the two P-type pumps, we have initiated studies of the selectivity of Na+ versus protons for activation of activity using pumps comprising chimeric catalytic subunits of the rat α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase. Presumably, regions of dissimilarity in their α subunits include structures which confer the distinct ligand binding/reactivities of the two ion pumps. In an earlier study (5Blostein R. Zhang R.-P. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that the replacement of the front-half of the Na,K-ATPase with that of the H,K-ATPase produced a functional chimera, H519N, which could be readily distinguished from the parent enzymes by virtue of its distinct sensitivity to ouabain. Unlike the parent H,K-ATPase, its activity is ouabain-sensitive, albeit with much lower sensitivity than that of the endogenous highly ouabain-sensitive pig kidney Na,K-ATPase of the LLC-PK1cells into which this chimera was transfected. In the present study, we have focused our attention on the cation selectivity changes affected by chimeric replacements within the front-half of the Na,K-ATPase, namely an N-terminal H85N chimera which served as a control and two others of which one (H85N/H356–519N) comprises an H356–519N as well as the H85N replacement, and the other, H519N, which comprises the entire front-half of the gastric H,K-ATPase appended to the back-half of the Na,K-ATPase. The chimeras presented in this paper were generated between the rat Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit (cDNA provided by E. Benz, The Johns Hopkins University) and the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α subunit (cDNA provided by G. Shull, University of Cincinnati). Fragments of each cDNA were exchanged using the restriction sites ApaI, corresponding to H,K-ATPase amino acid number 85, HpaI at amino acid 356, and NarI at amino acid 519. The ApaI and HpaI sites were introduced into the cDNAs using the Kunkel method of site-directed mutagenesis. The Na,K-ATPase α subunit was mutated at base pair (bp) 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 465 Cys → Gly to form the ApaI site and at bp 1273 Cys → Thr and Cys → Ala at bp 1275 to form the HpaI site. The H,K-ATPase α subunit already contained an ApaI site but was mutated at bp 1268 Ala → Gly, bp 1269 Cys → Thr, and bp 1271 Gly → Ala to introduce the HpaI site. These mutations did not change the amino acid sequence. Chimera H85N was constructed in the plasmid pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains an ApaI site in the polylinker of pSP72 upstream of the cDNA insert, by subcloning the smallApaI fragment of the H,K-ATPase into the complementary portion of the Na,K-ATPase. Chimera H85N/H356–519N was created by inserting the HpaI/NarI fragment from the H,K-ATPase α subunit into chimera H85N. Both constructs were sequenced through the ligation points. LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells were grown in α-minimum essential media or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Subconfluent cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (6Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1987; 6: 632-638Google Scholar) with chimera constructs that had been subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCB6 (kindly provided by M. Roth, University of Texas Southwestern) which carries resistance to the antibiotic G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were selected in media containing 1.8 mg/ml G418. Clones were screened for expression by immunofluorescence and Western blotting as described previously (7Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and routinely passaged in media containing 1 μm ouabain. Among the chimera-transfected cells which failed to survive this selection one, H519N-transfected LLC-PK1 cells, did survive in culture medium supplemented with additional (5 mm) K+. Assays of pump-mediated K+influx were carried out using KCl and 86Rb+, as a congener of K+ added in trace amounts, with cells grown in 24-well costar plates as described previously (5Blostein R. Zhang R.-P. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the monensin concentration was 12 μm, and both the preincubation and assays with medium containing monensin were carried out for 10 min at 37 °C. Na+ concentrations shown represent extracellular Na+ concentrations, and it is assumed that intracellular Na+ is reasonably close to extracellular Na+ concentration under these conditions (cf.

Each value shown represents the mean ± S.E. of the difference between the means of triplicate determinations carried out in the presence of low (10−5m) and high (5 × 10−3m) ouabain concentrations. Intracellular pH of transfected cultured cells was determined at 37 °C essentially as described by Kaplan and Boron (10Kaplan D.L. Boron W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4116-4124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF and the K+/nigericin calibration procedure of Thomas et al. (11Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum N. Zimiak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of BCECF was reduced to 5 μm. The analysis was carried out with H85N-transfected MDCK cells grown on coverslips inserted diagonally in a cuvette held in a thermostatically controlled cell holder in a Perkin-Elmer model LS-50B luminescence spectrometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Excitation and emission slit widths were 10 and 2.5 nm, respectively, and the ratio method was used with excitation wavelengths of 490 and 450 nm light and emission intensity at 535 nm. Electrophysiological measurements of the chimera-mediated current were similar to those described by Horisberger et al. (12Horisberger J.D. Jaunin P. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 88: 8397-8400Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Initially, oocytes were loaded with Na+ by incubating them for 2 h in a solution free of K+ or Ca2+ ions (97 mm Na+, 0.82 mm Mg2+, 0.5 mm EGTA, 22.5 mm Cl−, 76 mm gluconate, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)) The Na+-loading step was followed by a 15-min incubation in a K+-free bath solution (97 mm Na+, 0.82 mmMg2+, 0.42 mm Ca2+, 5 mm Ba2+, 22.5 mm Cl−, 76 mm gluconate, 2 μm ouabain, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)), which contained 5 mmBa2+ in order to block channel-mediated K+currents. Finally, oocytes were transferred to the chamber of the voltage clamp set up that contained the same K+-free bath solution. The following protocol was followed to measure whole-cell currents at a holding potential of −50 mV; once the base line had stabilized, the K+-free bath solution was replaced with a K+-containing solution, and the K+-induced current was recorded. The only difference between K+-free and K+-containing solution was that a fraction of Na+ ions had been replaced with K+ ions. The sum of the concentrations of Na+ and K+ was always 97 mm. Following recording of the current, the K+-containing solution was replaced by the identical solution to which 5 mm ouabain had been added in order to demonstrate that the recorded current was indeed pump-mediated. All data were recorded using a Warner Instruments Oocyte Clamp 725C (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Data analysis was performed with Pulse and Pulsfit software from HEKA (HEKA, Darmstadt, Germany). To determine half-activation constants, pump currents were plotted against their corresponding potassium concentrations and modeled with a Hill function, n = 2. Membranes from LLC-PK1 cells were isolated as follows. Cells grown in α-minimum essential media containing 1 μm ouabain and 1.8 g/liter G418 were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then the packed cell pellet was lysed by treatment with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm MgCl2 for 20 min on ice (20-ml pellet obtained from cells grown to 60–80% confluence on 10 15-cm Petri dishes). Following homogenization with a motor-driven Teflon/glass homogenizer (2 × 25 strokes with a 2-min interval on ice) and centrifugation for 2 min at 1500 × g, the supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 50 min at 39,000 × g. The pellet was washed by resuspension with ≈200-volume 1 mm EDTA-Tris (pH 7.4) and centrifugation. Following suspension in the same medium, the pellet was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. To ensure complete permeability of the membranes used for assays of ATPase activity, membranes were treated with SDS in bovine serum albumin essentially as described by Forbush (13Forbush III., B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were treated for 10 min at 22 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin in 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.65 mg/ml SDS and then diluted ≥6-fold with 0.3% bovine serum albumin in 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a final protein concentration of 0.02–0.12 mg/ml. Prior to assay, membranes were preincubated with either 20 μm ouabain (low ouabain) or 5 mm ouabain (high ouabain) in 2 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. Unless indicated otherwise, assays were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 μl of preincubated membranes and either (final concentrations) 30 mm MES-Tris or 30 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA at final pH values of 5.5 and 7.4, respectively. NaCl and KCl were varied as indicated with choline chloride added to maintain a constant (150 mm) chloride concentration and, unless indicated otherwise, with [γ-32P]ATP added at a final concentration of 10 μm for H519N, 50 μm for experiments with H85N/H356–519N at pH 5.5, and 250 μm for experiments with H85N and H85N/H356–519N at pH 7.4. The final ouabain concentrations were 10 μm (low ouabain) and 2.5 mm (high ouabain). All assays were carried out in triplicate, and each value shown is the mean ± S.E. of the difference measured in the presence of low and high ouabain concentrations. [γ-32P]ATP was synthesized enzymatically from 32Pi as described elsewhere (14Post R.L. Sen A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 762-768Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All isotopes were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Analysis of kinetic data using the Kaleidagraph program was carried out as described by Therien et al. (9Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As indicated, data points in the figures are shown as either percentages ofV max, with the absolute values ofV max given in the figure legends (determinations of K0.5(Na+), K0.5(K+), K′ATP), or as percentages of the maximal activity observed. In order to characterize domains of the catalytic α subunit which confer the distinct cation selectivities of the Na,K- and gastric H,K-ATPases, we have assessed the functional consequences of replacing regions of the one enzyme by those of the other. The focus of the present experiments has been on regions within the N-terminal half of these enzymes. These chimeras were expressed in both mammalian epithelial cell lines (MDCK and LLC-PK1) and, in the cases of H85N and H85N/H356–519N, in Xenopus oocytes. All included replacement of the cytoplasmic N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase (residues 1–85) with the homologous region of the gastric H,K-ATPase. This strategy permits assessment of protein expression using antibodies raised against the N terminus of the H,K-ATPase. Accordingly, the chimera H85N served as a control for other chimeras. Following selection in G418 as described earlier (5Blostein R. Zhang R.-P. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), growth of the transfected cells in medium containing a low concentration (1 μm) of ouabain was used for selection of cells expressing functional rat H,K-/Na,K-ATPase chimeras. All three chimeras survived this selection, the H85N control and the chimeras involving the substitution of (i) the front-half of the cytoplasmic M4–M5 loop (H85N/H356–519N) and (ii) the entire front-half gastric H,K-ATPase/back-half Na,K-ATPase (H519N). Although as reported previously (5Blostein R. Zhang R.-P. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the H519N-transfected cells did not grow initially in ouabain, they were gradually adapted to growth in ouabain by first selecting cells resistant to G418 and then replacing the medium containing G418 (cf. Ref. 5Blostein R. Zhang R.-P. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with medium containing micromolar ouabain and elevated (5 mm) K+, a strategy first used by Arguello and Lingrel (15Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) for the S775A mutant. Relative to H85N and H85N/H356–519N, the doubling time of H519N-transfected cells was increased 2–3-fold. Preliminary experiments showed that the behavior of the control H85N in MDCK cells with respect to apparent affinities for activation of K+ influx by extracellular K+ (Kext) or varying intracellular Na+ (Nacyt) was similar to that of the endogenous ouabain-sensitive dog kidney enzyme (not shown), suggesting that this region does not have an important role in cation interactions. In subsequent studies, the behavior of transfected LLC-PK1 rather than MDCK cells was studied for the following reasons. First, with membranes isolated from LLC-PK1 cells, the fraction of total Na,K-ATPase activity insensitive to low (10−5m) but sensitive to high (2.5 × 10−3m) ouabain concentrations was greater than that observed with membranes isolated from MDCK cells. Second, with control H85N-transfected LLC-PK1, but not MDCK cells, the pump-mediated K+ influx into cells equilibrated and then assayed in Na+-free medium was essentially zero. This is probably due to the absence, or a substantially lower amount of nonspecific binding of Na+ or, more likely, trapping of cations in interstitial spaces of LLC-PK1 cells compared with MDCK cells. To determine whether the H519N and H356–519N substitutions alter cation interactions, the transport behaviors of these chimeras were compared with that of the H85N control under conditions of varying pH, Na+, and K+ concentrations, with monensin added to maintain a constant concentration of intracellular Na+as described earlier (8Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). That the intracellular pH approximated the extracellular milieu was verified using BCECF fluorescence to measure intracellular pH as described under “Experimental Procedures” (not shown). As documented in several figure legends, the activity of the H519N chimera was severalfold lower than that of the other chimeras, which is not surprising in view of its notably lower growth rate (doubling time ≥2-fold longer). In the representative experiments shown in Fig.1, the effects of varying K+concentration were tested on (chimera) pump-mediated K+influx into chimera-transfected LLC-PK1 cells equilibrated with 20 mm Na+ at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1 A) and pH 7.4 (Fig. 1 B). Higher Na+ concentrations were avoided in order to minimize changes in intracellular pH due to putative Na+/H+ exchange. The data are plotted as percentages of V max values given in the legend. The results show that the substitution of the N-terminal half (residues 356–519) of the M4–M5 loop of the gastric pump into the homologous regions of the Na,K-ATPase decreases the apparent affinity for K+ and that the fold change relative to H85N is similar for both H85N/H356–519N and H519N (≈6- to 7-fold higher K0.5(K+) at pH 6.0 and 4.4-fold higher K0.5(K+) at pH 7.4; see values in legend). Accordingly, a significant difference between H85N/H356–519N and H519N could not be detected with cells assayed in 20 mm Na+. With cells equilibrated at pH 7.4 and assayed at lower Na+ concentration (10 mm) the fold difference from the control H85N was reduced similarly for both H85N/H356–519N and H519N chimeras at pH 7.4 (2-fold higher K0.5(K+); experiment not shown). However, with both the sodium concentration reduced and the proton concentration increased (Fig. 1 C; cells assayed at 10 mmNa+ and pH 6.0), K0.5(K+) values 4- and 8-fold higher than that of H85N were observed with H85N/H356–519N and H519N, respectively (see values in legend). In subsequent K+ influx assays, the medium K+ concentration was 4 mm in order to ensure close to saturation of all chimeric pumps. V max values of all chimeras were reduced over 50% as the pH was decreased from pH 7.4 to pH 6.0 (see legend) due, presumably, to a decrease in overall catalytic activity as pH is decreased. Experiments at relatively high Na+ concentration were also carried out with cRNA-injected oocytes using ouabain-sensitive current as a measure of pump activity. Quantitative comparisons with fluxes shown in Fig. 1 are precluded by the differences in conditions, namely high intra- and extracellular Na+ and the membrane potential clamped at −50 mV. Nevertheless, the results showed that the H85N/H356–519N pump was electrogenic, and consistent with the flux data in Fig. 1, its apparent affinity for K+ was notably lower than that of H85N (experiments not shown). Fig. 2 shows Rb+ influx as a function of varying Na+ concentration with transfected LLCPK1 cells equilibrated and assayed in medium containing saturating (4 mm) K+ and at pH 6.0 (Fig.2 A) and pH 7.4 (Fig. 2 B). The results suggest that the H519N substitution and, to a lesser extent, the H356–519N substitution cause marked changes in selectivity for Na+. Whereas little, if any, activity was detected in control H85N cells equilibrated and assayed in Na+-free medium at either pH 6.0 or pH 7.4, a substantial ouabain-sensitive Rb+ influx into H519N-transfected cells occurred in the absence of added Na+ at both pH values, i.e. 35 and 60% of the maximal influxes observed with optimal Na+ were observed at pH 7.4 and pH 6.0, respectively (cf. Fig.3 below). Ouabain-sensitive K+ influx under Na+-free conditions was also observed with the H85N/H356–519N chimera, although the activity relative to that observed with optimal Na+ concentration was much lower.Figure 3Comparison of ouabain-sensitive (86Rb+) K+ influx at various pH values in the absence and presence of Na+. Cells were equilibrated without and with 20 mm NaCl and 4 mm KCl and assayed as described in Fig. 1. Absolute values (nmol/mg/min) of fluxes shown as 100% are 3.00 ± 0.08, 2.38 ± 0.03, and 0.84 ± 0.04 for H85N, H85N/H356–519N, and H519N, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The pH sensitivity profiles of K+ influx into cells equilibrated with either 0 or 20 mm Na+ are shown in Fig. 3. For all three chimeras, activity in the presence of Na+, presumably Na+/K+ exchange, decreases as a function of decreasing pH. In the absence of Na+, pump activity of the control H85N is barely detectable but persists in H85N/H356–519N and H519N chimeras, particularly the latter. Although the experiments presented in Figs. 2 and3 suggest that under Na+-free conditions the H85N/H356–519N and H519N chimeras catalyze an exchange of protons for K+, it is unlikely that intracellular Na+ is completely removed, even in cells equilibrated and assayed in Na+-free medium in the presence of monensin (see Fig. 5 of Ref. 8Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several explanations are plausible. Either the apparent affinity for Na+ of the H519N chimera and, to a lesser extent, the H85N/H356–519N chimera are markedly increased compared with the control H85N and/or one or both of these chimeras can use protons in place of Na+ (H+/K+exchange) or together with Na+ ((H+ + Na+)/K+ exchange). To gain explicit information about proton versusNa+ selectivity affected by the H356–519N and H519N substitutions, it was necessary to assay activity using Na+-free preparations. Well washed porous membranes, although lacking sidedness, are nominally Na+-free and thus satisfy this criterion. In the experiments described below, we tested the effects of pH and varying Na+ and K+concentrations on this component of ATPase activity of LLC-PK1 membranes, henceforth referred to as “ouabain-sensitive ATPase.” With membranes, it was feasible to assay activity at concentrations of protons (pH 5.5) greater than feasible with cells (pH ≥ 6.0). We first characterized the three chimeras with respect to apparent affinity for ATP. This allowed for subsequent assays to be carried out at optimal but not excessive concentrations of ATP, thereby maximizing the sensitivity of the assays. As shown in Fig. 4, the chimeric replacements altered markedly the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ATP. This holds true particularly for H519N. Thus, K′ATP values determined at pH 7.4 with optimal Na+ (100 mm) and K+ (10 mm) concentrations were 124, 45, and 1.92 μm ATP for H85N, H85N/H356–519N, and H519N, respectively. K′ATP was reduced approximately 4-fold further when the pH was reduced to pH 5.5 (experiments not shown). Based on these results, the effects of cations were tested under the conditions of saturating concentrations of ATP. Thus (and unless indicated otherwise), the ATP concentration was 50 μm for experiments carried out at low pH (pH 5.5) and 250 μm for experiments carried out at pH 7.4 with the H85N and H85N/H356–519N chimeras. Assays of the H519N chimera were carried out at 10 μm ATP at both pH values. Despite the low Na,K-ATPase activity of the H519N preparations at pH 7.4 (see legend to Fig. 4), for all three chimeras, these concentrations of ATP allowed for maximal percentages (at least 25% of the total ATP hydrolyzed) of pump-associated ATP hydrolysis. The Na+ dependence of ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity of membranes derived from mutant-transfected LLC-PK1 cell membranes measured with constant K+ concentration (10 mm) at pH 5.5 is shown in Fig. 5 A. The results indicate that in the absence of Na+, an ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity is observed with the H85N/H356–519N and H519N chimeras at pH 5.5, whereas little, if any, activity is observed with the control H85N chimera. In fact, the activity of H519N at pH 5.5 was similar in the absence or presence of Na+. Activities of the H85N/H356–519N and control H85N chimeras were also evaluated at higher pH (pH 7.4; Fig. 5 B) under which condition a significant ouabain-sensitive component could not be detected in the absence of Na+ and presence of K+. For these chimeras, the data were fitted to a 3-site non-cooperative model. Their Na+ activation profiles indicate similar values ofK′Na of which the significance vis àvis experiments carried out at higher K+ concentration is discussed below. Experiments aimed to assess the K+ dependence of the putative H+,K+-ATPase activity effected by the chimeric substitutions are described in Fig.6. The results indicate that at acidic pH and absence of Na+, the activities of all three chimeras increase with addition of 0.5 to 2 mm K+. With higher K+ concentration (≥10 mm), the"

Here we demonstrate by transient transfection assays that p62 stimulates the transcription of reporter genes linked to the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer. A putative p62-responsive element was localized to the B domain of the distal 72-base pair repeat of the SV40 enhancer. p62 was unable to bind this element in vitro, nor was it able to activate transcription when directly tethered to a promoter, suggesting that p62 stimulates transcription via an indirect mechanism. Stimulation of transcription mediated by p62 was dependent on its amino-terminal region, which is also necessary for interaction with cell surface signaling molecules. These findings indicate that p62 may link extracellular signals directly to transcriptional responses, and identify the SV40 enhancer as a downstream target for signal transduction pathways in which p62 participates. p62 is a recently identified ubiquitin-binding, cytosolic phosphoprotein that interacts with several signal transduction molecules including the tyrosine kinase p56lck and the protein kinase C-ζ. p62 is therefore suggested to serve an important role in signal transduction in the cell, although the physiological function of p62 remains undefined.

An important clue to the cellular function of p62 came with the recent demonstration that p62 is a multiubiquitin-binding protein (10Vadlamudi R.K. Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20235-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that primarily serves to target proteins for degradation via the 26 S proteosome. p62 does not appear to be associated with the proteosome, but may be part of a novel cytosolic structure that serves to sequester ubiquitinated proteins (11Shin J. Arch. Pharmacal Res. (Seoul). 1998; 21: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). p62 may therefore link signal transduction pathways to the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. We have previously demonstrated that p62 interacts with COUP-TFII, an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (3Marcus S.L. Winrow C.J.

In transient transfection assays, co-transfection of p62 was shown to potentiate transactivation mediated by COUP-TFII, suggesting that p62 may directly participate in gene regulation. In this paper, we demonstrate that p62 stimulates transcription of reporter genes that are linked to the SV40 enhancer. Stimulation of transcription mediated by p62 was dependent on the amino-terminal region of p62, which is also necessary for interaction with cell surface signaling molecules. However, p62 was unable to bind to the SV40 enhancer or to stimulate transcription when directly tethered to DNA, suggesting that p62 functions indirectly. These findings indicate that p62 may link extracellular signals directly to transcriptional responses, and identify the SV40 enhancer as a downstream target for signal transduction pathways in which p62 participates. BSC40 and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) calf serum. Expression vectors for the mouse peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), the human 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXRα) (12Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A.

The plasmid pCMVL containing the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter was a kind gift of Scott Bunnell (University of Alberta). The SV40 enhancer was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from pSV-SPORT (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the oligonucleotides 5′-ATTGGATCCGAATGTGTGTCAGTTAGC (forward primer) and 5′-ATTGGATCCTGGTTGCTGACTAATTGAGA (reverse primer). Two products resulted from this amplification, one of 160 base pairs (bp) and containing the entire SV40 enhancer, the other of 100 bp and containing the distal 72-bp repeat and 5′-flanking region. The products were digested with BamHI, gel purified, and inserted into theBglII site of the luciferase reporter vector, pGL2-promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmids, pENH.FOR/GL2 and pENH.REV/GL2, contain the 160-bp insert in the forward and reverse orientation, respectively. pENH.MIN/GL2 contains the distal 72-bp repeat and 5′-flanking region in the forward orientation. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing XhoI overhangs 5′-TCGAGGCAGAAGTATGCAAAGCATGCATCTCAATTAGTCAGAAC and encompassing the A domain of the SV40 enhancer (14Zenke M. Grundström T. Matthes H. Wintzerith M. Schatz C. Wildeman A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was inserted into the XhoI site of the pGL2-promoter. The resulting plasmids, pA(x1)/GL2 and pA(x3)/GL2, contain 1 and 3 copies of the A domain, respectively. The B domain of the SV40 enhancer (14Zenke M. Grundström T. Matthes H. Wintzerith M. Schatz C. Wildeman A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with the primer pairs 5′-ATTCTCGAGCAGCTGTGGAATGTG (forward) and 5′-ATTCTCGAGCTGGGGAGCCTGG (reverse). The product was digested withXhoI and inserted into the XhoI site of pGL2-promoter to generate pB(x1)/GL2 and pB(x2)/GL2, containing 1 and 2 copies of the B domain, respectively. The thymidine kinase (TK) promoter was amplified by PCR using the primer pairs 5′-ATTAGATCTCAAACCCCGCCCAGCG (forward) and 5′-ATTAAGCTTGATCTGCGGCACGCTG (reverse). The resulting product was digested with BglII and HindIII and inserted into the corresponding sites of the promoterless pGL2 luciferase vector (Promega). The 21-bp repeats of the SV40 early promoter were amplified by PCR using 5′-ATTAGATCTGCATCTCAATTAGTCAG (forward primer) and 5′-ATTAGATCTGGGGCGGAGAATGGGC (reverse primer). The product was digested with BglII and inserted into the BglII site of TKluc to generate pGC/TKluc. The entire natural SV40 enhancer was amplified by PCR using the primer pairs 5′-ATTCTCGAGCTGTGGAATGTGTGTCAG (forward) and 5′-ATTCTCGAGTGGTTGCTGACTAATTGAG (reverse). The product was digested with XhoI and inserted into the XhoI site of TKluc to generate pENH/TKluc. Construction of the expression vector pORCA/SG5 and derivatives pORCAΔ128–163 and pORCAΔ258–440 have been described (3Marcus S.L. Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27197-27200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pORCAΔ1–187 was constructed as follows: an EcoRI site followed by an initiator ATG codon (lowercase letters below) was inserted immediately upstream of codon 188 by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer 5′-CAGCCGCTGGCTCCGGAAGgaattcatgGTGAAACACGGACACTTC and single-stranded DNA prepared from pORCA/SG5. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI, and the fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 188–440 was inserted into the EcoRI site of pSG5. The first 29 amino acid residues of p62 were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis using 5′-CACTATAAGGCGAATTCGCCATGGAGCCTGAGGCGGAAGC and single-stranded DNA prepared from pORCA/SG5 to generate pORCAΔ1–29. pORCAΔ29–50 was constructed similarly using 5′-CTTCAGCTTCTGCTGCAGCGTGGCCGCCCTGTTCCCC. Correct mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing in all cases. The reporter plasmid p(GAL4)5E1bCAT, which contains 5 tandem copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding site upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, and the expression plasmid pGAL4-VP16, which contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the activation domain of VP16, have been described (15Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSG-GAL4-p62 expresses p62 as an in-frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. It was constructed by cloning an EcoRI fragment containing the cDNA for p62 into the EcoRI site of pSG-424 (15Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). BSC40 or COS-1 cells (∼380,000 cells) were seeded onto 10-cm dishes 3 days before transfection. Transfections were done by the calcium phosphate method, as described (16Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), followed by a glycerol shock after 16 h. Transfections typically contained 5 μg of a luciferase reporter gene construct and, where indicated, 4 μg of the p62 expression plasmid, pORCA/SG5. Effector plasmid dosage was kept constant by addition of pSG5. Total DNA was kept at 20 μg with sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (16Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For transfections with p(GAL4)5EE1bCAT, cells were transfected as above using 5 μg of reporter gene and 2 μg of effector plasmids expressing GAL4-VP16 or GAL4-p62. Measurement of CAT activity was as described previously (15Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The stop codon of p62 was changed to a codon for glutamine followed by a BglII site by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide 5′-GCATCCCCCGCCGTTGcagatctTTTTGCCCACCTCTTCTG and pORCA/SG5 single-stranded DNA. A fragment with BglII termini, encoding the peptide DEDPLAMYPYDVPDYAAMYPYDVPDYAAMGKGES, which contains two repeats of the 9-amino acid influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (underlined residues) (17Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), was ligated into the BglII site at the p62 stop codon to generate pORCA-HA/SG5. Total RNA was isolated from transfected COS-1 cells by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction using a commercially available kit (Tri-Reagent, Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry. Northern blot analysis was carried out according to established methods (18Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1989Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA was loaded per lane. Specific mRNA levels were quantified by densitometry with an Ultroscan XL laser densitometer (LKB Instruments, Bromma, Sweden). Antibodies to full-length mouse PPARα and human RXRα were raised in rabbits by injection of affinity purified maltose-binding protein fusions expressed in Escherichia coli. The 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the 9-amino acid HA epitope, was purchased from the Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA). Protein extracts from transfected cells were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. Protein concentration was determined with a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 50 μg of each protein extract was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, as described (18Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1989Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Sciences, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with pORCA/SG5 or with control vector, and EMSA was performed as described previously (16Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Sajjadi F.G. Alvares K. Reddy J.K. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7541-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). All reactions were normalized for protein content. The entire SV40 enhancer plus 21-bp repeats was amplified by PCR using 5′-ATTGGATCCGAATGTGTGTCAGTTAGC (forward primer) and 5′-ATTGGATCCGGGGCGGAGAATGGGC (reverse primer). The resulting 200-bp product was digested with BamHI and end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Binding reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis at 4 °C on pre-run 3.5% polyacrylamide gels (30:1, acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio) with 22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA acid as running buffer. Recombinant p62 was produced in E. coli as a fusion to glutathioneS-transferase (a kind gift of Christopher Winrow, University of Alberta). The fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Pharmacia, Baie d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada), and the glutathione S-transferase moiety was cleaved with bovine thrombin according to the manufacturer's instructions. We originally cloned p62(ORCA) using the yeast two-hybrid system with the nuclear hormone receptor COUP-TFII as bait (3Marcus S.L. Winrow C.J. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27197-27200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In our investigations of the function of p62, we noted that the activity of reporter genes linked to the SV40 enhancer/early promoter was stimulated in transient transfection assays in the presence of an expression vector for p62. Our results suggested that p62 might be involved in transcription activation. To explore this initial observation further, we transfected BSC40 cells with the luciferase reporter plasmid pSV2luc, which contains the SV40 enhancer/early promoter, in the absence or presence of the p62 expression plasmid, pORCA/SG5. As shown in Fig.1, co-transfection of pORCA/SG5 resulted in a 6-fold stimulation of luciferase activity as compared with control transfections carried out with empty expression vector. This increase in activity was specific for the SV40 enhancer/early promoter, as co-transfection of pORCA/SG5 with a luciferase reporter construct containing the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (pCMVL) or the minimal SV40 promoter (pGL2-promoter) did not result in stimulation of luciferase activity (Fig. 1). Similarly, the activity of a reporter plasmid under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was unaffected by co-expression of p62 (data not presented). These findings indicate that p62-mediated stimulation of gene expression was dependent upon the presence of the SV40 enhancer region. To determine if p62-mediated stimulation of reporter gene activity was due to an overall increase in transcription, we carried out Northern blot and immunoblot analyses of transfected cells. For this purpose, we used an expression plasmid containing the SV40 enhancer/early promoter (pSG5) linked to cDNAs for different nuclear hormone receptors. The various plasmids were co-transfected into COS-1 cells in the presence, or absence, of pORCA-HA/SG5, which encodes p62 tagged at its carboxyl terminus with the HA epitope to permit monitoring of the expression of p62 in transfected cells. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and divided into two aliquots. Total RNA was isolated from one aliquot and subjected to Northern blot analysis with appropriate probes. Protein extracts were prepared from the other aliquot and subjected to immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, mRNA levels for the nuclear hormone receptors RXRα and PPARα were increased in the presence of p62-HA (2.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively), as compared with control transfections carried out with empty vector (Fig. 2, top panels, compare lane 2 to lane 3 for RXRα and lane 5 to lane 6 for PPARα). The increase in mRNA correlated with an increase in the levels of the corresponding RXRα and PPARα proteins (7.3- and 2.4-fold, respectively) (Fig. 2, bottom panels, compare lane 2 to lane 3 for RXRα and lane 5 tolane 6 for PPARα). The presence of full-length p62-HA in cells transfected with pORCA-HA/SG5 was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2, bottom panels, comparelane 7 to lane 8). The above findings indicate that p62-mediated stimulation of reporter gene activity correlates with increased levels of transcription. The SV40 early promoter consists of three copies of a 21-bp repeat, followed by a TATA box (Fig. 3) (14Zenke M. Grundström T. Matthes H. Wintzerith M. Schatz C. Wildeman A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19McKnight S. Tjian R. Cell. 1986; 46: 795-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 20Atchison M.L. Annu.

Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Each repeat has two copies of a GC-hexanucleotide motif that has been shown to bind the transcription factor Sp1. The prototype SV40 enhancer, derived from SV40 strain 776, contains two tandem copies of a 72-bp repeat. The “minimal” enhancer has been localized to the distal 72-bp repeat and 5′-flanking region (14Zenke M. Grundström T. Matthes H. Wintzerith M. Schatz C. Wildeman A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To characterize the putative p62-responsive cis-acting elements of the SV40 enhancer/early promoter, we made several constructs based on the plasmid pGL2-promoter, which contains a luciferase reporter gene linked to the minimal SV40 early promoter (Fig. 4). Co-transfection of this basic plasmid in the presence of p62 expression plasmid resulted in little change (less than 2-fold) in luciferase activity. In contrast, appending the natural SV40 enhancer (two copies of the 72-bp repeat) in the forward (pENH.FOR/GL2) or reverse (pENH.REV/GL2) orientation resulted in a 7–10-fold p62-dependent increase in luciferase activity. A reporter plasmid that contained only the distal 72-bp repeat and 5′-flanking region (pENH.MIN/GL2) also showed increased luciferase activity (4-fold) in the presence of p62, although the absolute level of induction was reduced vis à visthe natural SV40 enhancer. To examine whether the SV40 early promoter, and in particular the GC-rich 21-bp repeats, participate in p62-mediated stimulation, we used a luciferase reporter construct (TKluc) linked to the minimal TK promoter. Co-transfection of either TKluc(contains the TK TATA box) or pGC/TKluc, (contains the 3 GC-rich repeats of the SV40 early promoter placed upstream of the TK TATA box), with p62 expression plasmid did not result in a significant increase in luciferase activity over background levels observed with the reporter genes alone (Fig. 4). However, linking the natural SV40 enhancer directly to TKluc (pENH/TKluc) resulted in a greater than 5-fold p62-dependent increase in luciferase activity. Our results indicate that the distal 72-bp repeat of the SV40 enhancer is sufficient to mediate p62 responsiveness and that induction is independent of the GC-rich 21-bp repeats or the SV40 TATA element. Full function of the SV40 enhancer has been shown to depend on the cooperation of multiple sequence motifs (GT-I, GT-IIC, SphI, Sph-II, TC-II, octamer, and P), which bind a variety of ubiquitous and cell-specific factors. (20Atchison M.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 127-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Jones N.C. Rigby P.W.J. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 23Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.-M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The minimal SV40 enhancer encompasses ∼100 bp, including the distal 72-bp repeat and its 5′-flanking region (14Zenke M. Grundström T. Matthes H. Wintzerith M. Schatz C. Wildeman A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and is composed of at least two distinct subdomains, A and B. The A and B domains possess very little enhancing activity individually but can cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Moreover, activity can be potentiated by multimerization of either domain. To determine the contribution of the A and B domains to the transactivating activity of p62 on the SV40 enhancer, we made luciferase reporter gene constructs containing single or multiple copies of either the A or B domain linked to the minimal SV40 early promoter. Transcriptional activation by p62 via a single B domain (pB(x1)/GL2) was modest (3-fold) but was increased (6-fold) when the B domain was duplicated (Fig. 5). In contrast, the activity of a reporter gene containing a single copy (pA(x1)/GL2) or 3 copies (pA(x3)/GL2) of the A domain was unaffected or only marginally stimulated, respectively, by coexpressed p62. Therefore, the B domain of the distal 72-bp repeat is necessary and sufficient to confer responsiveness to p62. To begin to explore the mechanisms by which p62 might potentiate transcription via the SV40 enhancer, we performed EMSA using a labeled DNA fragment containing the natural SV40 enhancer and 21-bp repeats to determine if p62 binds to this element in vitro. The DNA probe was incubated with extracts prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with pORCA/SG5 or the corresponding empty vector, pSG5. The pattern and/or mobilities of the protein-DNA complexes formed on this element with COS-1 cell extracts did not change in the presence of coexpressed p62 (Fig.6 A, compare lane bto lane c). Purified, bacterially expressed, p62 did not bind to the DNA probe under our assay conditions (Fig. 6 B, compare lane a to lane e). Moreover, protein-DNA complexes formed on this element were not altered quantitatively or qualitatively when purified p62 was incubated with increasing amounts of untransfected COS-1 cell extract (Fig. 6 B, comparelanes b-d to lanes f-h, respectively). Therefore, within the limits of these assay systems, p62 does not appear to be capable of binding directly or indirectly to the SV40 enhancer, or of altering the interaction of cellular factors with this element. To determine if p62 has intrinsic transcription activating potential, we made the plasmid pSG-GAL4-p62 linking the cDNA for p62 to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transactivator GAL4 and carried out transient transfection assays together with a CAT reporter gene having 5 upstream copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding site (p(GAL4)5E1bCAT). As shown in Fig.7, the activity of this reporter gene was strongly stimulated by the potent transactivator GAL4-VP16, as expected. However, when directly bound to DNA, GAL4-p62 was unable to stimulate transcription over background levels of the reporter gene alone. Therefore, p62 does not possess an intrinsic activation capacity, and this finding, together with results from the DNA binding assays, suggests that p62 stimulates transcription through an indirect means. p62 contains a small region near its amino terminus (residues 66–82) that shares homology to cdc24 and harbors a putative protein binding motif; a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif (residues 128–163) that appears to be involved in homodimerization; a Ser-rich PEST motif (residues 266–296) that may be a target for protein kinases; and a region near its carboxyl terminus that is required for binding to ubiquitin (Fig.8, numbering according to human p62) (1Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5991-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,4Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Vadlamudi R.K. Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20235-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain has been shown to be required for interaction with p56lck, PKC-ζ, and COUP-TFII. To identify regions of p62 that are important for the observed transcriptional stimulation of the SV40 enhancer, we generated a series of mutant derivatives of p62 and tested these for activity in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 8). A derivative of p62 truncated at amino acid 257 retained the ability to stimulate transcription of pSV2luc, albeit with lower efficiency compared with the wild-type protein (3- versus 7-fold, respectively). Therefore, the ubiquitin-binding region and the Ser-rich/PEST domain, which includes several potential kinase phosphorylation sites, are not essential for p62-mediated stimulation of transcription of the SV40 enhancer. Similarly, a derivative missing the putative zinc finger/protein interaction region (residues 128–163) retained activity. However, derivatives lacking the first 187 or first 85 residues were inactive. Δ1–85 is missing the cdc24 homology region (residues 66–82). To further demarcate this region, derivatives of p62 were constructed missing residues 1–29 or residues 29–50. As shown in Fig. 8, Δ1–29 activated transcription of pSV2luc and did so as efficiently as the wild-type protein. In contrast, Δ29–50 was inactive. Thus, residues spanning amino acids 29–50 are essential for activity. The cdc24 homology region may also be important; however, in the absence of amino-terminal residues, this region itself is insufficient for activity. Previous work has shown that first 50 residues of p62 are necessary for interaction with the p56lckSH2 domain (12Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5723-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, our results indicate that at least part of the SH2-binding domain of p62 is also essential for transactivation of the SV40 enhancer. p62 has been shown to bind to a variety of cellular factors including signaling molecules such as p56lck, PKC-ζ, and cytokine receptors; the transcription factor COUP-TFII; and ubiquitin. These findings, coupled with recent observations that p62 is widely expressed in most cell types and is rapidly induced by cell proliferation and differentiation signals, suggest that p62 is a multifunctional protein that serves a general role in signal transduction in the cell, perhaps linked to the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. However, the cellular action of p62 remains unclear, since a direct role for p62 in signal transduction events and/or regulation of protein degradation has not been demonstrated. The findings reported here, demonstrating that p62 also stimulates transcription via the SV40 enhancer, add a further functional dimension to this protein and suggest that p62 provides a link between cell surface signaling and specific gene transcription. Transcriptional induction mediated by p62 appears to be specific for the SV40 enhancer, since the activity of other promoter/regulatory regions were unaffected by the presence of p62. The natural SV40 enhancer (two copies of the 72-bp repeat) was the most robust at conferring responsiveness to p62 and could do so when appended to the SV40 early promoter or to a heterologous promoter. By mutational analysis, we localized a putative p62-responsive element to the B domain of the 72-bp repeat of the SV40 enhancer. A single copy of the B domain was sufficient to mediate responsiveness to p62; however, the level of induction was significantly increased when the B domain was duplicated, as is the case with the natural enhancer. These results suggest that cooperative interactions of multiple factors participate in mediating full p62 responsiveness. The mechanism by which p62 potentiates SV40 enhancer-mediated transcription is unknown. p62 does not bind to the SV40 enhancer either on its own or in conjunction with cellular factors, nor does it appear to alter the protein/DNA interactions of cellular factors that interact with this element. Moreover, p62 does not activate transcription when tethered directly to a promoter. Therefore, p62 probably functions indirectly in modulating transcription, perhaps as a transcription intermediary cofactor. Interestingly, p62 shares a small region of homology with the transcriptional coactivator CBP (residues 136–154 of p62 and residues 1715–1722 of CBP), suggesting possible similarities in their mechanisms of action. This region is part of a domain in CBP (residues 1680–1812) that has been shown to bind TFIIB (24Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bächinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). However, this region of CBP homology is not essential for transactivation of the SV40 enhancer by p62 (Fig. 3). Moreover, there is no evidence of p62 being found in the nucleus, as one may expect if it played a direct role in transcription activation. It remains possible that the subcellular distribution of p62 may be altered in the presence of interacting proteins. Indeed, the subcellular localization of ZIP, the rat homolog of p62, is altered in the presence of overexpressed PKC-ζ (4Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that p62 modulates the function of cellular transcription factors that target the SV40 enhancer. p62 has been shown to have a tightly associated, or intrinsic, Ser/Thr protein kinase activity (1Joung I.

Therefore, p62 may activate one or more SV40 enhancer-binding transcription factors directly or indirectly by phosphorylation. Since part of the SH2- and PKC-ζ-binding domain of p62 is also required for transactivation, p62 may link cell surface signaling pathways to transcription factor phosphorylation. The SV40 enhancer contains multiple binding sites for a number of ubiquitous and cell-specific transcription factors, including transcription enhancer factor 1 (23Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H.

There is evidence that AP1, TCIIA/NF-κB, and TCIIB/KBF1 may mediate response of the SV40 enhancer to phorbol esters (26Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 38–30), and several other transcription factors that bind to this element are subject to modulation by extracellular signals. What role these factors play, if any, in p62-mediated transcriptional activation is unknown, and awaits definition through future mutational, protein binding, and transfection studies. It should be noted that many of the transcription factors that interact with the SV40 enhancer are not specific to this element and play broad and important roles in normal cellular gene regulation (21Jones N.C. Rigby P.W.J. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 31MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is likely that p62 has a role as a more general regulator of gene transcription. p62 could also act to alter the availability, stability, and/or subcellular distribution of transcription factors. Such actions would be consistent with p62 being a nonproteosomal, ubiquitin-binding protein that may be involved in the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (10Vadlamudi R.K. Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20235-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is possible, for instance, that p62 may target transcriptional repressors that bind to the SV40 enhancer for degradation. There is a growing number of examples of transcription factors whose activity is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (33Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, such a scenario appears an unlikely explanation for our findings, since the region of p62 that is required for ubiquitin binding is in fact dispensable for its transactivating ability. In summary, we have demonstrated that p62, a protein known to interact with distinct components of the cell surface signal transduction pathways, is able to activate transcription. We have identified a subdomain of the SV40 enhancer as one of its downstream targets. Our observation that a region of p62 that is necessary for its interaction with cellular signaling molecules is also required for its ability to stimulate transcription, implicates p62 in linking cell surface signal transduction pathways to transcriptional responses.

Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the polysialyltransferase of the E. coli Bos-12 recognizes an α-2,8 glycosidic linkage of sialic acid at the nonreducing end of an exogenous acceptor of either the α-2,8 homopolymer of sialic acid or the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid and catalyzes the transfer of Neu5Ac from CMP-Neu5Ac to this residue. When the exogenous acceptor is an α-2,8-linked oligomer of sialic acid, the main product synthesized is derived from the addition of a single residue of [14C]Neu5Ac to form either an α-2,8 glycosidic linkage or an α-2,9 glycosidic linkage at the nonreducing end, at an α-2,8/α-2,9 ratio of approximately 2:1. When the acceptor is the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid, chain elongation takes place four to five times more efficiently than the α-2,8-linked homopolymer of sialic acid as an acceptor. It was found that the α-2,9-linked homopolymer of sialic acid and the α-2,8/α-2,9-linked hetero-oligomer of sialic acid with α-2,9 at the nonreducing end not only failed to serve as an acceptor for theE. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferase for the transfer of [14C]Neu5Ac, but they inhibited the de novosynthesis of polysialic acid catalyzed by this enzyme. The results obtained in this study favor the proposal that the biosynthesis of the α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid catalyzed by the E. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferase involves a successive transfer of a preformed α-2,8-linked dimer of sialic acid at the nonreducing terminus of the acceptor to form an α-2,9 glycosidic linkage between the incoming dimer and the acceptor.

Sialic acid generally occurs in vertebrate tissues as a constituent of oligosaccharide, glycoproteins, and glycolipid. In contrast to sialyl linkage in vertebrates which comprises a large panel of novel linkages and appears to have a regulatory role in broad spectra of biological process such as cell growth, differentiation, fertilization, and neuronal pathogenicity (2Kundig F.D.

These studies have shown that CMP-Neu5Ac is the immediate precursor, and the synthesis of the polymer takes place in two sequential steps: the transfer of a Neu5Ac residue from CMP-Neu5Ac to undecaprenyl phosphate to form undecaprenyl phosphate-neuraminyl derivative, which then serves as the acceptor for subsequent sequential transfer of a single unit of Neu5Ac from CMP-Neu5Ac to the C8 position of the acceptor to form the α-2,8-linked polymer of sialic acid (7Troy F.A.

Vijay I.K. Tesche N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 156-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli K1 synthesizes a homopolymer of sialic acids with α-2,8 glycosidic linkage, whereas E. coli Bos-12 synthesizes a heteropolymer of sialic acids with alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 glycosidic linkages (1Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alignment of the primary structures of polysialyltransferase from both sources reveals a 92% sequence homology (12Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J.

It has been postulated that a single polysialyltransferase from E. coli Bos-12 catalyzes the formation of both α-2,9 and α-2,8 glycosidic bonds to form the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 glycosidic bond, to form the uniqueE. coli Bos-12 sialic acid polymer (13Vimr E.R. Bergstrom R. Steenbergen S.M. Boulnois G. Roberts I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5127-5131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of this enzymatic reaction remains obscure. In this report, we provide evidence in support of the proposal that the biosynthesis of the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid catalyzed by the polysialyltransferase of E. coli Bos-12 involves a successive transfer of a preformed α-2,8-linked dimer of sialic acid at the nonreducing terminus of the acceptor to form an α-2,9 glycosidic linkage between the incoming dimer and the acceptor.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe biosynthesis of the heteropolymer of sialic acid (Fig.1) catalyzed by E. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferase was investigated using CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac as the donor of sialic acid and exogenous polymers of sialic acids with different chain length and different glycosidic linkages (the α-2,8 homopolymer, the α-2,9 homopolymer, and the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer) as acceptors. The extent of [14C]Neu5Ac transferred to the exogenous acceptor was quantitated from the chromatogram of either TLC or anion exchange HPLC chromatography. Linkage analysis of the sialyl residue newly incorporated into the acceptor was examined by periodate oxidation, which cleaves C-C bonds having vicinal hydroxyl groups,e.g. the α-2,9-linked sialic acids (18Ada G.L.

The stimulatory effect of colominic acid, which is an α-2,8-linked homopolymer of sialic acid (Fig. 2, ○), was four to five times less than that found for the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8-linked heteropolymer of sialic acid, whereas the α-2,9-linked homopolymer of sialic acid (Fig. 2, ■) not only failed to serve as an acceptor but had an inhibitory effect on the de novo endogenous synthesis of polysialic acid (Fig. 2, ×).Figure 2Stimulation or inhibition of the activity ofE. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferase by polysialic acid.

However, unlike the α-2,9-linked homopolymer or oligomer of sialic acid (TableII), the α-2,8-linked oligomer or the polymer did not inhibit the transfer of [14C]Neu5Ac to the endogenous acceptor, at the concentration used.Table IMolar ratio of [14C]Neu5Ac transferred to the acceptors catalyzed by E. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferasLinkage of acceptor and chain lengthaDP is defined as degree of polymerization (number of monomeric sialic acid per chain).Neu5Ac incorporated into acceptorsbThe amount of CMP-Neu5Ac present in reaction mixture was 10.8 nmol.

The chromatogram in Fig. 4, A–D, shows that with a trimer, tetramer, or pentamer as the acceptor, the main product resulted from the addition of a sialyl residue to form the tetramer (83%), pentamer (78%), and hexamer (75%), respectively. Minor products resulting from the addition of two or three sialyl residues to the acceptor were also noted. When the acceptor was a hexamer, in addition to the heptamer (51%), products resulting from the addition of two or three sialyl residues to form an octamer (36%) and a nonamer (13%) became more significant.Figure 4Extent of chain elongation. The profiles of chain elongation of external acceptors catalyzed by the E. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferase were determined by ion exchange liquid chromatography (A–D). The incubation mixtures described in Fig. 3 were first applied to a Superdex peptide gel filtration column (7.5 × 300 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove unreacted CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac. Radiolabeled fraction were combined and analyzed by a Mono Q HR 5/5 ion exchange chromatography (5 × 50 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Effluent collected was measured for radioactivity by scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)On the other hand, when the α-2,9/α-2,8-heteromer was the acceptor (Fig. 2, ▵) the transfer of [14C]Neu5Ac to the acceptor was much more efficient. Of the total of 8.37 nmol transferred to the endogenous plus the exogenous acceptors (Table I), 7.21 nmol or 86% ended up with the external acceptor. Assuming that the alternating a 2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid has an average chain length (DP) of 150 (1Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it corresponds to 4.51 nmol of [14C]Neu5Ac incorporated/nmol of acceptor. It should be remembered that the polysialic acids isolated from bacterium are not expected to have a uniform chain length and that the DP used in the calculation is an average chain length. Thus, the molar ratio of [14C]Neu5Ac incorporated/acceptor is not expected to be an integral number.The amounts of radioactivity found to be associated with the pellets that contain the enzyme complexes were found to be less than 10–20% of that found in the soluble supernatant (see “Experimental Procedures”) in all cases.The Polysialyltransferase Activity Is Inhibited by the Polymer and Oligomer of Sialic Acid with an α-2,9 Glycosidic Linkage at the Nonreducing EndThe homopolymer of α-2,9-linked sialic not only failed to serve as an acceptor, but inhibited the transfer of [14C]Neu5Ac to the endogenous acceptor by about 60% (Fig. 2, ■, and Table I). At an inhibitor:acceptor molar ratio of 10:1 the polysialyltransferase-catalyzed transfer of [14C]Neu5Ac to the α-2,8-linked homopolymer and to the α-2,9/α-2,8-linked heteropolymer of sialic acids was inhibited by 100% and 75%, respectfully, by the α-2,9-linked homopolymer of sialic acid (Table II).The effect of an oligomer of sialic acid with an α-2,9 linkage at the nonreducing end on the polysialyltransferase was investigated. For this purpose, the α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid was digested with Endo-N, which specifically cleaves the α-2,8 glycosidic linkage within the polysialyl chain, resulting in the formation of oligosaccharides that end up with an α-2,9 glycosidic linkage at the nonreducing end but with internal α-2,8 glycosidic linkages (14Kwiatkowski B. Stirm S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows an anion exchange HPLC chromatogram of oligosaccharides obtained from the Endo-N digestion of a 2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid. The chain length of oligosaccharides increases successively from leftto right of the chromatogram with an interval DP value of 2. Oligosaccharides with lactone were observed as the peaks with a retention time corresponding to oligosaccharides with an odd DP value number caused by a reduction in a negative charge of a carboxyl group after lactonization reaction (19Vann W.F. Liu T.-Y. Robbins J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Inhibition of endogenous synthesis catalyzed by polysialyltransferase by the alternating α-2,8/α-2,9 oligosaccharide with α-2,9 glycosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. A, separation of alternating α-2,8/α-2,9 oligosaccharides generated by Endo-N digestion of the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid by ion exchange chromatography. Polysaccharide isolated from E. coli Bos-12 was incubated with bacteriophage φ92 Endo-N as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The hydrolysate was pass through a Dowex 50-X8 column prior to applying to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. Oligosaccharides with different DP were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl as described previously. The lactonized products are indicated as (L). B, E. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferase preparation was incubated with exogenous oligosaccharide of different chain length (0.69 mm) in the presence of CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac for a period of 1 h, and the incubation mixtures were spotted on a TLC plate, developed, and autoradiographed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Lane 1, reaction without exogenous oligosaccharide;lane 2, dimer, Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac; lane 3, tetramer: Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac(α-2,8)Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac;lane 4, hexamer, Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac(α-2,8)Neu5Ac(α-2,9) Neu5Ac(α-2,8)Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac; lane 5, octamer: Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac(α-2,8)Neu5Ac(α-2,9) Neu5Ac(α-2,8) Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac(α-2,8)Neu5Ac(α-2,9)Neu5Ac; lane 6, alternating α-2,9/α-2,8 heteropolymer of sialic acid; lane 7, control to show the position of CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5 B shows that the oligosaccharides with a DP value ranging from 2 to 8 with an α-2,9 glycosidic linkage at their nonreducing end were not only unable to serve as an exogenous acceptor for the chain elongation mediated by the polysialyltransferase, but they inhibited the de novo endogenous synthesis of polysialic acid catalyzed by the enzyme. The extent of inhibition by the α-2,9-terminated oligomer of sialic acid, calculated from the amount of [14C]Neu5Ac incorporated into the endogenous polymeric form of sialic acid, was 70–80% (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2–5 compared with lane 1). In the absence of inhibitors, the alternating α-2,9/α-2,8-linked heteropolymer of sialic acid with an α-2,8-linkage at the nonreducing end enhanced the transfer of [14C]Neu5Ac to the polymeric acceptor by about 10-fold (Fig. 5 B, lane 1 compared withlane 6). The polysialyltransferase of E. coliBos-12 appears only to recognize an α-2,8 linkage at the nonreducing end in the acceptor to transfer Neu5Ac.To eliminate the possibility that the inhibition could be caused by attachment of the O-acetyl group or by formation of lactone, all polysaccharides used were treated with 0.1 n NaOH as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Linkage Analysis of the Sialic Acid Added to the AcceptorPeriodate, which cleaves C-C bonds having vicinal hydroxyl groups (e.g. the C7-C8 bond of the α-2,9-linked sialic acid), was employed to determine the newly formed linkage between [14C]Neu5Ac and the acceptor, the α-2,9/α-2,8-linked heteropolymer of sialic acid (Fig. 2, ▵). Periodate oxidation of the radiolabeled polysaccharide followed by reduction with nonradiolabeled sodium borohydride (1Egan W. Liu T.-Y. Dorow D. Cohen J.S. Robbins J.D. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) released a radiolabeled disaccharide with a retention time of 38 min (Fig.6), which corresponds to the position of an authentic sample of disaccharide with the requisite structure predicted from previous study (Fig. 1 and refs. therein). This radioactive disaccharide derivative was examined further by thin layer chromatography and was shown to possess the requisite mobility on the chromatogram (Fig. 6, inset). Periodate oxidation did not release a trisaccharide derivative nor a monosaccharide; NeuAc7, which would have resulted, had the last residue added to the acceptor and formed either an α-2,8-linkage or an α-2,9-linked sialic acid at the nonreducing end. In the former case the last two residues would have been α-2,8/α2,8-linked sialic acids, whereas in the latter case it would have been α-2,8/α-2,9-linked sialic acids. These results favor the proposal that the polysialyltransferase from E. coli Bos-12 catalyzed the transfer of a preformed α-2,8-linked dimer of sialyl residue to the nonreducing end of the acceptor to form an α-2,9 linkage between the acceptor and the α-2,8-linked dimer.Figure 6Glycosidic linkage analysis of newly added sialyl residues on the capsular polysaccharide of E. coli Bos-12. 14C-Labeled capsular polysaccharide from E. coli Bos-12 was oxidized with 2-fold molar excess of sodium meta-periodate for 18 h at 25 °C and quenched by ethylene glycol. The reaction mixture was applied to a Superdex peptide gel filtration column (7.5 × 300 mm) to separate radiolabeled material from ethylene glycol and salt. Samples recovered from the gel filtration chromatography were reduced by sodium borohydride and desalted by the Superdex peptide gel filtration column prior to analyses by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography. Samples recovered from anion exchange chromatography were analyzed further by TLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset: lane 1, small molecule released after periodate oxidation; lane 2,14C-labeled capsular polysaccharide of E. coliBos-12; lane 3, control to show the position of CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When the acceptor molecule was the α-2,8-linked homo-oligomer of sialic acid, the results obtained were much more complicated (Fig. 5,A–D). Upon periodate oxidation, the tetramer, the pentamer, the hexamer, and the heptamer resulting from the addition of a single residue of [14C]Neu5Ac to the respective acceptor released a monomeric product with 24–29% of the radioactivity incorporated into the acceptor, which moved in the position of NeuAc7 on the chromatogram. This portion of the products was assigned to have an α-2,9-linkage at the nonreducing end (TableIII).Table IIIAnalysis of linkages formed between the exogenous α-2,8 oligosialic acid acceptor and [14C]Neu5Ac catalyzed by the E. coli Bos-12 polysialyltransferaseChain lengthaChain length was defined as described in Fig. 4 and Footnote a of Table I.Amount of Neu5Ac incorporatedbThe amount of Neu5Ac incorporated was obtained by liquid scintillation counting of effluent from ion exchange chromatography and recalculated from the specific activity of CMP-Neu5Ac.

https://openalex.org/W2075499997,"The NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase fromEscherichia coli, named Fre, is a monomer of 26.2 kDa that catalyzes the reduction of free flavins using NADPH or NADH as electron donor. The enzyme does not contain any prosthetic group but accommodates both the reduced pyridine nucleotide and the flavin in a ternary complex prior to oxidoreduction. The specificity of the flavin reductase for the pyridine nucleotide was studied by steady-state kinetics using a variety of NADP analogs. Both the nicotinamide ring and the adenosine part of the substrate molecule have been found to be important for binding to the polypeptide chain. However, in the case of NADPH, the 2′-phosphate group destabilized almost completely the interaction with the adenosine moiety. Moreover, NADPH and NMNH are very good substrates for the flavin reductase, and we have shown that both these molecules bind to the enzyme almost exclusively by the nicotinamide ring. This provides evidence that the flavin reductase exhibits a unique mode for recognition of the reduced pyridine nucleotide. In addition, we have shown that the flavin reductase selectively transfers the pro-R hydrogen from the C-4 position of the nicotinamide ring and is therefore classified as an A-side-specific enzyme."
