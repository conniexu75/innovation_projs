https://openalex.org/W2132291850,"The zinc finger DNA-binding motif occurs in many proteins that regulate eukaryotic gene expression. The crystal structure of a complex containing the three zinc fingers from Zif268 (a mouse immediate early protein) and a consensus DNA-binding site has been determined at 2.1 angstroms resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 18.2 percent. In this complex, the zinc fingers bind in the major groove of B-DNA and wrap part way around the double helix. Each finger has a similar relation to the DNA and makes its primary contacts in a three-base pair subsite. Residues from the amino-terminal portion of an alpha helix contact the bases, and most of the contracts are made with the guanine-rich strand of the DNA. This structure provides a framework for understanding how zinc fingers recognize DNA and suggests that this motif may provide a useful basis for the design of novel DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1970220520,"Methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH), an alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme from numerous methylotrophic soil bacteria, contains a novel quinonoid redox prosthetic group that is covalently bound to its small beta subunit through two amino acyl residues. A comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence of the small subunit for the enzyme from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 with the published amino acid sequence obtained by the Edman degradation method, allowed the identification of the amino acyl constituents of the cofactor as two tryptophyl residues. This information was crucial for interpreting 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectral data collected for the semicarbazide- and carboxymethyl-derivatized bis(tripeptidyl)-cofactor of MADH from bacterium W3A1. The cofactor is composed of two cross-linked tryptophyl residues. Although there are many possible isomers, only one is consistent with all the data: The first tryptophyl residue in the peptide sequence exists as an indole-6,7-dione, and is attached at its 4 position to the 2 position of the second, otherwise unmodified, indole side group. Contrary to earlier reports, the cofactor of MADH is not 2,7,9-tricarboxypyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a derivative thereof, or pro-PQQ. This appears to be the only example of two cross-linked, modified amino acyl residues having a functional role in the active site of an enzyme, in the absence of other cofactors or metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W1656231611,"A systematic mutagenesis strategy was used to identify the functional regions and residues of a protein kinase. Clusters of the charged amino acids in the catalytic subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cAMP-dependent protein kinase, were systematically mutated to alanine, producing a set of mutations that encompassed the entire molecule. Residues indispensable for enzyme activity were identified by testing the ability of the mutants to function in vivo. Active mutants were assayed in vitro, and mutants with reduced specific activity were subsequently analyzed by steady-state kinetics to determine the effects of the mutation on kcat and on Km for MgATP and for a peptide substrate. Specific residues and regions of the enzyme were identified that are likely to be important in catalysis and in binding of MgATP, functions that are common to all protein kinases. Additional regions were identified that are likely to be important in binding a peptide substrate, the recognition of which is likely to be specific to the serine/threonine protein kinases that have a requirement for basic residues around the target hydroxyamino acid. The properties of mutants defective in substrate recognition were consistent with an ordered sequential reaction mechanism. This represents the first comprehensive analysis of a protein kinase by a rational mutagenesis strategy."

https://openalex.org/W1995810447,"In many regions of Asia and Africa, consanguineous marriages currently account for approximately 20 to 50% of all unions, and preliminary observations indicate that migrants from these areas continue to contract marriages with close relatives when resident in North America and Western Europe. Consanguinity is associated with increased gross fertility, due at least in part to younger maternal age at first livebirth. Morbidity and mortality also may be elevated, resulting in comparable numbers of surviving offspring in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous families. With advances in medicine and public health, genetic disorders will account for an increased proportion of disease worldwide. Predictably, this burden will fall more heavily on countries and communities in which consanguinity is strongly favored, as the result of the expression of deleterious recessive genes. However, studies conducted in such populations indicate that the adverse effects associated with inbreeding are experienced by a minority of families."

https://openalex.org/W1507543762,"The two thymidine (dThd) kinases in human cells, the cytosolic, S-phase-specific TK1 and the mitochondrial, constitutively expressed TK2 were purified to homogeneity as judged from sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The substrate specificity of TK1 and TK2 toward natural substrates and important nucleoside analogues was compared. With TK1, the Km values for 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd), 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), and 3'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (FLT) were 2.2, 0.6, and 2.1 microM as compared to 0.5 microM for dThd and 9 microM for deoxyuridine (dUrd). With TK2, dUrd, deoxycytidine (dCyd), and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) were efficiently phosphorylated, but with distinctly different kinetics: Michaelis-Menten kinetics with dCyd, dUrd, and FdUrd; negative cooperativity with dThd. Negative cooperativity was also observed with AZT, although this drug was a very poor substrate for TK2 with a Vmax of 5-6% of that with dThd. FLT, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddCyd), and arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) were not substrates for TK2, and 2',3'-didehydrodideoxy-thymidine (D4T) was not a substrate for TK1 or TK2. On the other hand, AZT, FLT, and D4T were competitive inhibitors with Ki values of 0.6, 6, and 2073 microM for TK1, and 2, 10, and 78 microM for TK2, respectively. The much lower tolerance for modifications of the deoxyribose moiety of TK2 as compared to TK1 is important for the design of new antiviral nucleoside analogues intended for use in cells with different expression of TK1 and TK2."

https://openalex.org/W1966129578,"Conventional approaches for proving in situ biodegradation of organic pollutants in aquifers have severe limitations. In the approach described here, patterns in a comprehensive set of microbiological activity and distribution data were analyzed. Measurements were performed on sediment samples gathered at consistent depths in aquifer boreholes spanning a gradient of contaminant concentrations at a buried coal tar site. Microbial adaptation to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was demonstrated by mineralization of naphthalene and phenanthrene in samples from PAH-contaminated, but not adjacent pristine, zones. Furthermore, contaminant-stimulated in situ bacterial growth was indicated because enhanced numbers of protozoa and their bacterial prey were found exclusively in contaminated subsurface samples. The data suggest that many convergent lines of logically linked indirect evidence can effectively document in situ biodegradation of aquifer contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W1538052598,"Dystrophin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle by alkaline dissociation of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex which was first prepared by derivatized lectin chromatography. Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was isolated from digitonin-solubilized rabbit skeletal muscle membranes by a novel two-step method involving succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) chromatography and DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography. Proteins co-purifying with dystrophin were a protein triplet of Mr 59,000 and four glycoproteins of Mr 156,000, 50,000, 43,000, and 35,000, all previously identified as components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Alkaline treatment of sWGA/DEAE-purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex resulted in complete dissociation of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. In order to separate dystrophin from its associated proteins, alkaline-dissociated dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was sedimented by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The residual glycoproteins which contaminated peak dystrophin-containing gradient fractions were then removed by WGA-Sepharose adsorption. The resulting protein appeared as a single band with an apparent Mr of 400,000 on overloaded Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The absence of WGA-peroxidase staining on nitrocellulose transfers of the pure protein indicated that the pure protein was devoid of contaminating glycoproteins. Antisera raised against the carboxyl terminus of human skeletal muscle dystrophin (which does not cross-react with the carboxyl terminus of the chromosome 6-encoded dystrophin-related protein) recognized the pure protein as did antisera specific for the amino terminus of human dystrophin. These data indicate that the protein isolated is indeed the intact, predominant skeletal muscle isoform product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene."
https://openalex.org/W1750774965,"Neutrophils possess a classical Ca2+, phosphatidyl serine (PS) and diglyceride (DG)-dependent protein kinase C (beta-PKC) which was translocatable from cytosol to membrane in response to elevated Ca2+ in the physiologic range or to pretreatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The translocatable beta-PKC was purified from neutrophil membranes prepared in the presence of Ca2+, eluted with EGTA and subjected to hydroxyapatite chromatography. An 80-kDa protein possessing Ca/DG/PS-dependent histone phosphorylating activity was recognized by a monoclonal antibody to beta-PKC but not to alpha-PKC or gamma-PKC. A cytosolic kinase activity remaining after Ca(2+)-induced translocation of beta-PKC was dependent on PS and DG but did not require Ca2+. This novel Ca(2+)-independent, PS/DG-dependent kinase, termed nPKC, eluted from hydroxyapatite between alpha-PKC and beta-PKC, ran as a 76-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was reactive to a polyclonal consensus antibody but not to monoclonal antibodies to alpha-PKC, beta-PKC, or gamma-PKC. Long chain fatty acyl-CoA, but not the corresponding free fatty acids, inhibited nPKC in the 1-10 microM range. The chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe triggered prompt but transient increases in neutrophil long chain fatty acid acyl-CoA, suggesting that nPKC is regulated by fatty acyl-CoA as well as DG during neutrophil activation. Purified beta-PKC phosphorylated a number of cytosolic proteins in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, including a major 47-kDa cytosolic protein, which may be implicated in superoxide anion generation. In contrast, nPKC did not phosphorylate the 47-kDa protein, but phosphorylated numerous cytosolic proteins in a Ca(2+)-independent manner, including a 66-kDa protein which was not phosphorylated by beta-PKC. Differences in location, substrate specificity, and cofactor dependence between nPKC and beta-PKC suggest these kinases may play selective roles in the activation sequence of the neutrophil."
https://openalex.org/W1630052702,"Maltose is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli by a binding protein-dependent transport system. The three membrane-associated components of the transport system, the MalK, MalF, and MalG proteins, have been solubilized from the membrane and maltose transport activity has been reconstituted in proteoliposome vesicles (Davidson, A. L., and Nikaido, H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4254-4260). A modification of the reconstitution technique is presented which permits reconstitution from the detergent dodecyl maltoside. Utilizing reconstitution of maltose transport as an assay, we have purified these proteins in the presence of n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside. The purified proteins catalyze both maltose transport activity and ATP hydrolysis. In all experiments, the MalF, MalG, and MalK proteins behaved as a multiprotein complex; all three proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibody prepared against MalF, and they copurified, eluting from a gel filtration column between markers of Mr 160,000 and 200,000. Each complex contains two MalK, one MalF, and one MalG proteins, providing two putative sites for ATP hydrolysis. Chemical cross-linking detected specific interactions between MalF and MalG and between MalF and MalK."
https://openalex.org/W1616654149,"The reaction of ozone with a number of biological molecules was found to produce singlet oxygen in high yield. At pH 7.0, the reaction of ozone with an equimolar amount of biological molecule produced the following singlet oxygen yields (mole of singlet oxygen/mole of ozone): cysteine, 0.49 +/- 0.02; methionine, 1.13 +/- 0.11; reduced glutathione, 0.33 +/- 0.02; albumin, 1.00 +/- 0.05; uric acid, 0.64 +/- 0.09; ascorbic acid, 0.96 +/- 0.007; NADPH, 1.07 +/- 0.07; NADH, 0.95 +/- 0.01. Thus, singlet oxygen may be an important intermediate in the biochemical damage caused by ozone."
https://openalex.org/W1932457795,"Abstract The serine protease inhibitor (serpin) C1 inhibitor inactivates enzymes involved in the regulation of vascular permeability. A patient from the Ma family with the genetic disorder hereditary angioedema inherited a dysfunctional C1 inhibitor allele. Relative to normal plasma, the patients's plasma contained an additional C1 inhibitor immunoreactive band, which comigrated with normal C1 inhibitor cleaved by plasma kallikrein, C1s, or factor XIIa. C1 inhibitor Ma did not react with a monoclonal antibody to a neoepitope that is present in complexed and cleaved normal C1 inhibitor, suggesting conformational differences between cleaved normal C1- inhibitor and cleaved C1 inhibitor Ma. Molecular cloning and sequencing of exon 8 of the C1 inhibitor Ma allele revealed a single C to A mutation, changing alanine 434 to glutamic acid. Ala 434 of C1 inhibitor aligns with the P12 residue of the prototypical serpin alpha 1-antitrypsin. The P12 amino acid of all inhibitory serpins is alanine, and it is present in a highly conserved region on the amino-terminal side of the serpin-reactive center loop. Whereas normal C1 inhibitor expressed by transfected COS-1 cells formed complexes with and was cleaved by kallikrein, fXIIa, and C1s, COS-1-expressed Ala434---Glu C1 inhibitor was cleaved by these enzymes but did not form complexes with them. These results, together with evidence from other studies, suggest that serpin protease inhibitor activity is the result of protein conformational change that occurs when the P12 region of a serpin moves from a surface location, on the reactive site loop of the native molecule, to an internal location within sheet A of the complexed inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1504297960,"Morphological observations suggest a close association between heterochromatin and the nuclear lamina. To investigate the molecular aspects of this association, we have established a simple sedimentation assay employing purified lamin proteins, or their 125I-labeled derivatives, and polynucleosomal particles isolated from avian erythrocytes. We report here that purified, unlabeled lamin A and 125I-lamin A, but not 125I-lamin B or 125I-bovine serum albumin, bind to polynucleosomes in a saturable and specific fashion. The specific binding of 125I-lamin A is of high affinity (Kd = approximately 1 x 10(-9) M) and is distinctly temperature-dependent. This interaction is not affected by exogenous polyionic agents such as polylysine and DNA, but it can be abolished by protease digestion of the polynucleosomes. These data suggest that nuclear lamin A maintains a direct association with a proteinaceous constituent of interphase chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1498898707,"One of the major objectives in the study of thrombogenesis is to determine the mechanisms by which a hematopoietic progenitor is activated and committed to the megakaryocytic lineage. Recent development of primary cultures of human megakaryocytes and the molecular cloning of genes that are specific to this lineage offer the possibility of getting some insights into the genetic mechanisms that control megakaryocytopoiesis. One gene of interest is the glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) gene; GPIIb, the alpha subunit of the platelet cytoadhesin GPIIb-IIIa, is produced in megakaryocytes at an early stage of the differentiation, whereas the other subunit of this complex, GPIIIa, is expressed in other cells. For these reasons, the 5'-flanking region of the GPIIb gene was used to identify the regions that interact with DNA-binding nuclear factors. A fragment extending from -643 to +33 is capable of controlling the tissue-specific expression of the CAT gene in transfection experiments. Within this region, we have identified several sequences that are implicated in DNA protein interactions as shown in DNAse I footprints and gel mobility shift assays. One region, centered at -54, is similar to a nuclear factor E1-binding site, and a region located at position -233 contains a CCAAT motif. Two domains centered at positions -345 and -540, respectively, bind proteins that are present in megakaryocytic cells and nonrelated cells as well. Finally, two other domains, located at positions -460 and -510, interact with proteins that are only present in megakaryocytic cells. In addition, deletion of the region containing these two domains results in a significant decrease of the promoter activity. It is very likely that these domains bind megakaryocyte-specific nuclear proteins acting as positive transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1484533956,"Co-translational protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is interrupted by particular amino acid sequences which are called stop-transfer sequences. Since the stop-transfer process should reflect the character of the protein translocation machinery, systematic examination on the structural requirements for stop-transfer sequences should give information about the translocation process. By the manipulation of the cDNA of interleukin 2, a typical secretory protein, the middle portion of the molecule was replaced with systematically constructed hydrophobic stretches, and two positively or negatively charged amino acid residues were introduced just behind the hydrophobic stretches. The modified proteins were synthesized with an in vitro transcription-translation system in the presence of dog pancreas rough microsomes, and their topologies in the membrane were examined with proteinase K digestion. The efficiency of stop-translocation depended on the hydrophobicity and the length of the inserted stretch. The segments followed by positively charged residues interrupted the translocation more efficiently than those with negatively charged residues. We observed that more than 19 alanine residues were required for efficient stop-translocation, whereas only 9 leucine residues were sufficient. We suggest that the positively charged residues following the hydrophobic stretches promote stop-translocation of the peptides through the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1545176156,"Expression of the C-terminal third of chicken gizzard caldesmon in Escherichia coli, using the Nagai vector (Nagai, K., and Thogersen, H.V. (1987) Methods Enzmol. 153, 461-481), produces a cII-caldesmon fusion protein (27 kDa) with caldesmon sequence beginning at Lys579. Degradation during purification yields five peptides with molecular masses of 24, 22, 19 (two peptides), and 15 kDa. The 24-kDa peptide begins at Phe581; the 22-kDa peptide begins at Leu597, the two 19-kDa peptides begin at Phe581 and Val629, respectively; the 15-kDa peptide also begins at Val629. We estimate that the 15-kDa and one of the 19-kDa peptides end near Leu710. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce truncated peptides with known C termini; one peptide (17 kDa) terminates at Asn675. Digestion of the fragments with chymotrypsin generates a second 15-kDa fragment that begins at Ser666 (15K'). All of the peptides, with the exception of 15K', bind Ca(2+)-calmodulin-Sepharose and share a common 37-amino acid peptide between Val629 and Ser666, suggesting this contains the calmodulin binding site. Comparison with published sequences (Takagi, T., Yazawa, M., Ueno, T., Suzuki, S., and Yagi, K. (1989) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 106, 778-783 and Bartegi, A., Fattoum, A., Derancourt, J., and Kassab, R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15231-15238) for other calmodulin-binding fragments further restricts the binding site to 7 residues, Trp-Glu-Lys-Gly-Asn-Val-Phe, between Trp659 and Ser666. All of the fragments, except the two 15-kDa peptides, co-sediment with F-actin, indicating that there are two segments in the C-terminal third of caldesmon that can interact with F-actin: one between Leu597 and Val629, the other between Arg711 and Pro756. Although separated in the primary sequence, these domains may interact with the calmodulin-binding region in the folded structure."
https://openalex.org/W1588502587,"We have explored the acyl-CoA substrate specificity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) by synthesizing 81 fatty acid analogs and surveying their activity in a coupled in vitro assay containing Pseudomonas acyl-CoA synthetase and Escherichia coli-derived yeast NMT. Single oxygen or sulfur substitution for C-3 through C-13 is well tolerated by both enzymes. Detailed kinetic analyses suggest that the acyl-CoA and peptide-binding sites of NMT are relatively insensitive to placement of single group 6B heteroatoms. By contrast, di-oxygen-substituted analogs were very poor substrates, producing dramatic reductions in the affinity of NMTs peptide-binding site for a synthetic octapeptide substrate derived from the NH2-terminal sequence of a known N-myristoylprotein, the gag poly-protein precursor of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). This observation provides an example of binding site cooperativity in NMT. Replacement of one oxygen with sulfur at either the 6, 9, or 12 position of dioxatetradecanoic acids results in a general increase in peptide catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km). An analysis of five fatty acids from octanoic to dodecanoic having terminal phenyl groups indicated that the best substrate was 10-phenyldecanoic acid even though Corey-Pauling-Koltun molecular models indicate that it has a length equivalent to that of tridecanoic acid. Six analogs having an equivalent length of 13 carbon atoms were subsequently prepared in which the phenyl group was systematically moved one methylene group closer to carboxyl. Movement of the phenyl just one carbon closer to carboxyl (producing 9-(p-methylphenyl) nonanoic acid) decreases peptide catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) severalfold compared to 10-phenyldecanoic acid. 10-(4-Tolyl)decanoic acid has the same relative positions of phenyl and carboxyl as 10-phenyldecanoic acid even though a methyl group is present on the phenyl ring. It produces peptide Km and Vmax values that are the same as 10-phenyldecanoic acid. Substitution of either oxygen or sulfur for a methylene group fails to override the effects noted when the phenyl group position is altered in the C-14 equivalent fatty acid series. Several fatty acids of differing chain lengths with cyclohexyl-, 2-furyl, and 2-thienyl groups at their omega termnius had activity profiles that paralleled those of the comparable phenyl-substituted compounds. Myristic acid analogs with triple bonds (beginning at positions 2 through 13), cis-double bonds (positions 3 through 13) and trans-double bond isomers (E5, E6, and E7) were also tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1547251039,"Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) induces two Ca2+ responses in single gonadotropes: a Ca2+ spike/plateau or oscillation. Similar receptor-mediated Ca2+ signals have been reported in many cell types but their functional significance is obscure. Accordingly, we have determined the concentration-response properties of LHRH-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) release at the single cell level. We demonstrate a critical single cell LHRH threshold for LH release. Each gonadotrope had a particular LHRH threshold value and a range of different single cell thresholds was distributed in the gonadotrope population. The physiological significance of the threshold was demonstrated by a striking reduction (delta ED50 = 153 nM) of the LHRH threshold immediately before the preovulatory surge of LH release. The metestrous phenotype of secretion resembled a quantal process in contrast with the graded process of the proestrous phenotype. That is, the quantity of hormone secreted per metestrous gonadotrope was independent of LHRH concentration and more all-or-none than graded. The LHRH threshold and the quantal secretion process of metestrous gonadotropes was further studied by measuring cytosolic Ca2+ using fura-2 and digital imaging microscopy. We provide evidence suggesting that the Ca2+ spike/plateau and oscillation are the respective responses to subthreshold and suprathreshold concentrations of LHRH. It is proposed therefore that the Ca2+ oscillation and spike/plateau response form a binary intracellular signaling code that functions as an on-off switch. It is further proposed that this potential code unraveled here for the regulation of hormone secretion may also regulate other gonadotrope functions. Thus, while the Ca2+ spike/plateau response is strongly associated with LH release, it may be associated with reduced levels of LH-beta mRNA, and reduced numbers of LHRH receptors. Conversely, while the Ca2+ oscillation appears to be unrelated to LH release, it may be associated with increased levels of LH-beta mRNA, and increased numbers of LHRH receptors. This model may explain in molecular terms the long-standing observation that an invariant, albeit pulsatile, pattern of LHRH release is sufficient to support the preovulatory surge of LH release."
https://openalex.org/W2139055220,"The glucocorticoid receptor exists in the cytoplasm of hormone-untreated cells as a complex with the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90). Glucocorticoids induce dissociation of the glucocorticoid binding protein from HSP90 and translocation of the receptor to the nucleus. HSP90 binds to actin filaments, and calmodulin or tropomyosin inhibits the binding. We present here evidence that the HSP90-containing glucocorticoid receptor complexes (8 S receptor) bind to filamentous actin in vitro while the HSP90-free form of the receptor does not. The binding was detectable for both the crude cytosolic fractions and the partially purified 8 S glucocorticoid receptor. Purified HSP90 or tropomyosin completely abolished the binding. Calmodulin also inhibited the binding in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. From these results, we conclude that the glucocorticoid receptor complex is able to bind actin filaments via the HSP90 moiety. The binding may provide an anchoring mechanism for the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1481970002,"Our previous studies have shown that the deletion of the insulin receptor carboxyl terminus impairs metabolic, but augments mitogenic, signaling (McClain, D. A., Maegawa, H., Levy, J., Huecksteadt, T., Dull, T. J., Lee, J., Ullrich, A., and Olefsky, J. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8904-8911; Thies, R.S., Ulrich, A., and McClain, D. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12820-12825). To explore further the regulatory role of the insulin receptor carboxyl terminus, a mutant insulin receptor was constructed in which the two tyrosines (Y1316 and Y1322) on the carboxyl terminus were replaced with phenylalanines. Rat 1 fibroblasts expressing high levels of this mutant receptor (Y/F2 cells) exhibited normal insulin binding and normal insulin internalization. The absence of the two tyrosines in the carboxyl terminus did not affect the phosphotransferase activity of the beta-subunit and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. However, the Y/F2 cells showed markedly enhanced sensitivity for insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis. Dose-response curves for both insulin-stimulated thymidine uptake and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation in the Y/F2 cell lines were shifted to the left (4-10-fold) compared with those observed in the cells expressing similar numbers of wild type receptors. Thus, the two tyrosines of the insulin receptor carboxyl terminus do not modulate the kinase function of the insulin receptor, although they are autophosphorylated in native receptors. Moreover, these tyrosines are not necessary for stimulation of glucose transport. On the other hand, these results suggest that the two carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues exert an inhibitory effect on mitogenic signaling in native insulin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1493079944,"Mammalian RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIE (TFIIE) was purified to apparent homogeneity. The activity copurified with polypeptides of 34 and 56 kDa. The 56-kDa subunit was sufficient for low levels of transcription activity in a transcription system reconstituted in vitro with highly purified general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. The 34-kDa polypeptide was found to be stimulatory. The native molecular mass of TFIIE, as determined by gel filtration was estimated to be approximately 200 kDa, suggesting that TFIIE exists in solution as a tetramer composed of two 56-kDa and two 34-kDa polypeptides. Consistent with previous studies demonstrating an interaction of TFIIE with RNA polymerase II, we found that the entry of TFIIE into the transcription cycle was subsequent to the entry of RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1483580827,"An enzyme of molecular weight 32,000 comprising a single subunit has been isolated from whole cell extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro, the enzyme transfers the gamma phosphate of ATP to a protein substrate, histone H4, to produce an alkali-stable phosphorylation. Modification of the substrate histidine with diethylpyrocarbonate prevented phosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated substrate showed the presence of 1-phosphohistidine. Hence, the isolated enzyme is a protein histidine kinase. A novel assay for acid-labile alkali-stable protein phosphorylation was used in the purification of the kinase activity to a final specific activity of 2,700 nmol/15 min/mg. The purified enzyme phosphorylates specifically histidine 75 in histone H4 and does not phosphorylate histidine 18 nor histidine residues in any other core histone. Steady state kinetic data are consistent with an ordered sequential reaction with Km values for Mg-ATP and histone H4 of 60 and 17 microM, respectively. The protein histidine kinase requires a divalent cation such as Mg2+, Co2+, or Mn2+ but will not use Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, spermine, or spermidine. This is the first purification of an enzyme that catalyzes N-linked phosphorylation in proteins."

Nevertheless, the biochemistry of the intrinsic association between factors Xa and Va is poorly understood. In the present study we have measured the formation of the protein-protein complex in the absence of phospholipid by using analytical ultracentrifugation. Factor Xa or factor Va were respectively modified with a chromophore-peptidyl-chloromethyl ketone or a thiol-specific chromophore, which permitted selective evaluation of the sedimentation of either component by virtue of its unique absorbance properties. Regardless of which protein was labeled, a factor Xa-Va complex (s20,w = 9.8) was formed. The interaction is specific and reversible. In 2 mM Ca2+ and at 20 degrees C, the dissociation constant for the binding of factor Xa to factor Va is 0.8 microM with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The association has multiphasic Ca2+ dependence.

Insulin stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in cells that expressed normal insulin receptors (RAT 1 HIRc, and CHO-WT and CHO-T cells), or receptors in which lysine 1018 in the ATP-binding site of the tyrosine kinase domain was exchanged for alanine (RAT 1 A/K1018 and CHO-mut cells). For both rat and hamster cell lines, the insulin dose-response curves from cells that expressed the mutant receptors were identical to those from the appropriate controls that over expressed the normal insulin receptors. Insulin failed to stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in CHO-delta cells, which expressed a mutant human insulin receptor that was truncated by 112 amino acids at the carboxyl terminal of the beta chain. Control studies verified that all the cells used in this study exhibited the expected phenotypes with respect to the number of insulin receptors which they expressed, insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity, and the biological consequences of inactivating the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. These findings show that the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase does not play an obligatory role in the insulin signaling pathway that stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1589613282,"Membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg) is the antigen receptor on B lymphocytes mediating early events in antigen presentation and signal transduction. Wild-type human mIgM constructs transfected into the murine B-cell lymphoma A20 are expressed as transmembrane proteins with antigen presentation and signaling functions comparable to the endogenous mIgG2A; the transfected wild-type mIgM is internalized rapidly after anti-Ig cross-linking. Transfected constructs lacking the normal three-amino acid cytoplasmic tail are expressed exclusively as phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, lack both antigen presentation and signal transduction functions, and are internalized slowly following anti-Ig binding. The molecular mass of the cytoplasmic tail-deleted phosphatidylinositol-linked Ig molecule is consistent with cleavage of the transmembrane residues during processing. Cytoplasmic domains may therefore regulate the mode of expression of membrane proteins and thereby influence their functional capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W1597266286,"We have studied the biosynthesis of cartilage dermatan sulfate proteoglycan II (DS-PGII) (decorin) using in vitro translation of mRNA to determine the size of the primary gene product and by radiolabeling the protein in the presence of tunicamycin to inhibit the addition of Asn-linked oligosaccharides. Pulse-chase experiments were performed to examine post-translational processing and secretion. Inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing were used to determine whether DS-PGII molecules containing partially processed oligosaccharides could become proteoglycans and be secreted. Cell-free translation of sucrose gradient-fractionated RNA and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the core protein confirmed that the functional translated mRNA is in the size range of the two mRNA species observed by hybridization of chondrocyte RNA with a bone PGII cloned probe and that the translation product is a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa. Digestion of the intact proteoglycan (average molecular mass = 103 kDa) with chondroitinase ABC or AC results in an approximately 48-49-kDa product. Chondrocytes treated with tunicamycin to inhibit Asn-linked oligosaccharide addition synthesize and secrete a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-substituted proteoglycan (average molecular mass = 86 kDa), yielding a 42-kDa core protein after chondroitinase ABC digestion, showing that Asn-linked oligosaccharides are not required for the addition of GAG chains or secretion. Following a short pulse (10 min) of [3H]leucine, three glycosylated forms of the DS-PGII core protein were observed, one of which is likely to be the precursor form of PGII predicted by the implied protein sequence of both bovine and human cDNA clones. Following the apparent cleavage of the propeptide, GAG-substituted intracellular core protein is detectable. Susceptibility to endoglycosidase H indicates that approximately one-third of the secreted core protein contains exclusively complex-type Asn-linked oligosaccharides and approximately two-thirds contain high mannose as well as complex-type oligosaccharides. Secreted DS-PGII appears to be fully substituted with three Asn-linked oligosaccharide chains. Inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing, however, permitted secretion of GAG-substituted DS-PGII that was fully (three chains) or incompletely (one or two chains) substituted with partially processed Asn-linked carbohydrate chains. By comparison of chondrocyte DS-PGII with fibroblast DS-PGII, we conclude that the addition and processing of Asn-linked carbohydrate chains are directed by the amino acid sequence of the core protein. The results reported here also suggest that the addition of xylose, the initial step in GAG chain synthesis, occurs early in biosynthesis and is determined by the primary amino acid sequence of the core protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1855218898,"The crystal structure of the DNA decamer C-G-A-T-C-G-A-T-C-G has been solved to a resolution of 1.5 A, with a final R-factor of 16.1% for 5,107 two-sigma reflections. Crystals are orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with cell dimensions a = 38.93 A, b = 39.63 A, c = 33.30 A, and 10 base pairs/asymmetric unit. The final structure contains 404 DNA atoms, 142 water molecules treated as oxygen atoms, and two Mg(H2O)6(2+) complexes. Decamers stack atop one another to simulate continuous helical columns through the crystal, as with three previously solved monoclinic decamers, but the lateral contacts between columns are quite different in the orthorhombic and monoclinic cells. Narrow and wide regions of the minor groove exhibit a single spine or two ribbons of hydration, respectively, and the minor groove is widest when BII phosphate conformations are opposed diagonally across the groove. Phosphate conformation, in turn, appears to have a base sequence dependence. Twist, rise, cup, and roll are linked as has been observed in the three monoclinic decamers and can be characterized by high or low twist profiles. In all five known decamer crystal structures and eight representative dodecamers, a high twist profile is observed with G-C and G-A steps whereas all other R-R steps are low twist profiles (R = purine). A-T and A-C steps are intermediate in character whereas C-A and C-G exhibit behavior that is strongly influenced by the profiles of the preceding and following steps. When sufficient data are in hand, sequence/structure relationships for all helix parameters probably should be considered in a 4-base pair context. At this stage of limited information the problem is compounded because there are 136 unique 4-base steps x-A-B-y in a double helix as compared with only 10 2-base steps A-B."

https://openalex.org/W1545480663,"Oncostatin M is a polypeptide cytokine having unique structure and diverse biological activities, including the ability to inhibit growth of certain cultured tumor cells. Here we have determined the disulfide bonding pattern of recombinant oncostatin M and have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify regions of this molecule necessary for receptor binding and growth inhibitory activities. Two intramolecular disulfide bonds, C6-C127 and C49-C167, were identified in recombinant oncostatin M. Analysis of mutations at each of the five cysteines in oncostatin M indicated that mutants C49S and C167S were inactive (less than 1/10 wild type activity) in growth inhibitory assays and radioreceptor assays. Carboxyl-terminal deletion mutations terminating at S185 and beyond were active, but further shortening abolished activity in both assays. Two deletion mutants proximal to C49 (delta 22-36 and delta 44-47) and insertion mutant GAG77 also were inactive. One deletion mutant, delta 87-90, had significantly (approximately 3-fold) increased activities in both growth inhibitory assays and radioreceptor assays. A potential amphiphilic domain was identified beginning at C167 and extending toward the carboxyl terminus. Two mutants having altered hydrophobic residues within this domain (F176G and F184G) were inactive, suggesting that these residues are required for proper conformation of the receptor binding site. Taken together, these results indicate that biological activity of oncostatin M requires discontinuous regions of the molecule, including residues near the essential disulfide bond, C49-C167, and within a putative amphiphilic helix at the carboxyl terminus. Oncostatin M thus belongs to a growing family of cytokines whose interactions with their respective receptors are mediated in part by known or predicted carboxyl-terminal amphiphilic helices."
https://openalex.org/W1544794927,"Genes for urea cycle enzymes including liver-type arginase are expressed mainly in the liver and are regulated developmentally, nutritionally, and hormonally in a coordinated manner. The promoter region of the rat arginase gene was investigated with an in vitro transcription system using nuclear extracts prepared from rat tissues. Accurate initiation of the transcription in liver nuclear extracts was confirmed by runoff analysis and S1 nuclease mapping. The arginase promoter was transcribed more efficiently in liver nuclear extracts than in brain extracts, reproducing the in vivo tissue specificity qualitatively. Analysis of deletion mutants of the 5'-flanking region in liver nuclear extracts revealed a positive regulatory region spanning nucleotides -90 to -51 relative to the transcription start site. Overlapping this region, two protected areas were detected by DNase I footprinting. Competition analysis with synthetic oligonucleotides showed that the more downstream protected area was occupied, in a mutually exclusive manner, by two factors each related to CTF/NF-1 and Sp1. The other more upstream protected area was recognized by a factor related to the liver-enriched transcription factor C/EBP, which was recently shown to interact with regulatory regions of two other urea cycle enzyme genes."
https://openalex.org/W1546614931,"Homogeneous 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD, EC 1.1.1.50) of rat liver cytosol is potently inhibited at its active site by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Using 3 alpha-bromoacetoxy-5 alpha-androstan-17-one (BrAnd, a substrate analog) and 11 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone (Br11P, a glucocorticoid analog) as affinity-labeling agents, kinetic evidence was obtained that these agents alkylate this site. Inactivation of 3 alpha-HSD with either [14C]BrAnd or [14C] Br11P led to the incorporation of 1 mol of affinity-labeling agent per enzyme monomer. Complete acid hydrolysis of 3 alpha-HSD radiolabeled with either agent followed by amino acid analysis led to the identification of [14C]carboxymethylcysteine indicating that [14C]BrAnd and [14C]Br11P covalently tag discrete reactive cysteine(s) at the enzyme active site. Trypsin digestion of [14C]BrAnd-inactivated 3 alpha-HSD followed by peptide mapping led to the purification of a single radiolabeled peptide (3A1) which gave the following sequence: H2N-Ser-Ile-Gly-Val-Ser-Asn-Phe-Asn-X-Arg-CO2H. Identical experiments on [14C] Br11P-inactivated 3 alpha-HSD led to the purification of three radiolabeled peptides (11P1-11P3). The major radiolabeled peptide (11P1) had an identical sequence to 3A1 which was tagged with [14C]BrAnd. The minor radiolabeled peptides had the following sequences: H2N-Ser-Lys-Asp-Ile-Ile-Leu-Val-Ser-Tyr-X-Thr-Leu-Gly-Ser-Ser-Arg-CO2H (11P2) and H2N-Ser-Pro-Val-Leu-Leu-Asp-Asp-Pro-Val-Leu-X-Ala-Ile-Ala-Lys-CO2H (11P3). In each peptide group X was identified as carboxymethylcysteine. Alignment of the peptide sequences with the primary structure of 3 alpha-HSD, deduced from its cDNA clone, assigned peptide 11P1 to residues 162-171, peptide 11P2 to residues 208-223, and peptide 11P3 to residues 232-246 of the amino acid sequence. The reactive cysteines correspond to Cys170, Cys217, and Cys242. We propose that Cys170 labeled by BrAnd may lie within the catalytic pocket of the enzyme. By contrast the 11 alpha-bromoacetoxy group in Br11P labeled several reactive cysteines which may be involved in the binding of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs."
https://openalex.org/W1545918964,"Physicochemical and functional analyses of the translation products of fiber mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate suggested that fiber polypeptide chains (monomers) were capable of self-assembling in vitro, forming trimeric fibers (trimers) without direct intervention of any other adenovirus-coded protein or cell nuclear matrix component. Kinetic studies showed that trimer formation occurred at a rate six times lower than that of fiber polypeptide synthesis. Fiber assembly was found to be relatively inefficient in vitro, with only 25-30% fiber polypeptides trimerized after 4-h translation reaction. The rate constant for fiber subunit assembly, extrapolated from the kinetic curves of trimer formation, was found to be in the order of magnitude of 10(5) M-1 s-1, with a t 1/2 of 1.3 h at 30 degrees C. A latence phase of approximately 40 min in the appearance of the first detectable trimers indicated that fiber assembly did not occur co-translationally, suggesting the existence of rate-limiting intermediate step(s) during assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1538563084,"Mechanism of fibronectin (FN)-induced chemotaxis of fibroblastic cells has not been fully understood. The present study was performed to establish a molecular nature of the chemotactic region of rat plasma FN. The chemotactic dose-response pattern of intact FN for mouse embryo fibroblastic cells, NIH-L13 cells, which was represented as a curve with a maximum activity at around 50 nM, changed to a biphasic mode through a proteolysis with thermolysin. Two distinct chemotactic components were isolated from the thermolytic fragments. One component, a fragment with a molecular mass of 110-150 kDa, was estimated to contain the central cell-binding domain and the carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain of the intact FN molecule. Cell migration stimulated by the 110-150-kDa fragment increased successively in a dose-dependent manner, and the capability to promote the migration was much higher than that of the intact FN (over 2-fold). The second chemotactic component, a fragment with a molecular mass of 21 kDa, was shown to reside in the carboxyl-terminal fibrin-binding domain. The 21-kDa fragment produced a bell-shape dose-response pattern, being consistent with the intact FN, whereas a maximum response occurred at a 100-fold lower concentration (0.5 nM) than that of the intact FN molecule. At higher concentrations, this fragment revealed an inhibitory activity for the cell migration in response to the 110-150-kDa fragment. No significant molecular interaction between these two active components was observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, suggesting that the 21-kDa fragment may act directly on the cell to inhibit the cell migration. These results suggest that rat plasma FN contains at least two chemotactically active components that regulate cooperatively chemotactic migration of fibroblastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1536627658,"To elucidate a role for heat shock proteins in islet function, isolated pancreatic islets were labeled with [35S]methionine after control, heat shock, or interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) treatment, extracted in the presence of detergent, and then passed over affinity columns with antibodies against heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70), hsp 70 itself, or ATP conjugated to the columns. In control or IL-1 beta-treated islets, the antibody column efficiently absorbed hsp 70 together with two other proteins of molecular masses 46 and 53 kDa. In extracts from heat-shocked cells, the binding of cellularly synthesized hsp 70 to the antibody column was inefficient but improved by the addition of unlabeled partially purified hsp 70 to the extracts. When assessing the binding of proteins in the extracts to the hsp 70 column, hsp 70 and the 46- and 53-kDa proteins among others all bound to the column. No differences in the patterns of binding to the hsp 70 column between extracts from the different islet exposures were noticed. The 46-kDa protein was identified as actin by immunoblot analysis. ATP-agarose column chromatography revealed a pattern of binding similar to that of the hsp 70 column. It is concluded that hsp 70 contains at least two functional domains, one adjacent to the epitope recognized by the antibody and active in restoring cellular function after heat shock, whereas the other has the ability to bind the 46- and 53-kDa and possibly other proteins. Furthermore, the stress induced by heat shock differs significantly from that after IL-1 beta treatment with respect to the functional behavior of hsp 70."
https://openalex.org/W1571787382,"We have used resonance energy transfer to monitor epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor micro-aggregation at the surface of intact human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells. EGF molecules labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and eosin isothiocyanate were demonstrated to bind tightly to cellsurface receptors, to elicit immediate changes in cytosolic free [Ca2+], and to undergo endocytosis. Under conditions which maintain the integrity of the cell, we observed no energy transfer between the donor fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled EGF molecules and the acceptor eosin isothiocyanate-labeled growth factors bound to receptors. However, after disruption of cells by Dounce homogenization, a significant degree of energy transfer was observed (approximately 10-20%) with membranes, indicative of receptor aggregation. These results suggest that EGF does not cause micro-aggregation of the majority of its receptors on the surface of intact A431 cells within the time period of the early events associated with growth factor action. Moreover, it appears that the A431 cells contain some component which imparts a constraint on the ability of EGF receptors to aggregate, and that some of this component is lost upon the disruption of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577041681,"Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors are present on both the apical and basal surfaces of confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells grown on gelatin-coated polycarbonate filters. Although there is only a single species of receptor protein present, as shown by immunoblotting, the receptors on the two surfaces were found to behave differently. LDL receptors on the basal surface show all of the characteristics of the LDL receptor described in fibroblasts in that their number is dependent upon the sterol (or LDL) content of the medium; however, regulation is only affected by LDL in the medium in contact with the basal side. In contrast, the apical surface LDL receptors are not regulated by the presence of LDL in the media on either the apical or basal surface. LDL particles can be transported across the monolayer in a temperature-dependent and -specific manner from the apical to the basal sides of the cell, but not in the opposite direction. The binding of 125I-LDL to both surfaces can be effectively inhibited not only by unlabeled LDL and very low density lipoprotein, but also by an antibody directed against the LDL receptor. The data suggest that the LDL receptors on the two aspects of the cell surface are biochemically identical, but differ in function. Thus, the basal surface receptor is involved in the control of cell cholesterol homeostasis, while that on the apical surface is responsible for the transport of LDL to the basal side."

https://openalex.org/W1552530881,"Abstract The subcellular fate of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) formed from exogenous lactosylceramide (LacCer) in rat liver is investigated. LacCer radiolabeled on different positions of the molecule was intravenously administered to rats as a liposomal dispersion. A Golgi apparatus fraction 140-fold enriched in specific markers and constituted by intact cisternal stacks, as well as the lysosomal and plasma membrane fractions concurrently prepared from the same homogenate, were then studied in order to determine the time course of radioactive glycosphingolipids. LacCer quickly decreased with time in the plasma membrane, whereas in the lysosomes it increased up to 4 h and decreased thereafter. In both fractions results were regardless of the labeling position. In the Golgi apparatus, LacCer increased up to 12 h and then decreased. In this fraction, the radioactivity values of [Glc-3H]LacCer were over twice those of [Gal-3H]LacCer. GlcCer was found only after [Glc-3H]LacCer administration. In the lysosomes, its time course provided a peak similar in shape but delayed in timing with respect to that of LacCer. Conversely, in the Golgi apparatus GlcCer was earlier formed, but earlier consumed, than LacCer. Gangliosides increased in the Golgi apparatus until 4 h and then decreased after 12 h, whereas in the plasma membrane they were progressively accumulated. In both fractions the amount of [Glc-3H]gangliosides was over twice that of [Gal-3H]gangliosides was over twice that of [Gal-3H]gangliosides. Since we demonstrated that the sugars released in the course of LacCer degradation (LacCer----galactose + GlcCer----glucose + ceramide) are not incorporated into glycoconjugates, we conclude that a part of GlcCer formed during the lysosomal degradation of LacCer actually reaches the Golgi apparatus where it undergoes successive glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1582842476,"Interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) each rapidly stimulate binding of nuclear factors from Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, to a 29-base pair regulatory sequence derived from the 5' upstream region of the murine 2-5A synthetase gene. This regulatory sequence contains a functional interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and also functions as a PDGF-responsive sequence. We show that IFN alpha induces binding of a protein of molecular mass 65 kDa to the ISRE. Constitutively expressed ISRE-binding proteins of 98 and 150 kDa are also demonstrated. Binding of inducible factors to the ISRE increases significantly within 15 min of IFN alpha or PDGF treatment. PDGF-induced binding is not mediated by IFN beta. The protein kinase inhibitors, staurosporine and K252a, block PDGF-induced ISRE binding and 2-5A synthetase gene expression. IFN alpha-induced ISRE binding and gene activation are not blocked by these inhibitors. Treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate or dibutyryl cyclic AMP does not activate ISRE binding factors or 2-5A synthetase gene expression. PDGF responsiveness of the ISRE in vivo is also sensitive to staurosporine, indicating that inhibition of a protein kinase activity blocks the PDGF-specific transcriptional signal. Our data indicate the signal transduction pathway for IFN alpha-induced, ISRE-dependent transcription is distinct from the PDGF-induced ISRE response and is likely independent of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C activities."
https://openalex.org/W1488283794,"N-(Cyanoacetyl)-L-phenylalanine (compound 1) and N-(3-chloropropionyl)-L-phenylalanine (compound 2) were studied as the first peptidic mechanism-based inactivators (suicide substrates) for the zinc protease carboxypeptidase A (CPA). A crucial deprotonation on the methylene alpha to the amide carbonyl of 1 and 2 has been suggested to lead to the transient formation of a ketenimine and an alpha, beta-unsaturated amide, respectively. Subsequently, it is proposed that these key intermediates trap an active site nucleophile, resulting in covalent modification of the protein. In competition with the inactivation process, the enzyme hydrolyzes the amide bonds in these molecules. Partition ratios of 1180 +/- 40 and 1680 +/- 60 were determined for 1 and 2, respectively. N-Acrolyl-L-phenylalanine (compound 4), the putative intermediate from 2, was independently studied to test the validity of the mechanistic scheme and was observed to be an active site-directed inactivator of CPA. A solvent deuterium isotope effect of 1.39 +/- 0.02 was noted for inactivation by 2 and one of 1.31 +/- 0.01 for its hydrolysis, in keeping with a proposed promoted water hydrolytic pathway for peptide hydrolysis by CPA (Christanson, D. W., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1989) Acc. Chem. Res. 22, 62-69). Details of the kinetic analysis and design concepts are discussed."
