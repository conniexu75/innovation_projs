Mitochondrial dynamic proteins are profoundly involved in autophagic processes, especially the initiation and formation of autophagosomes, but it is not clear whether they play any role in cardiac autophagy. We previously reported that mitofusin 2 (MFN2), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, serves as a major determinant of cardiomyocyte apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress. Here, we reveal a novel and essential role of MFN2 in mediating cardiac autophagy. We found that specific deletion of MFN2 in cardiomyocytes caused extensive accumulation of autophagosomes. In particular, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a critical step in autophagic degradation, was markedly retarded without altering the formation of autophagosomes and lysosomes in response to ischemia-reperfusion stress. Importantly, MFN2 co-immunoprecipitated with RAB7 in the heart, and starvation further increased it. Knockdown of MFN2 by shRNA prevented, whereas re-expression of MFN2 restored, the autophagosome-lysosome fusion in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Hearts from cardiac-specific MFN2 knock-out mice had abnormal mitochondrial and cellular metabolism and were vulnerable to ischemia-reperfusion challenge.

Significance: Mitofusin 2 has a novel and essential role in cardiac autophagic regulation. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, constantly undergoing shape changes controlled by fusion and fission. Mitochondrial fusion/fission-related proteins mainly consist of the fusion proteins mitofusin 1 and 2 (MFN1 and -2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), and the fission proteins dynamin-related protein (DRP1) and FIS1 (1Santel A.

Recent studies demonstrated that mitochondrial dynamic proteins are also associated with autophagy, a conserved process in all eukaryotes for self-degrading intracellular components and damaged organelles, to maintain normal organelle function and nutrient restoration (6Twig G.

Scorrano L. During autophagy mitochondria elongates are spared from degradation and sustain cell viability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). In addition, Parkin, an important player in Parkinson disease and a ubiquitin ligase related to mitochondrial fission by down-regulation of mitofusins, promotes autophagy to eliminate impaired mitochondria, thus providing a link between the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (9Narendra D.

During starvation-induced autophagy, the mitochondrial outer membrane contributes to the formation of autophagosomes in a manner dependent on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumTEMtransmission electron microscopyCKOcardiac-specific knock-out./mitochondrial connections regulated by MFN2 (10Hailey D.W.

In a tissue with a high rate of aerobic metabolism, heart cells contain prominent mitochondrial networks, occupying up to 40% of the cell volume and generating ATP in response to energy needs through oxidative phosphorylation fueled by the catabolism of lipids and carbohydrates (11Bing R.J.

Med. 1954; 16: 504-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of autophagy in response to Atg1 depletion is associated with the accumulation of deleterious mitochondria (12Suzuki S.W. Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. Starvation-induced cell death in autophagy-defective yeast mutants is caused by mitochondria dysfunction.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e17412Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, whether mitochondria regulate autophagy in the heart has not yet been well defined. Unlike many other cell types, where mitochondria of irregular shape are highly mobile and prone to fusion-fission as pairs of mitochondria meet (13Chan D.C. Mitochondria.

The machinery of mitochondrial inheritance and behavior.Science. 1999; 283: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), the mitochondria in cardiomyocytes are restricted and immobilized in clusters between myofilaments (16Birkedal R.

Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C1148-C1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins, especially MFN2, are expressed abundantly in the heart (1Santel A. Frank S. Gaume B. Herrler M. Youle R.J. Fuller M.T. Mitofusin-1 protein is a generally expressed mediator of mitochondrial fusion in mammalian cells.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2763-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether, in addition to regulating the mitochondrial fusion/fission process, these dynamically related proteins also play a role in mediating autophagic processes in the heart. MFN2 was originally identified as a mitochondrial protein mediating fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and mutation of MFN2 is causally associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A, a neurodegenerative disease (17Kijima K. Numakura C. Izumino H. Umetsu K. Nezu A. Shiiki T. Ogawa M. Ishizaki Y. Kitamura T. Shozawa Y. Hayasaka K. Mitochondrial GTPase mitofusin 2 mutation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2A.Hum.

Mutations in the mitochondrial GTPase mitofusin 2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2A.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). In addition to mediating mitochondrial fusion, MFN2 localizes on the ER membrane, serving as a bridge to tether the ER to mitochondria (19de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Mitofusin 2 tethers endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Moreover, MFN2 plays multiple roles in the regulation of cell metabolism, mitochondrial DNA stability, cell proliferation, and cell survival and death (20Bach D. Pich S. Soriano F.X. Vega N.

The importance of MFN2 is manifested by the embryonic lethality of the global MFN2 knock-out mouse (24Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. Mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2 coordinately regulate mitochondrial fusion and are essential for embryonic development.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Recently, the cardiac role of MFN2 has been explored in vivo in cardiac-specific MFN2 and MFN1/MFN2 knock-out mouse models (25Chen Y. Liu Y. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mitochondrial fusion is essential for organelle function and cardiac homeostasis.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 26Papanicolaou K.N. Khairallah R.J.

Mitofusin-2 maintains mitochondrial structure and contributes to stress-induced permeability transition in cardiac myocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1309-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cardiomyocytes lacking MFN2 have enlarged mitochondria and are protected from cell death due to the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening in response to cardiac stresses (26Papanicolaou K.N. Khairallah R.J. Ngoh G.A. Chikando A. Luptak I. O'Shea K.M. Riley D.D. Lugus J.J. Colucci W.S. Lederer W.J. Stanley W.C. Walsh K. Mitofusin-2 maintains mitochondrial structure and contributes to stress-induced permeability transition in cardiac myocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1309-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Conditionally combined MFN1/MFN2 ablation in adult mouse heart, however, leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and rapid cardiac failure (25Chen Y. Liu Y. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mitochondrial fusion is essential for organelle function and cardiac homeostasis.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that although MFN1/MFN2-mediated mitochondrial fusion plays a pivotal role in regulating cardiac function, MFN2 may control cardiac function alternatively by a means independent of mitochondrial fusion. Our previous studies have shown that up-regulation of MFN2 in response to oxidative stress triggers the apoptotic death of vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, whereas down-regulation or dysregulation of MFN2 leads to vascular proliferative disorders (22Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Dysregulation of HSG triggers vascular proliferative disorders.Nat.

Role of mitofusin 2 in cardiovascular oxidative injury.J. Mol. Med. 2010; 88: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we found a novel function of MFN2 in the heart. Our data showed that, in the cardiac-specific MFN2 knock-out mouse heart, MFN2 deficiency impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and the subsequent accumulation of autophagosomes in cardiomyocytes eventually led to cardiac dysfunction. All procedures of animal handling were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Peking University and by AAALAC International. The Mfn2 gene exon 4 floxed mice (Mfn2f/f) were generated by standard techniques and were bred with Mlc2v-Cre mice to generate cardiac-specific MFN2 knock-out mice (MFN2 CKO), as described previously (29Zheng M. Cheng H. Li X. Zhang J. Cui L. Ouyang K. Han L. Zhao T. Gu Y. Dalton N.D. Bang M.L. Peterson K.L. Chen J. Cardiac specific ablation of Cypher leads to a severe form of dilated cardiomyopathy with premature death.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate, and the hearts were excised for transmission electron microscopy assay, RT-PCR, Western blot, histology, and immunofluorescence detection. In the starvation experiments, 4-month-old mice were deprived of food for 2 days but had free access to drinking water. Detailed procedures are in the supplemental material. After anesthesia, mice were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4), and the hearts were excised, post-fixed, dehydrated, and then embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections (70–90 nm) were observed with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1010, JEOL). Neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated and cultured as described previously (23Shen T. Zheng M. Cao C. Chen C. Tang J. Zhang W. Cheng H. Chen K.H. Xiao R.P. Mitofusin-2 is a major determinant of oxidative stress-mediated heart muscle cell apoptosis.J. Biol.

Elementary events underlying excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle.Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses containing GFP-LC3, MFN2-GFP, MFN2 cDNA, and MFN2-shRNA were used to infect neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes. Cells were harvested to assess the efficiency of gene knockdown by Western blotting or prepared for functional studies. Mouse MFN2 cDNA was from Invitrogen. Adenoviruses expressing GFP-LC3 and MFN2 were packaged using the Stratagene Adeasy system following the procedures provided. Two sets of MFN2-shRNA were designed to specifically target rat MFN2, with the sequences 5′-GGACCCAGTTACTACAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTCCTGGCTCAAGACTATAA-3′. The MFN2-shRNA was packaged into adenovirus using the BLOCK-iTTM adenoviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen). Protein was extracted from mouse hearts and separated by SDS-PAGE. The transferred PVDF membranes were probed with the primary antibodies (anti-LC3B, anti-RAB7, and anti-tubulin from Sigma; anti-FYCO1 from Novus; anti-p62 from MBL; and anti-phospho-eIF2α and anti-eIF2α from Cell Signaling) and then incubated with the secondary antibodies (IRDye-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG from LI-COR). Immunoblots were evaluated using the Odyssey imaging system. For co-immunoprecipitation, the whole heart lysate was pre-cleaned with protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated with anti-RAB7 (Sigma), anti-MFN2 (Abnova), or control IgG for 3 h; protein A/G was then added, and samples were shaken at 4 °C overnight. The precipitates were washed three times with PBS, and the proteins were denatured for Western blot. Cardiac mitochondria were isolated as described previously (31Amiott E.A. Lott P. Soto J. Kang P.B. McCaffery J.M. DiMauro S. Abel E.D. Flanigan K.M. Lawson V.H. Shaw J.M. Mitochondrial fusion and function in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A patient fibroblasts with mitofusin 2 mutations.Exp. Neurol. 2008; 211: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial respiratory function was evaluated by measuring oxygen consumption. Detailed procedures are in the supplemental material. The heart was rapidly excised, and the aorta was cannulated and perfused with Tyrode solution containing 2 mm CaCl2 at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg, equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, and maintained at 37 °C. After stabilization for 20 min, the heart was subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. For autophagic flux assay, hearts were perfused with Tyrode solution containing either a combination of 5 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma) and 30 mm NH4Cl (Sigma) or DMSO as solvent control. Ventricular myocardium was harvested, and total protein was extracted for Western blot. For measurement of ΔΨm, the heart was perfused with Tyrode solution containing 100 nm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (Invitrogen) and 10 nm blebbistatin (Sigma). Confocal images were taken from multiple randomly selected regions before and after I/R. Each image was taken ∼30 μm deep into the epimyocardium of the left ventricle. The same procedure was performed for detection of functional lysosomes by perfusing with Tyrode solution containing 50 nm LysoTrackerTM red (Invitrogen). To quantify the lysosome production, the percentage surface area covered by LysoTrackerTM red was measured using ImageJ software. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. The unpaired t test with repeated measures was applied, when appropriate, to determine the statistical significance of differences. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The cardiac MFN2 knock-out mouse model (CKO) was generated to specifically study the cardiac function of MFN2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, although MFN2 depletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts by adenovirus-mediated Cre transfection (supplemental Fig. S2A) led to mitochondrial fragmentation as expected (supplemental Fig. S2B), knock-out of MFN2 in cardiomyocytes resulted in increased numbers of large mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S3A) and an average 61.5% increase in individual mitochondrial area, from 0.65 μm2 in control heart to 1.05 μm2 in MFN2 CKO heart from micrographs of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) sections (supplemental Fig. S3B). However, no significant change of total mitochondrial mass was found in the MFN2 CKO mouse heart, as indicated by unaltered mitochondrial volume density and mtDNA copy number (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). Moreover, the CKO heart showed no difference in the deletion containing NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4), a common feature of diseased and aging hearts (32Tanhauser S.M. Laipis P.J. Multiple deletions are detectable in mitochondrial DNA of aging mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Wallace D.C. Mitochondrial diseases in man and mouse.Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar), compared with control heart (supplemental Fig. S3D). Indeed, the relative frequency of mitochondrial area distribution shifted to the right, showing an increased proportion of large mitochondria in the population (supplemental Fig. S3E). These results are thus in general agreement with a recently published study in which enlarged mitochondria were described in the heart of a different MFN2 cardiac knock-out mouse model (26Papanicolaou K.N. Khairallah R.J. Ngoh G.A. Chikando A. Luptak I. O'Shea K.M. Riley D.D. Lugus J.J. Colucci W.S. Lederer W.J. Stanley W.C. Walsh K. Mitofusin-2 maintains mitochondrial structure and contributes to stress-induced permeability transition in cardiac myocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1309-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These data from MFN2 knock-out hearts indicate that MFN2 plays roles other than mediating mitochondrial fusion in the heart. Surprisingly, the TEM data revealed a large number of double and multimembrane autophagosome-like vacuolar structures in the MFN2 CKO heart (Fig. 1A). To confirm that MFN2 depletion is associated with abnormal autophagic activity, the conversion of the soluble form of LC3 (LC3-I) to the lipidated and autophagosome-associated form (LC3-II), the hallmark of autophagic processing at the molecular level, was measured (34Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). A 1.97-fold increase of LC3-II protein level was found in the MFN2 CKO heart over that from wild-type littermate heart (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of MFN2 CKO heart sections with LC3 antibody showed accumulated LC3-positive staining (Fig. 1C), and immunofluorescent staining of single cardiomyocytes isolated from the CKO heart also showed elevated LC3-positive puncta (Fig. 1D), consistent with the notion that LC3-II protein accumulates in autophagosomal membranes, whereas LC3-I is localized in the cytosol in a soluble form (34Kabeya Y.

Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the depletion of MFN2 in heart leads to the increased accumulation of autophagosomes. Autophagy is a highly regulated process, which includes the formation of autophagosomes with sequestration of cytosolic proteins or organelles, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to generate autophagolysosomes, and the degradation of the cargo in autophagolysosomes by lysosomal proteases (36Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy. Molecular machinery for self-eating.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). The question raised here is whether the accumulation of autophagosomes in response to MFN2 depletion is mainly due to the increased formation of autophagosomes or a consequence of an impaired autophagic degradation process. To address this question, we first assessed the expression levels of p62 protein, a specific autophagic substrate protein representing autophagic flux (37Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H.

https://openalex.org/W2049338438,"Mainstream theory suggests that the approximate number system supports our non-symbolic number abilities (e.g. estimating or comparing different sets of items). It is argued that this system can extract number independently of the visual cues present in the stimulus (diameter, aggregate surface, etc.). However, in a recent report we argue that this might not be the case. We showed that participants combined information from different visual cues to derive their answers. While numerosity comparison requires a rough comparison of two sets of items (smaller versus larger), numerosity estimation requires a more precise mechanism. It could therefore be that numerosity estimation, in contrast to numerosity comparison, might rely on the approximate number system. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a numerosity estimation experiment. We controlled for the visual cues according to current standards: each single visual property was not informative about numerosity. Nevertheless, the results reveal that participants were influenced by the visual properties of the dot arrays. They gave a larger estimate when the dot arrays consisted of dots with, on average, a smaller diameter, aggregate surface or density but a larger convex hull. The reliance on visual cues to estimate numerosity suggests that the existence of an approximate number system that can extract numerosity independently of the visual cues is unlikely. Instead, we propose that humans estimate numerosity by weighing the different visual cues present in the stimuli."

Its absence leads to viral attenuation in the context of whole organisms, and it prevents apoptosis in infected cells. Herein, we have examined the structure of SH protein in detergent micelles and in lipid bilayers, by solution NMR and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. We found that SH protein has a single α-helical transmembrane domain and forms homopentamers in several detergents. In detergent micelles, the transmembrane domain is flanked N-terminally by an α-helix that forms a ring around the lumen of the pore and C-terminally by an extended β-turn. SH protein was found in the plasma membrane of transiently expressing HEK 293 cells, which showed pH-dependent (acid-activated) channel activity. Channel activity was abolished in mutants lacking both native His residues, His22 and His51, but not when either His was present. Herein, we propose that the pentameric model of SH protein presented is a physiologically relevant conformation, albeit probably not the only one, in which SH contributes to RSV infection and replication. Viroporins are short (∼100 amino acids) viral membrane proteins that form oligomers of a defined size, act as proton or ion channels, and in general enhance membrane permeability in the host.

In vivo, viruses lacking viroporins usually exhibit an attenuated or weakened phenotype, altered tropism, and diminished pathological effects. We have chosen to study the SH protein, 64 amino acids long, found in the human respiratory syncytial virus because of the effect of RSV on human health and the lack of adequate antivirals. We show that SH protein forms oligomers that behave as ion channels when activated at low pH. This study adds SH protein to a growing group of viroporins that have been structurally characterized.

Interestingly, TZDs are also known to bind specifically to mitochondrial membrane proteins and may modulate mitochondrial metabolism through this direct binding (23Colca J.R. McDonald W.G.

Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E252-E260Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that TZDs with potent anti-diabetic pharmacology that do not activate PPARγ at physiologic concentrations (PPARγ-sparing TZDs (PsTZDs)) can be identified (24Colca J.R. Kletzien R.F. What has prevented the expansion of insulin sensitisers?.Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2006; 15: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and used to treat insulin resistance, diabetes, and other metabolic and inflammatory conditions with reduced risk of PPARγ-driven side effects. Herein, we demonstrate that a PsTZD (MSDC-0602), which is in Phase 2 clinical trials, markedly improved measures of systemic insulin sensitivity and metabolism and reduced adipose tissue inflammation. We also provide evidence that at least some of the beneficial pharmacology of the TZDs on hepatocytes is direct and independent of PPARγ. These studies suggest that PsTZDs could prove efficacious for treatment of obesity-related derangements in insulin sensitivity and metabolism and provide the framework for further evaluation of PPAR-sparing mechanisms to treat aspects of metabolic disease. MSDC-0602 was synthesized initially at Kalexsyn (Kalamazoo, MI) as part of a series of TZDs designed to have reduced ability to bind to PPARγ. Production scale synthesis of all TZDs for mouse studies was conducted by USV Ltd. (Mumbai, India), and TZDs were incorporated into the experimental diets by Research Diets Inc. Male mice were used in all studies. Liver-specific (LS)-PPARγ−/− mice were generated by intercrossing mice harboring floxed PPARγ alleles (9He W. Barak Y. Hevener A. Olson P. Liao D. Le J. Nelson M.

Magnuson M.A. DNA excision in liver by an albumin-Cre transgene occurs progressively with age.Genesis. 2000; 26: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and extensively back-crossed into the C57BL/6 background. LS-PPARγ−/− mice were compared with littermate PPARγflox/flox mice not expressing Cre. Ob/ob and ob/+ control mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. To cause diet-induced obesity (DIO), C57BL/6 wild-type or LS-PPARγ−/− mice were fed a diet providing 60% of its calories as fatty acids (Research Diets Inc. (catalog #D12492i)) starting at 6 weeks of age. DIO mice were compared with age-matched C57BL/6J male mice maintained on a matched low fat diet (10% fat; #D12450Bi). For in vivo drug treatment, 6-week-old ob/ob mice were placed on a diet (Purina #5015) containing rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, or MSDC-0602 (300 ppm) for 4 weeks before sacrifice. This dose was chosen based on pilot studies showing that 300 ppm in diet resulted in a concentration of 2–5 μm MSDC-0602 in the blood of obese mice. DIO mice and that had been maintained on the high fat (60% fat) diet for 8 weeks were randomized to receive 60% fat diet containing MSDC-0602 (300 ppm) for the last 2 or 4 weeks of the trial or to receive 60% fat diet not containing MSDC-0602 for the duration. The dosage selected for these studies provides ∼30 mg/kg/day of MSDC-0602. Mice were sacrificed for tissue collection after a 4-h fast. To examine insulin-stimulated protein phosphorylation, a subset of mice was injected intraperitoneal with human insulin (10 milliunits/g of body weight) 5 min before sacrifice, and tissue was dissected and snap-frozen for protein isolation. Glucose and insulin tolerance test studies were performed as described (27Finck B.N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Han D.H. Coleman T. Sambandam N. LaRiviere L.L. Holloszy J.O. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P.

Tail blood glucose was determined at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after challenge using a One-Touch Ultra glucometer (LifeScan, Inc.). Total area under the curve was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine. The right jugular vein and carotid artery of DIO mice that were untreated or treated for 3 weeks with MSDC-0602 were surgically catheterized and mice recovered for 1 week. After a 5–6-h fast, hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were performed on conscious mice using the protocol adopted from the Vanderbilt Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (28Ayala J.E. Bracy D.P. Malabanan C. James F.D. Ansari T. Fueger P.T. McGuinness O.P. Wasserman D.H. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in conscious, unrestrained mice.J. Vis. Exp. 2011; 57: e3188PubMed Google Scholar) by the University of Michigan Animal Phenotyping Core consisting of a 90-min equilibration period followed by a 120-min experimental period (t = 0–120 min). Insulin was infused at 2.5 milliunits/kg/min. To estimate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in individual tissues, a bolus injection of 2-[1-14C]deoxyglucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (10 μCi) was given at t = 78 min while continuously maintaining the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic steady state. At the end of the experiment, animals were anesthetized with an intravenous infusion of sodium pentobarbital, and tissues were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of tissue 14C radioactivity. Plasma insulin was measured using the Linco rat/mouse insulin ELISA kits. For determination of plasma radioactivity of [3-3H]glucose and 2-[1-14C]deoxyglucose, plasma samples were deproteinized and counted using a liquid scintillation counter. For analysis of tissue 2-[1-14C]deoxyglucose 6-phosphate, tissues were homogenized in 0.5% perchloric acid, and the supernatants were neutralized with KOH. Aliquots of the neutralized supernatant with and without deproteinization were counted for determination of the content of 2-[1-14C]deoxyglucose P. Primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes were prepared as described (29Chen Z. Gropler M.C. Norris J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Harris T.E. Finck B.N.

To measure the rate of glucose output, after a pretreatment period of 18 h with MSDC-0602 or vehicle, the hepatocytes were washed extensively with PBS and then incubated for 3 h in 1 mm Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer containing 10 mm lactate and 0.5 μm glucagon with or without insulin (0.5 μm) and MSDC-0602. Glucose contents in the media were determined enzymatically (Sigma). Hepatocytes from WT or LS-PPARγ−/− mice were isolated, plated, and then treated with vehicle (DMSO), rosiglitazone (1 μm), or MSDC-0602 (1 μm). Protein and RNA was collected 18 h after treatment. Rates of glucose production were determined in hepatocytes after 24 h of drug treatment. 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes were purchased from Zen-Bio. Preadipocytes were grown to confluence in complete medium containing 10% calf serum. Two days after reaching confluence, adipocyte differentiation was initiated by adding complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a hormone differentiation mixture (115 μg/ml methylisobutylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 390 ng/ml dexamethasone). In addition to the differentiation mixture, cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), rosiglitazone (0.1 μm), pioglitazone (0.1 μm), or MSDC-0602 (0.1 μm). RNA was collected after 48 h of drug treatment. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined using a colorimetric assay (Sigma) using plasma collected at time of sacrifice. Plasma insulin and adiponectin concentrations were determined by commercially available ELISAs from Crystal Chemical Co. and Linco Research Inc., respectively. Hepatic triglyceride content was determined using a colorimetric assay as previously described (29Chen Z. Gropler M.C. Norris J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Harris T.E. Finck B.N.

Western blotting studies were performed using antibodies directed against AKT (Cell Signaling), phospho-Ser-473 or phospho-Thr-308 AKT (Cell Signaling), fatty acid synthase (Abcam Inc.), glucose-6-phosphatase α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Cayman Chemical), and actin (Sigma). Densitometries of the bands were conducted using ImageJ software (NIH). Total RNA was isolated using the RNAzol method (Tel-Test). Real-time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the SYBR Green kit. The sequence of the oligonucleotides used in quantitative real-time-PCR analyses can be provided upon request. TZD binding to the ligand binding domain of PPARγ was assessed in a LanthaScreenTM TR-FRET competitive binding assay performed according the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). IC50 values for the PPARγ LanthaScreen were determined using Gen5 software (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). R2 values for individual IC50 values ranged from 0.983 to 0.999 based on three separate assays for each compound.

Kelly), (ii) heterologous firefly luciferase reporter construct driven by five copies of a Gal4 response element, and (iii) SV40-driven renilla luciferase reporter construct. Transfected cells were treated with PPARγ agonists (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PPARα agonist (GW7647; Cayman Chemical), or MSDC-0602 for 24 h. Cell lysate firefly and renilla luciferase activity was assessed 48 h later by using the Dual-Glo kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was corrected for renilla luciferase activity, and DMSO (vehicle) values were normalized to 1.0. The 125I-labeled probe (MSDC-1101; see chemical structure Fig. 1E) was synthesized by coupling a carboxylic acid analog of pioglitazone to a p-azido-benzyl group containing ethylamine. The purified compound was iodinated carrier-free with Iodogen (Pierce). [125I]MSDC-1101 was purified on a C18 column and stored in the dark. Cross-linking reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in a total volume of 40 μl (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 20 μl of mitochondrial membranes (1 μg/μl), 10 μl of 4% DMSO with or without competing TZDs (n = 3/concentration), and 10 μl (0.1 μCi) of carrier free 125I-labeled MSDC-1101. The reaction was stopped by UV exposure (180,000 μJ), cross-linked proteins were run on SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gels were dried and exposed to imaging film. Densitometries of the specifically labeled bands were conducted using ImageJ software (NIH). Hepatic mitochondria from the caudate lobe of the liver were isolated from CO2-euthanized mice by sucrose gradient centrifugation (34Boehm E.A. Jones B.E. Radda G.K. Veech R.L. Clarke K. Increased uncoupling proteins and decreased efficiency in palmitate-perfused hyperthyroid rat heart.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H977-H983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiration assays were performed at 37 °C using a water-jacketed Clark electrode (Hansatech Instruments). After measurement of basal (state 2) respiration, 1 mm ADP was added to isolated mitochondria in respiration buffer, and maximal (state 3) respiration was defined. Thereafter, state 4 (ADP-depleted) respiration was mimicked by adding 1 μg/ml oligomycin to inhibit ATP synthase. Uncoupled respiration was measured using 5 μm carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; Sigma). Statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance or a t test. All data are presented as the means ± S.E., with a statistically significant difference defined as a p value <0.05. MSDC-0602 is a modified TZD with alterations in the carbon backbone (Fig. 1A) that limit the ability to bind PPARγ (Fig. 1B). The IC50 for PPARγ binding was 0.08 μm for rosiglitazone, 1.147 μm for pioglitazone, and 18.25 μm for MSDC-0602. Using a Gal4-PPARγ construct containing the ligand binding domain of mouse PPARγ, we confirmed that MSDC-0602 only minimally activated Gal4-PPARγ in HepG2 cells even at a concentration of 50 μm, whereas rosiglitazone and pioglitazone activated the Gal4-PPARγ construct at much lower concentrations (Fig. 1C). MSDC-0602 also did not activate Gal4-PPARα (Fig. 1C) or PPARδ 5Z. Chen, P. A. Vigueira, K. T. Chambers, A. M. Hall, M. S. Mitra, N. Qi, W. G. McDonald, J. R. Colca, R. F. Kletzien, and B. N.

Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (0.1 μm) induced the expression of the known PPARγ target genes Fabp4, Cidec, Cd36, and Plin4 in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1D). In contrast, MSDC-0602 (0.1 μm) did not lead to a significant induction in the expression of these genes. Finally, TZDs are also known to bind competitively to mitochondrial membranes (23Colca J.R. McDonald W.G. Waldon D.J. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Bannow C.A. Lund E.T. Mathews W.R. Identification of a novel mitochondrial protein (“mitoNEET”) cross-linked specifically by a thiazolidinedione photoprobe.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E252-E260Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and MSDC-0602 bound to mitochondrial membranes with an equivalent affinity (Fig. 1E). These data demonstrate that, although these TZDs differ greatly in their ability to bind and activate PPARγ, they each have similar affinity for mitochondrial binding, which we hypothesize mediates at least some of the anti-diabetic pharmacology of TZDs. We compared the efficacy of MSDC-0602 with pioglitazone and rosiglitazone in ob/ob mice. Treatment with any of the three TZDs corrected plasma glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin concentrations, which were elevated in ob/ob mice compared with lean controls (Table 1). Treatment with MSDC-0602, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone also significantly improved glucose and insulin tolerance in ob/ob mice (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-473 and Thr-308 of Akt in gastrocnemius muscle was significantly improved by TZD treatment (Fig. 2B). Thiazolidinediones are known to increase insulin sensitivity by acting in adipose tissue to increase expression of beneficial adipokines and to reduce inflammation and macrophage infiltration.

In social drinkers, these two processes have been usually studied separately by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during rapid picture presentation. The aim of our study was to confront social drinkers to a task triggering high alcohol cue-reactivity, to verify whether it specifically altered inhibitory performance, by using long-lasting background picture presentation. Methods ERP were recorded during visual Go/No-Go tasks performed by social drinkers, in which a frequent Go signal (letter “M”), and a rare No-Go signal (letter “W”) were superimposed on three different types of background pictures: neutral (black background), alcohol-related and non alcohol-related. Results Our data suggested that heavy social drinkers made more commission errors than light drinkers, but only in the alcohol-related context. Neurophysiologically, this was reflected by a delayed No-Go P3 component. Conclusions Elevated alcohol cue-reactivity may lead to poorer inhibitory performance in heavy social drinkers, and may be considered as an important vulnerability factor in developing alcohol misuse. Prevention programs should be designed to decrease the high arousal of alcohol stimuli and strengthen cognitive control in young, at-risk individuals."

https://openalex.org/W1970079778,"Ulva prolifera, a typical green-tide-forming alga, can accumulate a large biomass in a relatively short time period, suggesting that photosynthesis in this organism, particularly its carbon fixation pathway, must be very efficient. Green algae are known to generally perform C3 photosynthesis, but recent metabolic labeling and genome sequencing data suggest that they may also perform C4 photosynthesis, so C4 photosynthesis might be more wide-spread than previously anticipated. Both C3 and C4 photosynthesis genes were found in U. prolifera by transcriptome sequencing. We also discovered the key enzymes of C4 metabolism based on functional analysis, such as pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK). To investigate whether the alga operates a C4-like pathway, the expression of rbcL and PPDK and their enzyme activities were measured under various forms and intensities of stress (differing levels of salinity, light intensity, and temperature). The expression of rbcL and PPDK and their enzyme activities were higher under adverse circumstances. However, under conditions of desiccation, the expression of rbcL and ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) activity was lower, whereas that of PPDK was higher. These results suggest that elevated PPDK activity may alter carbon metabolism and lead to a partial operation of C4-type carbon metabolism in U. prolifera, probably contributing to its wide distribution and massive, repeated blooms in the Yellow Sea."

Here, we observed that expression of a novel splice variant of σ(1)R, termed short form σ(1)R (σ(1)SR), has a detrimental effect on mitochondrial energy production and cell survival. σ(1)SR mRNA lacks 47 ribonucleotides encoding exon 2, resulting in a frameshift and formation of a truncated receptor. σ(1)SR localizes primarily in the ER at perinuclear regions and forms a complex with σ(1)R but not with IP(3)R in the mitochondrion-associated ER membrane. Overexpression of both σ(1)R and the truncated isoform promotes mitochondrial elongation with increased ER mitochondrial contact surface. σ(1)R overexpression increases the efficiency of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in response to IP(3)R-driven stimuli, whereas σ(1)SR overexpression reduces it. Most importantly, σ(1)R promotes ATP production via increased mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, promoting cell survival in the presence of ER stress. By contrast, σ(1)SR suppresses ATP production following ER stress, enhancing cell death. Taken together, the newly identified σ(1)SR isoform interferes with σ(1)R function relevant to mitochondrial energy production under ER stress conditions, promoting cellular apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1994719008,"The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that serves as the primary system for removing bile salts from the liver. In humans, deficiency of BSEP, which is encoded by the ABCB11 gene, causes severe progressive cholestatic liver disease from early infancy. In previous studies of Abcb11 deficiency in mice generated on a mixed genetic background, the animals did not recapitulate the human disease. We reasoned that ABCB11 deficiency may cause unique changes in hepatic metabolism that are predictive of liver injury. To test this possibility, we first determined that Abcb11 knock-out (KO) C57BL/6J mice recapitulate human deficiency. Before the onset of cholestasis, Abcb11 KO mice have altered hepatic lipid metabolism coupled with reduced expression of genes important in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This was associated with increased serum free-fatty acids, reduced total white adipose, and marked impairment of long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation. Importantly, metabolomic analysis confirmed that Abcb11 KO mice have impaired mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation with the elevated fatty acid metabolites phenylpropionylglycine and phenylacetylglycine. These metabolic changes precede cholestasis but may be of relevance to cholestatic disease progression because altered fatty acid metabolism can enhance reactive oxygen species that might exacerbate cholestatic liver damage."

MR imaging showed the obvious contrast change of brain glioma before and after administration of Tf-SPIONs in C6 glioma rat model in vivo on T2 weighted imaging. Significant contrast enhancement of brain glioma could still be clearly seen even 48 h post injection, due to the retention of Tf-SPIONs in cytoplasm of tumor cells which was proved by Prussian blue staining. Thus, these results suggest that Tf-SPIONs could be a potential targeting MR contrast agent for the brain glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2011779831,"Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss in association with Lewy body inclusions. Gathering evidence indicates that α-synuclein (α-syn), a major component of the Lewy body, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Although α-syn is considered to be a cytoplasmic protein, it has been detected in extracellular biological fluids, including human cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma of healthy and diseased individuals. In addition, a prion-like spread of α-syn aggregates has been recently proposed to contribute to the propagation of Lewy bodies throughout the nervous system during progression of PD, suggesting that the metabolism of extracellular α-syn might play a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. In the present study, we found that plasmin cleaved and degraded extracellular α-syn specifically in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Aggregated forms of α-syn as well as monomeric α-syn were also cleaved by plasmin. Plasmin cleaved mainly the N-terminal region of α-syn and also inhibited the translocation of extracellular α-syn into the neighboring cells in addition to the activation of microglia and astrocytes by extracellular α-syn. Further, extracellular α-syn regulated the plasmin system through up-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression. These findings help to understand the molecular mechanism of PD and develop new therapeutic targets for PD."
https://openalex.org/W2094664906,"Insect oviposition on plants frequently precedes herbivory. Accumulating evidence indicates that plants recognize insect oviposition and elicit direct or indirect defenses to reduce the pressure of future herbivory. Most of the oviposition-triggered plant defenses described thus far remove eggs or keep them away from the host plant or their desirable feeding sites. Here, we report induction of antiherbivore defense by insect oviposition which targets newly hatched larvae, not the eggs, in the system of tomato Solanum lycopersicum L., and tomato fruitworm moth Helicoverpa zea Boddie. When tomato plants were oviposited by H. zea moths, pin2, a highly inducible gene encoding protease inhibitor2, which is a representative defense protein against herbivorous arthropods, was expressed at significantly higher level at the oviposition site than surrounding tissues, and expression decreased with distance away from the site of oviposition. Moreover, more eggs resulted in higher pin2 expression in leaves, and both fertilized and unfertilized eggs induced pin2 expression. Notably, when quantified daily following deposition of eggs, pin2 expression at the oviposition site was highest just before the emergence of larvae. Furthermore, H. zea oviposition primed the wound-induced increase of pin2 transcription and a burst of jasmonic acid (JA); tomato plants previously exposed to H. zea oviposition showed significantly stronger induction of pin2 and higher production of JA upon subsequent simulated herbivory than without oviposition. Our results suggest that tomato plants recognize H. zea oviposition as a signal of impending future herbivory and induce defenses to prepare for this herbivory by newly hatched neonate larvae."
https://openalex.org/W1999695626,"In vertebrate rod cells, retinoid dehydrogenases/reductases (RDHs) are critical for reducing the reactive aldehyde all-trans-retinal that is released by photoactivated rhodopsin, to all-trans-retinol (vitamin A). Previous studies have shown that RDH8 localizes to photoreceptor outer segments and is a strong candidate for performing this role. However, RDH12 function in the photoreceptor inner segments is also key, because loss of function mutations cause retinal degeneration in some forms of Leber congenital amaurosis. To investigate the in vivo roles of RDH8 and RDH12, we used fluorescence imaging to examine all-trans-retinol production in single isolated rod cells from wild-type mice and knock-out mice lacking either one or both RDHs. Outer segments of rods deficient in Rdh8 failed to reduce all-trans-retinal, but those deficient in Rdh12 were unaffected. Following exposure to light, a leak of retinoids from outer to inner segments was detected in rods from both wild-type and knock-out mice. In cells lacking Rdh8 or Rdh12, this leak was mainly all-trans-retinal. Wild-type rods incubated with all-trans-retinal reduced moderate loads of retinal within the cell interior, but this ability was lost by cells deficient in Rdh8 or Rdh12. Our findings are consistent with localization of RDH8 to the outer segment where it provides most of the activity needed to reduce all-trans-retinal generated by the light response.

https://openalex.org/W2060626291,"Venous leg ulcers can be very hard to heal and represent a significant medical need with no effective therapeutic treatment currently available.In wound edge biopsies from human venous leg ulcers we found a striking upregulation of dermal N-cadherin, Zonula Occludens-1 and the gap junction protein Connexin43 (Cx43) compared to intact skin, and in stark contrast to the down-regulation of Cx43 expression seen in acute, healing wounds. We targeted the expression of these proteins in 3T3 fibroblasts to evaluate their role in venous leg ulcers healing. Knockdown of Cx43 and N-cadherin, but not Zonula Occludens-1, accelerated cell migration in a scratch wound-healing assay. Reducing Cx43 increased Golgi reorientation, whilst decreasing cell adhesion and proliferation. Furthermore, Connexin43 and N-cadherin knockdown led to profound effects on fibroblast cytoskeletal dynamics after scratch-wounding. The cells exhibited longer lamelipodial protrusions lacking the F-actin belt seen at the leading edge in wounded control cells. This phenotype was accompanied by augmented activation of Rac-1 and RhoA GTPases, as revealed by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer and pull down experiments.Cx43 and N-cadherin are potential therapeutic targets in the promotion of healing of venous leg ulcers, by acting at least in part through distinct contributions of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and cytoskeletal dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2068352579,"The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host factor that mediates inhibition of viruses in the Filoviridae, Retroviridae and Togaviridae families. We previously demonstrated that ZAP blocks replication of Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototype Alphavirus in the Togaviridae family at an early step prior to translation of the incoming genome and that synergy between ZAP and one or more interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) resulted in maximal inhibitory activity. The present study aimed to identify those ISGs that synergize with ZAP to mediate Alphavirus inhibition. Using a library of lentiviruses individually expressing more than 350 ISGs, we screened for inhibitory activity in interferon defective cells with or without ZAP overexpression. Confirmatory tests of the 23 ISGs demonstrating the largest infection reduction in combination with ZAP revealed that 16 were synergistic. Confirmatory tests of all potentially synergistic ISGs revealed 15 additional ISGs with a statistically significant synergistic effect in combination with ZAP. These 31 ISGs are candidates for further mechanistic studies. The number and diversity of the identified ZAP-synergistic ISGs lead us to speculate that ZAP may play an important role in priming the cell for optimal ISG function."
https://openalex.org/W2100449472,"ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes alter the structure of chromatin at specific loci and facilitate tissue-specific gene regulation during development. Several SWI/SNF subunits are required for cardiogenesis. However, the function and mechanisms of SWI/SNF in mediating cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) differentiation during cardiogenesis are not well understood. Our studies of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex identified that BAF250a, a regulatory subunit of the SWI/SNF, plays a key role in CPC differentiation. BAF250a ablation in mouse second heart field (SHF) led to trabeculation defects in the right ventricle, ventricular septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, reduced myocardial proliferation, and embryonic lethality around E13. Using an embryonic stem cell culture system that models the formation and differentiation of SHF CPCs in vivo, we have shown that BAF250a ablation in CPCs specifically inhibits cardiomyocyte formation. Moreover, BAF250a selectively regulates the expression of key cardiac factors Mef2c, Nkx2.5, and Bmp10 in SHF CPCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase I digestion assays indicate that BAF250a regulates gene expression by binding selectively to its target gene promoters and recruiting Brg1, the catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF, to modulate chromatin accessibility. Our results thus identify BAF250a-mediated chromatin remodeling as an essential epigenetic mechanism mediating CPC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2013979901,"The platelet-derived growth factor receptor β is a member of the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase family and dimerizes upon activation. We determined the structure of the transmembrane segment in dodecylphosphocholine micelles by liquid-state NMR and found that it forms a stable left-handed helical dimer. Solid-state NMR and oriented circular dichroism were used to measure the tilt angle of the helical segments in macroscopically aligned model membranes with different acyl chain lengths. Both methods showed that decreasing bilayer thickness (DEPC-POPC-DMPC) led to an increase in the helix tilt angle from 10° to 30° with respect to the bilayer normal. At the same time, reconstitution of the comparatively long hydrophobic segment became less effective, eventually resulting in complete protein aggregation in the short-chain lipid DLPC. Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations of the dimer were carried out in explicit lipid bilayers (DEPC, POPC, DMPC, sphingomyelin), confirming the observed dependence of the helix tilt angle on bilayer thickness. Notably, molecular dynamics revealed that the left-handed dimer gets tilted en bloc, whereas conformational transitions to alternative (e.g. right-handed dimeric) states were not supported. The experimental data along with the simulation results demonstrate a pronounced interplay between the platelet-directed growth factor receptor β transmembrane segment and the bilayer thickness. The effect of hydrophobic mismatch might play a key role in the redistribution and activation of the receptor within different lipid microdomains of the plasma membrane in vivo."

Trained cyclists (N = 14) completed two 75-km cycling time trials (randomized, crossover) while ingesting BAN or CHO (0.2 g/kg carbohydrate every 15 min). Pre-, post-, and 1-h-post-exercise blood samples were analyzed for glucose, granulocyte (GR) and monocyte (MO) phagocytosis (PHAG) and oxidative burst activity, nine cytokines, F2-isoprostanes, ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and metabolic profiles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Blood glucose levels and performance did not differ between BAN and CHO (2.41±0.22, 2.36±0.19 h, P = 0.258). F2-isoprostanes, FRAP, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, GR-PHAG, and MO-PHAG increased with exercise, with no trial differences except for higher levels during BAN for IL-10, IL-8, and FRAP (interaction effects, P = 0.003, 0.004, and 0.012). Of 103 metabolites detected, 56 had exercise time effects, and only one (dopamine) had a pattern of change that differed between BAN and CHO. Plots from the PLS-DA model visualized a distinct separation in global metabolic scores between time points [R2Y(cum) = 0.869, Q2(cum) = 0.766]. Of the top 15 metabolites, five were related to liver glutathione production, eight to carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, and two were tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. BAN and CHO ingestion during 75-km cycling resulted in similar performance, blood glucose, inflammation, oxidative stress, and innate immune levels. Aside from higher dopamine in BAN, shifts in metabolites following BAN and CHO 75-km cycling time trials indicated a similar pattern of heightened production of glutathione and utilization of fuel substrates in several pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2115938686,"Odd-nosed monkeys represent one of the two major groups of Asian colobines. Our knowledge about this primate group is still limited as it is highlighted by the recent discovery of a new species in Northern Myanmar. Although a common origin of the group is now widely accepted, the phylogenetic relationships among its genera and species, and the biogeographic processes leading to their current distribution are largely unknown. To address these issues, we have analyzed complete mitochondrial genomes and 12 nuclear loci, including one X chromosomal, six Y chromosomal and five autosomal loci, from all ten odd-nosed monkey species. The gene tree topologies and divergence age estimates derived from different markers were highly similar, but differed in placing various species or haplogroups within the genera Rhinopithecus and Pygathrix. Based on our data, Rhinopithecus represent the most basal lineage, and Nasalis and Simias form closely related sister taxa, suggesting a Northern origin of odd-nosed monkeys and a later invasion into Indochina and Sundaland. According to our divergence age estimates, the lineages leading to the genera Rhinopithecus, Pygathrix and Nasalis+Simias originated in the late Miocene, while differentiation events within these genera and also the split between Nasalis and Simias occurred in the Pleistocene. Observed gene tree discordances between mitochondrial and nuclear datasets, and paraphylies in the mitochondrial dataset for some species of the genera Rhinopithecus and Pygathrix suggest secondary gene flow after the taxa initially diverged. Most likely such events were triggered by dramatic changes in geology and climate within the region. Overall, our study provides the most comprehensive view on odd-nosed monkey evolution and emphasizes that data from differentially inherited markers are crucial to better understand evolutionary relationships and to trace secondary gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W1968509601,"The treatment for advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often includes platinum-based chemotherapy and IR. Cisplatin and IR combination therapy display schedule and dose-dependent synergy, the mechanism of which is not completely understood. In a series of in vitro and cell culture assays in a NSCLC model, we investigated both the downstream and direct treatment and damage effects of cisplatin on NHEJ catalyzed repair of a DNA DSB. The results demonstrate that extracts prepared from cisplatin-treated cells are fully capable of NHEJ catalyzed repair of a DSB using a non-cisplatin-damaged DNA substrate in vitro. Similarly, using two different host cell reactivation assays, treatment of cells prior to transfection of a linear, undamaged reporter plasmid revealed no reduction in NHEJ compared with untreated cells. In contrast, transfection of a linear GFP-reporter plasmid containing site-specific, cisplatin lesions 6-bp from the termini revealed a significant impairment in DSB repair of the cisplatin-damaged DNA substrates in the absence of cellular treatment with cisplatin. Together, these data demonstrate that impaired NHEJ in combined cisplatin-IR treated cells is likely the result of a direct effect of cisplatin-DNA lesions near a DSB and that the indirect cellular effects of cisplatin treatment are not significant contributors to the synergistic cytotoxicity observed with combination cisplatin-IR treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1992771732,"Mst1/Stk4, a hippo-like serine-threonine kinase, is implicated in many cancers, including prostate cancer. However, the mechanisms regulating Mst1 remain obscure. Here, we characterized the effects of phospho-Thr-120 on Mst1 in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated that phospho-Thr-120 did not alter the nuclear localization or cleavage of Mst1 in a LNCaP or castration-resistant C4-2 prostate tumor cell model, as revealed by a mutagenesis approach. Phospho-Thr-120 appeared to be specific to cancer cells and predominantly localized in the nucleus. In contrast, phospho-Thr-183, a critical regulator of Mst1 cell death, was exclusively found in the cytoplasm. As assessed by immunohistochemistry, a similar distribution of phospho-Mst1-Thr-120/Thr-183 was also observed in a prostate cancer specimen. In addition, the blockade of PI3K signaling by a small molecule inhibitor, LY294002, increased cytoplasmic phospho-Mst1-Thr-183 without having a significant effect on nuclear phospho-Mst1-Thr-120. However, the attenuation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity by a selective pharmacologic inhibitor, Ku0063794 or CCI-779, caused the up-regulation of nuclear phospho-Mst1-Thr-120 without affecting cytoplasmic phospho-Mst1-Thr-183. This suggests that PI3K and mTOR pathway signaling differentially regulate phospho-Mst1-Thr-120/Thr-183. Moreover, mutagenesis and RNAi data revealed that phospho-Thr-120 resulted in C4-2 cell resistance to mTOR inhibition and reduced the Mst1 suppression of cell growth and androgen receptor-driven gene expression. Collectively, these findings indicate that phospho-Thr-120 leads to the loss of Mst1 functions, supporting cancer cell growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2022040474,"Cellular responses to DNA damage require the formation of protein complexes in a highly organized fashion. The complete molecular components that participate in the sequential signaling response to DNA damage remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) in resting cells plays an important role in the formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci that assemble on the 53BP1 scaffold protein during the DNA damage response. The kinase VRK1 is activated by DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and specifically phosphorylates 53BP1 in serum-starved cells. VRK1 knockdown resulted in the defective formation of 53BP1 foci in response to IR both in number and size. This observed effect on 53BP1 foci is p53- and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-independent and can be rescued with VRK1 mutants resistant to siRNA. VRK1 knockdown also prevented the activating phosphorylation of ATM, CHK2, and DNA-dependent protein kinase in response to IR. VRK1 activation in response to DNA damage is a novel and early step in the signaling of mammalian DNA damage responses."
https://openalex.org/W1973620094,"Thymineless death strikes cells unable to synthesize DNA precursor dTTP, with the nature of chromosomal damage still unclear. Thymine starvation stalls replication forks, whereas accumulating evidence indicates the replication origin is also affected. Using a novel DNA labeling technique, here we show that replication slowly continues in thymine-starved cells, but the newly synthesized DNA becomes fragmented and degraded. This degradation apparently releases enough thymine to sustain initiation of new replication bubbles from the chromosomal origin, which destabilizes the origin in a RecA-dependent manner. Marker frequency analysis with gene arrays 1) reveals destruction of the origin-centered chromosomal segment in RecA(+) cells; 2) confirms origin accumulation in the recA mutants; and 3) identifies the sites around the origin where destruction initiates in the recBCD mutants. We propose that thymineless cells convert persistent single-strand gaps behind replication forks into double-strand breaks, using the released thymine for new initiations, whereas subsequent disintegration of small replication bubbles causes replication origin destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2021452548,"The objective of this project was to study the function of O-glycosylations in von Willebrand factor (VWF) life cycle. In total, 14 different murine Vwf cDNAs mutated on one or several O-glycosylations sites were generated: 9 individual mutants, 2 doublets, 2 clusters and 1 mutant with all 9 murine glycosylation sites mutated (Del-O-Gly). We expressed each mutated cDNA in VWF deficient-mice by hydrodynamic injection. An immunosorbent assay with Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) was used to verify the O-glycosylation status. Wild-type (WT) VWF expressed by hepatocytes after hydrodynamic injection was able to bind PNA with slightly higher affinity than endothelial-derived VWF. In contrast, the Del-O-Gly VWF mutant did not bind PNA, demonstrating removal of O-linked glycans. All mutants displayed a normal multimeric pattern. Two mutants, Del-O-Gly and T1255A/T1256A, led to expression levels 50% lower than those induced by WT VWF and their half-life in vivo was significantly reduced. When testing the capacity of each mutant to correct the bleeding time of VWF-deficient mice, we found that S1486A, T1255A, T1256A and the doublet T1255A/T1256A were unable to do so. In conclusion we have shown that O-glycosylations are dispensable for normal VWF multimerization and biosynthesis. It also appears that some O-glycosylation sites, particularly the T1255 and T1256 residues, are involved in the maintenance of VWF plasma levels and are essential for normal haemostasis. As for the S1486 residue, it seems to be important for platelet binding as demonstrated in vitro using perfusion experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2059797575,"Pretubulysin is a natural product that is found in strains of myxobacteria in only minute amounts. It represents the first enzyme-free intermediate in the biosynthesis of tubulysins and undergoes post-assembly acylation and oxidation reactions. Pretubulysin inhibits the growth of cultured mammalian cells, as do tubulysins, which are already in advanced preclinical development as anticancer and antiangiogenic agents. The mechanism of action of this highly potent compound class involves the depolymerization of microtubules, thereby inducing mitotic arrest. Supply issues with naturally occurring derivatives can now be circumvented by the total synthesis of pretubulysin, which, in contrast to tubulysin, is synthetically accessible in gram-scale quantities. We show that the simplified precursor is nearly equally potent to the parent compound. Pretubulysin induces apoptosis and inhibits cancer cell migration and tubulin assembly in vitro. Consequently, pretubulysin appears to be an ideal candidate for future development in preclinical trials and is a very promising early lead structure in cancer therapy."

The present study evaluated the potential of sifuvirtide formulated in a universal gel for topical use as a microbicide candidate for preventing sexual transmission of HIV. Our data showed that sifuvirtide formulated in HEC gel is effective against HIV-1 B, C subtypes, CRF07_BC and CRF01_AE, the latter two recombinants represents the most prevalent strains in China. In addition, we demonstrated that sifuvirtide in gel is stable for at least 8 weeks even at 40°C, and did not cause the disruption of integrity of mucosal epithelial surface, or the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines both in vitro or in vivo. These results suggest that sifuvirtide gel is an effective, safe and stable product, and should be further tested as a vaginal or rectal microbicide in pre-clinical model or clinical trial for preventing HIV sexual transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2030327405,"It is well established that chromatin is a destination for signal transduction, affecting many DNA-templated processes. Histone proteins in particular are extensively post-translationally modified. We are interested in how the complex repertoire of histone modifications is coordinately regulated to generate meaningful combinations of ""marks"" at physiologically relevant genomic locations. One important mechanism is ""cross-talk"" between pre-existing histone post-translational modifications and enzymes that subsequently add or remove modifications on chromatin. Here, we use chemically defined ""designer"" nucleosomes to investigate novel enzymatic cross-talk relationships between the most abundant histone ubiquitylation sites, H2AK119ub and H2BK120ub, and two important histone methyltransferases, Dot1L and PRC2. Although the presence of H2Bub in nucleosomes greatly stimulated Dot1L methylation of H3K79, we found that H2Aub did not influence Dot1L activity. In contrast, we show that H2Aub inhibited PRC2 methylation of H3K27, but H2Bub did not influence PRC2 activity. Taken together, these results highlight how the position of nucleosome monoubiquitylation affects the specificity and direction of cross-talk with enzymatic activities on chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2089139986,"Terminally misfolded glycoproteins are ejected from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol and are destroyed by the ubiquitin proteasome system. A dominant negative version of the deubiquitylating enzyme Yod1 (Yod1C160S) causes accumulation of dislocation substrates in the ER. Failure to remove ubiquitin from the dislocation substrate might therefore stall the reaction at the exit site from the ER. We hypothesized that addition of a promiscuous deubiquitylase should overcome this blockade and restore dislocation. We monitored ER-to-cytosol transport of misfolded proteins in cells permeabilized at high cell density by perfringolysin O, a pore-forming cytolysin. This method allows ready access of otherwise impermeant reagents to the intracellular milieu with minimal dilution of cytoplasmic components. We show that addition of the purified Epstein-Barr virus deubiquitylase to semi-intact cells indeed initiates dislocation of a stalled substrate intermediate, resulting in stabilization of substrates in the cytosol. Our data provide new mechanistic insight in the dislocation reaction and support a model where failure to deubiquitylate an ER-resident protein occludes the dislocon and causes upstream misfolded intermediates to accumulate."
https://openalex.org/W2069977105,"The N-end rule pathway is a proteolytic system in which its recognition components (N-recognins) recognize destabilizing N-terminal residues of short-lived proteins as an essential element of specific degrons, called N-degrons. The RING E3 ligases UBR2 and UBR1 are major N-recognins that share size (200 kDa), conserved domains and substrate specificities to N-degrons. Despite the known function of the N-end rule pathway in degradation of cytosolic proteins, the major phenotype of UBR2-deficient male mice is infertility caused by arrest of spermatocytes at meiotic prophase I. UBR2-deficient spermatocytes are impaired in transcriptional silencing of sex chromosome-linked genes and ubiquitylation of histone H2A. In this study we show that the recruitment of UBR2 to meiotic chromosomes spatiotemporally correlates to the induction of chromatin-associated ubiquitylation, which is significantly impaired in UBR2-deficient spermatocytes. UBR2 functions as a scaffold E3 that promotes HR6B/UbcH2-dependent ubiquitylation of H2A and H2B but not H3 and H4, through a mechanism distinct from typical polyubiquitylation. The E3 activity of UBR2 in histone ubiquitylation is allosterically activated by dipeptides bearing destabilizing N-terminal residues. Insufficient monoubiquitylation and polyubiquitylation on UBR2-deficient meiotic chromosomes correlate to defects in double strand break (DSB) repair and other meiotic processes, resulting in pachytene arrest at stage IV and apoptosis. Some of these functions of UBR2 are observed in somatic cells, in which UBR2 is a chromatin-binding protein involved in chromatin-associated ubiquitylation upon DNA damage. UBR2-deficient somatic cells show an array of chromosomal abnormalities, including hyperproliferation, chromosome instability, and hypersensitivity to DNA damage-inducing reagents. UBR2-deficient mice enriched in C57 background die upon birth with defects in lung expansion and neural development. Thus, UBR2, known as the recognition component of a major cellular proteolytic system, is associated with chromatin and controls chromatin dynamics and gene expression in both germ cells and somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975724273,"Tetrahydrouridine (THU) is a well characterized and potent inhibitor of cytidine deaminase (CDA). Highly expressed CDA catalyzes and inactivates cytidine analogues, ultimately contributing to increased gemcitabine resistance. Therefore, a combination therapy of THU and gemcitabine is considered to be a potential and promising treatment for tumors with highly expressed CDA. In this study, we found that THU has an alternative mechanism for inhibiting cell growth which is independent of CDA expression. Three different carcinoma cell lines (MIAPaCa-2, H441, and H1299) exhibited decreased cell proliferation after sole administration of THU, while being unaffected by knocking down CDA. To investigate the mechanism of THU-induced cell growth inhibition, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry was performed. This analysis revealed that THU caused an increased rate of G1-phase occurrence while S-phase occurrence was diminished. Similarly, Ki-67 staining further supported that THU reduces cell proliferation. We also found that THU regulates cell cycle progression at the G1/S checkpoint by suppressing E2F1. As a result, a combination regimen of THU and gemcitabine might be a more effective therapy than previously believed for pancreatic carcinoma since THU works as a CDA inhibitor, as well as an inhibitor of cell growth in some types of pancreatic carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003500869,"The capsule of Streptococcus pyogenes serves as an adhesin as well as an anti-phagocytic factor by binding to CD44 on keratinocytes of the pharyngeal mucosa and the skin, the main entry sites of the pathogen. We discovered that S. pyogenes HSC5 and MGAS315 strains are further thermoregulated for capsule production at a post-transcriptional level in addition to the transcriptional regulation by the CovRS two-component regulatory system. When the transcription of the hasABC capsular biosynthetic locus was de-repressed through mutation of the covRS system, the two strains, which have been used for pathogenesis studies in the laboratory, exhibited markedly increased capsule production at sub-body temperature. Employing transposon mutagenesis, we found that CvfA, a previously identified membrane-associated endoribonuclease, is required for the thermoregulation of capsule synthesis. The mutation of the cvfA gene conferred increased capsule production regardless of temperature. However, the amount of the capsule transcript was not changed by the mutation, indicating that a post-transcriptional regulator mediates between CvfA and thermoregulated capsule production. When we tested naturally occurring invasive mucoid strains, a high percentage (11/53, 21%) of the strains exhibited thermoregulated capsule production. As expected, the mucoid phenotype of these strains at sub-body temperature was due to mutations within the chromosomal covRS genes. Capsule thermoregulation that exhibits high capsule production at lower temperatures that occur on the skin or mucosal surface potentially confers better capability of adhesion and invasion when S. pyogenes penetrates the epithelial surface."
https://openalex.org/W2133975521,"In many viruses, a precursor particle, or procapsid, is assembled and undergoes massive chemical and physical modification to produce the infectious capsid. Capsid assembly and maturation are finely tuned processes in which viral and host factors participate. We show that the precursor of the VP2 capsid protein (pVP2) of the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a double-stranded RNA virus, is processed at the C-terminal domain (CTD) by a host protease, the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PurSA). The pVP2 CTD (71 residues) has an important role in determining the various conformations of VP2 (441 residues) that build the T = 13 complex capsid. pVP2 CTD activity is controlled by co- and posttranslational proteolytic modifications of different targets by the VP4 viral protease and by VP2 itself to yield the mature VP2-441 species. Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase is responsible for the peptidase activity that cleaves the Arg-452-Arg-453 bond to generate the intermediate pVP2-452 polypeptide. A pVP2 R453A substitution abrogates PurSA activity. We used a baculovirus-based system to express the IBDV polyprotein in insect cells and found inefficient formation of virus-like particles similar to IBDV virions, which correlates with the absence of puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase in these cells. Virus-like particle assembly was nonetheless rescued efficiently by coexpression of chicken PurSA or pVP2-452 protein. Silencing or pharmacological inhibition of puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase activity in cell lines permissive for IBDV replication caused a major blockade in assembly and/or maturation of infectious IBDV particles, as virus yields were reduced markedly. PurSA activity is thus essential for IBDV replication."

https://openalex.org/W2005041143,"Current familial searching strategies are developed primarily based on autosomal STR loci, since most of the offender profiles in the forensic DNA databases do not contain Y-STR or mitochondrial DNA data. There are generally two familial searching methods, Identity-by-State (IBS) based methods or kinship index (KI) based methods. The KI based method is an analytically superior method because the allele frequency information is considered as opposed to solely allele counting. However, multiple KIs should be calculated if the unknown forensic profile may be attributed to multiple possible relevant populations. An important practical issue is the KI threshold to select for limiting the list of candidates from a search. There are generally three strategies of setting the KI threshold for familial searching: (1) SWGDAM recommendation 6; (2) minimum KI≥KI threshold; and (3) maximum KI≥KI threshold. These strategies were evaluated and compared by using both simulation data and empirical data. The minimum KI will tend to be closer to the KI appropriate for the population of which the forensic profile belongs. The minimum KI≥KI threshold performs better than the maximum KI≥KI threshold. The SWGDAM strategy may be too stringent for familial searching with large databases (e.g., 1 million or more profiles), because its KI thresholds depend on the database size and the KI thresholds of large databases have a higher probability to exclude true relatives than smaller databases. Minimum KI≥KI threshold strategy is a better option, as it provides the flexibility to adjust the KI threshold according to a pre-determined number of candidates or false positive/negative rates. Joint use of both IBS and KI does not significantly reduce the chance of including true relatives in a candidate list, but does provide a higher efficiency of familial searching."

https://openalex.org/W2081448378,"The human locomotor system is flexible and enables humans to move without falling even under less than optimal conditions. Walking with high-heeled shoes constitutes an unstable condition and here we ask how the nervous system controls the ankle joint in this situation? We investigated the movement behavior of high-heeled and barefooted walking in eleven female subjects. The movement variability was quantified by calculation of approximate entropy (ApEn) in the ankle joint angle and the standard deviation (SD) of the stride time intervals. Electromyography (EMG) of the soleus (SO) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles and the soleus Hoffmann (H-) reflex were measured at 4.0 km/h on a motor driven treadmill to reveal the underlying motor strategies in each walking condition. The ApEn of the ankle joint angle was significantly higher (p<0.01) during high-heeled (0.38±0.08) than during barefooted walking (0.28±0.07). During high-heeled walking, coactivation between the SO and TA muscles increased towards heel strike and the H-reflex was significantly increased in terminal swing by 40% (p<0.01). These observations show that high-heeled walking is characterized by a more complex and less predictable pattern than barefooted walking. Increased coactivation about the ankle joint together with increased excitability of the SO H-reflex in terminal swing phase indicates that the motor strategy was changed during high-heeled walking. Although, the participants were young, healthy and accustomed to high-heeled walking the results demonstrate that that walking on high-heels needs to be controlled differently from barefooted walking. We suggest that the higher variability reflects an adjusted neural strategy of the nervous system to control the ankle joint during high-heeled walking."

Theoretically, inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption is the most efficient way to increase oxygen levels. The cationic, rhodacyanine dye-analog MKT-077 inhibits mitochondrial respiration and could be an effective metabolic inhibitor. However, the relationship between cellular MKT-077 uptake and metabolic inhibition is unknown. We hypothesized that rat and human mammary carcinoma cells would take up MKT-077, causing a decrease in oxygen metabolism related to drug uptake.R3230Ac rat breast adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to MKT-077. Cellular MKT-077 concentration was quantified using spectroscopy, and oxygen consumption was measured using polarographic electrodes. MKT-077 uptake kinetics were modeled by accounting for uptake due to both the concentration and potential gradients across the plasma and mitochondrial membranes. These kinetic parameters were used to model the relationship between MKT-077 uptake and metabolic inhibition. MKT-077-induced changes in oxygen consumption were also characterized in MDA-MB231 human breast carcinoma cells.Cells took up MKT-077 with a time constant of ∼1 hr, and modeling showed that over 90% of intracellular MKT-077 was bound or sequestered, likely by the mitochondria. The uptake resulted in a rapid decrease in oxygen consumption, with a time constant of ∼30 minutes. Surprisingly the change in oxygen consumption was proportional to uptake rate, not cellular concentration. MKT-077 proved a potent metabolic inhibitor, with dose-dependent decreases of 45-73% (p = 0.003).MKT-077 caused an uptake rate-dependent decrease in cellular metabolism, suggesting potential efficacy for increasing tumor oxygen levels and radiosensitivity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2018267517,"Despite advances in oncology drug development, most commonly used cancer therapeutics exhibit serious adverse effects. Often the toxicities of chemotherapeutics are due to the induction of significant DNA damage that is necessary for their ability to kill cancer cells. In some clinical situations, the direct induction of significant cytotoxicity is not a requirement to meet clinical goals. For example, differentiation, growth arrest, and/or senescence is a valuable outcome in some cases. In fact, in the case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the use of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has revolutionized the therapy for a subset of leukemia patients and led to a dramatic survival improvement. Remarkably, this therapeutic approach is possible even in many elderly patients, who would not be able to tolerate therapy with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Because of the success of ATRA, there is widespread interest in identifying differentiation strategies that may be effective for the 90-95% of AML patients who do not clinically respond to ATRA. Utilizing an AML differentiation agent that is in development, we found that AML differentiation can be induced through ATP depletion and the subsequent activation of DNA damage signaling through an ATR/Chk1-dependent and p53-independent pathway. This study not only reveals mechanisms of AML differentiation but also suggests that further investigation is warranted to investigate the potential clinical use of low dose chemotherapeutics to induce differentiation instead of cytotoxicity. This therapeutic approach may be of particular benefit to patients, such as elderly AML patients, who often cannot tolerate traditional AML chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2094115688,"Background Multiple lines of evidence suggest that infections in early life prevent the development of pathological immune responses to allergens and autoantigens (the hygiene hypothesis). Early infections may also affect later immune responses to pathogen antigen. Methods To evaluate an association between early infections and immune responses to pathogen antigen, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to Candida albicans was evaluated among 283 2- to 7-year-old children in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. A questionnaire and physical examination were used to characterize variables reflecting early exposure to infectious agents (family size, house construction materials, BCG vaccination, hospitalization history). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between early exposure to infectious agents and DTH to C. albicans. Results Triceps skinfold thickness (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.22) and age (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.55) were positively associated with DTH to C. albicans. Adjusted for age and sex, large family size (OR: 2.81; 95% CI: 1.04, 7.61), BCG vaccination scar (OR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.10, 8.71), and hospitalization during infancy with an infectious disease (OR: 4.67; 95% CI: 1.00, 21.74) were positively associated with DTH to C. albicans. Conclusions Early life infections were positively associated with later DTH to C. albicans. This result supports an expansion of the hygiene hypothesis to explain not only pathological immune responses to allergens, but also appropriate immune responses to pathogens. Immune system development may be responsive to early infections as an adaptive means to tailor reactivity to the local infectious disease ecology."

We hypothesized that human orthologs of these S. cerevisiae proteins would also be required for cellular survival after treatment with DNA damaging agents. For this purpose, human homologs of S. cerevisiae proteins were identified and mapped onto the human protein-protein interaction network. The resulting human network was highly modular and a series of selection rules were implemented to identify 45 candidates for human toxicity-modulating proteins. The corresponding transcripts were targeted by RNA interference in human cells. The cell lines with depleted target expression were challenged with three DNA damaging agents: the alkylating agents MMS and 4-NQO, and the oxidizing agent t-BuOOH. A comparison of the survival revealed that the majority (74%) of proteins conferred either sensitivity or resistance. The identified human toxicity-modulating proteins represent a variety of biological functions: autophagy, chromatin modifications, RNA and protein metabolism, and telomere maintenance. Further studies revealed that MMS-induced autophagy increase the survival of cells treated with DNA damaging agents. In summary, we show that damage recovery proteins in humans can be identified through homology to S. cerevisiae and that many of the same pathways are represented among the toxicity modulators."

Methods We investigated HIV-1 transmission in 46 HIV-1 concordant positive couples from Dakar, Senegal. Intracouple transmission was confirmed by maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis and pairwise distance comparisons of HIV-1 env gp41 sequences from both partners. Standardized interview data were used to deduce the direction as well as the external sources of the intracouple transmissions. Results Conservative molecular analyses showed linked viruses in 34 (74%) couples, unlinked viruses in 6 (13%) couples, and indeterminate results for 6 (13%) couples. The interview data corresponded completely with the molecular analyses: all linked couples reported internal transmission and all unlinked couples reported external sources of infection. The majority of linked couples (93%) reported the husband as internal source of infection. These husbands most frequently (82%) reported an occasional sexual relationship as external source of infection. Pairwise comparisons of the CD4 count, antiretroviral therapy status, and the proportion of gp41 ambiguous base pairs within transmission pairs correlated with the reported order of infection events. Conclusions In this suburban Senegalese population, a majority of HIV-1 concordant couples showed linked HIV-1 transmission with the husband as likely index partner. Our data emphasize the risk of married women for acquiring HIV-1 as a result of the occasional sexual relationships of their husbands."

https://openalex.org/W2063581250,"Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was generated after a recombination event between two endogenous murine leukemia viruses during the production of a prostate cancer cell line. Although the associations of the XMRV infection with human diseases appear unlikely, the XMRV is a retrovirus of undefined pathogenic potential, able to replicate in human cells in vitro. Since recent studies using animal models for infection have yielded conflicting results, we set out an ex vivo model for XMRV infection of human tonsillar tissue to determine whether XMRV produced by 22Rv1 cells is able to replicate in human lymphoid organs. Tonsil blocks were infected and infection kinetics and its pathogenic effects were monitoredXMRV, though restricted by APOBEC, enters and integrates into the tissue cells. The infection did not result in changes of T or B-cells, immune activation, nor inflammatory chemokines. Infectious viruses could be recovered from supernatants of infected tonsils by reinfecting DERSE XMRV indicator cell line, although these supernatants could not establish a new infection in fresh tonsil culture, indicating that in our model, the viral replication is controlled by innate antiviral restriction factors.Overall, the replication-competent retrovirus XMRV, present in a high number of laboratories, is able to infect human lymphoid tissue and produce infectious viruses, even though they were unable to establish a new infection in fresh tonsillar tissue. Hereby, laboratories working with cell lines producing XMRV should have knowledge and understanding of the potential biological biohazardous risks of this virus."
