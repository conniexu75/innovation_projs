https://openalex.org/W1977173058,The antigen of a monoclonal antibody that is specific for cells of human carcinoma of the colon is a monosialoganglioside as determined by the direct binding of antibody to thin-layer chromatograms of total lipid extracts of tissues. Binding of antibody to chromatograms is detected by autoradiography after the application of iodine-125-labeled F(ab')2 of rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies to mouse immunoglobulins.
https://openalex.org/W2085205514,"Vitellogenin is synthesized under estrogen control in the liver, extensively modified, transported to the ovary, and there processed to the yolk proteins lipovitellin and phosvitin. In the frog Xenopus laevis there are at least four distinct but related vitellogenin genes. The two genes A1 and A2 have a 95 percent sequence homology in their messenger RNA coding regions, and contain 33 introns that interrupt the coding region (exons) at homologous positions. Sequences and lengths of analogous introns differ, and many introns contain repetitive DNA elements. The introns in these two genes that have apparently arisen by duplication have diverged extensively by events that include deletions, insertions, and probably duplications. Rapid evolutionary change involving rearrangements and the presence of repeated DNA suggests that the bulk of the sequences within introns may not have any specific function."
https://openalex.org/W2104417677,"A series of rat liver cotransformed cell lines have been constructed containing from 5 to 100 copies of a variant human growth hormone gene. We have used hybridization in situ to demonstrate that most, if not all, cotransformed sequences reside in a chromosome of the host cell. In each of four cell lines examined, hybridization was restricted to a single chromosomal site with no extrachromosomal sites apparent. The site was invariant within each line; however, each line revealed a different site of integration for transforming sequences. In two of the four lines, transforming DNA resided at or near the site of gross chromosomal rearrangements, in one line near an rDNA site, and in one line in the middle of an apparently normal chromosome. Thus, insertion is not restricted to a unique chromosome or chromosomal region."

https://openalex.org/W1988232308,"Gender identity depends largely on postnatal environmental influences, while sex-dimorphic behavior and temperamental sex differences appear to be modified by prenatal sex hormones. A role of the prenatal endocrine milieu in the development of erotic partner preference, as in hetero-, homo-, or bisexual orientation, or of cognitive sex differences has not been conclusively demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2030483827,"An electric fish in the African family Mormyridae recognizes members of its own species by ""listening"" to electric organ discharges, which are species-specific signatures. Reactions of fish in the field and of individual electroreceptors to both normal and modified computer-synthesized discharges emphasize the importance of the waveform (time-domain cues) in species recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2089717240,"Sexually receptive female Spermophilus beldingi (Rodentia: Sciuridae) usually mate with several different males. The paternity of 27 litters born in 1977 and 1978 was ascertained by combining field observations of mating with laboratory paternity exclusion analyses. Most of the litters (78 percent) were multiply sired, usually by two or three males. This may be the highest frequency of multiple paternity ever directly demonstrated in a natural population."
https://openalex.org/W2007126968,Nonadherent tissue culture cell lines were established from normal bone marrow of a variety of mouse strains. The lines possessed morphological and histochemical markers of the basophil/mast cell and contained committed stem cells for metachromatic cells. Their derivation from normal marrow and their lack of tumorigenicity despite long-term culture makes these cell lines potentially important for studies of the mechanisms of allergic reactions and inflammation as well as the differentiation pathways involving this subset of hematopoietic cells.
https://openalex.org/W1996187835,"A new autosomal recessive mutation that causes hypothyroidism has been identified in mice. The gene, herein named hypothyroid (hyt), has been mapped on chromosome 12 approximately 30 units from the centromere. The mutants are characterized by retarded growth, infertility, mild anemia, elevated serum cholesterol, very low to undetectable serum thyroxine, and elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyroid glands are in the normal location but are reduced in size and hypoplastic. Mutant mice respond to thyroid hormone therapy by improved growth and fertility. These findings suggest that the hyt mutant gene results in primary hypothyroidism unresponsive to thyroid-stimulating hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2064917316,"Evoked potential and unit responses from the lamprey brain to weak electric fields demonstrate that lampreys have an electrosensory system as sensitive as those of other electroreceptive fishes. Electrosensory responses were recorded in the dorsal medulla, the midbrain torus semicircularis, and the optic tectum. Similarities in the structure of the anterior lateral line nerves and medullary organization between lampreys and several primitive jawed fishes indicate that the electroreceptive systems are homologous in these taxa. Thus electroreception was probably present in the earliest vertebrates ancestral to both agnathans and gnathostomes."
https://openalex.org/W2012844147,"Toxins in shellfish, which are responsible for paralytic poisonings, undergo reductive transformation when incubated with the homogenate of various portions of the scallop, Placopecten magellanicus. The transformation includes the reductive elimination of O-sulfate groups, a change that is most evident in the locomotor tissue homogenates. The commercially important adductor muscles can also inactivate the toxins."

https://openalex.org/W1991522711,"Four new synthetic analogs of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) can antagonize the antidiuretic response to intravenous vasopressin in anesthetized, water-loaded rats. They also cause a diuresis resembling that of diabetes insipidus when given intraperitoneally to conscious rats. Such antagonists may prove to be useful both pharmacologically and therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2075623550,"Gonadal steroid hormones, active during fetal life, continue after the birth of a fetus to influence the central nervous system and affect behavior. The characteristically different circulating concentrations of male and female steroid hormones in men and women appear to be partial determinants of certain sexually dimorphic behaviors, interacting in a complex way with psychological and sociocultural factors as well as with other biological factors. This interaction is highlighted in research on testosterone and aggression in men, mood and the menstrual cycle in women, and pubertal sex role reversal in pseudohermaphrodites."

https://openalex.org/W2024388247,Event-related potentials following silently named object pictures were recorded directly from the exposed left hemisphere of the human cortex at sites whose relation to naming was subsequently established by electrical stimulation mapping. Two simultaneous potential changes are specific to sites where stimulation disrupts naming: slow potentials as premotor sites and focal desynchronization at posterior sites surrounding the Sylvian fissure. These anatomically specific changes are also specific to the task--present with silent naming and absent in a spatial task with the same visual input. Overt speech is also preceded by slow potentials with earliest onset at premotor sites.
https://openalex.org/W1977308941,"Adult Hereford (Bos taurus) cattle were protected from severe reactions and death caused by the tick-borne protozoan hemoparasite Babesia bovis, 3 months after vaccination with a cell culture--derived immunogen. The immunogen consisted of filtered, freeze-dried supernatant fluid collected from long-term cultures of Babesia bovis in vitro. It was reconstituted with saponin adjuvant and injected twice subcutaneously at 2-week intervals. Serum collected from vaccinated cattle caused thickening of the merozoite surface coat, aggregation, and lysis of merozoites in vitro. This reaction was identical to that caused by serum from immune carrier cattle suggesting that the protective antigen present in culture fluids is merozoite surface coat antigen. No mortality occurred among vaccinated cattle, whereas mortality among unvaccinated cattle and Babesia bigemina--immune cattle was 62.5 percent indicating that immunity to bovine babesiosis is species-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2088176169,"The auditory brainstem response varies in a circadian rhythm that is negatively correlated with the circadian rhythm in oral temperature. The auditory brainstem responses and oral temperature were recorded every 3 hours from three healthy male subjects during a 2-day period. The data indicate that a reduction of 1 degree C in oral temperature is associated with an increase of 200 microseconds in the latency of wave V of the auditory brainstem response, and of 160 microseconds in the interval between waves I and V."
https://openalex.org/W1966726951,"An investigation of the rate of birth malformations in the Northland region of New Zealand provides no evidence to associate spraying of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid with the occurrence of any malformation of the central nervous system, including spina bifida. A statistically significant association between spray and malformation is found in the case of talipes. Whether this association indicates a causal relation remains to be established."

https://openalex.org/W1991788752,"The affinity of the amino terminal tetrapeptide of the beta chain of fibrin, Gly-His-Arg-Pro, for fibrinogen dramatically increases in the presence of 2 millimolar calcium ion. In contrast, there is no significant increase in the affinity of peptides beginning with the amino terminal sequence of the fibrin alpha chain, Gly-Pro-Arg, in the presence of calcium ions, although the number of binding sites increases. In the latter case, the increased number of sites is due to the alpha chain analogs binding to the site ordinarily occupied by the beta chain analogs. These results indicate that structures at the amino terminus of the fibrin beta chain play a more important role in fibrin polymerization when calcium ions are present."

https://openalex.org/W2041771328,"Human malignant cancer tumors grafted into nude mice produce tumors containing both human cancer cells and the host's stromal cells. After short-term propagation of these tumors in vitro, the murine mesenchymal cells appear transformed and are tumorigenic in nude mice. However, established human cancer cell lines fail to similarly after adjacent murine stromal cells when used to produce tumors in nude mice. These experiments suggest that cancer cells may recruit normal cells to become malignant, qualifying the view of the clonal (unicellular) origin of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2001081421,"The low activity of liver neuraminidase that is characteristic of mouse strain SM/J is inherited as a single gene on chromosome 17, near the major histocompatibility complex. This gene, neuraminidase-1 (Neu-1), is represented by the low activity allele Neu-1s in SM/J and the high activity allele Neu-1b in C57BL/6J and most other strains. Previously described variations in the posttranslational processing of acid phosphatase, α-mannosidase, arylsulfatase-B, and α-glucosidase are attributed to pleiotropic effects of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W2003333537,The intracellular location of the enzymes that excise tRNA intervening sequences and subsequently religate the molecular was investigated in Xenopus oocytes. All the splicing activity detected in a whole oocyte was present in the nucleus. By manual separation of the nuclear envelope and the nuclear contents (which form a gel-like structure in the presence of Mg++) it was found that all the activity of both splicing enzymes was located in the nuclear contents and was not associated with the nuclear membrane.
https://openalex.org/W2051069572,"Administration of tyrosine, the amino acid precursor of catecholamines, increased blood pressure 38 to 49 percent in rats made acutely hypotensive by hemorrhage; other large neutral amino acids were ineffective. Tyrosine's effect was abolished by adrenalectomy, suggesting that, in hypotensive animals, it acts by accelerating the peripheral synthesis and release of catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W2031259610,"A region containing visually responsive cells was found in the dorsocaudal claustrum. This area contains a single orderly map of the contralateral visual field. Like cortical cells, most claustral cells are selective for stimulus orientation. They are binocular, and they respond to either direction of movement and to a broad range of velocities. Their most striking property is a marked preference for very long stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1984774013,"Predictable change in neuronal connectivity can be induced in the buccal ganglia of adult Helisoma snails when neuritic growth is evoked by axotomy. Both transient and stable novel electrical connections are established between identified neurons. The breaking of inappropriate, normally transient connections is contingent on the formation of an appropriate connection."
https://openalex.org/W2070278432,"The specific activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (glutamine-hydrolyzing), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of de novo uridine 5'-triphosphate biosynthesis, was increased in 13 transplantable hepatomas, particularly in the rapidly growing tumors (5.7- to 9.5-fold), and the rise was correlated with tumor growth rates. Thus, synthetase activity was linked with both hepatic neoplastic transformation and progression. Synthetase specific activity was so elevated in a transplantable sarcoma (18-fold) and a kidney adenocarcinoma (5-fold). The increased activity should enhance the capacity of the pathway and should confer selective advantages to cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055694516,"Isoguanosine (oxyadenosine or crotonoside), previously known to occur in nature only in the croton bean, was isolated from an animal, the marine nudibranch mollusk Diaulula sandiegensis."
https://openalex.org/W2133090762,"Lipid vesicles were formed by ultrasonication from N-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl,1-acyl-2-(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) aminocaproyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Tnp-NBD-PE), a fluorescent- and hapten-conjugated phospholipid analog. The vesicles, which were nonfluorescent due to self-quenching, were further characterized by gel filtration chromatography and electron microscopy. Treatment of EL-4 lymphoma cells with these vesicles at 2°C resulted in immediate dequenching of fluorescence due to dilution of the fluorescent lipid in cell membranes. Control experiments showed Tnp-NBD-PE association with cells was predominantly via a lipid transfer mechanism, with little adsorption of intact vesicles. Fluorescence microscopy of the treated cells revealed bright uniform peripheral ring staining with no apparent internal fluorescence as long as the cells were maintained at 2°C. Fluorescence photobleaching recovery measurements showed that the majority (∼80%) of the Tnp-NBD-PE was free to diffuse in the plasma membrane of the treated cells and had a diffusion coefficient of approximately 8.5 × 10−9 cm2/sec. These observations strongly suggest that the exogenously supplied supplied lipid was diluted in the plasma membrane of the EL-4 cells and is initially free to diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane consistent with its proper integration in the plasma membrane bilayer. Upon incubation of washed, vesicle-treated cells at 37°C, essentially all the Tnp-NBD-PE became rapidly internalized. However, warming the cells in the presence of bound Tnp antibodies prevented the internalization of the Tnp-NBD-PE and led to the formation of caps. Capping was inhibited by azide and cytochalasin B. These results are discussed in relation to various models for the redistribution of lymphocyte plasma membrane components."
https://openalex.org/W1968852365,Lead acetate (0.02 or 0.5 percent) was administered to dams throughout the lactation period with half of the litters continuing on lead after weaning. Drug thresholds for d-amphetamine were determined by using the drug-discrimination learning paradigm. All the offspring that had been exposed to lead were less sensitive to the stimulus properties of d-amphetamine irrespective of whether or not they had continued on lead after weaning.

https://openalex.org/W1995689745,"When the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into acid insoluble material was measured, ribavirin appeared to be a potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis in KB cells and human lymphocytes. Inhibition was nearly 100-fold less, however, when DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of phosphorus-32-labeled phosphate or by DNA fluorescence. The potent inhibition detected by incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA actually was the result of a potent effect on the labeling of deoxythymidine triphosphate, not on the synthesis of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2065256780,"The 3'-terminal sequence of the large ribosomal subunit (""17S"") RNA of hamster mitochondria has been examined by means of oligonucleotide fingerprint analysis of 3' end-labeled samples. Patterns from partial acid or alkaline hydrolysates indicated marked heterogeneity and suggested an array of termini that included GGUUAOH, AnAOH and AnGOH (where n is about 10). Patterns from samples subjected to exhaustive digestion with ribonucleases T1 plus A, or with each separately, confirmed these inferences, and strikingly demonstrated the existence of oligoadenylated families of 3'-terminal sequences. Under the assumption that the oligoadenylate was added posttranscriptionally, these results indicated that the 3'-terminal transcribed moieties consist of variants of YAGGUUOH. Counting from the last U, we inferred that many such sequences end at U1 and G4, while smaller numbers end at G3 and A5; and that major sites of oligoadenylation occur at U1 and G4, and a minor site occurs at A5. This novel combination of imprecise termination of transcription or ""sizing"" of transcripts, and variable addition of adenylate residues, is discussed with regard to the mechanism of expression of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes."

https://openalex.org/W2008197135,"In alcoholic liver injury, necrosis is involved in the progression from benign fatty liver to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. However, there is no practical model of alcohol-dependent liver cell necrosis. The calcium-dependent killing of cultured rat hepatocytes by two different membrane-active hepatotoxins, galactosamine and phalloidin, is potentiated by ethyl alcohol. This indicates that some general physical effect of alcohol on cellular membranes renders cells susceptible to otherwise nonlethal injuries. The in vitro model described in this report may thus be used to search for a general mechanism underlying alcohol-related tissue injury."

Those who had ingested a placebo or nothing were detected with statistically significant frequency on the basis of their phasic electrodermal responses, which clearly distinguished them from truthful suspects. That was not the case with deceptive subjects who had ingested 400 milligrams of meprobamate, nor did the examiner detect which subjects had received the drug."

https://openalex.org/W2015901298,"Indirect costs of federally supported research have increased steadily and dramatically since the current indirect cost policy became effective in 1966. The amount of research supported by any given level of federal funding has thus been markedly reduced, and this has become a critical factor limiting research support in the United States. The current policy has had multiple adverse effects that threaten the health of both the federal research program and the universities in which most of the research is conducted. This article examines the background and nature of the current policy, describes its consequences, and proposes simplifying modifications."

https://openalex.org/W2015172881,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, E.C. 1.1.1.27) isozymes from three single-cell sources reacted differently with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) purified to published chromatographic and spectrophotometric specifications and free of inhibitors of LDH, when compared with a commercial preparation of NADH. The activity of LDH-1, purified from rabbit erythrocytes, increased the most with inhibitor-free NADH; the next most stimulated were the LDH isozymes from a control hepatocyte line; but hardly responsive at all were the same isozymes from chemically transformed cells. Thus isozyme composition alone did not account for the range of responses to purified NADH. The commercial preparation of NADH used in these studies contains the Strandjörd-Clayson inhibitors, the most potent group identified in NADH preparations relative to LDH activity. The results suggest that specific molecular differences in individual isozymes contribute to the differential response to the Strandjörd-Clayson inhibitors."

Granulocytes invade and destroy ctenidial epithelium adjacent to the granuloma, causing it and the granuloma to slough away into the mantle cavity, where they are removed as pseudofeces."
