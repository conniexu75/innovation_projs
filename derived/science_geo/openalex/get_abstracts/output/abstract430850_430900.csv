Ozone, the hydroxyl radical and nitrate are thought to be the main agents that act to remove trace gases, including pollutants, from the atmosphere. In this paper, the authors combine atmospheric observations from a forested region of Finland, laboratory experiments and theoretical considerations to identify another, previously unknown compound with significant capacity to oxidize sulphur dioxide and perhaps other trace gases. The compound seems to be a stabilized Criegee intermediate — a carbonyl oxide with two free-radical sites — or its derivative and could potentially enhance the reactivity of the atmosphere, contributing to the production of sulphuric acid and, consequently, atmospheric-aerosol formation. The chemistry investigated here is tightly connected with the presence of biogenic volatile organic compounds, and thereby with forest emissions. Atmospheric oxidation is a key phenomenon that connects atmospheric chemistry with globally challenging environmental issues, such as climate change1, stratospheric ozone loss2, acidification of soils and water3, and health effects of air quality4. Ozone, the hydroxyl radical and the nitrate radical are generally considered to be the dominant oxidants that initiate the removal of trace gases, including pollutants, from the atmosphere. Here we present atmospheric observations from a boreal forest region in Finland, supported by laboratory experiments and theoretical considerations, that allow us to identify another compound, probably a stabilized Criegee intermediate (a carbonyl oxide with two free-radical sites) or its derivative, which has a significant capacity to oxidize sulphur dioxide and potentially other trace gases. This compound probably enhances the reactivity of the atmosphere, particularly with regard to the production of sulphuric acid, and consequently atmospheric aerosol formation. Our findings suggest that this new atmospherically relevant oxidation route is important relative to oxidation by the hydroxyl radical, at least at moderate concentrations of that radical. We also find that the oxidation chemistry of this compound seems to be tightly linked to the presence of alkenes of biogenic origin."

Free-space quantum communication provides a promising solution towards this challenging goal. Here, through a 97-km free space channel, we demonstrate long distance quantum teleportation over a 35-53 dB loss one-link channel, and entanglement distribution over a 66-85 dB high-loss two-link channel. We achieve an average fidelity of {80.4(9)}% for teleporting six distinct initial states and observe the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality after distributing entanglement. Besides being of fundamental interest, our result represents a significant step towards a global quantum network. Moreover, the high-frequency and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing and tracking technique developed in our experiment provides an essential tool for future satellite-based quantum communication."

However, the gene regulatory network that controls the expression of these metastasis genes remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a computational approach for the deconvolution of transcriptional networks to discover master regulators of breast cancer bone metastasis. Several known regulators of breast cancer bone metastasis such as Smad4 and HIF1 were identified in our analysis. Experimental validation of the networks revealed BACH1, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, as the common regulator of several functional metastasis genes, including MMP1 and CXCR4. Ectopic expression of BACH1 enhanced the malignance of breast cancer cells, and conversely, BACH1 knockdown significantly reduced bone metastasis. The expression of BACH1 and its target genes was linked to the higher risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients. This study established BACH1 as the master regulator of breast cancer bone metastasis and provided a paradigm to identify molecular determinants in complex pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2076247294,"Fucα1-6 oligosaccharide has a variety of biological functions and serves as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma because of the elevated presence of fucosylated α-fetoprotein (AFP) in this type of cancer. In this study we purified a novel Fucα1-6-specific lectin from the mushroom Pholiota squarrosa by ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on thyroglobulin-agarose. The purified lectin was designated as PhoSL (P. squarrosa lectin). SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicate that PhoSL has a molecular mass of 4.5 kDa and consists of 40 amino acids (NH(2)-APVPVTKLVCDGDTYKCTAYLDFGDGRWVAQWDTNVFHTG-OH). Isoelectric focusing of the lectin showed bands near pI 4.0. The lectin activity was stable between pH 2.0 and 11.0 and at temperatures ranging from 0 to 100 °C for incubation times of 30 min. When PhoSL was investigated with frontal affinity chromatography using 132 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, it was found that the lectin binds only to core α1-6-fucosylated N-glycans and not to other types of fucosylated oligosaccharides, such as α1-2-, α1-3-, and α1-4-fucosylated glycans. Furthermore, PhoSL bound to α1-6-fucosylated AFP but not to non-fucosylated AFP. In addition, PhoSL was able to demonstrate the differential expression of α1-6 fucosylation between primary and metastatic colon cancer tissues. Thus, PhoSL will be a promising tool for analyzing the biological functions of α1-6 fucosylation and evaluating Fucα1-6 oligosaccharides as cancer biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W1970804271,"The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is among several mollusc species that have been well investigated due to the simplicity of their nervous systems and large identifiable neurons. Nonetheless, despite the continued attention given to the physiological characteristics of its nervous system, the genetic information of the Lymnaea central nervous system (CNS) has not yet been fully explored. The absence of genetic information is a large disadvantage for transcriptome sequencing because it makes transcriptome assembly difficult. We here performed transcriptome sequencing for Lymnaea CNS using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform and obtained 81.9 M of 100 base pair (bp) single end reads. For de novo assembly, five programs were used: ABySS, Velvet, OASES, Trinity and Rnnotator. Based on a comparison of the assemblies, we chose the Rnnotator dataset for the following blast searches and gene ontology analyses. The present dataset, 116,355 contigs of Lymnaea transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA), contained longer sequences and was much larger compared to the previously reported Lymnaea expression sequence tag (EST) established by classical Sanger sequencing. The TSA sequences were subjected to blast analyses against several protein databases and Aplysia EST data. The results demonstrated that about 20,000 sequences had significant similarity to the reported sequences using a cutoff value of 1e-6, and showed the lack of molluscan sequences in the public databases. The richness of the present TSA data allowed us to identify a large number of new transcripts in Lymnaea and molluscan species."
https://openalex.org/W2112233217,"We previously reported the identification of a novel family of immunomodulatory proteins, termed helminth defense molecules (HDMs), that are secreted by medically important trematode parasites. Since HDMs share biochemical, structural, and functional characteristics with mammalian cathelicidin-like host defense peptides (HDPs), we proposed that HDMs modulate the immune response via molecular mimicry of host molecules. In the present study, we report the mechanism by which HDMs influence the function of macrophages. We show that the HDM secreted by Fasciola hepatica (FhHDM-1) binds to macrophage plasma membrane lipid rafts via selective interaction with phospholipids and/or cholesterol before being internalized by endocytosis. Following internalization, FhHDM-1 is rapidly processed by lysosomal cathepsin L to release a short C-terminal peptide (containing a conserved amphipathic helix that is a key to HDM function), which then prevents the acidification of the endolysosomal compartments by inhibiting vacuolar ATPase activity. The resulting endolysosomal alkalization impedes macrophage antigen processing and prevents the transport of peptides to the cell surface in conjunction with MHC class II for presentation to CD4+ T cells. Thus, we have elucidated a novel mechanism by which helminth pathogens alter innate immune cell function to assist their survival in the host.—Robinson, M. W., Alvarado, R., To, J., Hutchinson, A.

This study compares the predictive value of Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Organ System Failure (OSF) obtained on the first day of ECMO removal, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) stages obtained at 48 hours post-ECMO removal (AKIN(48-hour)) in terms of hospital mortality for critically ill patients.This study reviewed the medical records of 119 critically ill patients successfully weaned from ECMO at the specialized intensive care unit of a tertiary-care university hospital between July 2006 and October 2010. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected retrospectively as survival predictors.Overall mortality rate was 26%. The most common condition requiring ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score displayed good discriminative power (AUROC 0.805±0.055, p<0.001). Furthermore, multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that daily urine output on the second day of ECMO removal (UO(24-48 hour)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and SOFA score on the day of ECMO removal were independent predictors of hospital mortality. Finally, cumulative survival rates at 6-month follow-up differed significantly (p<0.001) for a SOFA score≤13 relative to those for a SOFA score>13.Following successful ECMO weaning, the SOFA score proved a reproducible evaluation tool with good prognostic abilities."

In the endoplasmic reticulum, the zymogen pro-PCSK9 is first autocatalytically cleaved at its internal Gln152↓, resulting in a secreted enzymatically inactive complex of PCSK9 with its inhibitory prosegment (prosegment·PCSK9), which is the active form of PCSK9 on the LDLR. We mutagenized the P1 cleavage site Gln152 into all other residues except Cys and analyzed the expression and secretion of the resulting mutants. The data demonstrated the following. 1) The only P1 residues recognized by PCSK9 are Gln > Met > Ala > Ser > Thr ≈ Asn, revealing an unsuspected specificity. 2) All other mutations led to the formation of an unprocessed zymogen that acted as a dominant negative retaining the native protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of a large panoply of known natural and artificial point mutants revealed that this general dominant negative observation applies to all PCSK9 mutations that result in the inability of the protein to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Such a tight quality control property of the endoplasmic reticulum may lead to the development of specific PCSK9 small molecule inhibitors that block its autocatalytic processing. Finally, inspired by the most active gain-of-function mutant, D374Y, we evaluated the LDLR degradation activity of 18 Asp374 variants of PCSK9. All Asp374 mutations resulted in similar gain-of-function activity on the LDLR except that D374E was as active as native PCSK9, D374G was relatively less active, and D374N and D374P were completely inactive.

https://openalex.org/W2132420269,"O-Glucosylation of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch is essential for Notch function. O-Glucose can be elongated by xylose to the trisaccharide, Xylα1-3Xylα1-3Glcβ1-O-Ser, whose synthesis is catalyzed by the consecutive action of three glycosyltransferases. A UDP-glucose:protein O-glucosyltransferase (Poglut/Rumi) transfers O-glucose to serine within the O-glucose consensus. Subsequently, either of two UDP-xylose:glucoside xylosyltransferases (Gxylt1 or Gxylt2) transfers xylose to O-glucose. Finally, a UDP-xylose:xyloside xylosyltransferase (Xxylt1) transfers xylose to Xylα1-3Glcβ1-O-EGF. Our prior site-mapping studies demonstrated that O-glucose consensus sites are modified at high but variable stoichiometries in mouse Notch1 and identified a novel glycosylation site with alanine in place of proline, suggesting a revised, broader consensus sequence (CXSX(P/A)C). Here we examined the molecular basis for this site specificity. A panel of EGF repeats from human coagulation factor 9 (FA9), mouse Notch1, and Notch2 were bacterially expressed and purified by reverse phase HPLC for use in in vitro enzyme assays. We demonstrate that proper folding of EGF repeats is essential for glycosylation by Poglut/Rumi, that alanine can substitute for proline in the context of coagulation factor 9 EGF repeat for O-glucose transfer, confirming the new consensus sequence, and that positively charged residues within the O-glucose consensus sequence reduce efficiency of glycosylation by Poglut/Rumi. Moreover, proper folding of EGF repeats is also important for the activities of Gxylt1, Gxylt2, and Xxylt1. These results indicate that protein folding and amino acid sequences of individual EGF repeats fundamentally affect both attachment and elongation of O-glucose glycans."
https://openalex.org/W2018740114,"Background Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is a model system for the analysis of polyploidization. Although ascertaining the donor species of allotetraploid cotton has been intensively studied, sequence comparison of Gossypium chloroplast genomes is still of interest to understand the mechanisms underlining the evolution of Gossypium allotetraploids, while it is generally accepted that the parents were A- and D-genome containing species. Here we performed a comparative analysis of 13 Gossypium chloroplast genomes, twelve of which are presented here for the first time. Methodology/Principal Findings The size of 12 chloroplast genomes under study varied from 159,959 bp to 160,433 bp. The chromosomes were highly similar having >98% sequence identity. They encoded the same set of 112 unique genes which occurred in a uniform order with only slightly different boundary junctions. Divergence due to indels as well as substitutions was examined separately for genome, coding and noncoding sequences. The genome divergence was estimated as 0.374% to 0.583% between allotetraploid species and A-genome, and 0.159% to 0.454% within allotetraploids. Forty protein-coding genes were completely identical at the protein level, and 20 intergenic sequences were completely conserved. The 9 allotetraploids shared 5 insertions and 9 deletions in whole genome, and 7-bp substitutions in protein-coding genes. The phylogenetic tree confirmed a close relationship between allotetraploids and the ancestor of A-genome, and the allotetraploids were divided into four separate groups. Progenitor allotetraploid cotton originated 0.43–0.68 million years ago (MYA). Conclusion Despite high degree of conservation between the Gossypium chloroplast genomes, sequence variations among species could still be detected. Gossypium chloroplast genomes preferred for 5-bp indels and 1–3-bp indels are mainly attributed to the SSR polymorphisms. This study supports that the common ancestor of diploid A-genome species in Gossypium is the maternal source of extant allotetraploid species and allotetraploids have a monophyletic origin. G. hirsutum AD1 lineages have experienced more sequence variations than other allotetraploids in intergenic regions. The available complete nucleotide sequences of 12 Gossypium chloroplast genomes should facilitate studies to uncover the molecular mechanisms of compartmental co-evolution and speciation of Gossypium allotetraploids."

However, separate studies have implicated distinct mechanisms for TNPO3 either through its interaction with HIV-1 integrase or capsid. Here we have carried out a detailed biophysical characterization of TNPO3 and investigated its interactions with viral proteins. Biophysical analyses including circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation, small-angle x-ray scattering, and homology modeling provide insight into TNPO3 architecture and indicate that it is highly structured and exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. In vitro biochemical binding assays argued against meaningful direct interaction between TNPO3 and the capsid cores. Instead, TNPO3 effectively bound to the functional intasome but not to naked viral DNA, suggesting that TNPO3 can directly engage the HIV-1 IN tetramer prebound to the cognate DNA. Mass spectrometry-based protein footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis studies have enabled us to map several interacting amino acids in the HIV-1 IN C-terminal domain and the cargo binding domain of TNPO3.

Unlike HIV-1, which can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells through the nuclear import of the PIC, the MLV PIC does not traverse through the nuclear pore and instead gains access to chromatin during mitosis. The same study (12Christ F. Thys W. De Rijck J. Gijsbers R. Albanese A. Arosio D. Emiliani S. Rain J.C. Benarous R. Cereseto A. Debyser Z. Transportin-SR2 imports HIV into the nucleus.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1192-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) used yeast two-hybrid screens and determined that TNPO3 directly interacts with HIV-1 IN and not with any other retroviral proteins, thus implicating this protein-protein interaction with nuclear import. However, the importance of this direct interaction between HIV-1 IN and TNPO3 has been contested by others (19Krishnan L. Matreyek K.A. Oztop I. Lee K. Tipper C.H. Li X. Dar M.J. Kewalramani V.N. Engelman A. The requirement for cellular transportin 3 (TNPO3 or TRN-SR2) during infection maps to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsid and not integrase.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that both HIV-1 and MLV INs interact with TNPO3 with similar affinities (19Krishnan L. Matreyek K.A. Oztop I. Lee K. Tipper C.H. Li X. Dar M.J. Kewalramani V.N. Engelman A.

Interplay between HIV entry and transportin-SR2 dependency.Retrovirology. 2011; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, a chimeric virus where HIV-1 CA was replaced with its MLV counterpart lost sensitivity to TNPO3, thus highlighting the importance of CA in nuclear import (19Krishnan L. Matreyek K.A. Oztop I. Lee K. Tipper C.H. Li X. Dar M.J. Kewalramani V.N. Engelman A.

Virol. 2010; 84: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Further argument for the CA dependence on TNPO3 has emerged from the observations that a CA N74D mutant is insensitive to TNPO3 knockdowns (21Lee K. Ambrose Z. Martin T.D. Oztop I. Mulky A. Julias J.G. Vandegraaff N. Baumann J.G. Wang R. Yuen W. Takemura T. Shelton K. Taniuchi I. Li Y. Sodroski J. Littman D.R. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Unutmaz D. Engelman A. KewalRamani V.N. Flexible use of nuclear import pathways by HIV-1.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This mutant has been identified through a positive selection with respect to a C-terminal-truncated fragment of CPSF6, which effectively restricted HIV replication (21Lee K. Ambrose Z. Martin T.D. Oztop I. Mulky A. Julias J.G. Vandegraaff N. Baumann J.G. Wang R. Yuen W. Takemura T. Shelton K. Taniuchi I. Li Y. Sodroski J. Littman D.R. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Unutmaz D. Engelman A.

In this study it was shown that the N-terminal 358-amino acid fragment of CPSF6 binds to wild type CA and not its N74D mutant (21Lee K. Ambrose Z. Martin T.D. Oztop I. Mulky A. Julias J.G.

Full-length CPSF6 contains a SR2 domain at its C terminus (amino acids 527–588) and is thus a potential cargo of TNPO3. Collectively, these findings raised the possibility that TNPO3 effects on HIV-1 replication could be mediated by interaction with the C-terminal SR domain of full-length CPSF6, which in addition could bind CA through interaction with its N-terminal region. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate how CPSF6 and its interaction with TNPO3 could affect lentiviral replication. A link between HIV-1 entry and its interaction with TNPO3 has also been proposed (20Thys W. De Houwer S. Demeulemeester J. Taltynov O. Vancraenenbroeck R. Gérard M. De Rijck J. Gijsbers R. Christ F. Debyser Z. Interplay between HIV entry and transportin-SR2 dependency.Retrovirology. 2011; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Infectivity of HIV-1 with the CA N74D substitution but with its native envelope, which mediates the pH-independent uptake, was partly dependent on TNPO3 (20Thys W. De Houwer S. Demeulemeester J. Taltynov O. Vancraenenbroeck R. Gérard M. De Rijck J. Gijsbers R. Christ F. Debyser Z. Interplay between HIV entry and transportin-SR2 dependency.Retrovirology. 2011; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this dependence on the cellular factor was lost when the HIV-1 CA N74D mutant was pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, which mediates pH-dependent endocytosis (20Thys W. De Houwer S. Demeulemeester J. Taltynov O. Vancraenenbroeck R. Gérard M. De Rijck J. Gijsbers R. Christ F. Debyser Z. Interplay between HIV entry and transportin-SR2 dependency.Retrovirology. 2011; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent publications have extended the debate about a TNPO3-dependent mechanism in later stages of viral replication by suggesting that TNPO3 affects HIV-1 integration only after PICs enter the nucleus (22De Iaco A. Luban J.

Transportin 3 promotes a nuclear maturation step required for efficient HIV-1 integration.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002194Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One study (24Zhou L. Sokolskaja E.

Transportin 3 promotes a nuclear maturation step required for efficient HIV-1 integration.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002194Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that some CA travels with PICs into the nucleus, after which the TNPO3-RanGTP complex strips the residual CA from the PICs to facilitate the integration and subsequently exports CA to the cytoplasm. More recently, it was suggested that TNPO3 could directly interact with the CA cores (23Valle-Casuso J.C. Di Nunzio F. Yang Y. Reszka N. Lienlaf M. Arhel N. Perez P. Brass A.L. Diaz-Griffero F. TNPO3 is required for HIV-1 replication after nuclear import but prior to integration and binds the HIV-1 core.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 5931-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this study used uncleaved CA-nucleocapsid protein and RNA to assemble the CA tubes in vitro, and the control experiments were missing to rule out potential nonspecific charge-charge interactions between TNPO3 and highly polar NC or RNA (23Valle-Casuso J.C. Di Nunzio F. Yang Y. Reszka N. Lienlaf M. Arhel N. Perez P. Brass A.L. Diaz-Griffero F.

In this study we used a battery of biophysical and biochemical techniques to characterize the TNPO3 structure and examine its interactions with either the intasome or CA tubes using an in vitro model system. We have proposed a molecular model of TNPO3 that comprises 20 α-helical HEAT repeats forming a closed ring structure. Binding experiments argue against meaningful direct interactions between TNPO3 and the CA tubes but show instead that TNPO3 readily interact with the HIV-1 intasome. Furthermore, we have mapped the protein-protein interfaces to several HIV-1 IN amino acids in the C-terminal domain and the C-terminal cargo domain of TNPO3. Our findings provide an important framework for future genetic analysis to better understand the role of TNPO3 in HIV-1 biology. HIV-1 IN clones included the following: full-length, N-terminal domain (NTD) (amino acids 1–50), catalytic core domain (CCD) (amino acids 50–212 with the F185K substitution), and C-terminal domain (CTD) (amino acids 213–288 with the C280S substitution), all with a cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag. FLAG-tagged IN was cloned as previously described (25Kessl J.J. Jena N. Koh Y. Taskent-Sezgin H. Slaughter A. Feng L. de Silva S. Wu L. Le Grice S.F. Engelman A. Fuchs J.R. Kvaratskhelia M.

The TNPO3 expression vector was created by PCR amplification of tnpo3 from a GST-tagged vector (pGEX) containing tnpo3 with the addition of an NdeI and BamHI sites and cloned into pET15b to generate an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The pET3A expression vector containing full-length HIV-1 CA sequence was a gift from Alan Rein (NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health). Site-directed mutants for full-length IN, IN CTD, TNPO3, and CA were created using QuikChange XL kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. LEDGF/p75 was cloned with a hexahistidine tag as described previously (26Vandegraaff N. Devroe E. Turlure F. Silver P.A. Engelman A.

Slight alterations to the protocol included: substitution of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 for 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,and the addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in all buffers, and a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (GE Healthcare) was employed with a linear gradient on an AKTA Purfier10 FPLC (GE Healthcare) in lieu of a batch elution. Partially purified protein was either subjected to thrombin digestion or directly loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Heparin column (GE Healthcare). The three domains of IN as well as CTD mutants were purified similarly to methods previously described (29Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M.

TNPO3 was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) with a 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 4 h after an initial A600 of 0.6 was achieved. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, sonicated, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h to remove insoluble material. The lysate was then purified with a Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient of 15 to 500 mm imidazole (in the same buffer). This was followed with a final purification step by isocratic elution from a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Wild type (wt) and N74D CA was purified as previously described (30von Schwedler U.K. Stemmler T.L. Klishko V.Y. Li S. Albertine K.H. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I.

All proteins were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE, quantified by UV absorbance, and stored in 10% glycerol at −80 °C until used. SSCs were prepared as previously described using 400 nm IN with ∼ 20% forming the SSC (31Kessl J.J. Li M. Ignatov M. Shkriabai N. Eidahl J.O. Feng L. Musier-Forsyth K. Craigie R. Kvaratskhelia M.

The resulting flow-through material was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-hexahistidine (anti-HIS) and anti-IN antibodies (HIV-1 IN monoclonal antibody (8G4) from NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). The Western blot standard was Magic Mark XP (Invitrogen). FLAG-tagged IN and Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) were used to pull down hexahistidine-tagged TNPO3 or full-length LEDGF/p75 or both. The protocol was followed as previously described (32Kobbi L. Octobre G. Dias J. Comisso M. Mirande M.

After washing the beads, the proteins were extracted from the beads by NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Nickel affinity pulldown assays using Ni-NTA beads (GE Healthcare) were also done with His-tagged TNPO3 and untagged IN, IN domains, and LEDGF/p75. The binding buffer contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm imidazole, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet-P40. Resulting pulldown assays were extracted from the beads using NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen), subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and visualized by Coomassie staining. Full-length IN pulldown assays were also visualized via Western blotting with the anti-IN antibody (8G4). CA tubes were formed by the addition of equal volume of a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 4 m NaCl to purified 20 mg/ml wt or N74D CA and allowed to polymerize on ice for 2 h (33Cortines J.R.

Pulldown assays with wt or N74D CA tubes were then performed by centrifugation at 8000 × g after 30 min of a rocking incubation with either TNPO3 or cyclophilin A.

https://openalex.org/W2008232387,"Background The salt marsh beetle Pogonus chalceus represents a unique opportunity to understand and study the origin and evolution of dispersal polymorphisms as remarkable inter-population divergence in dispersal related traits (e.g. wing development, body size and metabolism) has been shown to persist in face of strong homogenizing gene flow. Sequencing and assembling the transcriptome of P. chalceus is a first step in developing large scale genetic information that will allow us to further study the recurrent phenotypic evolution in dispersal traits in these natural populations. Methodology/Results We used the Illumina HiSeq2000 to sequence 37 Gbases of the transcriptome and performed de novo transcriptome assembly with the Trinity short read assembler. This resulted in 65,766 contigs, clustering into 39,393 unique transcripts (unigenes). A subset of 12,987 show similarity (BLAST) to known proteins in the NCBI database and 7,589 are assigned Gene Ontology (GO). Using homology searches we identified all reported genes involved in wing development, juvenile- and ecdysteroid hormone pathways in Tribolium castaneum. About half (56.7%) of the unique assembled genes are shared among three life stages (third-instar larva, pupa, and imago). We identified 38,141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these unigenes. Of these SNPs, 26,823 (70.3%) were found in a predicted open reading frame (ORF) and 6,998 (18.3%) were nonsynonymous. Conclusions The assembled transcriptome and SNP data are essential genomic resources for further study of the developmental pathways, genetic mechanisms and metabolic consequences of adaptive divergence in dispersal power in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2140148218,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health problem and a leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and developed countries. In humans, genetic factors greatly influence individual susceptibility to NAFLD. The goals of this study were to compare the magnitude of interindividual differences in the severity of liver injury induced by methyl-donor deficiency among individual inbred strains of mice and to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with the variability. Feeding mice a choline- and folate-deficient diet for 12 wk caused liver injury similar to NAFLD. The magnitude of liver injury varied among the strains, with the order of sensitivity being A/J ≈ C57BL/6J ≈ C3H/HeJ < 129S1/SvImJ ≈ CAST/EiJ < PWK/PhJ < WSB/EiJ. The interstrain variability in severity of NAFLD liver damage was associated with dysregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, primarily with a down-regulation of the peroxisome proliferator receptor α (PPARα)-regulated lipid catabolic pathway genes. Markers of oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced DNA damage were also elevated in the livers but were not correlated with severity of liver damage. These findings suggest that the PPARα-regulated metabolism network is one of the key mechanisms determining interstrain susceptibility and severity of NAFLD in mice.—Tryndyak, V., de Conti, A., Kobets, T., Kutanzi, K., Koturbash, I., Han, T., Fuscoe, J.

https://openalex.org/W2156869889,"Obesity is associated with many diseases, one of the most common being obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which in turn leads to blood gas disturbances, including intermittent hypoxia (IH). Obesity, OSA and IH are associated with metabolic changes, and while much mammalian work has been done, mechanisms underlying the response to IH, the role of obesity and the interaction of obesity and hypoxia remain unknown. As a model organism, Drosophila offers tremendous power to study a specific phenotype and, at a subsequent stage, to uncover and study fundamental mechanisms, given the conservation of molecular pathways. Herein, we characterize the phenotype of Drosophila on a high-fat diet in normoxia, IH and constant hypoxia (CH) using triglyceride and glucose levels, response to stress and lifespan. We found that female flies on a high-fat diet show increased triglyceride levels (p<0.001) and a shortened lifespan in normoxia, IH and CH. Furthermore, flies on a high-fat diet in normoxia and CH show diminished tolerance to stress, with decreased survival after exposure to extreme cold or anoxia (p<0.001). Of interest, IH seems to rescue this decreased cold tolerance, as flies on a high-fat diet almost completely recovered from cold stress following IH. We conclude that the cross talk between hypoxia and a high-fat diet can be either deleterious or compensatory, depending on the nature of the hypoxic treatment."

Previous studies have revealed Treg cell defects in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTACS), but the mechanisms underlying these defects remain unclear. In this study, we found that the numbers of peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Treg cells and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)CD45RA(+)CD45RO(-) naive Treg cells were lower in the NSTACS patients than in the chronic stable angina (CSA) and the chest pain syndrome (CPS) patients. However, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)CD45RA(-)CD45RO(+) memory Treg cells was comparable in all of the groups. The frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)CD45RO(-)CD45RA(+)CD31(+) recent thymic emigrant Treg cells and the T cell receptor excision circle content of purified Treg cells were lower in the NSTACS patients than in the CSA patients and the CPS controls. The spontaneous apoptosis of Treg cells (defined as CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)annexin V(+)7-AAD(-)) was increased in the NSTACS patients compared with the CSA and CPS groups. Furthermore, oxidized LDL could induce Treg cell apoptosis, and the oxidized LDL levels were significantly higher in the NSTACS patients than in the CSA and CPS groups. In accordance with the altered Treg cell levels, the concentration of TNF-α was increased in the NSTACS patients, resulting in a decreased IL-10/TNF-α ratio. These findings indicate that the impaired thymic output of Treg cells and their enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis in the periphery were responsible for Treg cell defects observed in the NSTACS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2039520257,"Rhodopsin molecules are photochemically reactive membrane-embedded proteins, with seven transmembrane α-helices, which bind the chromophore retinal (vitamin A aldehyde). They are roughly divided into two groups according to their basic functions: (i) ion transporters such as proton pumps, chloride pumps, and cation channels; and (ii) photo-sensors such as sensory rhodopsin from microbes and visual pigments from animals. Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR), found in 2003 in the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7120, is categorized as a microbial sensory rhodopsin. To investigate the function of ASR in vivo, ASR and the promoter sequence of the pigment protein phycocyanin were co-introduced into Escherichia coli cells with the reporter gene crp. The result clearly showed that ASR functions as a repressor of the CRP protein expression and that this is fully inhibited by the light activation of ASR, suggesting that ASR would directly regulate the transcription of crp. The repression is also clearly inhibited by the truncation of the C-terminal region of ASR, or mutations on the C-terminal Arg residues, indicating the functional importance of the C-terminal region. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel function of rhodopsin molecules and raise the possibility that the membrane-spanning protein ASR could work as a transcriptional factor. In the future, the ASR activity could be utilized as a tool for arbitrary protein expression in vivo regulated by visible light."
https://openalex.org/W1978235810,"Most proteases are expressed as inactive precursors, or zymogens, that become activated by limited proteolysis. We previously identified a small molecule, termed 1541, that dramatically promotes the maturation of the zymogen, procaspase-3, to its mature form, caspase-3. Surprisingly, compound 1541 self-assembles into nanofibrils, and localization of procaspase-3 to the fibrils promotes activation. Here, we interrogate the biochemical mechanism of procaspase-3 activation on 1541 fibrils in addition to proteogenic amyloid-β(1-40) fibrils. In contrast to previous reports, we find no evidence that procaspase-3 alone is capable of self-activation, consistent with its fate-determining role in executing apoptosis. In fact, mature caspase-3 is >10(7)-fold more active than procaspase-3, making this proenzyme a remarkably inactive zymogen. However, we also show that fibril-induced colocalization of trace amounts of caspase-3 or other initiator proteases with procaspase-3 dramatically stimulates maturation of the proenzyme in vitro. Thus, similar to known cellular signaling complexes, these synthetic or natural fibrils can serve as platforms to concentrate procaspase-3 for trans-activation by upstream proteases."

Specifically, the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2 or GPR183) was shown to be activated by several oxysterols, most potently by 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC). Nothing is known about the binding mode, however. Using mutational analysis, we identify here four key residues for 7α,25-OHC binding: Arg-87 in TM-II (position II:20/2.60), Tyr-112 and Tyr-116 (positions III:09/3.33 and III:13/3.37) in TM-III, and Tyr-260 in TM-VI (position VI:16/6.51). Substituting these residues with Ala and/or Phe results in a severe decrease in agonist binding and receptor activation. Docking simulations suggest that Tyr-116 interacts with the 3β-OH group in the agonist, Tyr-260 with the 7α-OH group, and Arg-87, either directly or indirectly, with the 25-OH group, although nearby residues likely also contribute. In addition, Tyr-112 is involved in 7α,25-OHC binding but via hydrophobic interactions. Finally, we show that II:20/2.60 constitutes an important residue for ligand binding in receptors carrying a positively charged residue at this position. This group is dominated by lipid- and nucleotide-activated receptors, here exemplified by the CysLTs, P2Y12, and P2Y14. In conclusion, we present the first molecular characterization of oxysterol binding to a 7TM receptor and identify position II:20/2.60 as a generally important residue for ligand binding in certain 7TM receptors.

Oxysterols encompass a group of oxygenated cholesterol derivates that are synthesized by enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms in various organs. These molecules play an important role in a range of cellular processes, including inflammation (1Xu L. Bai Q. Rodriguez-Agudo D. Hylemon P.B. Heuman D.M. Pandak W.M. Ren S.

The molecular targets of oxysterols are only starting to emerge and many remain enigmatic. Given their hydrophobic nature, these molecules are able to modulate the activity of cellular effectors either directly by binding or indirectly by changing the physicochemical properties of the plasma membrane upon incorporation (4Rentero C.

Interestingly, two distinct receptor families are represented among the few effectors that are known to bind oxysterols, namely the nuclear receptor transcription factors and the G protein-coupled seven transmembrane (7TM) 2The abbreviations used are: 7TMseven transmembrane7α,25-OHC7α,25-dihydroxycholesterolCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCysL Tscysteineyl leukotriene receptors 1 and 2hEBI2human EBI2ProII:18 receptor:receptor in which the conserved TM-II Pro is found at position II:18/2.58ProII:19 receptor:receptor in which the conserved TM-II Pro is found at position II:19/2.59TMtransmembraneGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateCysLTcysteinyl leukotrienehEBI2human EBI2LTleukotrieneSPAscintillation proximity assay. receptors. Members of the former group include the liver X receptor α and β isoforms, both of which are activated by several oxysterols such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (5Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J.

In addition, another nuclear receptor, the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ, was recently suggested to be activated by various oxysterols (8Jin L. Martynowski D. Zheng S. Wada T. Xie W. Li Y. Structural basis for hydroxycholesterols as natural ligands of orphan nuclear receptor RORγ.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

Recently, the family of 7TM receptors was discovered to be oxysterols targets when two oxysterol-activated receptors were identified. These are smoothened, an essential element of the hedgehog signaling pathway (11Nachtergaele S. Mydock L.K. Krishnan K. Rammohan J. Schlesinger P.H. Covey D.F. Rohatgi R.

Prior to its deorphanization, a characterization of this receptor's apparent constitutive activity revealed that it signals through Gαi (14Rosenkilde M.M. Benned-Jensen T. Andersen H. Holst P.J.

Biologically, EBI2 was later shown to play an important role in humoral immune responses by regulating B cell trafficking within lymphoid follicles (16Gatto D. Paus D. Basten A. Mackay C.R. Brink R.

Specifically, activated B cells residing in the germinal centers down-regulate the expression of EBI2 and, upon translocating to the inter/outer follicular areas, up-regulate the level of EBI2 suggesting that the receptor functions as a chemotactic receptor by responding to an (at the time) unidentified agonist. This agonist was finally identified as the oxysterol 7α,25-OHC, which binds EBI2 with high affinity and selectivity (12Hannedouche S. Zhang J. Yi T. Shen W. Nguyen D. Pereira J.P. Guerini D.

Ultimately, this results in a significantly reduced number of plasma cells thus underscoring the biological importance of this novel agonist-receptor pair. Whereas structural data regarding the binding mode of oxysterols to nuclear receptors (8Jin L. Martynowski D. Zheng S. Wada T. Xie W. Li Y.

Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the oxysterol-binding protein (18Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H. Structural mechanism for sterol sensing and transport by OSBP-related proteins.Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) exist, the binding mode of oxysterols to 7TM receptors is unknown. However, pharmacophore studies on the 7α- and 25-OH groups in the EBI2 agonist suggest that both are tightly involved in ligand binding as even subtle changes in hydroxyl position result in a significant decrease in affinity, suggesting that a clearly defined set of anchor residues are present in EBI2 (12Hannedouche S.

Here, we have used mutational analysis to identify these residues, and in silico docking simulations to explore the possible binding modes of 7α,25-OHC. The important residues include an Arg in the top of TM-II (Arg-87 at position II:20/2.60), 3We used both numbering systems of Baldwin-Schwartz and Ballesteros (in this order and separated by a slash) when referring to positions within the helical domains. a Tyr in TM-III (Tyr-116 at position III:13/3.37) and a Tyr in TM-VI (Tyr-260 at position VI:16/6.51). Furthermore, the Tyr at position III:09/3.33 (Tyr-112) also play a prominent role in agonist binding. We also show that Arg or Lys residues at position II:20/2.60 are highly important for ligand binding in other 7TM receptors, here exemplified by the cysteinyl leukotriene receptors 1 and 2 (CysLTs) and two P2Y receptors (P2Y12 and P2Y14). Finally, as we previously have identified the Arg at position II:20/2.60 as a major regulator of EBI2 constitutive activity (19Benned-Jensen T. Rosenkilde M.M. Structural motifs of importance for the constitutive activity of the orphan 7TM receptor EBI2. Analysis of receptor activation in the absence of an agonist.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1008-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), our results also indicate that the majority of this activity likely has been a result of agonist contamination as reported for other lipid-activated receptors as well (20Stoddart L.A.

The cDNA encoding human EBI2 was from an in-house library, and cDNAs encoding CysLT1, CysLT2, P2Y12, and P2Y14 were bought from Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center. The promiscuous chimeric G protein Gqi4myr was kindly provided by Evi Kostenis (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelm University, Bonn, Germany). LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent and Opti-MEM was purchased from Invitrogen, and FuGENE 6 reagent was from Roche Applied Science. The PathHunter β-arrestin kit was from DiscoveRx. SteadyLite (lyophilized substrate solution) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate was purchased from KemEnTech. Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was from Pierce, and mouse anti-M1-FLAG antibody, sodium lactate, UDP-galactose, and ADP were from Sigma. [35S]GTPγS was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]7α,25-OHC was custom-synthesized (Tritec) and repurified periodically at Novartis. All oxysterols were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and dissolved in pure DMSO. The cysteinyl leukotrienes LTD4 and LTC4 were from Cayman Chemicals. Constructs used in GTPγS, β-arrestin recruitment, and competition binding studies carried an N-terminal M1-FLAG tag as described previously (19Benned-Jensen T. Rosenkilde M.M.

Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1008-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange protocol and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) adjusted to contain 4500 mg/liter glucose, 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 10% CO2. Stably transfected CHO FLP-IN cells were grown in Ham's F-12 containing 10% FBS, 1% glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and hygromycin (500 μg/ml) at 5% CO2. Stably transfected CHO K1.A2 cells used in β-arrestin assays were grown in Ham's F-12 containing 10% FBS, 1% glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and hygromycin (250 μg/ml) at 5% CO2. CHO cells stably expressing Gqi5 and EBI2 mutants were maintained in growth medium (DMEM/Ham's F-12) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and selection markers (0.25 mg/ml Zeocin, 5 μg/ml puromycin, and 0.4 mg/ml G418). For membrane preparations, transient transfections were performed using the calcium precipitation method, and FuGENE 6 and Lipofectamine 2000 were used in β-arrestin assays and for generation of stable CHO FLP-IN clones, respectively. Membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged receptor constructs or pcDNA3 as control. The cells were manually harvested with a cell scraper in ice-cold PBS and homogenized using a Dounce. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2 and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and kept at −80 °C until used in [35S]GTPγS binding experiments or competition binding. The protein concentrations in each preparation were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). [35S]GTPγS binding experiments were carried out in white 96-well plates (Nunc) using the SPA-based method. A volume of membrane preparation (corresponding to 20 μg of protein/well) was diluted in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 3 μm GDP, 10 μg/ml saponin, and Complete inhibitor mix, pH 7.4). [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol, 12.5 mCi/ml) diluted in assay buffer was added to a final concentration of 1 nm and incubated 1 h at 30 °C. Subsequently, WGA PVT SPA beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added (final concentration of 2.8 mg/ml) followed by 30 min of incubation at room temperature on a plate shaker. Finally, the plates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and the amount of radioactivity was determined using a Top Count scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The level of unspecific binding was determined by adding unlabeled GTPγS at a final concentration of 40 μm. All experiments were carried out at least three times and in triplicate. [3H]7α,25-OHC competition binding experiments were carried out in white 96-half-well plates (Costar). 10 μl of WGA PVT SPA beads diluted in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% cyclodextrin, pH 7.4) to 20 mg/ml was added to each well. Subsequently, 30 μl of membrane preparation diluted in binding buffer to 0.67 mg/ml was added. After a 20-min incubation on a shaker at room temperature, 2.5 μl of ligand at 20× final concentration was added followed by addition of [3H]7α,25-OHC to a final concentration of 10 nm. The plates were sealed and, after 15 min on shaker, incubated at room temperature overnight. The following day, the plates were spun down at 1500 rpm for 5 min and counted in a TopCounter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recruitment of β-arrestin was measured using the PathHunter β-arrestin assay (DiscoveRx). cDNA encoding M1-EBI2 WT was fused to the PK1 tag and the small fragment of β-galactosidase and cloned into pcDNA3.1+. Mutations were generated using the QuikChange protocol. Assays were performed in a CHO K1.A2-arrestin cell line stably expressing β-arrestin2 coupled to the β-gal large fragment. Cells were seeded out at 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and transfected the following day with 50 ng of DNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (0.15 μl/well). 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with varying concentrations of 7α,25-OHC for 90 min. β-Arrestin recruitment was detected as β-gal activity 60 min after addition of chemiluminescent substrate. CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with Gqi5 were seeded in black/clear bottom, poly-d-lysine-coated 384-well plates at a cell density of 10,000 cells/25 μl/well using culture medium. Cells were cultured for overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Culture medium was removed, and for cell loading, 20 μl per well of loading buffer (Calcium-5 no wash dye, Molecular Devices) were distributed into the wells, and the plates were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Compound dilutions were prepared in 90% DMSO, 10% water and finally transferred to assay buffer containing 0.1% cyclodextrin. Ten microliters of the compound was added to the cells, and the subsequent fluorescent changes were monitored for 3 min. Fluorescence was detected using a FDSS7000 (Hamamatsu). Two values of fluorescence calcium responses were exported as follows: Fmax, the fluorescence at the peak, and Fbasal, corresponding to the value prior to compound injection. From these two values, the calcium response is normalized with respect to the calcium base-line values using dF/F = (Fmax − Fbasal)/Fbasal. The maximum dF/F is called Emax. HEK293 cells were seeded at 35,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and transiently transfected the following day with FLAG-tagged receptor constructs or pcDNA at the indicated concentrations along with the trans-activator plasmid pFA2-CREB, the reporter plasmid pFRluc, and in some experiments the chimeric G-protein Gqi4myr at 6, 30, and 50 ng/well, respectively. The latter is a promiscuous G protein that binds to Gαi-coupled receptors but activates the Gαq pathway. The CREB activity was determined 48 h after transfection using the SteadyLite substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, the cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS (0.9 mm CaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 137 mm NaCl, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4), and the luminescence was measured 10 min after addition of the substrate using a TopCounter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All receptor constructs were tested at least three times in quadruples. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged receptor constructs as described above. Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times in TBS, and blocked for 30 min with TBS containing 2% BSA. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M1 antibody at 2 μg/ml for 2 h in TBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 1 mm CaCl2. After three washes in TBS containing 1% BSA and 1 mm CaCl2, the cells were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody diluted 1:1000 in the same buffer as the primary antibody. Following washing, the immune reactivity was determined by addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine according to the manufacturer's instruction. All steps were carried out at room temperature, and all constructs were tested at least three times in quadruples. The sequence of the human EBI2 receptor was obtained from Uniprot (accession code p32249). The closest three-dimensional structure homologue of EBI2 with known structure, CXCR4 (Protein Data Bank code 3ODU) (21Wu B. Chien E.Y. Mol C.D. Fenalti G. Liu W. Katritch V. Abagyan R. Brooun A. Wells P. Bi F.C. Hamel D.J. Kuhn P. Handel T.M. Cherezov V. Stevens R.C. Structures of the CXCR4 chemokine GPCR with small molecule and cyclic peptide antagonists.Science. 2010; 330: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), was used as template structure. The TL4-lysozyme domain was deleted from the CXCR4 crystal structure, and the sequence alignment between EBI2 and the template was constructed using the bioinfo tools in the ICM software package (Molsoft LLC, La Jolla, CA). Because the quality of comparative homology models is highly dependent on the quality of the sequence alignment between the target and the template structure, manual inspections and minor adjustments were performed to ensure proper alignment of conserved class A G-protein-coupled receptor motifs, conserved generic fingerprints, and to avoid accidental gaps in the transmembrane region. Specifically, the obligatory disulfide bridge between the highly conserved CysIII:01/3.25 (Cys-104 in EBI2) in the extracellular part of TMIII and a Cys in extracellular loop 2 (Cys-181 in EBI2) formed in most 7TM receptors was manually aligned to the CXCR4 template to ensure that the disulfide bridge would be formed in the initial EBI2 homology model (see supplemental Fig. 1). During EBI2 model generation, all amino acid were subjected to a full side chain optimization to optimize their packing. Loop regions of the EBI2 model that were constructed without a template were selected as the best scored loop structures assigned conformations from similar “fragments” in the ICM database of experimental structures. In general, comparative homology models are considered to be associated with atomic position errors that impede the use of homology models for purposes that require atomic resolution data, such as drug design and protein-ligand interaction predictions. Thus, the initial EBI2 model was subjected to full-atom structure relaxation using the ROSETTA membrane force field (22Barth P. Schonbrun J. Baker D.

Here, we investigated the role played in this process by Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP1), the universal cofactor of KRAB-zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), a tetrapod-restricted family of transcriptional repressors. T-cell-specific Kap1-deleted mice displayed a significant expansion of immature thymocytes, imbalances in CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios, and altered responses to TCR and TGFβ stimulation when compared to littermate KAP1 control mice. Transcriptome and chromatin studies revealed that KAP1 binds T-cell-specific cis-acting regulatory elements marked by the H3K9me3 repressive mark and enriched in Ikaros/NuRD complexes. Also, KAP1 directly controls the expression of several genes involved in TCR and cytokine signaling. Among these, regulation of FoxO1 seems to play a major role in this system. Likely responsible for tethering KAP1 to at least part of its genomic targets, a small number of KRAB-ZFPs are selectively expressed in T-lymphoid cells. These results reveal the so far unsuspected yet important role of KAP1-mediated epigenetic regulation in T-lymphocyte differentiation and activation.—Santoni de Sio, F.

https://openalex.org/W2107952889,"Background Two parallel and interacting processes are said to underlie animal behavior, whereby learning and performance of a behavior is at first via conscious and deliberate (goal-directed) processes, but after initial acquisition, the behavior can become automatic and stimulus-elicited (habitual). With respect to instrumental behaviors, animal learning studies suggest that the duration of training and the action-outcome contingency are two factors involved in the emergence of habitual seeking of “natural” reinforcers (e.g., sweet solutions, food or sucrose pellets). To rigorously test whether behaviors reinforced by abused substances such as ethanol, in particular, similarly become habitual was the primary aim of this study. Methodology/Principal Findings Male Long Evans rats underwent extended or limited operant lever press training with 10% sucrose/10% ethanol (10S10E) reinforcement (variable interval (VI) or (VR) ratio schedule of reinforcement), or with 10% sucrose (10S) reinforcement (VI schedule only). Once training and pretesting were complete, the impact of outcome devaluation on operant behavior was evaluated after lithium chloride injections were paired with the reinforcer, or unpaired 24 hours later. After limited, but not extended instrumental training, lever pressing by groups trained under VR with 10S10E and under VI with 10S was sensitive to outcome devaluation. In contrast, responding by both the extended and limited training 10S10E VI groups was not sensitive to ethanol devaluation during the test for habitual behavior. Conclusions/Significance Operant behavior by rats trained to self-administer an ethanol-sucrose solution showed variable sensitivity to a change in the value of ethanol, with relative insensitivity developing sooner in animals that received time-variable ethanol reinforcement during training sessions. One important implication, with respect to substance abuse in humans, is that initial learning about the relationship between instrumental actions and the opportunity to consume ethanol-containing drinks can influence the time course for the development or expression of habitual ethanol seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2037101763,"The Escherichia coli O9a and O8 O-antigen serotypes represent model systems for the ABC transporter-dependent synthesis of bacterial polysaccharides. The O9a and O8 antigens are linear mannose homopolymers containing conserved reducing termini (the primer-adaptor), a serotype-specific repeat unit domain, and a terminator. Synthesis of these glycans occurs on the polyisoprenoid lipid-linked primer, undecaprenol pyrophosphoryl-GlcpNAc, by two conserved mannosyltransferases, WbdC and WbdB, and a serotype-specific mannosyltransferase, WbdA. The glycan structure and pattern of conservation in the O9a and O8 mannosyltransferases are not consistent with the existing model of O9a biosynthesis. Here we establish a revised pathway using a combination of in vivo (mutant complementation) experiments and in vitro strategies with purified enzymes and synthetic acceptors. WbdC and WbdB synthesize the adaptor region, where they transfer one and two α-(1→3)-linked mannose residues, respectively. The WbdA enzymes are solely responsible for forming the repeat unit domains of these O-antigens. WbdA(O9a) has two predicted active sites and polymerizes a tetrasaccharide repeat unit containing two α-(1→3)- and two α-(1→2)-linked mannopyranose residues. In contrast, WbdA(O8) polymerizes trisaccharide repeat units containing single α-(1→3)-, α-(1→2)-, and β-(1→2)-mannopyranoses. These studies illustrate assembly systems exploiting several mannosyltransferases with flexible active sites, arranged in single- and multiple-domain formats."
https://openalex.org/W2024594911,"DNA sequences prone to forming noncanonical structures (hairpins, triplexes, G-quadruplexes) cause DNA replication fork stalling, activate DNA damage responses, and represent hotspots of genomic instability associated with human disease. The 88-bp asymmetric polypurine-polypyrimidine (Pu-Py) mirror repeat tract from the human polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) intron 21 forms non-B DNA secondary structures in vitro. We show that the PKD1 mirror repeat also causes orientation-dependent fork stalling during replication in vitro and in vivo. When integrated alongside the c-myc replicator at an ectopic chromosomal site in the HeLa genome, the Pu-Py mirror repeat tract elicits a polar replication fork barrier. Increased replication protein A (RPA), Rad9, and ataxia telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint protein binding near the mirror repeat sequence suggests that the DNA damage response is activated upon replication fork stalling. Moreover, the proximal c-myc origin of replication was not required to cause orientation-dependent checkpoint activation. Cells expressing the replication fork barrier display constitutive Chk1 phosphorylation and continued growth, i.e. checkpoint adaptation. Excision of the Pu-Py mirror repeat tract abrogates the DNA damage response. Adaptation to Chk1 phosphorylation in cells expressing the replication fork barrier may allow the accumulation of mutations that would otherwise be remediated by the DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2157681516,"Past exposure to atomic bomb (A-bomb) radiation has exerted various long-lasting deleterious effects on the health of survivors. Some of these effects are seen even after >60 yr. In this study, we evaluated the subclinical inflammatory status of 442 A-bomb survivors, in terms of 8 inflammation-related cytokines or markers, comprised of plasma levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-4, IL-10, and immunoglobulins, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The effects of past radiation exposure and natural aging on these markers were individually assessed and compared. Next, to assess the biologically significant relationship between inflammation and radiation exposure or aging, which was masked by the interrelationship of those cytokines/markers, we used multivariate statistical analyses and evaluated the systemic markers of inflammation as scores being calculated by linear combinations of selected cytokines and markers. Our results indicate that a linear combination of ROS, IL-6, CRP, and ESR generated a score that was the most indicative of inflammation and revealed clear dependences on radiation dose and aging that were found to be statistically significant. The results suggest that collectively, radiation exposure, in conjunction with natural aging, may enhance the persistent inflammatory status of A-bomb survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2165055542,"Understanding the structural organization of lipids in the cell and viral membranes is essential for elucidating mechanisms of viral fusion that lead to entry of enveloped viruses into their host cells. The HIV lipidome shows a remarkable enrichment in dihydrosphingomyelin, an unusual sphingolipid formed by a dihydrosphingosine backbone. Here we investigated the ability of dihydrosphingosine to incorporate into the site of membrane fusion mediated by the HIV envelope (Env) protein. Dihydrosphingosine as well as cholesterol, fatty acid, and tocopherol was conjugated to highly conserved, short HIV-1 Env-derived peptides with no antiviral activity otherwise. We showed that dihydrosphingosine exclusively endowed nanomolar antiviral activity to the peptides (IC50 as low as 120 nM) in HIV-1 infection on TZM-bl cells and on Jurkat T cells, as well as in the cell-cell fusion assay. These sphingopeptides were active against enfuvirtide-resistant and wild-type CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV strains. The anti-HIV activity was determined by both the peptides and their dihydrosphingosine conjugate. Moreover, their mode of action involved accumulation in the cells and viruses and binding to membranes enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. The data suggest that sphingopeptides are recruited to the HIV membrane fusion site and provide a general concept in developing inhibitors of sphingolipid-mediated biological systems.—Ashkenazi, A., Viard, M., Unger, L., Blumenthal, R., Shai, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2069128176,"After the pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila is phagocytosed, it injects more than 250 different proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells to evade lysosomal digestion and to replicate inside the host cell. Among these secreted proteins is the protein DrrA/SidM, which has been shown to modify Rab1b, a main regulator of vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells, by transfer of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to Tyr(77). In addition, Legionella provides the protein SidD that hydrolytically reverses the covalent modification, suggesting a tight spatial and temporal control of Rab1 function by Legionella during infection. Small angle x-ray scattering experiments of DrrA allowed us to validate a tentative complex model built by combining available crystallographic data. We have established the effects of adenylylation on Rab1 interactions and properties in a quantitative way. In addition, we have characterized the kinetics of DrrA-catalyzed adenylylation as well as SidD-catalyzed deadenylylation toward Rab1 and have determined the nucleotide specificities of both enzymes. This study enhances our knowledge of proteins subverting Rab1 function at the Legionella-containing vacuole."

For the expression of the GST peptides, bacteria were grown to an OD of 0.6, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the bacteria were harvested, washed, and stored at −20 °C. For purification of the GST peptides, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μl of DNase/10 ml). After complete lysis by sonication, the supernatant was cleared by centrifugation, and recombinant proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare). After washing of the resin with 20 volumes of washing buffer (PBS (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT), the GST-tagged protein was eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer (PBS (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm reduced glutathione). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for protein content, pooled, and dialyzed (overnight, 4 °C) against storage buffer (PBS (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The AlphaScreen binding assay was optimized for use in 384-well OptiPlate microplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a final volume of 25 μl. Proteins were all diluted to 5× working solutions in the assay buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)). First, 10 μl of the TRN-SR2 was pipetted into the wells, followed by 5 μl of His6-IN or a GST-peptide dilution series. The plate was sealed and left to incubate for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, 10 μl of a mixture of Ni2+ chelate acceptor and glutathione donor AlphaScreen beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. This establishes final concentrations of 20 μg/ml for each of the beads. Plates were then incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and analyzed using an EnVision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each titration was performed in duplicate, and assays were repeated at least twice in independent experiments. The equilibrium dissociation constants (apparent Kd) were calculated with Prism 5 (GraphPad), by plotting the titration curves using a one-site-specific binding with Hill slope fit as shown in Equation 1, Y=(Bmax)×(X0+Z0+Kd)-(X0+Z0+Kd)2-(4X0Z0)÷2(Eq. 1) The background signal was subtracted from each value. Points for which quenching of the signal occurs through excess of either binding partner (“hooking” as referred to by the supplier), were excluded from the final plot. Proteins were expressed by double polyethyleneimine-mediated transfection of 293T cells with 10 μg of each plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in co-IP buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.3), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v) and protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free)) after which lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma). After 3 h of incubation, the agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation for 2 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C and washed three times with 500 μl of co-IP buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies against 3×FLAG (1:10,000 dilution) (Sigma) and GFP (1:5000) (Abcam). Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rabbit anti-goat antibodies, respectively (Dako), and chemiluminescence (ECL+, Amersham Biosciences). The 3′-processing activity was measured in a standard assay using radioactively labeled oligodeoxynucleotide substrates resembling the viral LTR end, although a quantitative ELISA was used to measure the overall enzymatic activity (33Christ F.

Two and 3 days post-transfection, the supernatant was harvested, filtered with 0.22-μm pore-size syringe filters (Sartorius), concentrated by centrifugal filtration using VivaSpin concentrators (Millipore), and treated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science). By yeast two-hybrid, we previously identified TRN-SR2 as a bona fide binding partner of HIV-1 IN (19Christ F. Thys W. De Rijck J. Gijsbers R. Albanese A. Arosio D. Emiliani S. Rain J.C. Benarous R.

Virol. 2010; 84: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To define the minimal TRN-SR2 interaction domain in HIV-1 integrase, we now investigated its interaction with the NTD, the CCD, and the CTD. The different IN domains fused to GFP were expressed in 293T cells, and TRN-SR2 was expressed with a 3×FLAG tag (Fig. 1A). By co-IP, TRN-SR2 was shown to interact with both the catalytic core and the C-terminal domain of IN but not with the NTD (Fig. 1A). Next, deletion mutants of either the CCD or the CTD were generated and tested for interaction with TRN-SR2 in co-IP (data not shown). This approach failed to generate further insights because mutants bound nonspecifically to the agarose beads, most likely due to their reduced structural stability. We therefore opted for an in vitro approach. We purified recombinant full-length IN and its domains carrying an N-terminal His6 tag as well as recombinant TRN-SR2 with an N-terminal GST tag to determine the interaction by AlphaScreen (Fig. 1B). The apparent Kd value as well as the AlphaScreen counts are important to compare the affinity of two proteins tested in AlphaScreen. Both the CCD and the CTD of HIV-1 IN displayed affinity for TRN-SR2. The CCD of IN interacts with TRN-SR2 with a 2-fold lower affinity (Kd = 40.2 ± 15.1 nm) and 10-fold lower counts than full-length IN (Kd = 16.8 ± 3.8 nm), whereas the CTD of IN interacts with TRN-SR2 in a cooperative manner with a 6-fold lower affinity (Kd = 94.2 ± 2.6 nm) but 4-fold higher counts than full-length IN (Fig. 1B). The data confirm direct protein-protein interactions between TRN-SR2 and both CCD and CTD of HIV-1 IN as shown by co-IP. Hence, we focused our subsequent analysis of the interaction interface on these two domains. Nuclear localization signals are usually composed of short amino acid stretches and are commonly bipartite (36Marfori M. Mynott A. Ellis J.J. Mehdi A.M"

https://openalex.org/W2139239087,"Background Viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections in early-life are linked to the development of allergic airway inflammation and asthma. However, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. We have previously shown that neonatal and infant, but not adult, chlamydial lung infections in mice permanently alter inflammatory phenotype and physiology to increase the severity of allergic airway disease by increasing lung interleukin (IL)-13 expression, mucus hyper-secretion and airway hyper-responsiveness. This occurred through different mechanisms with infection at different ages. Neonatal infection suppressed inflammatory responses but enhanced systemic dendritic cell:T-cell IL-13 release and induced permanent alterations in lung structure (i.e., increased the size of alveoli). Infant infection enhanced inflammatory responses but had no effect on lung structure. Here we investigated the role of hematopoietic cells in these processes using bone marrow chimera studies. Methodology/Principal Findings Neonatal (<24-hours-old), infant (3-weeks-old) and adult (6-weeks-old) mice were infected with C. muridarum. Nine weeks after infection bone marrow was collected and transferred into recipient age-matched irradiated naïve mice. Allergic airway disease was induced (8 weeks after adoptive transfer) by sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin. Reconstitution of irradiated naïve mice with bone marrow from mice infected as neonates resulted in the suppression of the hallmark features of allergic airway disease including mucus hyper-secretion and airway hyper-responsiveness, which was associated with decreased IL-13 levels in the lung. In stark contrast, reconstitution with bone marrow from mice infected as infants increased the severity of allergic airway disease by increasing T helper type-2 cell cytokine release (IL-5 and IL-13), mucus hyper-secretion, airway hyper-responsiveness and IL-13 levels in the lung. Reconstitution with bone marrow from infected adult mice had no effects. Conclusions These results suggest that an infant chlamydial lung infection results in long lasting alterations in hematopoietic cells that increases the severity of allergic airway disease in later-life."

Internal organs or soft tissues have, however, rarely been reported, an obvious palaeobiological drawback. In this study, we employed synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to study microscopic ‘Orsten’ arthropods from the Cambrian of Sweden: Skara minuta and two phosphatocopine species, Hesslandona sp. and Hesslandona trituberculata. This exceptionally high-resolution technique reveals internal organs or soft tissues that allow detailed comparison with equivalent structures in extant crustaceans and functional inferences to be made. The S. minuta specimen shows the digestive system and muscles that extend to the extremities. The slanting anterior portion of the head and anterior position of the mouth with a straight oesophagus suggest a primarily brushing and scraping way of feeding. The prominent head appendage muscles indicate muscle strength and good capacity for food manipulation. In the phosphatocopines the bulbous labrum is one of the most prominent morphological structures of the body. All specimens analysed reveal pairs of muscle bundles within the labrum. Based on comparisons with extant crustacean relatives, these muscles would fulfil the function of moving the labrum up and down in order to open the buccal cavity. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that there is still much to be learned about the ‘Orsten’ taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2089376520,"Sucrose nonfermenting 1 (Snf1)-related kinase (SNRK) is a serine/threonine kinase with sequence similarity to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); however, its function is not well characterized. We conducted a gene array to determine which genes are regulated by SNRK. The array demonstrated that SNRK overexpression increased the levels of genes involved in cell proliferation, including calcyclin-binding protein (CacyBP), a member of the ubiquitin ligase complex that targets nonphosphorylated β-catenin for degradation. We confirmed that SNRK increased CacyBP mRNA and protein, and decreased β-catenin protein in HCT116 and RKO colon cancer cells. Furthermore, SNRK inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, and CacyBP down-regulation reversed the SNRK-mediated decrease in proliferation and β-catenin. SNRK overexpression also decreased β-catenin nuclear localization and target gene transcription, and β-catenin down-regulation reversed the effects of SNRK knockdown on proliferation. SNRK transcript levels were reduced in human colon tumors compared to normal tissue by 35.82%, and stable knockdown of SNRK increased colon cancer cell tumorigenicity. Our results demonstrate that SNRK is down-regulated in colon cancer and inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation through CacyBP up-regulation and β-catenin degradation, resulting in reduced proliferation signaling.

In order to be able to study specific genetic ablation in mdDA neurons a new tools was developed that drives Cre-recombinase under the control of the Pitx3 locus. The Pitx3 gene is well known for its specific expression in mdDA neurons and is present at the onset of terminal differentiation. Analysis of newly generated Pitx3-Cre knock-in mice shows that Cre expression, measured through the activation of eYfp by removal of a ""Stop"" signal (LoxP-Stop-LoxP-eYfp reporter mouse), is present at the onset of terminal differentiation and mimics closely the native Pitx3 expression domain.

https://openalex.org/W2164435762,"Mutations in fibulin proteins that cause cellular secretion deficiencies are linked to a variety of diseases, ranging from retinopathies to cutis laxa (CL). One secretion-deficient fibulin mutant, R345W fibulin-3, causes the macular dystrophy malattia leventinese by increased endoplasmic reticulum retention and/or extracellular misfolding. Herein, we report that small-molecule activation of the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response partially rescues R345W secretion deficiencies through translational attenuation mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation. Enhanced mutant fibulin-3 secretion can also be achieved by activation of a PERK-independent eIF2α kinase through arsenite treatment and is independent of activating transcription factor 4 signaling and protein translation. However, this translational attenuation strategy was unsuccessful for enhancing the secretion deficiencies of fibulin-5 mutants associated with age-related macular degeneration or CL. While lowered growth temperature enhanced the secretion of mutants associated with CL (C217R and S227P), these effects were not mediated through translational attenuation. In stark contrast to the situation with fibulin-3, protein translation was required for efficient wild-type and mutant fibulin-5 secretion. These data suggest that alteration of specific cellular signaling pathways and proteostasis network components can differentially influence fibulin fate, a hypothesis that could be exploited as a therapy for fibulin-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1990128574,"To thrive in the human body, HIV fuses to its target cell and evades the immune response via several mechanisms. The fusion cascade is initiated by the fusion peptide (FP), which is located at the N-terminal of gp41, the transmembrane protein of HIV. Recently, it has been shown that the HIV-1 FP, particularly its 5-13 amino acid region (FP(5-13)), suppresses T-cell activation and interacts with the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. Specific amino acid motifs often contribute to such interactions in TMDs of membrane proteins. Using bioinformatics and experimental studies, we report on a GxxxG-like motif (AxxxG), which is conserved in the FP throughout different clades and strains of HIV-1. Biological activity studies and FTIR spectroscopy revealed that HIV FP(5-13)-derived peptides, in which the motif was altered either by randomization or by a single amino acid shift, lost their immunosuppressive activity concomitant with a loss of the β-sheet structure in a membranous environment. Furthermore, fluorescence studies revealed that the inactive mutants lost their ability to interact with their target site, namely, the TMD of TCRα, designated CP. Importantly, lipotechoic acid activated macrophages (lacking TCR) were not affected by FP, further demonstrating the specificity of the immunosuppressant activity of CP. Finally, although the AxxxG WT and the GxxxG analog both associated with the CP and immunosuppressed T-cells, the AxxxG WT but not the GxxxG analog induced lipid mixing. Overall, the data support an important role for the AxxxG motif in the function of FP and might explain the natural selection of the AxxxG motif rather than the classical GxxxG motif in FP."
https://openalex.org/W2027176242,"Riproximin is a cytotoxic type II ribosome-inactivating protein showing high selectivity for tumor cell lines. Its binding to cell surface glycans is crucial for subsequent internalization and cytotoxicity. In this paper, we describe a unique mechanism of interaction and discuss its implications for the cellular targeting and cytotoxicity of riproximin. On a carbohydrate microarray, riproximin specifically bound to two types of asialo-glycans, namely to bi- and triantennary complex N-glycan structures (NA2/NA3) and to repetitive N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc), the so-called clustered Tn antigen, a cancer-specific O-glycan on mucins. Two glycoproteins showing high riproximin binding, the NA3-presenting asialofetuin and the clustered Tn-rich asialo-bovine submaxillary mucin, were subsequently chosen as model glycoproteins to mimic the binding interactions of riproximin with the two types of glycans. ELISA analyses were used to relate the two binding specificities of riproximin to its two sugar binding sites. The ability of riproximin to cross-link the two model proteins revealed that binding of the two types of glycoconjugates occurs within different binding sites. The biological implications of these binding properties were analyzed in cellular assays. The cytotoxicity of riproximin was found to depend on its specific and concomitant interaction with the two glycoconjugates as well as on dynamic avidity effects typical for lectins binding to multivalent glycoproteins. The presence of definite, cancer-related structures on the cells to be targeted determines the therapeutic potency of riproximin. Due to its cross-linking ability, riproximin is expected to show a high degree of specificity for cells exposing both NA2/NA3 and clustered Tn structures.

Riproximin is a lectin with potent antineoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo (1Voss C. Eyol E. Berger M.R.

It was originally identified as the active component of a powdered plant material used in African traditional medicine for treating cancer and has subsequently been isolated from the fruit kernels of Ximenia americana. Riproximin is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines with IC50 in the nanomolar range. For example, the breast cancer MCF7 cells showed >500-fold higher sensitivity than the non-tumorigenic breast epithelium MCF10A cells (3Bayer H. Ey N. Wattenberg A. Voss C. Berger M.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2011; 82: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This remarkable potency and selectivity prompted us to examine the molecular mechanisms of cell targeting in more detail. Riproximin belongs to type II of the cytotoxic ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) 3The abbreviations used are: RIPribosome-inactivating proteinaBSMasialo-bovine submaxillary mucinaOSMasialo-ovine submaxillary mucinASFasialofetuinBSMbovine submaxillary mucinFetfetuinLacNAcN-acetyl-d-lactosamineNAsialyl-free complex N-glycanNA2biantennary complex N-glycanNA3triantennary complex N-glycanOSMovine submaxillary mucinTnsingle O-linked GalNAcTn3three consecutive O-linked GalNAcMTT3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideCGcell growthGPglycoproteinRpxriproximinIRCinhibition of riproximin cytotoxicityMUCmucinCEAcarcinoembryonic antigen.

Several members of this family were investigated as potential antineoplastic agents, most prominently ricin. The mechanism of action of the RIP family of proteins involves two key steps represented by the A- and B-chains of the protein. First, the B-chain, a lectin, binds to cell surface glycans, resulting in internalization of the RIP. Within the cell, the A-chain, an rRNA N-glycosidase, depurinates the 28S RNA, leading to transcriptional arrest and eventually cell death (5Endo Y. Tsurugi K. The RNA N-glycosidase activity of ricin A-chain. The characteristics of the enzymatic activity of ricin A-chain with ribosomes and with rRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the mode of action also involves the induction of the unfolded protein response (6Horrix C. Raviv Z. Flescher E. Voss C. Berger M.R. Plant ribosome-inactivating proteins type II induce the unfolded protein response in human cancer cells.Cell Mol.

The cellular patterns of cytotoxicity and in vivo toxicity of a particular RIP are primarily determined by its binding and internalization efficiency (7Girbes T. Ferreras J.M. Arias F.J. Muñoz R.

Occurrence, cellular and molecular activities, and potential uses.Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 537-545PubMed Google Scholar). Several types of biomolecules, such as glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, proteoglycans, or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, contribute to a cell surface glycosylation pattern (8Reis C.A.

Investigations of the glycan structures from malignant tissues showed that the tumor-associated glycosylation significantly differs from that of normal tissues. Mucins showing aberrant O-glycosylation are a typical feature of epithelia-derived cancer (8Reis C.A. Osorio H. Silva L. Gomes C. David L. Alterations in glycosylation as biomarkers for cancer detection.J. Clin. Pathol. 2010; 63: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). N-Glycans are significantly altered in cancer too (10Arnold J.N. Saldova R. Hamid U.M. Rudd P.M.

The first attempts to use ricin as a cancer therapeutic were based on its higher cytotoxicity in transformed cells (16Lin J.Y. Tserng K.Y. Chen C.C. Lin L.T. Tung T.C. Abrin and ricin. New anti-tumor substances.Nature. 1970; 227: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), a mechanism that today would be called “targeted toward cancer-related glycostructures.” Its development, however, failed due to unexpectedly high toxicity (17Fodstad O. Kvalheim G. Godal A. Lotsberg J. Aamdal S. Høst H. Pihl A. Phase I study of the plant protein ricin.Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 862-865PubMed Google Scholar). Riproximin showed potent antineoplastic activity that might be derived from its glycan binding profile. The aim of this study was to identify the glycans that function as binding receptors for riproximin and are thus responsible for its tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Using a glycan microarray, riproximin was found to specifically bind to two types of glycans, the N-glycan structures NA2/NA3 and the Tn antigen, a prominent cancer-related O-glycan. The mechanism of binding of lectins to multivalent globular and linear glycoproteins was recently elucidated (18Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Multivalent lectin-carbohydrate interactions energetics and mechanisms of binding.Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2010; 63: 139-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both the interaction of Gal-binding galectins with multiple NA3 structures on ASF (19Dam T.K. Gabius H.J. André S. Kaltner H. Lensch M. Brewer C.F. Galectins bind to the multivalent glycoprotein asialofetuin with enhanced affinities and a gradient of decreasing binding constants.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12564-12571Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and that of GalNAc-binding soybean agglutinin with Tn on Tn-rich porcine submaxillary mucin (20Dam T.K. Gerken T.A. Cavada B.S. Nascimento K.S. Moura T.R. Brewer C.F. Binding studies of α-GalNAc-specific lectins to the alpha-GalNAc (Tn-antigen) form of porcine submaxillary mucin and its smaller fragments.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28256-28263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were described as depending on bind-and-jump and negative cooperativity effects. Using similar model glycoproteins, the mechanism of riproximin interaction with its glycotargets and implications for its cytotoxicity were investigated. Riproximin was purified from Ximenia americana fruit kernels as described before (3Bayer H. Ey N. Wattenberg A. Voss C. Berger M.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2011; 82: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In short, the purification procedure included an initial aqueous extraction of proteins from the crude kernel material, removal of lipids with chloroform, and subsequent chromatographic purification on a strong anion exchange resin and lactosyl-Sepharose. For detection, riproximin was fluorescently labeled with an amine-reactive, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-activated dye (DyLight 549, Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, washed, and concentrated (molecular weight cut-off, 10,000) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with 200 mm NaCl. Fluorescently labeled riproximin was additionally purified on a lactosyl-Sepharose column (Lactosyl Sepharose 4 Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) as described before (3Bayer H. Ey N. Wattenberg A. Voss C. Berger M.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2011; 82: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to exclude all conjugates with blocked binding sites. The eluate fractions were concentrated (molecular weight cut-off 10,000), and the protein content was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm. Integrity and biological activity of the labeled riproximin were controlled by SDS-PAGE and by a cell viability assay with HeLa cells, respectively (see below). The dye payload was determined from the UV-visible spectrum. The carbohydrate microarrays were prepared as described previously, with the following modifications (21Oyelaran O. Li Q. Farnsworth D. Gildersleeve J.C. Microarrays with varying carbohydrate density reveal distinct subpopulations of serum antibodies.J. Proteome. Res. 2009; 8: 3529-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Wang D. Liu S. Trummer B.J. Deng C. Wang A. Carbohydrate microarrays for the recognition of cross-reactive molecular markers of microbes and host cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The array contained 157 components, including 97 different defined synthetic carbohydrates as bovine serum albumin (BSA) or human serum albumin conjugates, 28 synthetic glycopeptides, and 32 natural glycoproteins. For a list of the carbohydrate structures, see supplemental Table 1. Samples were printed in duplicate on SuperEpoxy 2 Protein glass slides (TeleChem International, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) using a Biorobotics MicroGrid II microarrayer (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) fitted with Stealth pins (Telechem International; catalog no. SMP3, which produce ∼100-μm spots). Relative humidity within the printing chamber was maintained at >50%. Due to the small footprint of a single array (4.5 × 4.5 mm), 16 copies of the full array could be printed onto each glass slide. Printed glass slides were stored at −20 °C until use. Riproximin binding was evaluated using minor modifications of the previously reported protocol (21Oyelaran O. Li Q. Farnsworth D. Gildersleeve J.C. Microarrays with varying carbohydrate density reveal distinct subpopulations of serum antibodies.J. Proteome. Res. 2009; 8: 3529-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Campbell C.T. Zhang Y. Gildersleeve J.C. Curr. Protocols Chem. Biol. 2010; 2: 37-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were fitted with a 16-well module (Grace Bio-Labs) to physically separate the 16 printed copies of the array. Each well was blocked with 3% BSA (200 μl/well; immunoglobulin-free BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h. DyLight-labeled riproximin was diluted 1:25 in 3% BSA in PBS and then incubated on the array (75 μl/well) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. After washing six times with PBS, the well module was disassembled, and the slide was incubated in PBS for 5 min. The slide was centrifuged at 453 × g for 5 min and then scanned using a GenePix Scanner 4000A (Molecular Devices Corp., Union City, CA). Slides were scanned at 10 μm resolution, and image analysis was carried out with GenePix Pro 6.0 analysis software (Molecular Devices Corp.). The fluorescent spots were defined as circular regions of interest with a diameter of 100 μm. Regions of interest were allowed to be adapted to the actual feature size by ±30 μm. After local background subtraction, the median pixel intensity of regions of interest was used to obtain a single fluorescence value for each spot. The mean value of the two replicate spots was used as the final value for each array component. To investigate the competitive binding of riproximin with Tn3 structures, riproximin was incubated with 60 μg/ml Tn3-BSA (15 Tn3 molecules/BSA molecule) in 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h prior to the incubation of the mixture on the carbohydrate microarray. Asialo-bovine submaxillary mucin (aBSM) was prepared by incubating 9 mg/ml BSM with 28 milliunits/mg neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 3 h at 37 °C. As a control, the same amount of BSM was incubated in buffer without neuraminidase. The degree of desialylation was monitored by dot blot analysis using biotinylated wheat germ agglutinin (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). For cell culture experiments, aBSM and BSM control samples were filter-sterilized (0.45 μm). BSM sample concentrations were determined using the Glycoprotein Carbohydrate Estimation Kit (Thermo Scientific, Pierce) and a BSM standard curve. The BSM sample concentration was also used to estimate the aBSM concentrations because the desialylation procedure created additional reducing ends, which interfered with the measurement. To deglycosylate ASF, 6 μg/μl glycoprotein was incubated for 5 min at 100 °C in denaturing buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was cooled on ice, and 0.75% (v/v) Triton X-100 as well as 1 μl of N-glycosidase F (5000 units/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) were added subsequently. The control reaction contained no N-glycosidase. Reaction mixtures were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Protein deglycosylation was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Glycoproteins were serially diluted in PBS, and 1 μl of each dilution was spotted onto a nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Whatman Protran, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was dried at room temperature and blocked with 5% BSA. The membrane was probed with riproximin (30 μg/ml in 5% BSA) followed by an anti-riproximin monoclonal mouse antibody (mRpx-Ab 62). HRP-linked, human preadsorbed goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used for detection. The isolation of N-glycans from asialofetuin and fetuin was performed according to Karg et al. (24Karg S.R. Frey A.D. Ferrara C. Streich D.K. Umaña P. Kallio P.T. A small-scale method for the preparation of plant N-linked glycans from soluble proteins for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2009; 47: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 100 mg/ml glycoprotein was digested with 110 milliunits/μl pepsin (Roche Applied Science) in 10 mm HCl for 48 h at 37 °C. Pepsin was inactivated by raising the pH above 5.0 with NaOH. The samples were buffered with sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2 (final concentration 100 mm). Peptide-N-glycosidase F (Sigma-Aldrich) was subsequently added, and the sample was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Free N-glycans and smaller peptides were separated by ultrafiltration on membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 30,000. To remove the peptides, the glycans were additionally purified on C18 resin (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) spin columns, which were prepared using 30 μl of resin per column prewashed with ethanol followed by H2O. The N-glycan/peptide mixtures were added to the spin columns, incubated for 5 min, and centrifuged. The eluates were subsequently desalted on a cation exchange resin (AG 50W-X8, hydrogen form, 100–200 mesh; Bio-Rad). For this step, the resin was washed with H2O before transferring 0.6 ml to an empty spin column and drying the resin by centrifugation. The N-glycan- containing eluates were loaded onto the resin, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and eluted by centrifugation. The N-glycan samples were dried in a SpeedVac and stored at 4 °C. Glycoprotein binding assays were performed using Immuno 96 MicroWell solid plates (Maxisorp, NUNC, Langenselbold, Germany) coated with 1 μg/ml ASF or aBSM in PBS, respectively. After blocking with 5% BSA in PBS, a 1-h preincubated mixture of riproximin and serially diluted glycoprotein was added. Riproximin was detected using the monoclonal riproximin antibody Rpx-mAb 62, followed by an HRP-coupled, human preadsorbed anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Binding was colorimetrically measured using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. When ASF binding was assessed, 5% milk in PBS was used for blocking, and an ovine anti-bovine asialofetuin IgG (AbD Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany) followed by HRP-linked anti-sheep antibody was used for detection. Binding signals of 2–3 replicates were averaged and plotted. Concentration-response curves were fitted using the log-logistic model. To directly refer the potential inhibition effects of the glycoproteins to the relative number of carbohydrate structures, the number of N-acetyl-d-lactosamine (LacNAc) and Tn (GalNAc) residues per ASF and aBSM was estimated as follows. For ASF, a molecular mass of 48 kDa and three NA3s resulting in nine terminal LacNAc residues were used for calculation. For aBSM, a molecular mass of 400 kDa was assumed (25Downs F. Pigman W. Preparation of glycopeptides from bovine submaxillary mucin by chemical degradation.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Tettamanti G. Pigman W. Purification and characterization of bovine and ovine submaxillary mucins.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 124: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). 920 GalNAc residues/molecule were estimated for aBSM based on data available for porcine submaxillary mucin, which possesses a molecular mass of 106 Da with ∼2300 GalNAc residues/molecule (20Dam T.K. Gerken T.A. Cavada B.S. Nascimento K.S. Moura T.R. Brewer C.F. Binding studies of α-GalNAc-specific lectins to the alpha-GalNAc (Tn-antigen) form of porcine submaxillary mucin and its smaller fragments.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28256-28263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For desialylation of the cell surface, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, or HeLa cells were seeded into microplates and allowed to settle down overnight. Neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science) was diluted into medium without FCS to a concentration of 1 milliunit in 50 μl. FCS-containing medium was removed from the cells and replaced by the neuraminidase-containing FCS-free medium. Control cells received FCS free medium without neuraminidase. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, neuraminidase-containing and control media were replaced by fresh FCS-containing medium, and the cells were treated with serial dilutions of riproximin. Cell viability was tested with the 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after 72 h of incubation (see below). Three independent experiments were performed for cells in which an effect of neuraminidase exposure was observed on riproximin cytotoxicity. For the analysis, neuraminidase-pretreated cells (Neu+/Rpx) and control cells (Neu−/Rpx) were analyzed as two separate groups. For each experiment, antiproliferative activity was measured in triplicate for each riproximin concentration as well as for cells treated with solvent control. Observed antiproliferative activity response values were normalized to mean values of solvent control cells and averaged per riproximin concentration. For each treatment group, the four-parameter log-logistic model (27Lee J.J. Kong M. Confidence intervals of interaction index for assessing multiple drug interaction.Stat. Biopharm. Res. 2009; 1: 4-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was fitted to the averaged normalized antiproliferative activity values. From each of the two fitted antiproliferative activity curves, the IC50 value, defining the concentration that produces 50% of the responsive maximal cytotoxic effect of riproximin, was estimated. The ratio of the two IC50 estimates (i.e. (IC50 Neu−/Rpx)/(IC50 Neu+/Rpx)) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval were computed to assess statistical significance. The IC50 shift was considered significant when the IC50 ratio explicitly differed from a value of 1 and the respective 95% confidence interval did not include the value 1. The cytotoxic activity of riproximin was assessed using the MTT cell viability assay on HeLa, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cell lines. Cells were propagated in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C in medium that was supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For the assay, the cells were seeded into microplates (2500 cells/well for HeLa, 3000 cells/well for MDA-MB-231, 3500 cells/well for MCF7) and allowed to settle down overnight. To analyze the influence of single glycoproteins, serial dilutions of the glycoproteins ASF, Fet, aBSM, and BSM were added to the cells prior to the addition of riproximin in a concentration corresponding to its IC50 (HeLa, 0.14 ng/ml; MCF7, 0.10 ng/ml; MDA-MB-231, 0.75 ng/ml). Plates were incubated for 72 h, and the cell growth (CG) was determined by the MTT method. To investigate the inhibitory effect of the glycoprotein-derived N-glycans alone, the HeLa cells were treated with N-glycans obtained from ASF and Fet by peptide-N-glycosidase F treatment (see above). The glycan effect on the cytotoxicity of riproximin was correlated to the originating protein amount that had been used for deglycosylation. For data analysis, the inhibitory effect of the single glycoproteins (GP) on riproximin (Rpx) cytotoxicity (inhibition of riproximin cytotoxicity (IRC) (%)) was calculated as (CGGP/Rpx − CGRpx)/(100 − CGRpx) × 100. Both values, the CGGP/Rpx (average cell growth with glycoprotein and riproximin) and CGRpx (average cell growth with riproximin alone), were normalized to the respective control without riproximin treatment. Computed IRC values were averaged for every glycoprotein concentration. Inverse cell viability curves were determined for each single glycoprotein by fitting the four-parameter log-logistic model (27Lee J.J. Kong M. Confidence intervals of interaction index for assessing multiple drug interaction.Stat. Biopharm. Res. 2009; 1: 4-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IRC50 value determined from the curve depicts the glycoprotein concentration that inhibits 50% of the riproximin cytotoxicity. Accordingly, IRC25 and IRC75 values describe the concentrations inhibiting 25 and 75% of the riproximin cytotoxicity. Statistical two-way analysis of variance with interaction was conducted to assess significance. The effects of the independent factors “group” (i.e. native versus analogical desialylated glycoprotein) and “concentration” (i.e. the concentration of the glycoprotein) as well as the interaction effect between group and concentration on calculated average IRC values (dependent model variable) were studied by performing corresponding global F-tests. Analysis of variance was carried out on a significance level of 5% (i.e. p values of p ≤ 0.05 obtained in the F-tests were regarded as statistically significant). For the investigation of ASF and aBSM in combination, different concentrations of these glycoproteins were combined according to the inhibiting effect of the single proteins. Concentrations corresponding to the IRC25, IRC50, and IRC75 of ASF were combined with aBSM concentrations corresponding to IRC75, IRC50, and IRC25, respectively, resulting in the initial concentration for each combination. Serial dilutions of all three combinations were added to the cells prior to the treatment of the cells with riproximin, as described above. Four MTT viability experiments were performed for each of the three combinations. Data analysis was performed as for the experiments with the single glycoproteins (see above). To circumvent potential problems due to negative or >100% IRC, the model parameters of the lower and upper curve asymptotes were constrained to be ≥0 and ≤100, respectively. Combination indices (CIs) were used to assess the effect of each combination of ASF and aBSM on riproximin cytotoxicity. CIs and the corresponding pointwise 95% confidence bounds were computed for theoretical IRC values ranging between 0.01 and 0.99 (i.e. between 1 and 99%), with a step size of Δ = 0.005 between two neighboring theoretical IRC values, as described by Lee and Kong (27Lee J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2050254694,"Separase, an endopeptidase required for the separation of sister-chromatides in mitotic anaphase, triggers centriole disengagement during centrosome duplication. In cancer, separase is frequently overexpressed, pointing to a functional role as an aneuploidy promoter associated with centrosomal amplification and genomic instability. Recently, we have shown that centrosomal amplification and subsequent chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), increasing from chronic phase (CP) toward blast crisis (BC). Moreover, a functional linkage of p210BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity with centrosomal amplification and clonal evolution has been established in long-term cell culture experiments. Unexpectedly, therapeutic doses of imatinib (IM) did not counteract; instead induced similar centrosomal alterations in vitro. We investigated the influence of IM and p210BCR-ABL on Separase as a potential driver of centrosomal amplification in CML. Short-term cell cultures of p210BCR-ABL-negative (NHDF, UROtsa, HL-60, U937), positive (K562, LAMA-84) and inducible (U937p210BCR-ABL/c6 (Tet-ON)) human cell lines were treated with therapeutic doses of IM and analyzed by qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis and quantitative Separase activity assays. Decreased Separase protein levels were observed in all cells treated with IM in a dose dependent manner. Accordingly, in all p210BCR-ABL-negative cell lines, decreased proteolytic activity of Separase was found. In contrast, p210BCR-ABL-positive cells showed increased Separase proteolytic activity. This activation of Separase was consistent with changes in the expression levels of Separase regulators (Separase phosphorylation at serine residue 1126, Securin, CyclinB1 and PP2A). Our data suggest that regulation of Separase in IM-treated BCR-ABL-positive cells occurs on both the protein expression and the proteolytic activity levels. Activation of Separase proteolytic activity exclusively in p210BCR-ABL-positive cells during IM treatment may act as a driving force for centrosomal amplification, contributing to genomic instability, clonal evolution and resistance in CML."
https://openalex.org/W1970871353,"The molecular mechanisms of neuronal morphology and synaptic vesicle transport have been largely elusive, and only a few of the molecules involved in these processes have been identified. Here, we developed a novel morphology-based gene trap method, which is theoretically applicable to all cell lines, to easily and rapidly identify the responsible genes. Using this method, we selected several gene-trapped clones of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, which displayed abnormal morphology and distribution of synaptic vesicle-like microvesicles (SLMVs). We identified several genes responsible for the phenotypes and analyzed three genes in more detail. The first gene was BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 9 (Btbd9), which is associated with restless legs syndrome. The second gene was cytokine receptor-like factor 3 (Crlf3), whose involvement in the nervous system remains unknown. The third gene was single-stranded DNA-binding protein 3 (Ssbp3), a gene known to regulate head morphogenesis. These results suggest that Btbd9, Crlf3, and Ssbp3 regulate neuronal morphology and the biogenesis/transport of synaptic vesicles. Because our novel morphology-based gene trap method is generally applicable, this method is promising for uncovering novel genes involved in the function of interest in any cell lines.—Hashimoto, Y., Muramatsu, K., Kunii, M., Yoshimura, S., Yamada, M., Sato, T., Ishida, Y., Harada, R., Harada, A.

https://openalex.org/W1978755844,"Of the TRIM/RBCC family proteins taking part in a variety of cellular processes, TRIM50 is a stomach-specific member with no defined biological function. Our biochemical data demonstrated that TRIM50 is specifically expressed in gastric parietal cells and is predominantly localized in the tubulovesicular and canalicular membranes. In cultured cells ectopically expressing GFP-TRIM50, confocal microscopic imaging revealed dynamic movement of TRIM50-associated vesicles in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner. A protein overlay assay detected preferential binding of the PRY-SPRY domain from the TRIM50 C-terminal region to phosphatidylinositol species, suggesting that TRIM50 is involved in vesicular dynamics by sensing the phosphorylated state of phosphoinositol lipids. Trim50 knock-out mice retained normal histology in the gastric mucosa but exhibited impaired secretion of gastric acid. In response to histamine, Trim50 knock-out parietal cells generated deranged canaliculi, swollen microvilli lacking actin filaments, and excess multilamellar membrane complexes. Therefore, TRIM50 seems to play an essential role in tubulovesicular dynamics, promoting the formation of sophisticated canaliculi and microvilli during acid secretion in parietal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2016814625,"Chronic hepatitis (CH) is common in dogs in the United Kingdom. An increased prevalence of the disease is seen in the English Springer spaniel (ESS), and this breed suffer from a severe form with young to middle aged female dogs being predisposed. The disease shares histological features with those of human viral hepatitis, although the specific aetiological agent has not yet been identified. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) class II alleles and haplotypes are associated with susceptibility/resistance to CH in the ESS. Sequence-based genotyping of the polymorphic exon 2 from DLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 class II loci were performed in 66 ESSs with CH and 84 healthy controls. There was a significant difference in the distribution of the protective alleles DRB1*00501 (3.0% vs. 12.0%, odds ratio [OR] = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06-0.74) and DQB1*00501 (3.8% vs. 12.0%, OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09-0.85) between cases and controls. The haplotype DLA-DRB1*00501/DQA1*00301/DQB1*00501 was present in 11.9% of controls and 3.0% of cases and was significantly associated with protection against disease development (OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.08-0.80). There was a significant difference in the distribution of the risk alleles DRB1*00601 (14.4% vs. 6.5%, OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.10-5.63) and DQB1*00701 (14.4% vs. 6.5%, OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.10-5.63) between cases and controls. A risk haplotype (DLA-DRB1*00601/DQA1*005011/DQB1*00701) was present in 14.4% of cases and 6.5% of controls and conferred an elevated risk of developing CH with an OR of 3.13 (95% CI = 1.20-8.26). These results demonstrate that DLA class II is significantly associated with risk and protection from developing CH in ESSs."

The nature of cobalamin-binding proteins in lower vertebrates remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to characterize the cobalamin-binding proteins of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and to compare their properties with those of the three human cobalamin-binding proteins. High cobalamin-binding capacity was found in trout stomach (210 pmol/g), roe (400 pmol/g), roe fluid (390 nmol/liter), and plasma (2500 nmol/liter). In all cases, it appeared to be the same protein based on analysis of partial sequences and immunological responses. The trout cobalamin-binding protein was purified from roe fluid, sequenced, and further characterized. Like haptocorrin, the trout cobalamin-binding protein was stable at low pH and had a high binding affinity for the cobalamin analog cobinamide. Like haptocorrin and transcobalamin, the trout cobalamin-binding protein was present in plasma and recognized ligands with altered nucleotide moiety. Like intrinsic factors, the trout cobalamin-binding protein was present in the stomach and resisted degradation by trypsin and chymotrypsin. It also resembled intrinsic factor in the composition of conserved residues in the primary cobalamin-binding site in the C terminus. The trout cobalamin-binding protein was glycosylated and displayed spectral properties comparable with those of haptocorrin and intrinsic factor. In conclusion, only one soluble cobalamin-binding protein was identified in the rainbow trout, a protein that structurally behaves like an intermediate between the three human cobalamin-binding proteins.

In this method, cells are cultivated on an alginate layer in a culture dish and released by spot application of a calcium chelate buffer that locally melts the alginate layer and enables the collection of cultured cells at the single-cell level. Primary hippocampal neurons, beating human embryonic stem (hES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes, and beating hES cell-derived cardiomyocyte clusters cultivated on an alginate layer were successfully released and collected with a micropipette. The collected cells were recultured while maintaining their physiological function, including beating, and elongated neurites. These results suggest that the proposed method may eventually facilitate the transplantation of ES- or iPS-derived cardiomyocytes and neurons differentiated in culture."
