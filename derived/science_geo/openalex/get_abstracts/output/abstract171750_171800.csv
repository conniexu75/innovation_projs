https://openalex.org/W1983605684,"Granular superconductivity occurs when microscopic superconducting grains are separated by non-superconducting regions through which they communicate by Josephson tunneling to establish the macroscopic superconducting state [1]. Although crystals of the cuprate high-Tc superconductors are not granular in a structural sense, theory indicates that at low hole densities the holes can become concentrated at some locations resulting in hole-rich superconducting domains [2-5]. Granular superconductivity due to Josephson tunneling through 'undoped' regions between such domains would represent a new paradigm for the underdoped cuprates. Here we report studies of the spatial interrelationships between STM tunneling spectra in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. They reveal an apparent spatial segregation of the electronic structure into ~3nm diameter domains (with superconducting characteristics and local energy gap delta<50 meV) in an electronically distinct background. To explore whether this represents nanoscale segregation of two distinct electronic phases, we employ scattering-resonances at Ni impurity atoms [6] as 'markers' for the local existence of superconductivity [7-9]. No Ni-resonances are detected in any regions where delta>50(2.5) meV. These observations suggest that underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is a mixture of two different short-range electronic orders with the long-range characteristics of a granular superconductor."

https://openalex.org/W2054901058,"Most plants are known as C3 plants because the first product of photosynthetic CO2 fixation is a three-carbon compound. C4 plants, which use an alternative pathway in which the first product is a four-carbon compound, have evolved independently many times and are found in at least 18 families. In addition to differences in their biochemistry, photosynthetic organs of C4 plants show alterations in their anatomy and ultrastructure. Little is known about whether the biochemical or anatomical characteristics of C4 photosynthesis evolved first. Here we report that tobacco, a typical C3 plant, shows characteristics of C4 photosynthesis in cells of stems and petioles that surround the xylem and phloem, and that these cells are supplied with carbon for photosynthesis from the vascular system and not from stomata. These photosynthetic cells possess high activities of enzymes characteristic of C4 photosynthesis, which allow the decarboxylation of four-carbon organic acids from the xylem and phloem, thus releasing CO2 for photosynthesis. These biochemical characteristics of C4 photosynthesis in cells around the vascular bundles of stems of C3 plants might explain why C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently many times."

We reported the association of interleukin-1 gene cluster polymorphisms suspected of enhancing production of interleukin-1 β with an increased risk both of hypochlorhydria induced by Helicobacter pylori and of gastric cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2140721790,"Using patch clamp techniques, we found that the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in the apical membrane of A6 distal nephron cells showed a sudden rundown beginning at 4 min after forming the inside-out configuration. This sudden rundown was prevented by addition of anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), and phosphatidylserine (PS) to the “cytoplasmic” bath. Conversely, chelation of endogenous PIP2 with anti-PIP2 antibody, hydrolysis of PIP2 with either exogenous phospholipase C (PLC) or activation of endogenous PLC by extracellular ATP, or application of the positively charged molecule, poly-l-lysine, accelerated channel rundown. However, neutral phosphatidylcholine had no effect on ENaC activity. By two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, we demonstrated that PIP2 and PIP3 significantly increased amiloride-sensitive current in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNAs of rat α-, β-, and γ-ENaC. However, PIP2 and PIP3 did not affect surface expression of ENaC, indicating that PIP2 and PIP3 regulate ENaC at the level of the inner plasma membrane through a mechanism that is independent of ENaC trafficking. These data suggest that anionic phospholipids may mediate the regulation of ENaC by PLC- or phosphoinositide 3-kinase-coupled receptors.

Anionic phospholipids are normally located in the inner leaflet to form a negatively charged surface. However, whether the phospholipid asymmetry affects the function of membrane proteins remains largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that one of the anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2),1regulates Na+-Ca2+ exchangers and ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels (1Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 2Hilgemann D.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 193-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Convincing evidence suggests that PIP2 directly interacts with the proximal COOH terminus of inward-rectifier K+ channels (3Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Not only PIP2, but also other negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4-P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), regulate KATPchannels (4Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 5Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). A model for the regulation of KATPchannels by anionic phospholipids has been proposed, which argues that the negatively charged head group of PIP2, PI-4-P, or PIP3 locks the positively charged carboxyl terminus of KATP channels at a certain position, resulting in the failure of ATP binding to the terminus (6Ashcroft F.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1059-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model raises an interesting question: can anionic phospholipids interact with the positively charged cytoplasmic termini of other ion channels? The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) plays a very important role in regulating total body Na+ homeostasis. Recent studies suggest that PIP2 stimulates ENaC in A6 cells (7Yue G. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14 (abstr.): A340Google Scholar) and that a decrease in PIP2 concentration may account for the inhibition of ENaC by luminal purinergic P2Y receptors (8Ma H.-P. Li L. Zhou Z.-H. Eaton D.C. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F501-F505Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is known that ENaC consists of three subunits designated α, β, and γ (9Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). By examining the first 50 amino acids of the NH2-terminal tails of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC, we found that the NH2-terminal tails of β- and γ-ENaC, but not of α-ENaC, contain significant numbers of positive charges. In fact, the P3geKiKaKiKKnL15 sequence in the γ subunit NH2 terminus is very similar to the pleckstrin homology domain in PLC-δ1 (10Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that these positive charges might interact with anionic phospholipids of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to modulate ENaC activity. Previous studies have shown that deletion of the NH2-terminal tails of β-ENaC (Δ2–49) and γ-ENaC (Δ2–53), but not the NH2-terminal tail of α-ENaC (Δ2–46), dramatically reduces ENaC activity (11Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32889-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that the positively charged NH2-terminal tails of β- and γ-ENaC play an important role in regulating ENaC activity. It has been shown that positively charged poly-l-lysine partially reversed the effect of PIP2 on KATP channels (12Koster J.C. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that positively charged agents may compete with the positively charged COOH terminus of KATP channels for binding to PIP2. Similarly, the positively charged NH2-terminal tails of β- and γ-ENaC could be physically “locked” by negatively charged phospholipids to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This putative interaction may account for the role of the NH2-terminal tails of β- and γ-ENaC in regulation ENaC activity (11Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32889-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present study aims to determine whether anionic phospholipids such as PIP2, PIP3, and PS regulate ENaC activity. A6 distal nephron cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) at passage 68. The cells were cultured in a plastic flask in a modified NCTC-109 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μm aldosterone (Sigma) at 26 °C and 4% CO2. Cells from passages 72–82 were removed from the flasks and plated on permeable supports attached to Snapwell inserts from Corning Costar Co. The permeable supports were coated with rat-tail collagen according to the protocol that is used by Corning Costar Co. The cells were cultured on permeable supports for 10–14 days before patch clamp recordings, as we reported previously (13Ma H. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F798-F805PubMed Google Scholar). Most chemicals, including phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC, adenosine 5′-triphosphate, PS, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and poly-l-lysine were obtained from Sigma. PIP2, PIP3, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture were purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-PIP2 antibody was from Assay Designs. NaCl bath solution contained (in mm): 100 NaCl, 3.4 KCI, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, at a pH of 7.4. KCl bath solution contained (in mm): 100 KCI, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 50 nm Ca2+(after titration with 2 mm EGTA), at a pH of 7.4. All the concentrations throughout this article are shown as the final concentration. Immediately before use, a Snapwell insert was thoroughly washed with NaCl bath solution (see “Chemicals and Solutions”) and transferred into the patch chamber mounted in the stage of a Leitz inverted microscope. Using patch clamp techniques, inside-out recordings were established on the apical membrane of A6 cells with polished micropipettes with tip resistance of 2.5–5 megaohms. Under the above culture conditions, a patch seal (seal resistance > 20 gigaohms) was usually formed after releasing positive pressure in the patch pipette or after applying a slightly negative pressure. After establishing the cell-attached mode, only patches containing channel activity without base-line drift were used for experiments. Before forming inside-out patches, NaCl bath solution in the patch chamber was replaced with KCl bath solution. Single-channel currents were obtained with +40-mV applied pipette potential (i.e. V m = −40 mV), filtered at 1 kHz, and recorded on video tapes with a modified Sony PCM video converter (Vetter Instruments). Before digitization with pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments), single-channel records were low-pass filtered at 100 Hz. The total numbers of functional channels (N) in the patch were estimate by observing the number of peaks detected on the current amplitude histograms. As a measure of channel activity, NP o (number of channels × the open probability, P o) was calculated by using at least 2 min of a single-channel record as we described previously (13Ma H. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F798-F805PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted at 22–23 °C. Oocytes were excised from adult female Xenopus frogs and treated with collagenase. Stage V-VI oocytes were injected with cRNAs for wild-type α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits and then were incubated at 18 °C in modified Leibovitz medium. Electrophysiological recordings were performed 24–48 h after the injections using two microelectrodes filled with 3 mm KCl and inserted into the oocyte, as we described previously (14Tucker J.K. Tamba K. Lee Y.J. Shen L.L. Warnock D.G. Oh Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1081-C1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A voltage step protocol from −120 to +40 mV in increments of 20 mV was used. Between voltage steps the membrane was voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −40 mV. The macroscopic ENaC currents were verified by application of 10 μm amiloride to the bath. The net amiloride-sensitive currents were used to represent ENaC activity. After recording control ENaC currents, the oocytes were taken out of the chamber and injected with 1 μl of H2O, PIP2 (30 μm), or PIP3 (30 μm), respectively. Phosphatase inhibitor mixture (2 μm) was included in each injection. 30 min after these injections, amiloride-sensitive currents were re-measured in these oocytes and compared with the currents before these injections. Using confocal microscopy, the surface expression of ENaC after each experimental manipulation was evaluated; rat β and γ-ENaC subunits were tagged in the extracellular loops with the FLAGTM epitope (DYKDDDDK), which can be recognized by M2 monoclonal antibody, as described previously (15Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged β-, γ-, and α-ENaC cRNAs were injected into Xenopusoocytes. Fluorescent imaging analysis of the expression level by confocal microscopy was carried out, as we described previously (16Saxena S. Quick M.W. Tousson A. Oh Y. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20812-20817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The oocytes were then secondarily injected with H2O, PIP2, or PIP3 as described above. The effects of PIP2 and PIP3 on ENaC surface expression were evaluated using the confocal fluorescent imaging methods. A paired t test or analysis of variance for multiple comparisons was used for statistical analysis, as we described previously (13Ma H. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F798-F805PubMed Google Scholar). A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The G protein-coupled P2Y2 receptor is expressed in renal epithelial cells (17Zambon A.C. Hughes R.J. Meszaros J.G. Wu J.J. Torres B. Brunton L.L. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F1045-F1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that ATP inhibits ENaC via a PLC-dependent pathway in A6 cells (8Ma H.-P. Li L. Zhou Z.-H. Eaton D.C. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F501-F505Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is well known that activation of PLC hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate IP3 and diacylglycerol and subsequently mobilizes [Ca2+]i. However, recent studies suggest that inhibition of Na+ absorption by the P2Y2receptor occurs independently of an increase in [Ca2+]i (18Lehrmann H. Thomas J. Kim S.J. Jacobi C. Leipziger J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that a decrease in PIP2 concentration might mediate the P2Y2 receptor-induced inhibition of ENaC. To test this hypothesis, inside-out patch experiments were performed as shown in Fig. 1. We found that ENaC activity in inside-out patches was stable for the initial 4 min. However, a sudden rundown occurred during the period from 4 to 5 min. Interestingly, the channel rundown was clearly prevented when the “cytoplasmic” bath contained 5 μm PIP2. In contrast, application of 100 nm anti-PIP2 antibody to the cytoplasmic bath to chelate endogenous PIP2significantly accelerated the rundown process. Application of exogenous PLC (0.5 unit/ml) to the cytoplasmic bath, which could hydrolyze PIP2, also accelerated the rundown. Furthermore, application of 100 μm ATP in the patch pipette, which presumably activates endogenous PLC, reduced ENaC activity as we recently observed in cell-attached patches (8Ma H.-P. Li L. Zhou Z.-H. Eaton D.C. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F501-F505Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The initial values ofNP o in the ATP experiments were much lower than the values in other group experiments. We argue that the inhibition of ENaC already occurred before forming the inside-out configuration, because the effect of ATP occurred when the patch pipette was attached to the cell membrane. These data suggest that a decrease in PIP2 concentration at the inner membrane leaflet appears to mediate the inhibition of ENaC by the P2Y2 receptor. It is known that KATP channels are not only regulated by PIP2, but also by PIP3 (4Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, the role of PIP3 has been neglected, because the plasma membrane does not contain PIP3 under normal conditions. Nevertheless, PIP3 can be generated by activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Interestingly, recent studies have shown that both aldosterone and insulin enhance Na+transport by activating PI 3-kinase in A6 cells and that inhibition of PI 3-kinase will block their stimulatory effect on ENaC activity (19Blazer-Yost B.L. Paunescu T.G. Helman S.I. Lee K.D. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C531-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Paunescu T.G. Blazer-Yost B.L. Vlahos C.J. Helman S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C236-C247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Record R.D. Froelich L.L. Vlahos C.J. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E611-E617PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether PIP3 could affect ENaC activity, the inside-out patch configuration was used. Consistent with the results as shown in Fig. 1, ENaC activity in inside-out patches was steady during the initial 4–5 min before a sudden rundown occurred. In contrast, the channel activity was maintained without rundown when the cytoplasmic bath contained 5 μm PIP3 (Fig.2). Because the concentration of PIP3 is elevated in response to aldosterone (19Blazer-Yost B.L. Paunescu T.G. Helman S.I. Lee K.D. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C531-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of PIP3 on ENaC activity may account in part for the regulation of ENaC by aldosterone. To test whether other anionic phospholipids can also regulate ENaC activity, inside-out patches were examined when negatively charged PS (20 μm) was applied to the cytoplasmic bath. Similar to the effect of PIP2 and PIP3, anionic PS also prevented ENaC rundown, suggesting that the effect of phospholipids on ENaC activity may be related to their anionic composition. To test whether negative charges are important for the effect of PIP2, PIP3, and PS on ENaC activity, the effect of the positively charged molecule, poly-l-lysine, on ENaC activity was examined. It appears that addition of poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) accelerated ENaC rundown. However, neutral PC had no effect on ENaC activity (Fig.2). These data suggest that an increase in PIP3concentration may mediate stimulation of ENaC by corticoid receptors and insulin at the level of interaction of the ENaC complex with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. In addition to A6 cells that natively express ENaC when conditioned by aldosterone, the Xenopus oocyte system was also used to test the role of PIP2 and PIP3 in regulating ENaC activity. Using two-electrode voltage clamp techniques exogenously expressed ENaC activity was evaluated with amiloride-sensitive currents following injection of rat α-, β-, and γ-ENaC cRNAs. Amiloride-sensitive currents were compared in the same oocyte before and 30 min after injection of equal volume of H2O (as a control), PIP2 (30 μm), or PIP3 (30 μm), respectively. Amiloride-sensitive currents were not changed in the oocytes injected with H2O (−728 ± 84 nAversus −750 ± 72 nA; n = 7). In contrast, amiloride-sensitive currents were increased, from −797 ± 40 nA to −1091 ± 69 nA (p < 0.001;n = 14) after injection with PIP2 and from −733 ± 31 nA to −1077 ± 73 nA (p < 0.001; n = 10) after injection with PIP3. To further determine whether the increase in amiloride-sensitive currents were related to ENaC trafficking, the density of ENaC on the surface of the plasma membrane was evaluated with confocal surface labeling techniques. The oocytes that expressed FLAGTM-tagged ENaC were injected with equal volume of H2O (as a control), PIP2 (30 μm), or PIP3 (30 μm), respectively. Fluorescent labeling was carried out 30 min after these injections. The data demonstrated that there was no difference in ENaC surface density between each group of oocytes injected with H2O, PIP2, or PIP3 (Fig.3), indicating that PIP2 and PIP3 up-regulate ENaC through a mechanism that appears to be independent of ENaC trafficking as it affects the density of surface expression. Although PIP2, PIP3, and PS failed to enhance ENaC activity in A6 cells, but only maintain the channel activity, it is likely that the stimulatory effect of anionic phospholipids on ENaC activity may be already saturated in A6 cells, which are continuously cultured in the presence of aldosterone. Further experiments will address this hypothesis by using ENaC-expressing renal epithelial cells cultured either in the absence or in the presence of aldosterone. Presumably, without prestimulation by aldosterone, anionic phospholipids will increase the low basal level of ENaC activity in such cells. We (8Ma H.-P. Li L. Zhou Z.-H. Eaton D.C. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F501-F505Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and others (18Lehrmann H. Thomas J. Kim S.J. Jacobi C. Leipziger J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that stimulation of the P2Y family, probably the P2Y2 receptor, inhibits ENaC activity in A6 distal nephron cells and amiloride-sensitive Isc in mouse cortical collecting duct principal cells via a pathway that appears to occur independently of an increase in [Ca2+]i. The present study demonstrates that anionic phospholipids activate endogenously expressed ENaC in A6 cells and exogenously expressed ENaC in Xenopusoocytes. Since both chelation of endogenous PIP2 with anti-PIP2 antibody and hydrolysis of endogenous PIP2 with exogenous PLC or extracellular ATP that presumably activates endogenous PLC could reduce ENaC activity (Fig.1), a decrease in PIP2 concentration in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane may explain inhibition of ENaC by the P2Y2 Receptor. In addition, we have found that PIP3 also regulates ENaC activity (Fig. 2). With the recognition of the role of PIP3 and PI 3-kinase in the responses to aldosterone and insulin on ENaC activity in A6 cells (19Blazer-Yost B.L. Paunescu T.G. Helman S.I. Lee K.D. Vlahos C.J.

The response to aldosterone is pleotropic and involves sgk kinase as well as changes in PI 3-kinase (23Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F.

Physiol. 2001; 280: F675-F682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the experiments described in the legend to Fig. 3, using anionic phospholipids as the putative downstream effectors of the aldosterone response, demonstrate activation of ENaCin situ rather than recruitment or translocation of ENaC complexes to the plasma membrane in the oocyte system. Therefore, an increase in PIP3 concentration in the inner plasma membrane may account in part for the stimulatory effects of aldosterone and insulin on ENaC activity at the level of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane."

Because HSL-mediated lipolysis of TG in adipose tissue (AT) directly feeds non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) into the vascular system, the enzyme is expected to affect many metabolic processes including the metabolism of plasma lipids and lipoproteins. In the present study we examined these metabolic changes in induced mutant mouse lines that lack HSL expression (HSL-ko mice). During fasting, when HSL is normally strongly induced in AT, HSL-ko animals exhibited markedly decreased plasma concentrations of NEFA (−40%) and TG (−63%), whereas total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels were increased (+34%). Except for the increased HDL cholesterol concentrations, these differences were not observed in fed animals, in which HSL activity is generally low. Decreased plasma TG levels in fasted HSL-ko mice were mainly caused by decreased hepatic very low density lipid lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis as a result of decreased NEFA transport from the periphery to the liver. Reduced NEFA transport was also indicated by a depletion of hepatic TG stores (−90%) and strongly decreased ketone body concentrations in plasma (−80%). Decreased plasma NEFA and TG levels in fasted HSL-ko mice were associated with increased fractional catabolic rates of VLDL-TG and an induction of the tissue-specific lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and white AT. In brown AT, LPL activity was decreased. Both increased VLDL fractional catabolic rates and increased LPL activity in muscle were unable to provide the heart with sufficient NEFA, which led to decreased tissue TG levels in cardiac muscle. Our results demonstrate that HSL deficiency markedly affects the metabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins by the coordinate down-regulation of VLDL synthesis and up-regulation of LPL in muscle and white adipose tissue. These changes result in an “anti-atherogenic” lipoprotein profile.

The mobilization of TG during fasting or periods of increased energy demand, and the release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) is an essential process that supplies non-adipose organs with substrates for energy conversion (1.Sztalryd C.

In the liver, NEFA are also used for oxidation but, in addition, are utilized for several other metabolic processes. NEFA can be stored as hepatic TG droplets, used for the synthesis of ketone bodies, or incorporated into VLDL (3.Bulow J. Simonsen L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Frayn K.N. Powell D. Gibbons G.F. J.

This process supplies peripheral tissues such as AT with NEFA, thereby closing an inter-tissue cycle of fatty acid transport.An important enzyme for the mobilization of TG and NEFA production in AT is hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).

Although the highest levels of expression are found in WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT), the enzyme is also found in many other tissues including muscle (2.Langfort J. Ploug T. Ihlemann J.

In the postprandial state, HSL activity accounts for most of the detectable lipolysis in human WAT and thus determines whole-body lipid fuel availability (14.Frayn K.N. Shadid S. Hamlani R.

Sikorski M.A. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 139-159PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of HSL promotes the formation of a stable complex between HSL and lipotransin (22.Syu L.J. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which translocates the enzyme from the cytosol to the lipid droplet. In response to hormone signals, lipotransin-mediated ATP hydrolysis causes HSL to dissociate and thus gain access to the lipid surface. Insulin, the major antilipolytic hormone, inhibits HSL through phosphodiesterase-3-dependent cAMP degradation and interference with the lipotransin-mediated enzyme translocation.Recently, the rate-limiting function of HSL in the catabolism of WAT TG was challenged by studies in HSL knock-out (ko) mice (23.Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). HSL deficiency was compatible with normal body weight and fat mass, suggesting that at least one alternative lipase must exist in WAT to compensate for the hydrolysis of TG in the absence of HSL. Nonetheless, HSL-ko mice exhibited increased mass of BAT and marked changes in the lipid composition of WAT, BAT, and other tissues of the body (23.Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 24.Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R.

Additionally, in vitro lipolysis studies with isolated WAT revealed decreased NEFA and glycerol release when HSL was absent, thus arguing for a crucial role of HSL in the catabolism of TG and diglycerides and the subsequent release of NEFA (24.Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). As a result, the plasma levels of NEFA are decreased in fasting HSL-deficient mice (23.Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).Depending on the nutritional condition, plasma NEFA strongly affect lipid synthesis and utilization in hepatic and peripheral tissues (25.Raclot T. Dauzats M. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Accordingly, decreased NEFA release in HSL-ko mice is expected to result in decreased hepatic VLDL synthesis and other metabolic changes. To test this hypothesis, we studied the role of HSL deficiency on the metabolism of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in HSL-ko mice. We demonstrate that decreased plasma NEFA levels in HSL-deficient mice are associated with decreased hepatic VLDL synthesis, decreased ketogenesis, and the depletion of TG stores in the liver. Additionally, the catabolism of plasma VLDL is increased because of the coordinate up-regulation of the tissue-specific LPL activity in muscle and WAT, which results in drastically reduced plasma TG levels and increased HDL cholesterol concentrations in fed and fasted HSL-ko mice.DISCUSSIONThe physiological importance of HSL for the metabolism of AT-associated fat stores is evident from recent studies in HSL-deficient mice (23.Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1970-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the absence of HSL, the hydrolysis of TG and diglycerides is impaired, leading to a pronounced decrease of plasma NEFA concentrations especially in fasted animals (23.Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that decreased plasma NEFA concentrations cause marked alterations in the plasma lipoprotein pattern with decreased plasma TG levels and increased total and HDL cholesterol concentrations. In the liver, HSL-ko mice exhibited decreased VLDL synthesis, decreased TG storage droplets, and decreased ketogenesis.Generally, NEFA that enter hepatocytes are subsequently processed by one of two possible pathways. First, re-esterification of NEFA at the endoplasmic reticulum leads to the formation of cytoplasmic lipid storage droplets. Second, mitochondrial import feeds into β-oxidation or ketogenesis. According to current models, lipid storage droplets represent the major pool of fatty acids for subsequent VLDL production (37.Lewis G.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Following TG hydrolysis by a currently unidentified TG hydrolase and re-esterification at the endoplasmic reticulum (38.Speake B.K. Murray A.M. Noble R.C. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), TG are incorporated into VLDL by a process that involves microsomal lipid transfer protein (MTP) (39.Gordon D.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with this model and show that in a condition of decreased plasma NEFA level, as observed in fasted HSL-ko mice, both cytoplasmic fat stores and VLDL synthesis are decreased. It is interesting to note that additional potential sources of fatty acids to fuel lipid droplet and VLDL production, such as hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis and/or remnant particle uptake from the vascular system, cannot entirely compensate for the deficiency of fatty acid transport from AT to the liver.Considering the second possible fate of NEFA that enter hepatocytes, namely mitochondrial import for β-oxidation or ketogenesis, it was interesting to observe a pronounced decrease in the ketone body concentration in plasma suggesting that this second pathway of fatty acid processing is also less efficient when HSL-mediated production of NEFA from fat stores is absent. Alternatively, increased ketone body utilization by peripheral tissues might also contribute to the drastic decrease in ketone body concentration in plasma of fasted animals. In view of the importance of ketone bodies as an energy substrate, particularly in the brain, low rates of hepatic ketone body production in HSL-ko mice might cause a serious problem during prolonged fasting in HSL-deficient animals.Decreased hepatic VLDL production as a result of the defective TG lipolysis in AT of HSL-ko mice was also associated with alterations in the catabolic pathways of VLDL. VLDL turnover experiments revealed significantly increased FCR values in HSL-ko mice compared with controls. The increased FCR is explained mainly by the much smaller TG pool size in HSL-deficient animals. In fact, when the ACR was calculated as a product of the FCR × pool size, a decreased ACR was found in HSL-deficient mice. Because in steady state conditions the ACR is a measure of the production rate, this result confirms our observations of decreased VLDL synthesis in Triton WR-1339 experiments.The decreased TG pool in fasted HSL-ko animals was not only a result of decreased VLDL production but was also caused by the induction of LPL activities in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The statistically highly significant increase of LPL activities in muscle might reflect an effort to increase the uptake of energy substrate in a situation of extremely low plasma concentrations of NEFA and TG-rich lipoproteins. The regulation of LPL in AT was found to be less uniform. Independent of the feeding/fasting state LPL was markedly reduced in BAT of HSL-ko mice. In WAT, LPL was induced in fasted mice but reduced in fed HSL-deficient mice compared with control mice. Increased LPL activity in the muscle and WAT of fasted mice is expected to effectively lower plasma TG in addition to the decreased VLDL synthesis in HSL-ko mice, because the tissue-specific LPL activity in cardiac muscle has been shown to be particularly powerful in the catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins (40.Levak-Frank S. Hofmann W. Weinstock P.H. Radner H. Sattler W. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3165-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although LPL activity in BAT is decreased, the total tissue LPL activity is essentially unchanged because the tissue mass is increased in HSL-deficient mice (23.Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 35.Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is reasonable to assume that the total LPL-mediated lipolytic activity of the body is determined by the tissue-specific activities in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and WAT, which are all increased in fasted HSL-ko mice.The molecular mechanisms responsible for the coordinate regulation of LPL in the presence or absence of HSL remain to be elucidated. In human AT, such a coordinated regulation of LPL and HSL was observed, suggesting a control mechanism of fat storage and mobilization (41.Frayn K.N. Coppack S.W. Fielding B.A. Humphreys S.M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 163-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A coordinate regulation of the enzymes across tissue boundaries, however, has not been reported. Induction of LPL activity in muscle and WAT and reduction of LPL in BAT is a post-transcriptional process, because LPL mRNA levels were identical in these tissues in HSL-ko and control mice. Apparently, variations in LPL activities are a result of changes in enzyme processing or enzyme translocation to its final destination, the heparan sulfate anchors in the capillary endothelium. Post-transcriptional regulation of LPL has been observed in previous studies in response to hormones and cytokines such as insulin and interleukin-1 (42.Ewart H.S. Severson D.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43.Enerback S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The signals that trigger the post-transcriptional induction of LPL in HSL-deficient mice are presently unknown. However, several scenarios are conceivable. First, the lack of induction of LPL in WAT of HSL-ko mice in response to feeding indicates a defect in insulin action, because it is well documented that the postprandial up-regulation of WAT LPL is mediated by insulin. Second, the intracellular lipid stores in peripheral tissues, particularly the heart, might act as a “lipostat” signaling the increased requirement for fatty acids upon depletion. A similar function has been proposed for lipid stores in pancreatic β-cells (36.Roduit R. Masiello P. Wang S.P. Li H. Mitchell G.A. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1970-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 44.Winzell M.S. Svensson H. Arner P. Ahren B. Holm C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Third, the decreased availability of fatty acids or a subclass thereof (e.g. essential fatty acids) from plasma or changes in the hormonal status because of HSL deficiency might induce the post-transcriptional processing of LPL. The lipostat hypothesis is also consistent with our observation that, in contrast to all other peripheral tissues, LPL is drastically down-regulated in BAT of HSL-deficient mice. We assume that increased BAT mass and BAT lipid content as observed in HSL-ko mice (23.Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) inhibit LPL expression at the post-transcriptional level.The induction of LPL was highest in cardiac muscle, in accordance with the current concept that the heart is particularly dependent on NEFA uptake as oxidative fuel. However, despite this induction, the steady state concentration of cardiac muscle TG stores were decreased in HSL-ko mice. The normal heart also exhibits the capacity to store limited amounts of fatty acids as TG droplets (45.Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This myocardial TG content is kept relatively constant under physiological conditions, suggesting a strictly regulated equilibrium between oxidative fatty acid consumption and fatty acid uptake. In fasted HSL-ko mice, the cardiac TG pool was markedly reduced, indicating an imbalance of fatty acid uptake versus consumption, which was not compensated by the up-regulation of the tissue specific LPL activity.Decreased plasma TG levels as a result of decreased hepatic VLDL synthesis and increased peripheral VLDL catabolism are associated with increased plasma cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentrations. These data are in agreement with the well established concept that increased catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins due to the induction of LPL is an important determinant of HDL cholesterol levels. It is generally accepted that the LPL-mediated lipolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL provides “surface remnants” as precursor particles that together with hepatic preβ1-LpA-I particles are converted to mature α-LpA-I particles by the action of ABC-A1, lipid transfer proteins, and lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (46.Barrans A.

It is reasonable to assume that the increased LPL activities found in muscle and WAT at least partially account for the observed increase in HDL cholesterol levels.In summary, we conclude that the phenotypic changes observed in HSL-deficient mice indicate an important function for the enzyme in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein metabolism. In mammals, white adipose tissue (WAT)1 is the most important storage organ of TG. The mobilization of TG during fasting or periods of increased energy demand, and the release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) is an essential process that supplies non-adipose organs with substrates for energy conversion (1.Sztalryd C.

An important enzyme for the mobilization of TG and NEFA production in AT is hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).

They can be studied through their effects on atomic energy levels, which produce polarized spectral lines4,5. In particular, anisotropic radiation ‘pumping’ processes6,7 (which send electrons to higher atomic levels) induce population imbalances that are modified by weak magnetic fields8,9. Here we report peculiarly polarized light in the He I 10,830-Å multiplet observed in a coronal filament located at the centre of the solar disk. We show that the polarized light arises from selective absorption from the ground level of the triplet system of helium, and that it implies the presence of magnetic fields of the order of a few gauss that are highly inclined with respect to the solar radius vector. This disproves the common belief4,10,11 that population imbalances in long-lived atomic levels are insignificant in the presence of inclined fields of the order of a few gauss, and opens up a new diagnostic window for the investigation of solar magnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W1991089479,"Singularities underlie many optical phenomena1. The rainbow, for example, involves a particular type of singularity—a ray catastrophe—in which light rays become infinitely intense. In practice, the wave nature of light resolves these infinities, producing interference patterns. At the event horizon of a black hole2, time stands still and waves oscillate with infinitely small wavelengths. However, the quantum nature of light results in evasion of the catastrophe and the emission of Hawking radiation3. Here I report a theoretical laboratory analogue of an event horizon: a parabolic profile of the group velocity7 of light brought to a standstill in an atomic medium4,5,6 can cause a wave singularity similar to that associated with black holes. In turn, the quantum vacuum is forced to create photon pairs with a characteristic spectrum, a phenomenon related to Hawking radiation3. The idea may initiate a theory of ‘quantum’ catastrophes, extending classical catastrophe theory8,9."

https://openalex.org/W1883906736,"Relocation of the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis, by bee-keepers from southern to northern South Africa in 1990 has caused widespread death of managed African honeybee, A. m. scutellata, colonies. Apis mellifera capensis worker bees are able to lay diploid, female eggs without mating by means of automictic thelytoky (meiosis followed by fusion of two meiotic products to restore egg diploidy), whereas workers of other honeybee subspecies are able to lay only haploid, male eggs. The A. m. capensis workers, which are parasitizing and killing A. m. scutellata colonies in northern South Africa, are the asexual offspring of a single, original worker in which the small amount of genetic variation observed is due to crossing over during meiosis (P. Kryger, personal communication). Here we elucidate two principal mechanisms underlying this parasitism. Parasitic A. m. capensis workers activate their ovaries in host colonies that have a queen present (queenright colonies), and they lay eggs that evade being killed by other workers (worker policing)-the normal fate of worker-laid eggs in colonies with a queen. This unique parasitism by workers is an instance in which a society is unable to control the selfish actions of its members."

Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The 3.5-kb cyclooxygenase-2 reporter construct was created by deletion of the −6900 to −3180 sequence from the 7.2-kb construct (which removes the −3721 to −3707 PPRE) by BglII digestion. The −966 luciferase reporter was generated by SacI digestion of the 7.2-kb reporter construct. The acyl-CoA oxidase-luciferase plasmid (25.Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and the SV40-β-galactosidase reporter were as described previously (5.Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. St. Hilaire A. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Plasmids from log phase cells were isolated using a Bigger Prep kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime; Boulder, CO) and purified in CsCl gradients. The cyclooxygenase-2 PPRE-luciferase reporter (COX-2 PPRE)3-luc was created by ligating a synthetic oligonucleotide between the SacI and BglII sites of pGL3basic. The ligated oligonucleotide contained a 5′-SacI sequence, a synthetic COX-2 PPRE, a BamHI spacer, a second synthetic COX-2 PPRE, a KpnI spacer, and a third synthetic COX-2 PPRE followed by a BglII spacer. The synthetic COX-2 PPRE was AGGCGACAGGTCA based on the human −3721 PPRE. All plasmids were sequence verified. The murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC) was transfected using 1 μg of appropriate reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of SV40-β-galactosidase plasmid, and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE/ml Opti-MEM. Cells were washed once with PBS before the transfection solution was added for a period of 4 h. This was removed, and the cells were incubated in normal medium (e.g. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum for RAW264.7 cells) containing any stated agonist for 18–20 h before collection and assay. When PPAR expression plasmids were cotransfected, 0.25 μg of the relevant plasmid was combined with 0.55 μg of pGL3-PPRE and 0.1 μg of SV40-β-galactosidase plasmid. Agonist was then added to each well and incubated for 18–24 h. Cyclooxygenase-2 primers (forward, 5′-CTG GTG CCT GGT CTG ATG ATG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTC CTT TCA AGG AGA ATG GTG C) were synthesized by the DNA synthesis facility (University of Utah). Cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase (Promega) and amplified with Taq polymerase using 35 cycles of (90 °C denature, 55 °C anneal, 72 °C elongate, each for 1 min). Western blotting for cyclooxygenase-2 and PPARγ was accomplished by washing adherent monocytes twice with PBS and lysing them in a buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 16 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1× Laemmli solution. The cells were scraped in this buffer, the lysate was incubated at 95 °C, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 9% gel. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and the membranes were blocked with 2.5% non-fat dry milk and 0.5% human albumin in TBST (Tris-buffered saline Tween 20) buffer and then probed with E8 anti-PPARγ or mouse monoclonal anti-cyclooxygenase-2. Antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody and ECL reagent using Biomax (Eastman Kodak) film. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-actin monoclonal antibody to assess protein loading. Permanox chamber slides (LabTek Brand Products, Naperville, IL) were coated with 10 μg/ml anti-ICAM-3 antibody or P-selectin overnight at 4 °C, washed, and blocked with 1.5% HSA in HBSS for 2 h at 37 °C. The slides were washed three times with PBS, and monocytes (106/chamber) were added and allowed to interact with the surface for 1 h before agonists or HSA/HBSS was added. This incubation was continued for 7 h at 37 °C when nonadherent cells were removed, the chambers washed three times with PBS, and the cells fixed by the addition of −20 °C methanol. The slides were air dried and frozen. Thawed slides were washed three times with PBS, blocked for 1 h with 1.5% goat serum in PBS, and then incubated with H-100 rabbit polyclonal anti-human PPARγ antibody (Santa Cruz) (5 μg/ml in 1.5% goat serum in PBS) for 30 min at 24 °C. The slides were washed for 5 min/wash using three changes of PBS before the primary antibody was detected with a 30-min incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) (1 μg/ml in 1.5% goat serum in PBS). The slides were again washed for 5 min/wash using three changes of PBS before peroxidase was detected with AEC (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) peroxidase substrate. After a 30-min incubation, the cells were washed for 5 min/wash using three changes of deionized water. Images were collected with an Olympus AX70 photomicroscope and stored electronically. The amount of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1α released from adherent monocytes into 0.5% HSA/HBSS medium was determined by ELISA. Monocytes were pipetted into wells coated with protein, which unless otherwise stated was anti-ICAM-3, and allowed to interact with the substrate for 1 h before the addition of any agonist. This incubation was continued for an additional 7 h. 20 μm arachidonate was added 20 min prior to the end of the incubation, and the medium was then collected for analysis according to the manufacturer's directions. Prostaglandin standards for the ELISA were diluted into HSA/HBSS, the monocyte incubation buffer. For some experiments, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor NS398 (10 μm) was incubated with adherent monocytes for 30 min prior to the addition of agonists. Oxidation of LDL generates a host of lipid oxidation products, some of which are biologically active. We probed for the presence of cyclooxygenase-2 protein in monocytes exposed to these products by Western analysis to find that this enzyme was not normally present in freshly isolated human monocytes. Adhesion to and spreading on a surface coated with an anti-ICAM-3 antibody (42.Hayflick J.S. Stine J. Fox R. Hoekstra D. Gallatin W.M. J. Biol.

However, these adherent monocytes expressed significant amounts of cyclooxygenase-2 protein after being exposed to oxidized, and not native unoxidized, LDL. Cyclooxygenase-2 induction by oxidized LDL, or the total lipids extracted from oxidized LDL, was equivalent to that of the positive control LPS. Lipids extracted from unoxidized LDL did not do this. Cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression resulted from the appearance of new message because unactivated monocytes contained no detectable cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA, but this message was readily detectable after stimulation with oxidized LDL and its oxidatively generated polar phospholipid fraction (Fig. 1b). Inclusion of actinomycin D completely blocked the accumulation of cyclooxygenase-2 message (not shown), establishing the importance of transcriptional modulation. Oxidized LDL contains the potent and selective PPARγ agonist azPC, a prominent oxidatively fragmented alkylphosphatidylcholine that activates the PPARγ-driven gene CD36 in human monocytes (5.Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. St. Hilaire A. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), therefore it might be induced in monocytes through PPARγ activation. We treated primary human monocytes with rosiglitazone as a positive control for PPARγ activation and with synthetic azPC to find (Fig. 1a) that both dramatically enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression. The expression level in response to these two PPARγ agonists was similar to that of the LPS positive control, leading to the conclusion that PPARγ agonists are strong, independent stimuli for cyclooxygenase production. We tested whether the cyclooxygenase-inducing activity(ies) in oxidized LDL had the characteristics of the PPARγ ligands we had found previously in oxidized LDL in that these agonists all belonged to the small subclass of phospholipids with an ether bond at the sn-1 position that makes them resistant to phospholipase A1 digestion. The structure(s) in oxidized LDL responsible for cyclooxygenase-2 induction was a phospholipid because this activity was recovered in the polar phospholipid fraction eluting from a reversed phase HPLC column and because induction was abolished by treatment with phospholipase A2 (Fig. 2a). This maneuver would be expected to increase the amounts of free fatty acid oxidation products such as HETEs and HODEs (43.Delerive P. Furman C. Teissier E. Fruchart J. Duriez P. Staels B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which weakly interact with PPARα and PPARγ (27.Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S.

The phospholipids responsible for cyclooxygenase-2 induction were derived from the oxidation of the minor subclass, mainly phosphatidylcholines, of phospholipids that contain an ether rather than an ester bond at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone. This follows because treating the extracted phospholipids with phospholipase A1, which cleaves the ∼99.7% of the ester-containing phospholipids in LDL (31.Diagne A. Fauv"
https://openalex.org/W2073464302,"Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ is widely expressed in many tissues, the role of PPARδ is poorly understood. In this study, we report that PPARδ was up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) during vascular lesion formation. By using Northern blot analysis, we demonstrated that PPARδ was increased by 3–4-fold in VSMC treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (20 ng/ml). In addition, PDGF-induced PPARδ mRNA expression neither needs de novo protein synthesis nor affects the stability of PPARδ mRNA in VSMC. Preincubation of VSMC with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002, 50 μmol/liter) or infection of VSMC with an adenovirus carrying the gene for a dominant negative form of Akt abrogated PDGF-induced PPARδ mRNA expression, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of PDGF-induced PPARδ mRNA expression in VSMC. To explore the role of PPARδ in VSMC, we generated rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5) stably overexpressing PPARδ and the control green fluorescent protein. Overexpression of PPARδ in VSMC increased post-confluent cell proliferation by increasing the cyclin A and CDK2 as well as decreasing p57kip2. Taken together, the results suggest that PPARδ plays an important role in the pathology of diseases associated with VSMC proliferation, such as primary atherosclerosis and restenosis."

To understand the molecular mechanisms that mediate the function of Dermo-1, we generated a series of Dermo-1 mutants and used a MyoD-mediated transcriptional activation model to characterize the roles of its N-terminal, bHLH, and C-terminal structural domains in transcriptional repression. Both the C-terminal and HLH domains of Dermo-1 were essential for its repression of MyoD-mediated transactivation. Dermo-1 repressed, in a dose-dependent fashion, the transactivation activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a protein known to cooperate with MyoD in activating E-box-dependent gene expression. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of Dermo-1, but not the bHLH domain, were required for the inhibition of MEF2, suggesting that Dermo-1 inhibits both MyoD- and MEF2-dependent transactivation but through different mechanisms. Dermo-1 interacted directly with MEF2 and selectively repressed the MEF2 transactivation domain. An overall increase of histone acetylation induced by trichostatin A treatment reduced Dermo-1 transcriptional repression activity, suggesting that histone deacetylation is involved in Dermo-1-mediated transcriptional repression. Together, these results suggest that MEF2 is an important target in Dermo-1-mediated transcriptional repression and provide initial evidence of the involvement of histone acetylation in Dermo-1 transcriptional repression.

During embryogenesis, this gene is predominantly expressed in mesodermal- and ectodermal-derived tissues including somites, dermis, chondroblasts, limbs, teeth, and cranial structures and is believed to play important roles in the development and differentiation of these tissues and organs. Homologs of mouse Dermo-1 have been found in several other vertebrates such as humans, rats, and chicks with extensive sequence conservation during evolution (2.Lee M.S. Lowe G. Flanagan S.

Interestingly, Dermo-1 homologs are also expressed in a subset of mesodermal- and ectodermal-derived tissues such as subectodermal mesenchyme, osteoblasts, and limb buds (2.Lee M.S. Lowe G.

I. (1998) Oxford University Press, London, UKGoogle Scholar). There is ample evidence of interplay between different members of bHLH proteins in the regulation of myogenesis, cardiogenesis, neurogenesis, and hematopoiesis (7.Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

It is well documented that bHLH proteins regulate the differentiation of many other cell types during development either as transcriptional activators or repressors of gene expression (6.Littlewood, T., and Evan, G. I. (1998) Oxford University Press, London, UKGoogle Scholar). The bHLH proteins are characterized by two distinct motifs: (i) the basic region that mediates specific binding to the E-box consensus sequence (CANNTG) and (ii) the HLH domain that mediates heterodimerization with E proteins such as E12 (11.Murre C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, the bHLH proteins have also been shown to form complexes with non-bHLH proteins such as the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), SRF, and p300 (13.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F.

It has been established that MEF2, a MADS-domain protein, interacts directly with bHLH proteins to regulate gene transcription (13.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Recently, genetic studies have shown that members of the MEF2 family, as transcription factors and coactivators for a battery of gene regulation, are critical in controlling the development of multiple tissues including heart, vasculature, neural tubes, and skeletal muscle (17.Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 18.Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N.

In tissue culture, MEF2 can also induce gene expression in response to a calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase signal via the dissociation from HDAC factors (20.Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The function of MEF2 has been shown to be modulated via chromatin remodeling by recruiting HDAC 4/HDAC5/HDAC7 and their related protein MITR (20.Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl.

Many important attributes of the bHLH factors have been initially defined in the past using muscle differentiation as a model and members of myogenic bHLH proteins as regulators (6.Littlewood, T., and Evan, G. I. (1998) Oxford University Press, London, UKGoogle Scholar). MyoD is the first and most well characterized bHLH protein that behaves as a transcriptional activator; it provides a paradigm for defining the function of other bHLH proteins in cell determination and differentiation during development (23.Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that mediate the transcriptional activation of MyoD during myogenesis require both basic and HLH domains (24.Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcriptional activation activity of MyoD can be synergistically stimulated by members of the MEF2 family (13.Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Such cooperativity requires direct interactions between MyoD and MEF2, but only one of them is needed to bind to DNA (25.Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of MyoD during myogenesis is also regulated by Id and Twist, members of the HLH superfamily (6.Littlewood, T., and Evan, G. I. (1998) Oxford University Press, London, UKGoogle Scholar). Both Id and Twist are transcriptional repressors for MyoD. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating their action are distinct. The Id proteins belong to a class of HLH proteins that lack a basic region and have a greater affinity for E proteins (26.Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Therefore, Id functions as a dominant negative mutant to inhibit the function of tissue-restricted bHLH proteins such as MyoD. Twist, sharing significant homology with Dermo-1, contains both basic and HLH domains and has been shown to be a potent transcriptional repressor for MyoD (1.Li L. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27.Hebrok M. Fuchtbauer A. Fuchtbauer E.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The repression mechanisms of Twist on MyoD transactivation have been demonstrated to be mediated by direct interaction with the basic domain of MyoD, sequestering E proteins, inhibiting MEF2 activation, and inhibiting the histone acetylase activity of MyoD coactivators such as pCAF and CBP (28.Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 29.Hamamori Y. Wu H.Y. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Dermo-1 represses transcription. Since our first report on the cloning of Dermo-1 in a mouse and its function as a transcriptional repressor for MyoD (1.Li L. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), no further studies have been published on the characterization of the molecular mechanisms of Dermo-1 in transcriptional repression. Here we have focused on the roles of each domain of Dermo-1 in transcriptional repression using MyoD transactivation as a model. Our results demonstrate that the HLH and C-terminal domains and not the N-terminal and the basic regions of Dermo-1 are essential for its transcriptional repression activity. Further, Dermo-1 directly associates with MEF2 to repress its transactivation domain, and histone deacetylation is involved in Dermo-1-mediated gene repression. Dermo-1 cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3.1 vectors (Invitrogen) containing a FLAG epitope at the C terminus (pcDNA3.1FLAG, constructed by M. Yang in the laboratory of L. Li). Point mutants were generated using primers encoding several different mutations by a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting point mutants (DermoHLH−, Dermob−, DermoNls1−, DermoNls2−, and DermoNls1&2−) were mutated at F86P, R74A/E75A/R76A, R31A/K32A/R33A/R34A, K52A/K53A, and R31A/K32A/R33A/R34A/K52A/K53A, respectively. To minimize the introduction of errors by PCR, the sequences of these point mutants were confirmed and then inserted into wild type pcDNA3.1FLAG vectors for additional subcloning. The deletion mutants were generated by PCR using the following 5′ and 3′ primers (the 5′ primers all contained an EcoRI or HindIII site; the 3′ primers all contained an XhoI site). DermoΔN-(1–28): 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCATGGGCCGGAAGCGGCGCTACAG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CGGCTCGAGGTGGGAGGCGGACATGGAC-3′; DermoΔN-(1–65): 5′ primer, 5′CCCAAGCTTAGCCAGCGCATCCTGGCCAAC-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CGGCTCGAGGTGGGAGGCGGACATGGAC-3′; DermoΔC-(121–160): 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCGGGCGCCATGGAGGAGG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CGGCTCGAGCTGGTAGAGGAAGTCTATGTACCTG-3′; DermoΔC-(134–160): 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCGGGCGCCATGGAGGAGG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CGGCTCGAGGCAGCTGGTCATCTTATTGTC-3′; DermoΔC-(145–160): 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCGGGCGCCATGGAGGAGG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CGGCTCGAGCCACACGGAGAAGGCGTAG-3′; DermoHLHC: 5′ primer: 5′-CCCAAGCTTACCCAGTCGCTCAACGAGG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CGGCTCGAGGTGGGAGGCGGACATGGAC-3′. DermoΔN-(1–65) and DermoHLHC mutants were fused in-frame with the SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N terminus of Dermo-1 in the pcDNA3.1FLAG vector. To ensure the accuracy of mutagenesis, all resulting mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Transient transfection assays were performed using LipofectAMINE PlusTM (Life Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reporter gene MCK-luc contains two E-boxes (MyoD binding sites) and two MEF2 binding sites in the promoter region normally inactivated in 10T1/2 cells. 4R-tk-luc is a simplified MyoD-dependent reporter containing four E-boxes upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Briefly, 10T1/2 cells were grown in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum until they reached 80% confluence. Then, 10T1/2 cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of reporter gene (either MCK-luc or 4R-tk-luc or MEF2x3-luc or pGln5-luc (Refs. 31.Sternberg E.A. Spi G. Perry W.M. Vizard D. Weil T. Olson E.N. Mol.

Empty vectors (EMSV or pCDNA3.1) were included to verify that equal amounts of DNA were available for each transfection. 3–4 h after transfection, cells were placed in a mixture of 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated overnight. Then the medium was changed to 0.5% fetal calf serum for 2 days to induce differentiation. Next, the transfected cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercial luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to the protein content in each sample. To test whether Dermo-1-mediated transcriptional repression requires deacetylase activity, 10T1/2 cells were treated overnight with 330 nm deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), beginning 24 h after transfection. For all transfection experiments, the luciferase activities were the average of the results of three independent duplicate experiments. To determine the ability of Dermo-1 and its mutants to inhibit MyoD transactivation, 10T1/2 cells were plated onto 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 1 μg of MyoD as described above in the absence or presence of 1 μg of Dermo-1 or each mutant. Empty vectors (pcDNA3.1) were used to normalize the amounts of DNA transfected in each well. After 5 days in differentiation medium, the expression of skeletal myosin was detected by incubating cells first with an anti-myosin antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, then with biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min, and finally with a horseradish peroxidase-strepavidin conjugate (ABC system; Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. Positive cells were visualized by DAB staining for 30 min at room temperature (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The expression level of MyoD was assayed by standard Western blot analysis. 10T1/2 cells plated on 6-well plates were transiently transfected as described above but with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1FLAG-Dermo-1 or its mutants. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were rinsed two times in phosphate-buffered saline buffer and lysed in sample buffer (15 mm Tris HCl, 2% SDS, 4% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). Cell extracts were prepared by boiling for 5 min and brief centrifugation. Equal amounts of each sample were then subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). FLAG antibody was used to detect the expression of each protein, which was visualized using a commercial chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunoprecipitation assays, Dermo-1 and MEF2C were cotransfected into COS cells and, 48 h later, harvested in lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and proteinase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Harvested cells were then transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube using a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged to remove debris. FLAG-tagged Dermo-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 3–4 h and then washed five times in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with gentle agitation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated out by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane immunoblotted with MEF2 polyclonal antibody (no. sc-313, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and finally visualized using the chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The MEF2 antibody is made against the carboxyl terminus of MEF2A and recognizes MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D. Previously, we reported that Dermo-1 was able to inhibit the transactivation activities of myogenic bHLH factors (1.Li L. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To determine whether Dermo-1 could repress the role of MyoD in initiating the myogenic program, we transiently transfected 10T1/2 cells with MyoD alone or MyoD plus Dermo-1 expression plasmids. As expected, MyoD converted 10T1/2 fibroblast cells into differentiated myogenic cells, as indicated by the expression of skeletal muscle myosin protein detected using an anti-myosin antibody (Fig. 1A). However, when Dermo-1 was cotransfected with MyoD, the number of skeletal muscle myosin-positive cells decreased about 80% (Fig. 1A). As confirmation that the reduction of myogenic cells was not due to a Dermo-1-mediated down-regulation of MyoD expression, the expression level of MyoD was examined in 10T1/2 cells transfected with MyoD alone versusMyoD plus Dermo-1. The expression level of MyoD was comparable in 10T1/2 cells transfected with or without Dermo-1 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Dermo-1 does not affect the expression of MyoD in pEMSV vector but represses the ability of MyoD to initiate the myogenic program. To investigate whether Dermo-1 inhibits myogenic differentiation through a mechanism similar to another myogenic inhibitor, Id, we examined the inhibitory activities of Dermo-1 and Id in a model of MyoD-mediated gene activation using the E-box-dependent reporters (MCK-luc and 4R-tk-luc). Both Dermo-1 and Id repressed MyoD-dependent transactivation, but Dermo-1 was a more potent inhibitor than Id (Fig. 2, A and B). However, Dermo-1 and Id responded differently when E12 was cotransfected into 10T1/2 cells. The Id-dependent repression of MyoD was almost completely relieved by exogenous E12. In contrast, excess E12 only rescued 5–10% of Dermo-1-mediated repression of MyoD transactivation on 4R-tk-luc and MCK-luc reporters (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings suggested that sequestration of E12 protein is not the major mechanism for Dermo-1-mediated repression. To dissect the functional domains in Dermo-1 required for transcriptional repression, we generated a series of Dermo-1 mutants with mutations in its N-terminal, bHLH, or C-terminal regions (Fig. 3). The inhibitory ability of each mutant was determined using the same model system described above. Wild type Dermo-1 almost completely abolished MyoD transactivating activity, whereas deletion mutant DermoΔC-(121–160) (created by completely deleting the C-terminal region) repressed 45% of the MyoD activity (Fig. 4A). This suggested that the C-terminal region is essential for Dermo-1-mediated gene repression. However, mutants generated by limited deletions within the C-terminal region (i.e. DermoΔC-(134–160) and DermoΔC-(149–160)) did not reduce its ability as a transcriptional repressor (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the critical amino acids mediating Dermo-1 repression lie in the sequence immediately C-terminal to the HLH domain.Figure 4Both C-terminal and helix 1 domains are required for Dermo-1-mediated transcriptional repression of E-box-dependent reporters. 10T1/2 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of expression vectors encoding MyoD, Dermo-1, or the indicated mutants in the presence of 0.5 μg of reporter MCK-luc (A) or 4R-tk-luc (B). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The transactivation activities of MyoD were assigned a value of 100%. The luciferase activities were the average of the results of three independent duplicate experiments. C, Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody was done to examine the protein level of Dermo-1 and its mutants. 10T1/2 cells were transfected with equal amounts of FLAG-tagged expression plasmids encoding wild type Dermo-1, DermoΔN, DermoHLH−, Dermob−, and vector pcDNA3.1. For DermoΔ-(C121–160), 1.25 μg of plasmid DNA expressed similar amount of protein compared with 0.5 μg of wild type plasmid DNA. Please note that this amount of DermoΔC-(121–160) protein could repress 45% of the MyoD activity in Fig. 4A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the HLH domain in Dermo-1 was essential for its repression ability, we introduced a proline into the helix 1 region to disrupt the helix structure. The resulting mutant (DermoHLH−) completely lost its ability to repress transcription (Fig. 4A). This suggested that the HLH domain was required for the inhibitory function of Dermo-1. Consistent with this notion, a fusion protein of HLH and C-terminal domains at the C-terminal of the SV40 nuclear localization signal (i.e.DermoHLHC) is sufficient to repress 80% of the MyoD transactivation activities (Fig. 4A). However, the basic region mutant (i.e. Dermob−) and the N-terminal deletion mutant (i.e. DermoΔN-(1–65)) retained most of the repressor function (Fig. 4A). This result suggested that neither the DNA binding region nor the N terminus is essential for Dermo-1-mediated transcriptional repression. Data obtained using MCK-luc as a reporter were similar to results obtained using 4R-tk-luc as a reporter (Fig. 4B). However, Dermo-1 was a less potent repressor of 4R-tk-luc than of MCK-luc. Because MCK-luc contains the two MEF2 sites in this promoter, the results suggest the potential importance of the MEF2 sites in mediating Dermo-1 transcriptional repression. To ensure that loss of the inhibitory function by the mutants was not due to the absence of protein expression, the protein expression levels of all of the mutants described above were examined by Western blot analysis. Because all mutants were cloned in expression vectors containing the FLAG epitope tag, FLAG antibody immunostaining was used to visualize mutant proteins. Similar levels of protein expression were detected for all mutants except DermoΔC-(121–160) (Fig. 4C). Equal amounts of DermoΔC-(121–160) and wild type Dermo-1 proteins were observed when DermoΔC-(121–160) plasmid DNA was transfected 2.5-fold more than wild type plasmid DNA (Fig. 4C). This amount of DermoΔC-(121–160) protein could repress 45% of the MyoD activity (Fig. 4A). To determine whether a putative NLS in the N terminus of Dermo-1 contributes to cellular localization of Dermo-1 protein, three NLS mutants (DermoNls1−, DermoNls2−, and DermoNls1&2−) were generated and transfected into 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 5A). Immunostaining for the FLAG antibody demonstrated that the NLS mutations did not significantly block the translocation of Dermo-1 protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Fig. 5B). Whereas wild type Dermo-1 protein expression was exclusively nuclear, DermoNls1&2− protein expression was mostly but not completely nuclear (Fig. 5B), suggesting that amino acids other than the putative NLS sequences in the N terminus were also providing the nuclear localization signal. Mutation at both NLS sequences did not affect the expression and stability of these mutants compared with that of the wild type Dermo-1, as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C). Consistent with the observation that all the NLS mutants remain cytoplasmic, DermoNls1−, DermoNls2−, and DermoNls1&2− mutants all retained the ability to inhibit MyoD-activated reporter genes in transient transfection assays (Fig. 5D). Because MEF2C cooperates with MyoD to transactivate MCK and 4R-tk promoters, the effect of Dermo-1 on the transcriptional activity of MEF2C was examined. MEF2C significantly transactivated the MEF reporter (3xMEF-luc), which contains three MEF2 binding sites upstream of the basal tk promoter. However, such a transactivation was repressed by Dermo-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Dermo-1-mediated inhibition was also observed when MEF2C was replaced with MEF2A, another member of the MEF2 family (data not shown). For confirmation that Dermo-1 did not down-regulate the expression of MEF2C, the protein"

We synthesized the 19-mer oligopeptides corresponding to regions A and C of human calpastatin domain I and tested their effect on human erythrocyte μ-calpain and rat m-calpain. The two peptides significantly activate both calpains: the Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal activity is lowered from 4.3 to 2.4 μm for μ-calpain and from 250 to 140 μm for m-calpain. The EC50concentration of the peptides is 7.5 μm for μ-calpain and 25 μm for m-calpain. It is noteworthy that at low Ca2+ concentrations (1–2 μm for μ-calpain and 70–110 μm for m-calpain) both enzymes are activated about 10-fold by the peptides. Based on these findings, it is suggested that calpastatin fragments may have a role in calpain activationin vivo. Furthermore, these activators open new avenues to cell biological studies of calpain function and eventually may alleviate pathological states caused by calpain malfunction.

Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 2Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Several members of this family, such as the best studied typical forms, μ- and m-calpain, are thought to be activated by a Ca2+ signal; their activation then leads to the limited proteolytic modification of a variety of substrate proteins. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of rat (3Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and human (4Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) m-calpain have revealed the structural background of the Ca2+ dependence of calpain activity. Without Ca2+ the structure of the active site is distorted; large scale conformational changes have to occur for the assembly of a catalytically competent active site. Although mechanistically clear, key aspects of the activation process in vivo are still enigmatic as calpains require non-physiologically high Ca2+concentrations in vitro. μ- and m-Calpains reach half-maximal activation in the high μm to mmfree Ca2+ concentration range (cf. Ref. 5Baki A. Tompa P. Alexa A. Molnár O. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), hardly attainable under normal cellular conditions. Several suggestions have been put forward on how to close this gap. First, calpain undergoes autolytic activation with a concomitant sensitization to Ca2+ (5Baki A. Tompa P. Alexa A. Molnár O. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki K. Tsuji S. Ishiura S. Kimura Y. Kubota S. Imahori K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1787-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); this, of course, does not alleviate the initial high Ca2+ requirement. Second, phospholipids increase calcium sensitivity of calpain (7Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tompa P. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Friedrich P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and activation probably involves the translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane (9Michetti M. Salamino F. Tedesco I. Averna M. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Third, calpain might also be sensitized to Ca2+ by a specific activator protein that affects membrane localization and autolysis of the enzyme (11Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nuclear DNA, shown to promote calpain effect on transcription factors and other nuclear proteins, may be another positive effector (12Mellgren R.L. Song K. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above factors have been characterized to different extents, and there is no consensus with respect to their contribution. In this paper we raise the possibility of an additional, rather unexpected mode of calpain sensitization to Ca2+ by fragments of its endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin. Typical calpastatin molecules have five structural domains; the function of the N-terminal domain is not clear, the other four homologous domains are all capable of inhibiting a calpain molecule (13Maki M. Takano E. Mori H. Sato A. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Imajoh S. Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2364-2370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of Ca2+ is mandatory for calpain binding and inhibition by calpastatin (15Imajoh S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Nishimura T. Goll D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11842-11850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yang H.Q. Ma H. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18977-18984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and calpastatin binding invariably occurs at a Ca2+ concentration significantly lower than that needed for enzyme activity (18Kapprell H.P. Goll D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17888-17896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each inhibitory domain contains three short conserved stretches of about 20 amino acids, termed subdomains A, B, and C (cf. Fig. 1). In functional studies it was shown that subdomain B is responsible for inhibition (19Maki M. Bagci H. Hamaguchi K. Ueda M. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18866-18869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Lee W.J. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas subdomains A and C potentiate this inhibitory effect by binding to the calmodulin-like domains of the large and small subunit, respectively, in a strictly Ca2+-dependent manner (17Yang H.Q. Ma H. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18977-18984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Lee W.J. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biochem.

Yang H.Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24430-24436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subdomains A and C have no inhibitory effect on calpain (20Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Lee W.J. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Takano E. Ma H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10254-10261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations allow for a very intriguing possibility, theactivation of calpain by calpastatin fragments. Namely, as binding of calpastatin and its subdomains to calpain is facilitated by Ca2+, thermodynamic necessity demands that the reverse be also true: calpastatin should facilitate Ca2+ binding to calpain. In other words, calpastatin or its subdomains must lower the Ca2+ demand of calpain. This is clearly seen with whole calpastatin, which binds at a Ca2+ concentration significantly lower than that needed for calpain activity (18Kapprell H.P. Goll D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17888-17896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In essence, calpastatin shifts the conformational equilibrium of calpain toward the active form; activation with whole calpastatin, of course, is not seen because of blocking of the active site by subdomain B. Subdomains A and C, on the other hand, lack this inhibitory potential. In earlier experiments they did not inhibit calpain at high Ca2+ concentrations (20Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Lee W.J.

Human erythrocyte μ-calpain was purchased fromCalbiochem (catalog no. 208713). Rat m-calpain composed of an 80-kDa large subunit and a 21-kDa truncated small subunit was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified via the C-terminal His tag attached to its large subunit as given in Ref. 24Elce J.S.

The enzymes were dialyzed against three changes of 10 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmbenzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol (calpain buffer) and stored at 4 °C until use. On the day of use a small aliquot was taken out and reactivated with 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h prior to the experiments. The acetylated oligopeptide amides used in the present study correspond to subdomains A and C of human calpastatin inhibitory domain I (cf. Fig. 1 and Ref. 21Takano E. Ma H. Yang H.Q. Maki M.

The peptides were synthesized on 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin by solid phase method using the Boc1technique. The side protection groups were as follows: Boc-Asp(cHex), Boc-Lys(2-Cl-Z), Boc-Ser(Bzl), Boc-Thr(Bzl). All Boc derivatives were obtained from Reanal, Budapest, Hungary. The coupling was carried out by using 2 eq of protected amino acid derivative and 1.9 eq ofO-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or inN,N-dimethylformamide), in the presence ofN,N-diisopropylethylamine for 30 min. In case of positive ninhydrin assay the coupling was repeated until no free amino groups were detected. The Boc group was cleaved by 100% trifluoroacetic acid for 1 × 1 min. After the cleavage the resin was washed with 5%N,N-diisopropylethylamine in dichloromethane and with dichloromethane. The N-terminal aminoacetyl group was introduced by reacting the resin-bound peptide with 10 eq of 4-nitrophenyl acetate. The peptides were cleaved from the resin by liquid HF (20 ml) at −5 °C, in the presence of 2 ml of anisole and 100 mg of dithiothreitol for 1.5 h. The peptides were purified by gel filtration in 30% acetic acid followed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac 5-μm C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) (Hesperia, CA) using 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid in water as eluent A, 0.036% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as eluent B, and linear gradient 30–55% B in 60 min and 20–52% B in 30 min for peptide A or 8.5–30% B in 100 min and 5–40% B in 30 min for peptide C. The homogeneity of peptide A was >98% and of peptide C was >92%. The peptides were checked by amino acid analysis using a Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer, and mass spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Sciex API2000 triple quadrupole instrument (Toronto, Canada) equipped with TurboIonspray source. Both peptides were dissolved in calpain buffer at 5 mg/ml concentration and stored in aliquots at −20 °C until use. Calpain activity was measured in a Jasco FP 777 spectrofluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm in a 3 × 3 mm quartz cuvette. The reaction mixture in 50 μl of calpain buffer contained 1 mm LY-AMC as substrate at various peptide and Ca2+ concentrations as indicated. The actual free Ca2+ concentration was calculated from the total concentrations by using the stability constant logK app = 7.815 for Ca2+-EDTA. The reaction was started by the rapid mixing of the enzyme at a final concentration of 0.1 μm. The fluorescent trace recorded was transferred to a PC and evaluated by the MicroCal Origin data analysis software for determining the initial slope of fluorescence change; it was checked that this slope was proportional to enzyme amount/activity under the given conditions. The fluorescent substrate LY-AMC (catalog no. S 1153) and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The buffer was prepared with ion-exchanged distilled water. To see if oligopeptides A and C have an effect on μ-calpain activity, an intermediate Ca2+ concentration was used at which the enzyme activity could be conveniently measured but was significantly lower than that at saturating Ca2+concentrations (13% at 2.4 μm free Ca2+). At this Ca2+ level the enzyme was titrated with increasing concentrations of a mixture of peptides A + C. Fig.2 shows that the oligopeptides increase calpain activity about 5-fold with an EC50 concentration around 7.5 μm. The concentration dependence of activation has a slight sigmoidal shape, which hints at a cooperative effect between the two peptides. Subdomains A and C, when applied separately, also activate the enzyme (Fig. 2). Under the conditions used both increase the activity about 2–3-fold, with a half-maximal effect around 15 μm concentration. Activation of calpain at subsaturating Ca2+ concentration might result from the expected sensitization to Ca2+, from a net increase in maximal activity without affecting Ca2+sensitivity, or both. To distinguish between these alternatives, the Ca2+ dependence of μ-calpain in the absence of peptides and in the presence of peptides at saturating concentration (40 μm each) was measured (Fig.3 A). Activation is clearly due to a significant increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of the enzyme, the concentration of half-maximal activity shifts from 4.3 to 2.4 μm upon the addition of the peptide mixture. The maximal activity at saturating Ca2+ concentrations, on the other hand, is unchanged within experimental error. With respect to the physiological activation of the enzyme, it is potentially very significant that an activation of about an order of magnitude is seen at low Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3 B). A similar set of experiments was carried out with m-calpain,i.e. with rat 80/21. Subdomains A and C exert a qualitatively similar activating effect: at 140 μm free Ca2+, where enzyme activity is 10% of that at saturating Ca2+ concentrations, the peptides cause an about 5-fold activation of the enzyme (Fig. 4). Half-maximal peptide concentration is somewhat higher (25 μm), and the course of activation has a more distinct sigmoidal shape than with μ-calpain. The peptides themselves activate the enzyme about 2–3-fold with a half-effective concentration of 55 μm. The activation again can be accounted for by an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the enzyme: the half-maximal Ca2+ concentration shifts from 250 to 140 μm at saturating (75 μm) concentrations of the peptides with no effect on maximal activity (Fig.5 A). At low Ca2+concentrations the activation approaches one order of magnitude (Fig.5 B).Figure 5Ca2+ dependence of rat m-calpain activation by calpastatin subdomains A and C. A, the activity of m-calpain was measured by LY-AMC at the free Ca2+ concentrations indicated in the absence (▵) or presence (▴) of 75 μm peptides A and C. The initial rate of substrate consumption in the percentage of the activity measured at saturating (3 mm) Ca2+concentration is given. Free Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal activation shifted from 250 to 140 μm by the peptides. B, the extent of activation exerted by the peptides at various Ca2+ concentrations is calculated as given in Fig. 3 B for μ-calpain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results presented unequivocally demonstrate that peptides corresponding to subdomains A and C of human calpastatin domain I markedly sensitize both μ- and m-calpain to Ca2+. At saturating peptide concentrations the peptides lower the Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal activity from 4.3 to 2.4 μm for μ-calpain and from 250 to 140 μm for m-calpain. Perhaps more significantly, at low Ca2+ concentrations approaching the physiological range both μ- and m-calpain are activated by an order of magnitude. The activation shows a sigmoidal concentration dependence, which indicates cooperativity between binding of the two peptides. In structural terms this implies that the conformational change of the two subunits is functionally linked and occurs in a concerted manner. The peptide concentration needed for half-maximal effect is somewhat lower for μ-calpain (7.5 μm) than m-calpain (25 μm), which might be due to the different sensitivity of isoforms, but may also reflect species difference as the peptides are derived from human calpastatin. Either way, this difference indicates that the development of isoform-specific activator peptides is conceivable. Overall, our observations have three important implications. The first implication relates to the issue of the activation of calpains under physiological Ca2+ concentrations. As outlined in the introduction, several factors may be involved in lowering the Ca2+ demand of calpains. Although this issue is not settled yet, it seems that phospholipids (7Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tompa P. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Friedrich P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1993; 268: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific activator protein (11Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Pontremoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and autolytic processing of calpain itself (5Baki A. Tompa P. Alexa A. Molnár O. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki K. Tsuji S. Ishiura S. Kimura Y. Kubota S. Imahori K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1787-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) may all contribute to shifting the Ca2+ need of calpain toward the physiological range. Our findings, perhaps paradoxically, bring calpastatin, the specific calpain inhibitor, into this picture. In principle, it is possible that calpastatin is fragmented in such a way in vivo that degrades its inhibitory subdomain (B) but leaves activator subdomains A and C more or less intact. Under such circumstances activation might override inhibition and calpastatin fragments stimulate calpain. Calpastatin is very sensitive to proteolysis in vitro (25Takano E. Maki M. Mori H. Hatanaka M. Marti T. Titani K. Kannagi R. Ooi T. Murachi T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and is degraded by caspases (26Kato M. Nonaka T. Maki M. Kikuchi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and calpain itself (27De Tullio R. Averna M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in vivo. A significant difference in the sequence of calpastatin subdomains A, B, and C suggests that the action of a protease with a trypsin-like specificity may result in such a fragmentation: subdomain B has several Lys and Arg residues making this part of calpastatin sensitive whereas subdomains A and C have only a single N-terminal Lys residue offering limited access to proteolysis. The other condition for this mechanism to operate in vivo is that the intracellular concentration of calpastatin be high enough for the peptides to reach a level sufficient for activation. Quantitative considerations argue that in some tissues this condition is met. The physiological concentration of calpastatin varies in different tissues from about 0.035 to 4.4 μm (28Otsuka Y. Goll D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5839-5851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Elce J.S. Calpain Methods and Protocols. 144. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 3-16Google Scholar); as calpastatin consists of four homologous inhibitory domains (cf. Fig. 1), each capable of inhibiting one calpain molecule in a Ca2+-dependent manner (13Maki M. Takano E. Mori H. Sato A. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Imajoh S. Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2364-2370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration of inhibitory domains, and the potential concentration of activator peptides, is four times higher, i.e. is in the range of 0.14 to 17.6 μm. Thus, in certain tissues specific fragmentation of calpastatin may produce the activator peptides in concentrations commensurable with the range used in our studies. Furthermore, two other considerations support this conclusion in a wider range. First, it seems that calpastatin concentrations at certain locations within the cell is markedly higher than the average values just mentioned. In an unstimulated cell calpastatin localizes in an aggregated state close to the cell nucleus (30Tullio R.D. Passalacqua M. Averna M. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), at local concentrations which significantly exceed the values calculated for homogeneous distribution. Second, macromolecular crowding caused by the extreme protein concentration in the cytoplasm favors interactions to such an extent that reaction rates and equilibrium constants of interactions may be orders of magnitude higher in vivo than under test tube conditions (31Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Because of this mechanism, fragments corresponding to the same amount of calpastatin subdomains A and C may give a much higher effective concentration in the cell than in dilute solution in the test tube and activate calpain at concentrations significantly lower than the values reported in this work. The second general implication of our work is related to previous efforts at characterizing the physiological function of calpains. It is known from knockout experiments that calpains play an essential role as deletion of the ubiquitous small subunit is lethal in mice (32Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The role of various calpain forms has been extensively studied, almost invariably by the application of calpain inhibitors. From such studies we know that calpain(s) play a regulatory role in basic cellular processes such as the cell cycle (33Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), cell motility (34Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), cell spreading (35Croce K. Flaumenhaft R. Rivers M. Furie B. Furie B.C. Herman I.M. Potter D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36321-36327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), apoptosis (36Blomgren K. Zhu C. Wang X. Karlsson J.O. Leverin A.L. Bahr B.A. Mallard C. Hagberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10191-10198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and many more. The inhibitors, however, lack strict specificity. They may react with the proteosome, lysosomal proteinases, or even non-proteolytic enzymes (37Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 38Donkor I.O. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 1171-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These findings have prompted the development of strictly specific calpain inhibitors (39Wang K.K. Nath R. Posner A. Raser K.J. Buroker-Kilgore M. Hajimohammadreza I. Probert Jr., A.W. Marcoux F.W. Ye Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. Caner H. Collins J.L. Fergus A. Lee K.S. Lunney E.A. Hays S.J. Yuen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6687-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or the use of a cell-permeable variety of calpastatin subdomain B for cell biological studies. In general, the results with calpain inhibitors cannot always be unequivocally associated with the action of calpain. Thus, it is desirable to develop activators for calpain based on our observations with subdomains A and C. As these peptides are highly charged, both subdomains have to be fused with “carrier” peptides that make other substances membrane-permeable. The development of such constructs, which will probably complement the use of calpain inhibitors in further analysis of calpain function, is under way. 2P. Tompa and P. Friedrich (December 10, 2001) Hungarian Patent P0105289. The third implication worth considering is related to the pathological role of calpain. Overactivation of calpain seems to be important in a range of disorders (37Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 40Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 117-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); more recent findings, however, point to the link of diminished activity and the development of pathological states. Positional cloning in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2A linked the gene of calpain 3 (p94) with this disease (41Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Devaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. et al.Cell. 1995; 81: 27-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Later studies revealed that disease is associated with mutations in this gene, which invariably leads to a partial or complete loss of enzyme activity (42Ono Y. Shimada H. Sorimachi H. Richard I.

Bogardus C. Groop L. Boerwinkle E. Hanis C.L. Bell G.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). In a similar approach, diabetes mellitus type 2, which accounts for about 90% of the incidence of diabetes, was linked to the gene of calpain 10 (43); a single-nucleotide polymorphism within one intron of the gene is associated with a significantly reduced mRNA level (44Baier L.J. Permana P.A. Yang X. Pratley R.E. Hanson R.L. Shen G.Q. Mott D. Knowler W.C. Cox N.J. Horikawa Y. Oda N. Bell G.I. Bogardus C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R69-R73Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzyme in this case is fully active, but it is expressed at a lower level. The two diseases, and possibly others, have in common a diminution in calpain activity; apparently, drugs that could boost activity might be beneficial. We thank Prof. J. S. Elce (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada) for kindly providing the expression construct of rat m-calpain (80/21)."

To test the hypothesis that FAK plays a regulatory role in hepatic insulin action, we overexpressed wild type (WT), a kinase inactive (KR), or a COOH-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence-truncated mutant of FAK in HepG2 hepatoma cells. In control untransfected (NON) and vector (CMV2)- and WT-transfected cells, insulin stimulated an expected 54 ± 13, 37 ± 4, and 47 ± 12 increase in [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen, respectively. This was entirely abolished in the presence of either KR (−1 ± 7%) or FAT mutants (0 ± 8%,n = 5, p < 0.05 for KR or FAT versus other groups), and this was associated with a significant attenuation of incremental insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase (GS) activity. Insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B was significantly impaired in mutant-transfected cells. Moreover, the ability of insulin to inactivate GS kinase-3β (GSK-3β), the regulatory enzyme immediately upstream of GS, by serine phosphorylation (308 ± 16, 321 ± 41, and 458 ± 34 optical densitometric units (odu) in NON, CMV2, and WT, respectively,p < 0.02 for WT versus CMV2) was attenuated in the presence of either FAT (205 ± 14,p < 0.01) or KR (189 ± 4, p < 0.005) mutants. FAK co-immunoprecipitated with GSK-3β, but only in cells overexpressing the KR (374 ± 254 odu) and FAT (555 ± 308) mutants was this association stimulated by insulin compared with NON (−209 ± 92), CMV2 (−47 ± 70), and WT (−39 ± 31 odu). This suggests that FAK and GSK-3β form both a constitutive association and a transient complex upon insulin stimulation, the dissociation of which requires normal function and localization of FAK. We conclude that FAK regulates the activity of Akt/protein kinase B and GSK-3β and the association of GSK-3β with FAK to influence insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes.

Integrins constitute a cell-surface transmembrane receptor family that mediates growth and differentiation-promoting functions upon activation by engagement with basement membrane or other extracellular ligands (1Burridge K.

In the case of platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-I, FAK undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at low ligand concentrations but is dephosphorylated at higher concentrations (7Chen H.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the regulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of FAK upon insulin stimulation is a function of the level of IR expression (4Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has also previously been reported that integrin engagement stimulates both IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) activity (15Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33119-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which are important steps in insulin action to stimulate glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. Integrin engagement appears to play a stimulatory role in insulin signaling (8Guilherme A. Torres K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22899-22903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and specifically in insulin-stimulated mitogenesis (16Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), suggesting that the state of cell contact is an important regulator of insulin action. In light of the above data, it is important to establish the role of FAK in the regulation of insulin action. Hitherto, the tyrosine phosphorylation state of FAK in response to insulin administration in vivo was unknown. However, we recently showed that in the liver of healthy Sprague-Dawley rats, FAK rapidly undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation under euglycemic conditions in vivo (14Cheung A.T. Wang J. Ree D. Kolls J.K. Bryer-Ash M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that when insulin resistance was ameliorated in obese Zucker rats by administration of an adenoviral construct containing cDNA encoding for a soluble inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-α, this was associated with a consistent increase (>4-fold) in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of a 125-kDa protein, the identity of which was subsequently confirmed to be FAK (14Cheung A.T. Wang J. Ree D. Kolls J.K. Bryer-Ash M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, we further showed that pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor-α abolished insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK without altering IR abundance or IR tyrosine phosphorylation. In light of the above data, we undertook the present study to test the hypothesis that FAK plays an important role in the regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and insulin action. In the present work, we employ mutant FAK constructs overexpressed in HepG2 hepatoma cells and show that both the focal adhesion-targeting property and tyrosine kinase activity of FAK are essential for insulin-mediated stimulation of glycogen synthesis and that FAK acts to promote insulin action downstream of PI3K by a specific interaction with GSK-3β and Akt/PKB. Antibodies to FAK and GSK-3β were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-IR β-subunit, anti-IRS-1, and anti-p85 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibody to Akt and anti-phospho-specific Akt polyclonal antibody, which recognizes serine 473-phosphorylated Akt as well as anti-phospho-specific GSK-3β polyclonal antibody, which recognizes serine 9-phosphorylated GSK-3β, were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibody against phosphotyrosine (pY99) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Chemiluminescence kit, protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were all purchased from Pierce. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schuell. d-[U-14C]Glucose was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. UDP-[U-14C]glucose (303 mCi/mM) was from ICN (Irvine, CA). The pFLAG-CMV2 vector, anti-FLAG antibodies, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Mutant FAK cDNAs were FAK wild-type (WT), K454R mutant of FAK, in which Lys-454 was replaced by Arg (KR), or the COOH-terminal deletion variant dl686–1011 of FAK (FAT) (17Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript/KS (pBS, Stratagene). The cDNAs encoding WT and mutant forms of FAK were then excised from the pBS plasmid by SmaI and SalI digestion and directionally subcloned into EcoRV and SalI cut site of NH2-terminal FLAG-tagged pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector, since the COOH-terminal of FAK is required for location of FAK to the focal adhesion complex (17Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Insert orientations were confirmed by direct sequencing and restriction fragment analysis (data not shown). HepG2 is a cell line derived from a human hepatocyte carcinoma (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mmglutamine, and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 100-mm dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and were then transiently transfected using Tfx-20 reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) with pFLAG-CMV-expressing various FAK constructs as described above. Control cells were transfected with the pFLAG-CMV2 empty vector only. Transfection efficiency exceeded 50% (data not shown). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in fetal bovine serum-free DMEM before performing experiments. For insulin stimulation, recombinant human insulin was added to a final concentration of 100 nm. After the indicated treatment times, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and liquid N2 was added. 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing aprotinin (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was then added, and the cells were scraped off and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifugation tubes. They were incubated on ice for 40 min and vortexed frequently. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the clarified supernatants were separated into aliquots of equal protein content with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (Bio-Rad). Cells were suspended at 0.5 × 105cells/ml in complete medium, plated on 6-well plates in triplicate samples (0.5 × 105 cells/well), and transfected with FAK mutants. At 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, cells were harvested in 0.05% trypsin, EDTA and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma). 10 μl of suspended cells were then loaded onto a hemocytometer, and viable cells were counted under a light microscope. Cell growth was expressed as the number of live cells per well. Cell morphology was quantified by determination of the cellular aspect ratio according to the method of Ridyard and Sanders (18Ridyard M.S. Sanders E.J. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), after capturing the cell image on Image 1.61 software (NIH). Measurements were taken on 13 different cells in each culture. The aspect ratio was calculated as the long axis of the cell divided by its short axis. 500 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated with 10 μg of the respective antibody and agarose-conjugated Protein G at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 100 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin. The washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar) and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were blotted with various primary antibodies followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Results were visualized by Supersignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In cases where reblotting with a different primary antibody was required, the membrane was stripped by incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C with constant agitation. The membrane was then washed thoroughly in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and reprobed with the appropriate antibody. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Samples containing 500 μg of protein were precleared for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose that had previously been washed 3 times with lysis buffer and were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-GSK-3β or anti-Akt/PKB antibody. Protein G-Sepharose (40 μl of beads in suspension) was added, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. After washing the precipitates 3 times with lysis buffer, 20 μl of Laemmli stopping buffer was added to each pellet, and the samples were placed in boiling water for 10 min before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. When the blots were probed with the monoclonal anti-FAK antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse antibody was used as secondary antibody. The blots were then stripped by incubation in 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 50 °C for 30 min with agitation, followed by thorough rinsing, blocking, and reprobing with monoclonal GSK-3β or polyclonal Akt/PKB antibody. The determination of glycogen synthesis was made by measurement of the incorporation of d-[U-14C]glucose into glycogen (20Agius L. Peak M. Alberti K.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Confluent transfected HepG2 cells in 6-well plates were incubated overnight in fetal bovine serum-free DMEM and then for 3 h in fetal bovine serum-free DMEM containing 5.5 mm glucose and 0.33 μCi/ml d-[U-14C]glucose in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin. The incubation was terminated by removal of the medium and rinsing the cells five times in ice-cold PBS. Cells were solubilized with 20% KOH for 2 h, and an aliquot (100 μl) of the resulting lysate was removed for protein analysis. Lysates were extracted with 8% (w/v) tricarboxylic acid, neutralized with 2.0 m HCl, then boiled for 5 min, and 1 mg of glycogen was added as a carrier to each sample. Total glycogen was precipitated by the addition of 80% ethanol (final concentration) for 2 h at −20 °C followed by centrifugation at 1100 ×g for 10 min. This step was then repeated. After the pellets had been re-dissolved in distilled water, the samples were precipitated again as described above. The amount of incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. GS activity was determined by a modification of previously described methods (21Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 22Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence J.C., Jr. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26422-26427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells transfected with FAK mutants were incubated in serum-free medium overnight followed by the addition of 100 nm insulin or saline for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were scraped into 500 μl of GS assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% glycogen, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 40 min with frequent mixing. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the clarified supernatants were separated into aliquots with GS assay buffer to equal protein content (Bio-Rad). To measure GS activity, 50 μl of supernatant (4 μg of protein/μl) were added to an equal volume of GS buffer containing 2 μCi/ml UDP-[14C]glucose and 15 mg/ml glycogen in the presence or absence of 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, assay tubes were chilled for a further 15 min on ice. Contents were then spotted onto labeled Whatman filter papers (GF/A; 2.4 cm), which were immediately immersed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C, mixed for 40 min, then washed twice more in 70% ethanol (for 15 and 60 min) to remove unincorporated substrate from precipitated glycogen. Filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was counted with 10 ml of liquid scintillation fluid. PI3K activity was measured by the technique of Backer et al. (23Backer J.M. Schroeder G.G. Kahn C.R. Myers M.G., Jr. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1367-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with insulin, cells were lysed at 4 °C for 20 min in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40; 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting lysates were incubated with either anti-p85α or anti IRS-1 antibody for 2 h and then for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose (4 μg/ml of lysate). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A, 1% Nonidet P-40, twice with 0.5 m LiCl/100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and pellets were directly incubated with phosphatidylinositol (0.1 mg/ml) in medium containing 880 μm ATP (30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 20 mm MgCl2 at room temperature for 10 min with constant shaking in a final volume of 80 μl. After the addition of 20 μl of 8 m HCl, lipids were extracted with 160 μl CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, by volume). The samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel plate (Merck) and coated with 1% potassium oxalate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. All statistical comparisons were conducted using Student's 2-tailed t test for paired or unpaired samples as appropriate, with appropriate correction for multiple comparisons (SigmaStat statistical software version 2.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Data are reported as the means ± S.E. Recent studies have suggested several roles for integrin signaling via FAK in the regulation of cell survival (24Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y.

Overexpression of FAK stimulated cell migration, and mutation of Tyr-397 to Phe abolished this property (31Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of various constructs of FAK on cell proliferation and morphology, we first measured the growth rate of cells transfected with various constructs of FAK: FAK WT, K454R mutant of FAK, in which Lys-454 is replaced by Arg (KR), or the COOH-terminal deletion variant dl686–1011 of FAK (FAT). As shown in Fig. 1, the cell growth curves were similar among the 5 groups (Fig. 1 C), and 48 h after transfection all 3 of constructs were overexpressed by ∼4–5-fold. Analysis of cell shape showed that there were no significant differences in the morphology of the transfected and non-transfected cells. The mean values for the aspect ratio were 1.23 ± 0.04, 1.27 ± 0.06, and 1.20 ± 0.03 in WT and FAT- and KR mutant-transfected cells, respectively. The mean value in non-transfected cells was 1.24 ± 0.05. In HepG2 cells transfected with the FAT mutant, the expression level of endogenous FAK was similar to that of non-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, left), suggesting that transfection did not alter the cellular phenotype. Fig. 1 A, right, confirms the specificity of the anti-FLAG antibody for detecting exogenous FAK tagged with FLAG, since endogenous FAK is not visible. To determine the effects of insulin stimulation on FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, HepG2 cells, either untransfected or transfected with WT FAK, were treated with 100 nm insulin for 0–60 min. Extracts were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody then stripped and reblotted with anti-FAK antibody to quantify the amount of FAK immunoprecipitated. After 5 min of insulin treatment, a significant decrease in FAK phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity was observed in both groups versus the non-insulin-stimulated state (Fig. 2 A). The decrease in FAK phosphorylation in both groups was transient, because anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity gradually increased with longer exposure to insulin, indicating that FAK was either subsequently re-phosphorylated or phosphorylated on tyrosine residues that are not phosphorylated in the non-insulin-stimulated state. In the basal state, as reported by Hildebrand et al. (17Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), the kinase-defective variant KR FAK showed significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation. After exposure to insulin for 10 min, tyrosine phosphorylation of KR FAK was unchanged compared with basal levels (Fig. 2 B). This is an interesting observation indicating that the phosphorylation state of FAK is dependent upon its kinase activity. It has been reported that this protein may function in dominant negative fashion by occupying all of the potential binding sites for enzymatically active FAK (17Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). FAT-FAK showed an intermediate level of tyrosine phosphorylation, both in the presence and absence of insulin stimulation. The tyrosine phosphorylation state of FAK in the FAT and WT FAK groups was not significantly altered by insulin treatment (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of FAT and KR FAK effectively abolished incremental insulin-mediated glucose incorporation into glycogen in HepG2 cells, indicating that correct cellular localization and intact kinase activity of FAK are required for insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. The mutants appear to act in a dominant negative manner, since mutant expression did not markedly diminish expression of endogenous FAK (Fig. 1). However, overexpression of WT FAK did not increase basal or incremental insulin-mediated glucose incorporation into glycogen compared with that seen in untransfected or vector-transfected cells, suggesting that parental endogenous expression levels of FAK were sufficient for maximum insulin action. The basal mean values were similar in all groups at 128 ± 22, 127 ± 21, 147 ± 25, 140 ± 26, and 142 ± 24 pmol/1 h/mg of protein in NON, CMV2, WT, FAT, and KR, respectively. To determine the mechanism of the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in FAT and KR mutant cells, GS activity was assayed. An in vitro assay in which UDP-[14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined in the presence of GS precipitated from HepG2 cells overexpressing the WT and mutant forms of FAK was employed. The data are shown in Fig. 4 and demonstrate that incremental insulin-stimulated GS activity was significantly impaired in the presence of the two mutant FAK constructs. In NON, CMV2, and WT preparations, insulin stimulation led to a 2.3-, 2.1-, and 2.1-fold increase in GS activity, respectively. In contrast, in the preparations overexpressing FAT and KR, GS activity increased by 1.7- and 1.3-fold, respectively (p < 0.05 versus NON, CMV2, and WT). There was a significant difference between basal and insulin-stimul"

This steroid-binding inhibition was fully reversed when reducing agents were added to kidney cytosol obtained from mice treated for 5 h, but it was only partially reversed in cytosol obtained from mice treated for 10 days. Although the oligomeric structure of the MR-hsp90 heterocomplex was always unaffected, a decreased amount of MR protein was evidenced after the long term treatment. Such a deleterious effect was correlated with a post-translational modification of MR, as demonstrated by an increased level of receptor carbonylation. In addition, a failure at the elongation/termination step was also observed during the receptor translation process in a reticulocyte lysate system. Thus, a high polyribosomes/monomers ratio and both increased proteolysis and decreased ADP-ribosylatable concentration of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) were shown. Importantly, similar observations were also performed in vivo after depletion of glutathione. Notwithstanding the EF-2 functional disruption, not all renal proteins were equally affected as the MR. Interestingly, both EF-2 and MR expressed in old mice were similarly affected as inl-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine-treated young mice. We therefore propose that a dramatic depletion of glutathione in kidney cells mimics the cumulative effect of aging which, at the end, may lead to a renal mineralocorticoid dysfunction.

Regardless of its subcellular localization, this association stabilizes the receptor in its hormone binding and transcriptionally inactive form. It is thought that upon ligand binding, the steroid receptors undergo a conformational change that leads to the dissociation of the hsp90-heterocomplex, dephosphorylation, dimerization, translocation into the nucleus (for cytoplasmic receptors), hyperphosphorylation, and binding to specific hormone-responsive elements. Nonetheless, the actual temporal sequence of this cascade of events remains unclear. In contradiction to what was previously thought, it has been shown that the dissociation of the hsp90-heterocomplex upon steroid binding is not necessarily the first step in the signaling pathway (3.Galigniana M.D. Biochem.

For this translocation process, the activity of the Ser/Thr phosphatases seems to play a key role (3.Galigniana M.D. Biochem.

Interestingly, the MR nuclear translocation is abrogated by oxidative stress in intact kidney cells (2.Galigniana M.D. Curr. Top. Steroid Res. 2000; 3: 1-22Google Scholar). Several studies (10.Galigniana M.D. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 511-521Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11.Souque A. Fagart B. Coutte M.E. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

J. 1999; 341: 585-592Crossref Google Scholar) performed in vitro with both cell-free systems and cells in culture have demonstrated that cysteine groups on the MR play an essential role in steroid binding. We have recently provided direct evidence (14.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 263-280Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that the MR function is also affected in vivo in a similar manner as shown in vitro. Thus, inhibition of ALDO binding to renal MR was observed after administering mice a transition state inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase,l-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO). The consequent GSH deficiency paralleled the inhibition of the mineralocorticoid biological responses to the same extent after both short (5 h) and long (5 days) periods of treatment. We demonstrated that this effect was due to the inhibition of the steroid binding to MR due to oxidation of essential cysteine groups rather than changes on the receptor protein concentration. However, we subsequently observed that the level of expression of renal MR is systematically decreased after GSH depletion for longer times (i.e. 10 days). Inasmuch as a wide variety of renal disorders involve the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (15.Ceballos-Picot I. Witko-Sarsat V. Merad-Boudia M. Nguyen A.T. Thévenin M. Jaudon M.C.

Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), a decreased level of MR expression may be relevant to understand the regulation of the critical acid base and electrolyte balance under normal or pathological circumstances (e.g. oxidative stress, metal intoxications, aging, etc.). A profound imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants has been related to renal disorders, from minimal change nephritic syndrome to obstructive nephropathy (16.Nath K.A. Salahudeen A.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Baud L. Arcaillou R. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 20: F765-F776Google Scholar). Moreover, patients with end-stage renal failure on maintenance hemodialysis are chronically exposed to the oxidative stress generated by reactive oxygen species due to perdialytic neutrophil activation (19.Himmelfarb J. Ault K.A. Holbrook D. Leeber D.A. Hakim R.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1993; 4: 178-186PubMed Google Scholar). Increased concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) (20.Dasgupta A. Hussain S. Ahmad S. Nephron. 1992; 60: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), an intermediate product generated by lipid peroxidation, and decreased levels of GSH (15.Ceballos-Picot I. Witko-Sarsat V. Merad-Boudia M. Nguyen A.T. Thévenin M. Jaudon M.C. Zingraff J. Verger C. Jungers P. Descamps-Latscha B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) were also found in plasma and erythrocytes of hemodialyzed patients. Because the MR is not an exported protein, a decreased rate of protein synthesis and/or an increased protein degradation in renal cells may explain the observed diminution of MR levels under chronic oxidative conditions. The proposition that oxygen radical-mediated oxidation is a marking step in protein turnover is supported by several observations (reviewed in Refs. 21.Stadman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar and 22.Dean R.T. Fu S. Stocker R. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar and references therein) so that most of the studies were mainly focused on protein degradation. In agreement with this notion, it has been demonstrated recently that the turnover of oxidized proteins is enhanced in fibroblasts via proteosomal activity (23.Merker K. Sitte N. Grune T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the molecular mechanism for protein synthesis failure during the onset of oxidative stress has not been extensively studied and, consequently, is not completely defined. Because of this fact and also because oxidized MR seems to be more stable to thermal degradation (although incapable to bind steroid) than its “reduced” form (10.Galigniana M.D. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 511-521Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze the effect of oxidative stress generated by GSH depletion on the individual steps of polypeptide synthesis in kidney. By using the GSH-depleting agent BSO as an experimental model, we aimed to study the expression of renal MR, and we correlated this process with the elongation phase of protein synthesis under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Because the elongation phase only requires a small number of factors as compared with the initiation step, we also focused our analysis on the MR translation process. In particular, we searched for putative post-translational modifications of elongation factor 2 (EF-2), the main protein implicated in the elongation step. Finally, we discuss our molecular findings from the perspective of an integrated process that may take place under normal and pathological conditions. [1,2-3H]ALDO (50 Ci/mmol), [U-adenosine-14C]NAD (850 mCi/mmol), NaB[3H]4 (63 Ci/mmol), [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol),l-[3,4-3H]valine (55 Ci/mmol), and 125I-conjugated counterantibodies were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Reduced GSH, GSH monoethyl ester (GME),l-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), cumene hydroperoxide (CH), protein A-Sepharose, butylated hydroxyanisole, α-tocopherol, deferoxamine, mannitol, cysteine, sodium ascorbate, catalase from bovine liver, and diphtheria toxin from Corynebacterium diphtheriae were from Sigma. RU486 was a kind gift from Roussell-Uclaf (Romainville, France). Complete-MiniTM protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DNA encoding for full-length human MR was generously provided by Dr. R. Evans (24.Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). TNT Quick-coupled Transcription-Translation kit was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against EF-2 (25.Ayala A. Parrado J. Bougria M. Machado A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23105-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the MR (26.Robertson N.M. Schulman G. Karnik S. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1226-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were described previously. The mouse monoclonal IgG antibody against hsp90 was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Donkey anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibodies were from Pierce. Chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. BSO was dissolved in ethanol/propylene glycol/saline solution (3:5:32). Two daily intramuscular injections of 2.5 mmol BSO/kg were given to BALB/c mice (see below) at intervals of 12 h (8:00 and 20:00 h) during the indicated times. In co-treatments with GME, three doses of 2.0 mmol/kg of the ester were also injected (8:00, 14:00, and 20:00 h). The ALDO-dependent sodium retention and potassium elimination were measured in urine samples collected as described previously (14.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 263-280Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27.Burton G. Galigniana M.D. deLavallaz S. Brachet-Cota A. Sproviero E. Ghini A. Lantos C.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 535-543PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty-day-old and 18-month-old male BALB/c mice were adrenalectomized by dorsal approach and maintained with Purina Diet 1, saline solution supplemented with 50 μg/ml dexamethasone, and freshwater ad libitum. Two days before sacrifice, the steroid was omitted from the saline solution, and food was removed the previous night. Kidneys were excised after extensive perfusion with ice-cold phosphate saline solution, and renal cortex-medulla interphases were homogenized in 1 volume of buffer MOPS/Mo (20 mm MOPS, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 20 mm Na2MO4, at pH 7.5) containing 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture per 5 ml of solution. Homogenates were centrifuged at 67,000 × g for 45 min at 3 °C, and the supernatant of this centrifugation was referred to as cytosol. Renal cytosol was incubated for 12 h at 0 °C with 20 nm [3H]ALDO and 1.0 μm RU486 to mask the slight cross-reaction of ALDO with the glucocorticoid receptor. A 500-fold excess of radioinert ALDO was used to determine the nonspecific binding (20% of the total). Bound steroid was separated from free steroid by adding 1 volume of 2% charcoal, 0.2% dextran 15–20. ALDO binding to kidney MR was measured in vivo as described before (14.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 263-280Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28.Galigniana M.D. Vicent G.P. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Burton G. Lantos C.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 58-70Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30-day-old male mice were treated with vehicle, BSO, or BSO and GME for the indicated periods. An intraperitoneal injection of 10 μCi of [3H]ALDO and 20 μg of RU486 (±30 μg ALDO) was given. Kidneys were removed after 20 min and homogenized in buffer MOPS/Mo lacking DTT. Free [3H]ALDO was cleared from cytosol by adsorption with charcoal/dextran, and the samples were divided into equal fractions. The specific binding was measured either without further treatment or after reincubating cytosol with 10 nm[3H]ALDO (±500-fold ALDO) for 3 h at 0 °C in the absence or presence of 2 mm DTT. Free tracer was adsorbed with charcoal, and the radioactivity was measured. Polyribosomes and monomeric ribosomes were analyzed in post-mitochondrial supernatants treated with deoxycholate (∼65% of the total renal RNA) by using a 20–40% linear sucrose gradient as described previously (25.Ayala A. Parrado J. Bougria M. Machado A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23105-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The RNA profiles were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and then semi-quantified by planimetry. The procedure for the determination of total proteins was similar to the one described previously (25.Ayala A. Parrado J. Bougria M. Machado A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23105-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for liver. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg); the abdomen was opened, and 25 μCi of l-[3,4-3H]valine in 200 μl of saline solution was injected in the renal artery. Tissue samples were taken at the indicated times and immediately frozen under liquid nitrogen until homogenization in 3 volumes of 0.3 msucrose. Under these experimental conditions, the radioactivity was detected in kidney within 5–10 s after the injection of radioactive valine and continued at an approximately linear rate for 2.5–3.0 min. Therefore, we began to obtain tissue samples 20 s after the injection and during a total period of 2 min. Kidney homogenates in 0.3m sucrose were diluted with 1 volume of a buffer containing 100 mm Tris and 2 mm magnesium acetate and centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000 × g. Two ml of the supernatant were mixed with 0.2 ml of 20% sodium deoxycholate, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 15 min. Proteins in the resultant supernatant were used to quantify total and nascent chains. To measure radioactivity of total renal protein, an aliquot of this supernatant was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 90 °C for 1.5 h. Precipitated proteins were redissolved with protosol, and the radioactivity was counted. The incorporation of labeled valine into nascent polypeptides was determined layering 1.5 ml of supernatant on 6 ml of a medium containing 1 m sucrose, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 ml of a 100,000 × g supernatant obtained by 1 h of ultracentrifugation of kidney homogenate (1:2) in 50 mm triethanolamine, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl and 0.25 m sucrose (pH 7.3). The mixture was centrifuged at 25,000 × g, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water. Proteins were precipitated and the radioactivity counted as described above. We followed a standard technique as described previously (3.Galigniana M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 263-280Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, renal cytosol was incubated with the rabbit anti-MR immune serum (or non-immune rabbit serum) prebound to protein A-Sepharose and washed four times with ice-cold MOPS buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and MR and hsp90 were identified by Western blot analysis. The procedure was performed using the TNT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation kit from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant phMR3750 DNA encoding for full-length human MR (24.Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) inserted into polylinker EcoRI site of pGEM4 (Promega Biotech) was used as a template for transcription with T7 polymerase followed by translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. When the incubations were performed in the presence of oxidants, the reticulocyte lysate was preincubated for 60 min at 25 °C with either 2.0 mm CH and/or 5.0 mm BSO. In the protection assays against oxidants, a reducing solution was also simultaneously added to the medium at the following final concentrations: 20 μm butylated hydroxyanisole, 200 μm α-tocopherol, 5 mmGSH, 5 mm cysteine, 2 mm DTT, 1 mmsodium ascorbate, 20 mm mannitol, 3 mmdeferoxamine, and 0.5 mg/ml catalase. ADP-ribosylation was performed by a modification of the method used by Galicka et al. (29.Galicka A. Sredzinska K. Gindzienski A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 553-556Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Renal EF-2 was immunoprecipitated from renal cytosol with the rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against EF-2 precoupled to protein A-Sepharose. The immune pellet was washed twice with MOPS buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and twice with 20 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.4. The pellets were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μl of a solution containing 20 mm Tris, 10 mm DTT, 10 μm [14C]NAD, and 5 μg of diphtheria toxin. The pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, and the radioactivity incorporated to the immunopurified EF-2 was counted. EF-2 was isolated from the ribosome-free extract of rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described by Ryazanov and Davydova (30.Ryazanov A.G. Davydova E.K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparation was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue G-250 staining and parallel Western blotting with anti-EF-2 antibody. The rate of incorporation of [35S]Met to hMR in rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with pure EF-2 was measured after alkaline hydrolysis followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously (31.Davydova E. Malinin N.L. Ovchinnikov L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Renal GSH concentration was quantified by an enzymatic assay as described previously (14.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 263-280Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Carbonyl content in either renal microsomes or immunopurified proteins was measured by reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride according to Lenz et al. (32.Lenz A.-G. Costabel U. Shaltiel S. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). MDA was measured with the thiobarbituric standard method described by Estebauer and Cheeseman (33.Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2892) Google Scholar). Statistical tests were carried out by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni analysis. Table I shows that the renal concentration of GSH was dramatically decreased when mice were treated with the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor, BSO. Such an efficient depletion was achieved as soon as 5 h after a single injection of BSO. On the other hand, a co-treatment with the cell-permeable ester GME fully prevented the deleterious effect of BSO by preserving (and even increasing) the intracellular levels of GSH. In agreement with the onset of an oxidative intracellular milieu, an increased concentration of both MDA, a product generated by the break down of hydroperoxides, and protein carbonyls were also measured after acute (5 h) and prolonged (3 and 10 days) treatment. On the other hand, the levels of these two markers of oxidation were indistinguishable from untreated controls when mice were co-treated with BSO and GME.Table IOxidative stress abrogates the mineralocorticoid biological effectConditionRenal GSHaValues are given in μmol/g of renal tissue.MDAbValues are given in mmol/mg of microsomal protein.CObValues are given in mmol/mg of microsomal protein.Na+/K+ratiocThe Na+/K+ ratio in control mice was 1.27 ± 0.14.30-day-old mice2.51 ± 0.2116.1 ± 2.9351.3 ± 33.10.17 ± 0.04BSO 5 h0.34 ± 0.15dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.37.5 ± 9.3eValues different from control at p < 0.010.544.4 ± 22.7dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.0.44 ± 0.10dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001. 3 days0.18 ± 0.06dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.40.1 ± 1.8dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.635.9 ± 21.9dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.0.50 ± 0.11dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001. 10 days0.15 ± 0.08dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.61.4 ± 1.9dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.729.6 ± 45.0dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.0.58 ± 0.05dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.BSO + GME 5 h2.75 ± 0.1418.1 ± 3.0370.7 ± 20.80.15 ± 0.02 3 days4.04 ± 0.61eValues different from control at p < 0.010.14.4 ± 1.2318.0 ± 13.10.19 ± 0.09 10 days4.62 ± 1.01eValues different from control at p < 0.010.13.7 ± 3.1304.1 ± 21.20.21 ± 0.1218-Month-old mice1.87 ± 0.45eValues different from control at p < 0.010.36.0 ± 4.2dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.608.3 ± 32.1dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.0.37 ± 0.03dValues different from control (30-day-old mice) at p<0.001.Adrenalectomized 30-day-old or 18-month-old mice were treated with BSO or BSO and GME for the indicated times.

The mineralocorticoid effect (Na+/K+ratio) was measured in vivo after injecting a saturating dose of ALDO as described under “Materials and Methods.” Contents of GSH in renal cytosol and MDA and CO were also quantified in microsomal fractions. Results are the mean ± S.E. (n = 6). To evaluate the in vivo mineralocorticoid effect, a saturating dose (28.Galigniana M.D. Vicent G.P. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Burton G. Lantos C.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 58-70Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) of 2 μg of ALDO per 100 g of body weight was injected, and the anti-natriuretic and kaliuretic effects were measured. ALDO decreased the Na+/K+ urinary ratio by 80% in control adrenalectomized mice. However, the biological response to ALDO was attenuated after 5 h of BSO injection, so a 2.5-fold higher Na+/K+ ratio was measured. This effect was more significant for longer periods of treatment (3 and 10 days). Taken together, these results clearly confirm (14.Piwien-Pilipuk G. Galigniana M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 263-280Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that the depletion of renal GSH impairs the mineralocorticoid biological response. Interestingly, the data shown in Table I also suggest a similar effect of aging on the mineralocorticoid response. Thus, 18-month-old animals also exhibit high levels of protein carbonyls and MDA, as well as a decreased biological response to ALDO as compared with 30-day-old animals. To evaluate the MR binding capacity in vivo, control and BSO-treated mice were injected with [3H]ALDO, and kidneys were excised after 20 min, a time when renal radioactivity reaches a maximum level in kidney (28.Galigniana M.D. Vicent G.P. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Burton G. Lantos C.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 58-70Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Renal cytosol was obtained in MOPS/Mo buffer without DTT; free tracer was cleared by adsorption with charcoal/dextran, and the samples were divided into equal fractions. The specific binding (Fig. 1) was measured either without further treatment or after a reincubation of cytosols with [3H]ALDO in the absence or presence of 2 mmDTT. As expected, the treatment with BSO decreased the steroid binding capacity of MR under in vivo conditions, whereas this inhibition was fully prevented by co-treatment with GME. When radiolabeled cytosols were reincubated in vitro with [3H]ALDO, the specific binding remained unchanged (gray bars), indicating that the in vivo ALDO labeling had saturated the MR binding capacity. Consistent with the notion that an oxidative milieu inhibits the s"
https://openalex.org/W2006889352,"Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to investigate whether the two protease-sensitive sequences Phe156-Gly163 and Arg184-Ser191, of the manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP) from a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus (Motoki, A., Shimazu, T., Hirano, M., and Katoh, S. (1998) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1365, 492–502), are involved in functional interaction with photosystem II (PSII). The ability of MSP to bind to its functional site on the PSII complex and to reactivate oxygen evolution was dramatically reduced by the substitution of Arg152, Asp158, Lys160, or Arg162 with uncharged residues, by insertion of a single residue between Phe156 and Leu157, or by deletion of Leu157. Substitution of each of the four charged residues with an identically charged residue showed that the charges at Asp158, and possibly Lys160, are important for the electrostatic interaction with PSII. The reactivating ability was also strongly affected by the alteration of Phe156 to Leu. Replacement of Lys188, the only strictly conserved charged residue in the Arg184–Ser191 sequence, by Gln had only a marginal effect on the function of MSP. High affinity binding of MSP to PSII was also affected significantly by mutation at Arg152, which is located in a region (Val148–Arg152) strictly conserved among the 14 sequences so far reported. These results imply that the Val148–Gly163 sequence, which is well conserved among MSPs from cyanobacteria to higher plants, is a domain of MSP for functional interaction with PSII. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to investigate whether the two protease-sensitive sequences Phe156-Gly163 and Arg184-Ser191, of the manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP) from a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus (Motoki, A., Shimazu, T., Hirano, M., and Katoh, S. (1998) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1365, 492–502), are involved in functional interaction with photosystem II (PSII). The ability of MSP to bind to its functional site on the PSII complex and to reactivate oxygen evolution was dramatically reduced by the substitution of Arg152, Asp158, Lys160, or Arg162 with uncharged residues, by insertion of a single residue between Phe156 and Leu157, or by deletion of Leu157. Substitution of each of the four charged residues with an identically charged residue showed that the charges at Asp158, and possibly Lys160, are important for the electrostatic interaction with PSII. The reactivating ability was also strongly affected by the alteration of Phe156 to Leu. Replacement of Lys188, the only strictly conserved charged residue in the Arg184–Ser191 sequence, by Gln had only a marginal effect on the function of MSP. High affinity binding of MSP to PSII was also affected significantly by mutation at Arg152, which is located in a region (Val148–Arg152) strictly conserved among the 14 sequences so far reported. These results imply that the Val148–Gly163 sequence, which is well conserved among MSPs from cyanobacteria to higher plants, is a domain of MSP for functional interaction with PSII. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is mediated by PSII, 1The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIMSPextrinsic 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing proteinEDC1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimideMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid a multiprotein complex carrying chlorophylls, carotenoids, and a variety of redox cofactors (for reviews see Refs. 1.Seidler A.

Among the protein components of PSII, the extrinsic 33-kDa protein is also called the manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP) and is associated with the lumenal surface of the PSII complex together with two or three other extrinsic proteins, i.e. the 23-kDa and 17-kDa proteins in higher plants and green algae (3.Murata N. Miyao M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 122-124Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar), cytochromec 550 and a 12-kDa protein in cyanobacteria (4.Shen J.-R. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c 550, the 12-kDa protein, and a 20-kDa protein in red algae (5.Enami I. Murayama H. Ohta H. Kamo M. Nakazato K. Shen J.-R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MSP stabilizes the manganese cluster, which catalyzes oxidation of water to molecular oxygen. Dissociation of the protein by washing with 1 mCaCl2 or MgCl2 (6.Ono T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 381-384Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or 2.6 m urea plus 0.2 m NaCl (7.Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar) leads to a gradual release of two of four Mn2+ ions present in the cluster. Oxygen evolution is strongly suppressed by the release of MSP, but the lost activity can be restored by rebinding of the protein (8.Kuwabara T. Miyao M. Murata T. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 283-289Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9.Ono T. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 380-389Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because no cofactor is associated with MSP, it is considered that binding of the protein itself is responsible for optimal activity of oxygen evolution. photosystem II extrinsic 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing protein 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid Cross-linking experiments with various bifunctional reagents have shown that MSP is associated with or in close proximity to essentially all of the major intrinsic proteins of the PSII complex (10.Enami I.

Various attempts have been made to locate binding sites for PSII or identify amino acid residues on MSP that are involved in binding to its functional site on the PSII complex. The N-terminal sequence of spinach MSP was suggested to have a binding site to PSII because removal of 16 or 18 amino acid residues from its N terminus by protease digestion resulted in total loss of the protein binding (16.Eaton-Rye J.J. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence was presented indicating that the N-terminal sequence is necessary for maintaining the binding ability of the protein to PSII but might not be involved in the intermolecular binding itself (17.Seidler A. Rutherford A.W. Michel H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that Asp9, the only conserved, charged residue in the N-terminal 18-amino acid sequence, might engage in both intra- and intermolecular interactions (18.Qian M. Al-Khaldi S.F. Putnam-Evans C. Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15244-15252Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cross-linking with EDC, which covalently links amino and carboxyl groups in van der Waals contact, indicated that MSP is bound directly to CP47, an intrinsic chlorophyll-carrying protein of the PSII complex through electrostatic interaction (10.Enami I. Satoh K. Katoh S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 226: 161-165Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11.Bricker T.M. Odam W.R. Queirolo C.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 111-117Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12.Enami I. Kaneko M. Kitamura N. Koike H. Sonoike K. Inoue Y. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 224-232Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Analysis of EDC-cross-linked products showed that a charge-pair interaction exists between a charged residue in the Asp1–Lys76 sequence of the spinach MSP and an oppositely charged residue in the Phe364–Asp440 sequence of CP47 (13.Odom W.R. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5616-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Chemical modification with specific reagents showed that six conserved lysyl residues distributed over the entire sequence of spinach MSP are accessible to at least one of the reagents when the protein is free in solution but not when the protein is associated with PSII membranes (19.Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7492-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20.Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K. Nakazato K. Inoue Y. Enami I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests that these lysyl residues are located in domains of the protein that are in contact with the PSII complex and might participate in intermolecular interaction. Cross-linking of the Lys159–Lys236 domain of spinach MSP to CP47 with a reagent that cross-links lysyl residues within a 1.2-nm radius has been reported (21.Queirola C.B. Doctoral dissertation. Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge1992Google Scholar). Four arginyl residues of the spinach protein may also be involved in the binding to PSII because they were modified with a specific reagent only when the protein was free in solution (20.Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K. Nakazato K. Inoue Y. Enami I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Involvement of negatively charged amino acid residues on MSP in binding to PSII was also suggested by EPR studies with a free radical-relaxing agent dysprosium, which showed that the binding site for MSP on the PSII complex is positively charged (22.Isogai Y. Nishimura M. Itoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1493-1499Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments in which carboxyl groups of spinach MSP were activated for cross-linking prior to reconstitution with PSII membranes or vice versa, showed that all carboxyl groups involved in intermolecular cross-linking with EDC are located on MSP (23.Seidler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of spinach MSP was strongly reduced by chemical modification of carboxyl groups of aspartyl and glutamyl residues with glycine methyl ester when it was free in solution but not when it was bound to PSII membrane (24.Frankel L.K. Cruz J.A. Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14271-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reduced binding affinity was related to modification of two or three acidic amino acid residues located in domains Asp157–Asp168 and Glu212–Gln247, because these residues were modified only when the protein was free in solution. Mutation of Asp159 to other residues in Synechocystis MSP affected oxygen evolution significantly (25.Burnap R.L. Qian M. Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13712-13718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in another study, chemical modification of carboxyl groups with glycine methyl ester failed to affect the ability of the spinach protein to reactivate oxygen evolution upon reconstitution at a high protein/PSII ratio (20.Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K. Nakazato K. Inoue Y. Enami I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of completely or partially conserved aspartyl and glutamyl residues on spinach MSP was performed, but none of the mutations had a dramatic effect (26.Seidler A. Röll K. Michel H. Murata N. Current Research in Photosynthesis. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1992: 409-412Google Scholar, 27.Seidler A. Michel H. Rutherford A.W. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 259-262Google Scholar). All of the mutant proteins were able to bind to PSII membranes, and the ability of the protein to reactivate oxygen evolution was only marginally affected by alteration of several residues. Thus, amino acid residues on MSP that are involved in functional interaction with PSII still remain to be identified. We showed previously that cleavage of MSP from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus at a single site between Phe156 and Gly163, or between Agr184 and Ser191, by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or lysylendopeptidase resulted in total loss of the ability of the protein to bind to PSII and to restore the oxygen-evolving activity (28.Motoki A. Shimazu T. Hirano M. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Introduction of a nick between Phe156 and Leu157, a cleavage site specific to chymotrypsin, by site-directed mutagenesis also led to loss of the binding and reactivating ability of MSP. The cause of the inactivation of MSP may, however, not be related to a local change at the protease-cleavage site, because the mutation was accompanied by a significant change in the secondary conformation of the protein. Insertion of a methionyl residue between Phe156 and Leu157 abolished functional binding of MSP and unexpectedly created an appreciable binding affinity for nonspecific sites of the PSII complex. Because the protein conformation was little affected by insertion of the residue, the observed changes in the protein binding were ascribed to a small structural change(s) in the mutated polypeptide. Based on these observations, we proposed that the two protease-sensitive regions, Phe156–Gly163 and Arg184–Ser191, are possible candidates for interaction with the PSII complex. In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to identify the amino acid residues involved in effective binding ofSynechococcus MSP to PSII. Conserved, charged residues in the first protease-sensitive sequences were substituted with an uncharged residue, and the ability of the mutant proteins to bind to urea/NaCl-washed PSII and to restore the oxygen evolution was determined. Charge-preserving substitution with an identically charged residue was also performed to examine whether the residues are involved in electrostatic interaction. For comparison, conserved, uncharged residues in and near the first protease-sensitive sequence Phe156–Gly163 and conserved, charged residues in other domains of the protein were altered. The results obtained indicate that Arg152, Phe156, Asp158, Lys160, and Arg162 located in or near the first protease-sensitive sequence are essential for binding of MSP to its functional site. Mutant proteins were also constructed by inserting a residue with a side group smaller than that of Met between Phe156 and Leu157 or by deleting Leu157, in order to elucidate the structural configuration of MSP around Phe156 and Leu157, which are required for the functional binding of MSP. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method described previously (28.Motoki A. Shimazu T. Hirano M. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The pET8c expression vector, which contains the wild-type psbOgene of S. elongatus, was constructed as described (29.Motoki A. Shimazu T. Hirano M. Katoh S. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 487-490Google Scholar). TheXbaI/BamHI fragment of the vector containing the whole psbO gene was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pBluescriptII phagemid vector (Stratagene) and subcloned intoSacI/HindIII site of the M13mp18 phagemid vector. The Sculpture™ in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to introduce a desired mutagenesis into a M13mp18 template (30.Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 31.Nakamae K.L. Eckstein F.

The synthesized, mutagenic oligonucleotides employed are shown in Table I. The mutation was checked by sequencing the single-stranded DNA of each mutated psbO gene. The mutated psbO genes were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the mutant MSPs were purified by the same method employed for isolation of the wild-type MSP (29.Motoki A. Shimazu T. Hirano M. Katoh S. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 487-490Google Scholar).

Satoh K. Katoh S. Plat Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 299-305Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes suspended in solution A (50 mmMES/NaOH (pH 6.0), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2) containing 1 m sucrose (1 mg of chlorophyll/ml) were treated with 0.20–0.25% sucrose monolaurate for 1 h at 20 °C in the dark. After the addition of an equal volume of solution A to reduce the sucrose concentration to 0.5 m, 2 volumes of the suspension was placed on 1 volume of solution A containing 1 m sucrose and centrifuged at 300,000 ×g for 1 h. A green band that appeared at the interface between 0.5 and 1 m sucrose contained PSII complexes. The complexes were collected by centrifugation at 370,000 ×g for 40 min and suspended in solution A containing 25% glycerol. PSII complexes were treated with 2.6m urea and 0.2 m NaCl for 30 min at 0 °C to extract the three extrinsic proteins, precipitated by centrifugation, and suspended in solution A containing 25% glycerol. Washed PSII complexes were incubated with each mutant protein in 20 mmMES/NaOH (pH 6.0), 10 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol at 0 °C at an indicated protein/PSII ratio. A stoichiometry of 45 chlorophylls/PSII was assumed for the PSII complexes (33.Ichimura T. Miyairi S. Satoh K. Katoh S. Plat Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 299-305Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h, the PSII complexes were precipitated by centrifugation at 370,000 × g for 40 min and then washed once with and resuspended in 50 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 25% glycerol. Wild-type and mutant MSPs bound to PSII were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples were denatured with 5% SDS and 60 mmdithiothreitol for 30 min, then applied to polyacrylamide gels. The acrylamide concentration was 4.5% for the stacking gel and 12.5% for the resolving gel, and both gels contained 0.1% SDS and 6m urea. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and scanned at 560 nm with an ATTO AE-6900 densitometer. Amounts of MSPs bound to PSII were estimated by measuring the peak area of the protein with that of CP47 as reference. Oxygen evolution was determined with a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 40 °C as described (33.Ichimura T. Miyairi S. Satoh K. Katoh S. Plat Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 299-305Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). White light of a saturating intensity was provided from a halogen lamp (Watanabe Shoko R&D Corp). The reaction medium contained 50 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.0), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 m sucrose, and 0.4 mm2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone. Far-UV and near-UV CD spectra were determined with a JASCO J-820 spectrometer. Data were collected every 0.1 nm with a bandwidth of 1 or 2 nm and a 0.5-s time constant. For determination of the far-UV CD spectra, proteins were dissolved in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) at a protein concentration of 80 μg/ml, which was determined by amino acid analysis. Eight repetitive scans were collected and averaged; the secondary structure elements were analyzed with the program VARSLC (34.Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar,35.Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Near-UV CD spectra were determined with proteins dissolved in 20 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.5). Measurement was repeated 6–16 times depending on the protein concentrations (see Fig. 4), and the signals obtained were averaged. There are several lines of evidence indicating that binding of MSP to its functional site involves electrostatic interactions between charged amino acid residues on the protein and oppositely charged residues on intrinsic proteins of PSII (6.Ono T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 381-384Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7.Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 36.Enami I. Tomo T. Kitamura M.

Acta. 1994; 1186: 52-58Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Single-amino acid substitution experiments were, therefore, performed for conserved, charged residues located in the two protease-sensitive sequences. The first protease-sensitive sequence, Phe156–Gly163, contains two positively charged amino acid residues, Lys160 and Arg162, and a negatively charged residue, Asp158, which are completely conserved among 14 sequences of MSPs from cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants (Fig. 1). Mutant proteins were constructed by replacing Lys160 and Arg162with Gln (K160Q,R162Q), and by replacing Asp158 with Asn (D158N). Binding affinities of the mutant proteins to PSII were determined by measuring the amount of each mutant protein bound to urea/NaCl-washed PSII at different protein/PSII ratios. Reconstituted PSII complexes were washed once to remove loosely bound MSP. As shown in Fig. 2, binding of wild-type MSP was saturated at a protein/PSII ratio of two. A further increase in the protein/PSII ratio led to only a small increase in the amount of the protein bound, reflecting the ability of the protein to bind specifically and stoichiometrically to its functional site on the PSII complex. On the other hand, binding of the protein to PSII complexes was dramatically altered by the mutations introduced. The binding curves of the K160Q and R162Q mutant proteins were sigmoidal, and the amounts of the two mutant proteins bound to PSII at low protein/PSII ratios were much lower than that of the wild-type protein, indicating that alteration of Lys160 and Arg162 leads to a large decrease in the binding affinity for the functional site. At protein/PSII ratios above four, the amount of mutant proteins bound increased linearly with an increase in protein concentration; this increase is apparently steeper than that of the wild-type protein. This is a feature of nonspecific binding that has been described first for mutant proteins with Met inserted between Phe156 and Leu157 and with Leu157 replaced by Met (28.Motoki A. Shimazu T. Hirano M. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was particularly enhanced upon substitution of Asp158 with Asn so that the amount of the D158N mutant protein bound to PSII far exceeded that of the wild-type protein at a protein/PSII ratio of six. Nevertheless, the high-affinity binding of the protein to PSII was appreciably reduced by the mutation. The results show that all three of the conserved, charged residues located in the Phe156–Gly163 sequence are required for high affinity binding of the protein to PSII, consistent with the notion that the first protease-sensitive sequence is a domain for interaction with PSII. The high affinity binding, however, was also severely affected by alteration of Arg152 to Gln, which is located three residues upstream of the first protease-sensitive sequence. This indicates that the binding domain is larger than the Phe156–Gly163 sequence and possibly involves the Val148–Arg152 sequence, which is strictly conserved in all the sequences of MSP shown in Fig. 1.Figure 2Effects of substitution of Arg152, Asp158, Lys160, and Arg162 with an uncharged residue on the binding affinity of MSP to PSII. Urea/NaCl-washed PSII complexes were reconstituted with each mutant protein at the indicated protein/PSII ratios. The amount of wild-type protein bound to PSII at the protein/PSII ratio of three was taken as 100%. ●, wild-type MSP; ▵, D158N; ▴, R152Q; ○, K160Q; ×, R162Q.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of the substitution mutations on the ability of MSP to restore the oxygen-evolving activity were also investigated. As shown in Table II, oxygen evolution was strongly suppressed by urea/NaCl washing, but the activity was partially restored by the addition of wild-type MSP. This reflects the normal function of the protein because the small magnitude of reactivation (about 30% of activity in untreated PSII complexes) can be ascribed to the following two reasons. First, the full activity of oxygen evolution of cyanobacterial or red algal PSII requires three or four extrinsic proteins (38.Shen J.-R. Inoe Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 39.Enami I. Kikuchi S. Fukuda T. Ohta H. Shen J.-R.

Plant cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1354-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); MSP only partially supports the activity. Second, the smaller reactivating effect of MSP may be because a larger proportion of PSII preparations had been irreversibly damaged during protein extraction. This, however, will in principle not affect our reconstitution results as far as the comparison of the relative effects of wild-type and mutant MSPs is concerned. The mutations that strongly affected the high affinity binding of the protein had a severe impact on the reactivation ability of MSP. The levels of oxygen evolution restored by the mutant MSPs were only less than 20% of that restored by wild-type protein even at a protein/PSII ratio of five. The results confirm that the four charged residues are essential for functional interaction with PSII and that the nonspecific binding to PSII is nonfunctional. Table II also shows that not all of the strictly conserved, charged residues are required for the function of MSP. Substitution of Lys188, the only strictly conserved, charged residue in the second protease-sensitive sequence, Arg184–Ser191 with Gln, had only a marginal effect on the reactivation ability of MSP. This casts a doubt on the notion that the second protease-sensitive sequence is a region for interaction with PSII. The alteration of Lys59, Arg73, Lys123, and Lys234 to Gln had no effect on the function of MSP. Thus, inactivation of MSP is specific to the substitution of a charged residue in the Val148–Gly163 sequence. The present study, however, does not exclude the existence of a binding site for PSII in other regions of the protein because there are still eight strictly conserved, charged residues that remain to be investigated (see Fig. 1).Table IIEffects of substitution of a charged amino-acid residue with an uncharged residue on the ability of MSP to restore oxygen-evolving activityPreparationsAdditionsOxygen evolutionReactivationμmol of O2/mg of chlorophyll/h%PSII complexesNone1153 Washed PSII complexesNone410 Washed PSII complexesWild-type MSP306100 Washed PSII complexesD158N8918 Washed PSII complexesK160Q7111 Washed PSII complexesR162Q8818 Washed PSII complexesR152Q8216PSII complexesNone1065 Washed PSII complexesNone780 Washed PSII complexesWild-type MSP360100 Washed PSII complexesK59Q34594 Washed PSI"

We show that although expression of IRK1 in HEK 293 cells leads to the appearance of a potassium current with strong inward rectifying properties, coexpression of the constitutively active form of Ras (Ras-L61) results in a significant reduction of the mean current density without altering the biophysical properties of the channel. The inhibitory effect of Ras-L61 is not due to a decreased expression of IRK1 since Northern analysis indicates that IRK1 mRNA level is not affected by Ras-L61 co-expression. Moreover, the inhibition can be relieved by treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059. Confocal microscopy analysis of cells transfected with the fusion construct green fluorescent protein-IRK1 shows that the channel is mainly localized at the plasma membrane. Coexpression of Ras-L61 delocalizes fluorescence to the cytoplasm, whereas treatment with PD98059 partially restores the membrane localization. In conclusion, our data indicate that the Ras-MAPK pathway modulates IRK1 current by affecting the subcellular localization of the channel. This suggests a role for Ras signaling in regulating the intracellular trafficking of this channel.

This suggests a role for Ras signaling in regulating the intracellular trafficking of this channel. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels play a key role in stabilizing resting membrane potential in both excitable and non-excitable cells. IRK1/Kir 2.1 is a member of this family, showing strong inward rectification properties. It is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types including neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system, glia, muscle, and immune system cells. Phosphorylation of IRK1 protein at both serine/threonine and tyrosine sites modulates its activity. The channel is a substrate of protein kinase A and protein kinase C, and direct activation of these kinases modulates the current (1.Wischmeyer E. Karschin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2.Jones S.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 662-667PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, a reduction of IRK1 conductance has been demonstrated after activation of muscarinic (2.Jones S.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 662-667PubMed Google Scholar) and tyrosine kinase receptors (3.Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Karschin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34063-34068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Muscarinic m1 receptors modulate IRK1 probably through protein kinase C, and the small GTPase Rho has been implicated in this effect (4.Jones S.V.P. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26 (Abstr. 802.7.2000)Google Scholar). The activation of nerve growth factor receptors leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IRK1 and to its endocytosis, although it is not yet clear which kinase is involved (5.Tong Y. Brandt G. Li M. Shapopalov G. Slimko E. Karschin A. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the role of Ras and of the downstream MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinaseRas-L61constitutively active form of RasHEKhuman embryonic kidneyGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPEGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorNHSN-hydroxysuccinimidehhumanmmouse pathway on the modulation of IRK1 current. To this purpose and to avoid receptor-mediated effects, we transfected the active form of Ras (Ras-L61) in HEK 293 cells together with the IRK1 channel. We found that activated Ras decreases IRK1 current without modifying the channel properties and that it does so acting through the MAPK kinase pathway. This effect seems to be due to a reduction of channel density at the cell surface, thus suggesting the involvement of the Ras-MAPK pathway in the regulation of IRK1 localization. mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase constitutively active form of Ras human embryonic kidney green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP epidermal growth factor EGF receptor N-hydroxysuccinimide human mouse HEK 293 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and kept in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes (1.4 × 105 cells per dish) and transfected with 2 μg of total DNA per dish using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). In cotransfection experiments, the different constructs were always used in a ratio of 1:3 for IRK1 and Ras, respectively. An empty vector was used to normalize the total amount of plasmid transfected. Cells were used 48 h after the transfection in all the experiments. The mouse IRK1 (mIRK1) cDNA, originated from a mouse macrophage cell line (6.Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), has been kindly provided by Dr. L. Yan. A deleted version of mIRK1 missing all the 3′ non-coding region of IRK1, obtained by digestion with BSTX1 and insertion of the 1.7-kb BSTX1 fragment into a pcDNAI vector (3′Δ−mIRK1), was used as a probe for Northern analysis. The enhanced green fluorescent protein-human IRK1 (EGFP-hIRK1) fused construct, EGFP being at the N terminus of hIRK1, was kindly provided by Dr. D. C. Johns (7.Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive active form of Ha-Ras (Ras-L61) fused to a Myc epitope was obtained by PCR modification of 5′ and 3′ ends of Ras in pRSV-Ras-L61 in order to create BamHI and EcoRI sites. The fragment was cloned into pBS-Nmyc2 and sequenced, and after excision of Myc-Ras with SalI, it was subcloned into pcDNAIII linearized with XhoI. EGF receptor (EGFR) fused in C-terminal to GFP was kindly provided by Jovin (8.Brock R. Hamelers I.H.L. Jovin T.M. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Classical patch clamp methodology in whole cell configuration was used; currents were amplified by an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). We carefully compensated pipette capacity, cell capacity, and series resistance before each voltage clamp protocol. Currents were not leakage-subtracted before acquisition. Experimental protocols, data acquisition, and analysis were done using pCLAMP 7 (Axon Instruments) and Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA) software. All experiments were performed at room temperature, and current traces were filtered at 5 kHz. Currents were measured with pipettes having 3–4 megohm resistance filled with (in mm): 135 sodium aspartate, 0.2 CaCl2, 1.6 MgCl2, 10 HEPES-KOH, 2 EGTA; the pH was set at 7.35. The extracellular control solution contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 6 glucose, 10 HEPES-NaOH at pH 7.35. In the test solutions, 40 mm KCl replaced an equivalent amount of NaCl. Cells were normally kept in the control solution, whereas test solutions were superfused by gravity at close proximity of the cell by a rapid solution changer (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Cells transfected with EGFP-hIRK1 displayed much higher currents with respect to those transfected with mIRK1; the control solution, containing 4 mm KCl, was therefore perfused in this case to ensure the correct operation of the patch clamp amplifier (9.Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995Google Scholar). When specified, cells were incubated for 2 h in a 5% CO2 saturated atmosphere at 37 °C with 40 μm PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), a selective inhibitor of MEK (10.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Leakage, obtained by perfusing the cells with the respective solutions containing 100 μm BaCl2, was subtracted during off-line analysis, and the resulting currents were normalized to cell capacity. For electrophysiological experiments in which mIRK1 was used, plasmid containing EGFP was always cotransfected in order to check the efficiency of transfection by visual observation with a fluorescence microscope. Almost 60% of the transfected cells resulted in fluorescence, and 90% of the fluorescent cells displayed the potassium current. For patch clamp experiments, bright fluorescent cells of medium size were chosen. All electrophysiological experiments were done 48 h after transfection at room temperature. All mean values were calculated from not less than three different transfections for each combination of constructs transfected (see figure legends for details). The electrophysiological data, where indicated, were statistically analyzed applying a two-population (independent) Student's t test with significance intervals as specified in the figure legends. Western blots using antibodies against the Myc epitope-tagged protein were performed to check for Ras-L61 expression For Northern analysis, HEK 293 and NIH 3T3 cells plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 6 μg of mIRK1 and 18 μg of Myc-Ras-L61 or with 18 μg of pCDNA1 vector. 48 h after transfection, total RNA was extracted (11.Tonini R. Mancinelli E. Balestrini M. Mazzanti M. Martegani E. Ferroni A. Sturani E. Zippel R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and subjected to DNase treatment according to published protocol (12.Ausubel F.M. Brent G. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Supplement 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1999: 4.1.4-4.1.6Google Scholar). The RNA (20 μg for sample) was separated by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, blotted on a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in 10× SSC overnight, and fixed. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C. The DNA template used was the 3′Δ−mIRK1 digested with HindIII. Riboprobe was synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α-32P]UTP at 40 °C for 45 min. After hybridization, the filter was washed at 68 °C in 5× SSC for 10 min, 2× SSC for 40 min, 1× SSC for 40 min, and twice in 1× SSC + 0.1% SDS for 45 min. The signal was detected by autoradiography. HEK 293 cells plated in 35-mm dishes were transfected with EGFP-hIRK1 and a control plasmid or with EGFP-hIRK1 and Ras-L61 (maintaining the ratio of 1:3 between IRK1 and Ras-L61/control plasmid cDNAs). 48 h after transfection, cells were treated or not with PD98059 for 3 h, and total proteins were extracted in SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of total proteins (40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with antibodies raised against hIRK1; polyclonal antibodies (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel); MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); phosphoMAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); or Myc (9E10, Berkeley Antibody, Richmond, CA). Bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). HEK 293 cells plated in 60-mm dishes were transfected with EGFP-hIRK1 with or without Ras-L61 (in a ratio of 1:3). 48 h after transfection, cells were biotinylated using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline on ice. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline, and biotinylated proteins were absorbed using immobilized streptavidin (Sigma). Absorbed material was collected and analyzed by Western blot using either hIRK1 or EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. HEK 293 cells plated on glass coverslips were transfected with EGFP-hIRK1 with or without Ras-L61. A parallel set of plates was transfected with EGFR-GFP construct in the presence or not of Ras-L61, maintaining in all cases the ratio of 1:3 as described above. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained from living cells. A Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) equipped with a krypton-argon laser and mounted on an upright Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used to acquire the images through a 63X Plan Neofluar oil immersion objective; a ×1–×3 zoom factor was applied to the scanned images during acquisition. The expression of the mIRK1 channel in HEK 293 cells allows the detection of a typical inward rectifying current that is activated at potentials below the potassium equilibrium potential (Fig. 1B) (in our case EK = −32 mV was calculated from the Nernst equation considering the experimental conditions) and that is completely blocked by 100 μm extracellular Ba2+ (Fig. 1C) (6.Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with a control plasmid did not display either macroscopic endogenous currents or the Ba2+-sensitive inward current (Fig. 1A). Cotransfection with Ras-L61, a constitutively active form of Ras, led to a significant reduction of the mean current density (by 43.3% at Vtest = −100 mV; p < 0.01); current kinetics and voltage dependence were not affected (Fig. 2). This effect was specific for the active form of Ras since cotransfection with the same amount of plasmid carrying the cDNA encoding wild type Ras did not modify the current density and its kinetics (data not shown). To distinguish whether the effect of Ras-L61 on mIRK1 channels depended on Ras itself or on the activation of the MAPK pathway, transfected cells were preincubated with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, for 2 h before the electrophysiological determinations. As shown in Fig. 2, PD98059 completely reversed the inhibitory effect of Ras-L61 at all membrane potentials tested, although it did not affect the current in cells transfected with the channel alone. This observation suggests that the modulation of the IRK1 current by activated Ras is mediated by the Ras-MAPK cascade. We then verified whether the decrease in current density observed in the presence of Ras-L61 was due to a modification of mIRK1 expression. Cells were transfected with mIRK1 without or with Ras-L61 maintaining at 1:3 the ratio between mIRK1 and Ras-L61. Cells were then treated or not with PD98059 for 3 h. Northern blot analyses for mIRK1 carried out on total RNA are reported in Fig. 3. The expected length of the messenger RNA for mIRK1 is 5.4 kb since the cDNA for mIRK1 includes, in addition to the 1.7-kb open reading frame, a 3′ untranslated region of about 3.7 kb. A band with the expected 5.4-kb length was evident although faint in transfected HEK 293 cells, whereas a more intense band of about 1.7 kb was evident in the same lanes. No bands were detected by the mIRK1 probe in HEK 293 cells transfected with the control plasmid. The intensity of the two bands was not modified either by cotransfection with Ras-L61 or by a 3-h pretreatment with PD98059, indicating that neither Ras-L61 nor PD98059 modify the expression of mIRK1. Interestingly, when the same construct was transfected in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (of mouse origin), three different transcripts were detected, and the 5.4-kb band was also highly represented. The finding obtained in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts confirms that, as observed in HEK 293 cells, transfected mIRK1 cDNA gives rise, in addition to the 5.4-kb band, also to shorter RNA products possibly due to alternative polyadenylation and/or early termination of the transcription. To further analyze the modulatory effect of the Ras/MAPK pathway on IRK1 and to study the cellular distribution of the channel, we utilized an EGFP-hIRK1 construct (7.Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coding for the green fluorescent protein fused in its C-terminal to the human Kir2.1 channel. Electrophysiological measurements (Fig. 4A) allowed the detection of a Ba2+-sensitive current, which showed the typical inward rectification properties as already described (13.Wood L.S. Tsai T.D. Lee K.S. Vogeli G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the whole cell currents exhibited by the human isoform fused to GFP were very similar to those produced by the mouse isoform (compare Figs.2A and 4A). The differences in shape of the I/V curves are probably due to intrinsic properties of the two channel isoforms; the human channel has a characteristic outward component (13.Wood L.S. Tsai T.D. Lee K.S. Vogeli G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) not present in mIRK1. The shift of the curves toward more positive potentials (compare Figs. 2B and Fig. 4B) is caused instead by the reduction of [K+] in the extracellular solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). As already reported for mIRK1, also for human IRK1 construct, cotransfection with Ras-L61 largely reduced, by 50%, the mean current density (see Table I). A 2-h pretreatment with PD98059 reverted the current density to values close to that observed in cells transfected with EGFP-hIRK1 alone. On the other hand, PD98059 had no significant effect on EGFP-hIRK1-transfected cells. To investigate whether Ras modifies the level of IRK1 protein, equal amounts of protein from cells transfected with EGFP-hIRK1, with or without Ras-L61 and treated or not with PD98059, were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-hIRK1 antibodies.Table IEffect of Ras-L61 and PD98059 on EGFP-hIRK1 currentTransfection/treatmentMean Imem(pA/pF)S.E.nEGFP-hIRK1−107±11.736EGFP-hIRK1/PD98059−115±11.535EGFP-hIRK1 + Ras-L61−53.2athe mean that is statistically significant from the others (p < 0.01).±8.139EGFP-hIRK1 + Ras-L61/PD98059−87±13.235Mean whole cell currents at Vtest = −100 mV normalized to the cell capacitance and leakage subtracted; a two-population t test has been applied between all the groups of data in all the combinations possible.a the mean that is statistically significant from the others (p < 0.01). Open table in a new tab Mean whole cell currents at Vtest = −100 mV normalized to the cell capacitance and leakage subtracted; a two-population t test has been applied between all the groups of data in all the combinations possible. Fig. 5 shows that similar levels of EGFP-hIRK1 protein were present in all conditions. As an internal standard, the expression of the endogenous protein ERK2 was analyzed, confirming comparable loading in all lanes. Immunoblot analysis using anti-Myc antibodies detected a protein with the expected 21 kDa molecular size only in cells transfected with the Ras-L61 construct. The activation state of ERKs was also investigated: antibodies against the phosphorylated form of ERK1 and ERK2 showed that Ras-L61 causes a strong activation of MAPKs and that treatment with the MEK inhibitor completely blocks this activation. These data clearly indicate that RasL61, which activates ERKs, does not alter the expression of the EGFP-hIRK1 protein. Moreover, a 3-h pretreatment with PD98059 has no effect on the level of EGFP-hIRK1. We then analyzed the subcellular localization of the GFP construct by confocal microscopy. In cells transfected with EGFP-hIRK1 alone, fluorescence was mainly localized at the plasma membrane with rare cytoplasmic spots probably related to a Golgi complex localization (Fig. 6A). Conversely, cotransfection with Ras-L61 led to a redistribution of the fluorescence signal to the whole cytoplasm (Fig. 6B). In addition, PD98059 reverted this effect since the fluorescence signal returned mainly at the level of the plasma membrane (Fig. 6D). PD98059 treatment of cells transfected with the channel alone (Fig. 6C) did not lead to any change in the fluorescence distribution pattern. To further verify the specific effect of the Ras-MAPK pathway on IRK1 trafficking, cells were transfected with a construct coding for the EGF receptor (EGFR) fused in C-terminal to GFP (8.Brock R. Hamelers I.H.L. Jovin T.M. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that is able to undergo ligand-induced endocytosis (14.Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, E and F, coexpression of Ras-L61 did not alter the localization of the fluorescence signal exhibited by EGFR-EGFP, which remained mainly localized at the plasma membrane level. To confirm the data reported above, we compared the level of surface-associated IRK1 channels and endogenously expressed EGFR under different conditions. Cells were transfected with hIRK1 with or without Ras-L61, and 48 h later, cell surface proteins were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-biotin. Biotinylated proteins were affinity-purified with immobilized streptavidin and analyzed. Immunoblotting with anti-hIRK1 antibodies shows that the amount of biotinylated (cell surface-associated) hIRK1 is higher in cells transfected with EGFP-hIRK1 alone than in cells cotransfected with Ras-L61. Conversely, no reduction of cell surface-associated EGFR could be detected in the presence of Ras. An equivalent amount of the two proteins was detected in total cell extracts (Fig. 7). These data further support a selective role for the Ras-MAPK pathway on the IRK1 channel without generally affecting membrane trafficking. Interestingly, our results show that activation of MAPK does not affect endocytosis of the EGFR. We have not analyzed whether MAPK activity alters ligand-induced EGF receptor internalization. We investigated the role of the Ras-MAPK pathway in regulating IRK1/Kir 2.1 channel by coexpressing in HEK 293 cells Kir 2.1 (either the mouse isoform or the human one fused to GFP) and constitutively active Ras. The expression of the active form of Ras (Ras-L61) reduces IRK1 current, identified as a Ba2+-sensitive potassium component, without affecting the kinetic properties of the channels. Inhibition of the MAPK cascade by PD98059 restores the level of IRK1 current, suggesting that Ras modulates the current through the downstream pathway. Our data rule out an inhibitory effect of Ras-L61 on IRK1 at the transcriptional level since mIRK1 mRNA level is not affected by Ras-L61 expression. Even though a 5.4-kb cDNA has been used and endogenous IRK1 has been reported to give rise to a 5.4-kb message (6.Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), we found in HEK 293 cells a predominant 1.7-kb message and a fainter one at 5.4 kb. Moreover, when the same plasmid was transfected in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, three different transcripts were detected, one of which is 5.4 kb. These results suggest that, depending on the cell type, alternative polyadenylation and/or early termination of the transcription can occur. To study the effect of Ras-L61 on the level of channel expression and its cellular localization, we used the EGFP-hIRK1 fusion protein. We could demonstrate that neither expression of Ras-L61 nor PD98059 treatment alters the level of the EGFP-hIRK1 protein. Confocal microscopy shows that although EGFP-hIRK1, when expressed alone, is mainly localized at the cell surface, in the presence of activated Ras, it becomes diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. This situation can be partially reversed by a 2-h treatment with PD98059. This inhibitor acts mainly on channel redistribution rather than on the de novo synthesis of IRK1 since treatment with cycloheximide together with PD98059 did not significantly alter the fluorescence signal at the plasma membrane (data not shown). These findings, together with the reduced level of biotinylated IRK1 protein found in Ras-L61-transfected cells, indicate that in HEK 293 cells, the Ras-MAPK pathway reduces the channel molecules present on the plasma membrane. The redistribution of IRK1 does not seem to be due to a general effect of active Ras on membrane trafficking: in fact, we did not detect any significant reduction of an endogenous surface-associated protein (EGFR). Moreover, cotransfection of Ras with EGFR-EGFP (a chimeric construct in which the GFP moiety does not affect the EGFR functions (10.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar)) did not alter its fluorescence distribution. Our experimental protocols do not allow a determination of how much of the membrane is internalized since capacitance measurements have been done in a steady state condition. However, the determined mean cell capacitance did not show significant differences in the different conditions (data not shown). Thus, the Ras-MAPK pathway appears to act on the trafficking of IRK1 molecules and does not have a generalized effect on membrane proteins. One of the mechanisms employed by cells to regulate the activity of ion channels is to modulate their localization (15.Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16.Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32889-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In fact, cell surface expression is the result of the balance of insertion of de novo synthesized proteins, of internalization through endocytosis, and of recycling (18.Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that a MAPK-dependent phosphorylation event rather than protein synthesis is required to reduce the level of cell surface-associated IRK1. We also show that a 2-h treatment with PD 98059 (which completely blocks MAPK activation) is sufficient to inhibit RasL61-mediated effects. This suggests that MAPK activity induces a rapid cycling of the IRK1 channel, although we cannot define whether phosphorylation accelerates internalization or whether it reduces the rate of the surface expression of IRK1 channels. In addition, we do not know whether IRK1 itself is the substrate of this phosphorylation or whether other proteins are involved in this process. However, it is worthwhile to recall that a consensus sequence for MAPKs is present in the C-terminal region of IRK1 that might be important for channel trafficking. Mechanisms for endo- and exocytosis of this channel are yet poorly understood. This point has been studied, for instance, by acute exposure to either extracellular signaling molecules or specific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (3.Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Karschin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34063-34068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To this regard, Tong et al. (5.Tong Y. Brandt G. Li M. Shapopalov G. Slimko E. Karschin A. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have shown that IRK1 endocytosis requires Tyr-242, part of a motif recognized by clathrin adaptor proteins, suggesting that internalization is mediated by clathrin. In addition, recent findings have revealed that forward trafficking (19.Dzwokai M. Zerangue N. Lin Y. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) of the channel, which is dependent on a C-terminal sequence of IRK1, also contributes to the regulation of the number of surface-associated channel. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanisms of IRK1 channel trafficking. Modulation of the availability of cell surface ion channels and channel trafficking may be particularly suitable to shape the electrophysiological response (7.Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may represent one of the events that control the basal electrical activity of the cell, an issue that seems important for the cell fate, proliferative versus differentiative (20.Bianchi L. Wible B. Arcangeli A. Taglialatela M. Morra F. Castaldo P. Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Arcangeli A. Rosati B.

We have previously shown that expression of CDC25Mm/Ras-GRF1 in the SK-N-BE neuroblastoma, induced to differentiate with retinoic acid, led to a significant increase in the number of cells showing the IRK1-like current (12.Ausubel F.M. Brent G. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Supplement 1. Wiley Interscience, New York1999: 4.1.4-4.1.6Google Scholar). The opposite modulation reported here, exerted by the Ras-MAPK pathway on the IRK1 channel, may depend on the cellular system used. The two model lines may differ in the inventory of expressed protein or in the cross-talk of signaling pathways. The occurrence of opposite effects in different systems under the same stimulus is not a new issue. For example, protein kinase A can exert a positive or negative effect on Kir2.1 if the channel is expressed in Xenopus oocytes or in COS7 cells, respectively (1.Wischmeyer E. Karschin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5819-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Zenner H.-P. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1413-1420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ras and MAPK pathway play a pivotal role in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, acting on many different target proteins. Modulation of calcium, potassium, and sodium channels by the Ras signaling pathway has already been demonstrated (23.Hahnel C. Gottmann K. Wittinghofer A. Lux H.D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24.Fitzgerald E.M. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J.

Moreover, it has been shown that in oligodendrocytes, inhibition of the inward rectifying potassium current, induced by ceramide, is mediated by a Ras- and Raf-1-dependent pathway (26.Hida H. Takeda M. Soliven B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8712-8719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With our present data, we suggest that the Ras-MAPK cascade modulates the inward rectifying potassium channel by reducing the cell surface channel availability. This may be relevant for the ion channel function in the context of its contribution to cell growth activity in non-excitable cell or to the electrical activity in excitable cells. We thank Dr. P.

We used permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells from mouse and the mag-fura-2 technique, which allows direct monitoring of changes in [Ca2+] of intracellular stores. We show here that Ca2+ can be released from stores in all cellular regions by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

In pancreatic acinar cells regulation of spatio-temporal changes in the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) plays an essential role in receptor-mediated stimulation of protein secretion. Hormonal stimulation of the cells leads to production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate[Ca2+]storeCa2+ concentration in intracellular Ca2+storesDiOC63,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodideNAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (1.Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar), which is followed by a cytosolic Ca2+ signal starting in the apical cell pole (2.Kasai H.

Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This cytosolic Ca2+ signal can either remain localized at the apical side in the form of Ca2+ oscillations, or it can spread toward the basolateral cell side in form of a “Ca2+ wave” (3.Thorn P.

Despite IP3 generation by activation of phospholipase C located in the basolateral plasma membrane, the initial rise in [Ca2+]i takes place at the opposite side of the cell. From results obtained by measurments of the [Ca2+]i it was concluded indirectly that stores in the apical cell pole possess receptors with higher sensitivities for IP3 than stores in the basolateral cell pole (3.Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 5.Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y.

A structural basis for the assumption of different IP3 sensitivities may be the existence of different IP3 receptor isoforms in pancreatic acinar cells (types I, II, and III) (8.De Smedt H.

In IP3 binding studies it has been shown that the type II IP3 receptors have a higher IP3 affinity than the type III receptors (10.Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Parys J.B. de Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R.

Taken together, these findings suggest that Ca2+ stores located in the apical region are equipped mainly with the higher affinity type II IP3 receptors; however, these predicted sensitivity differences between the stores in the two cell poles have not yet been quantified as changes of the [Ca2+] in the Ca2+ stores itself which allow concentration-response measurements. Recently, it has been shown that the speed of the Ca2+ wave that propagates from the apical to the basolateral cell side depends on the type of stimulating hormone such as acetylcholine, bombesin, or cholecystokinin (14.Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ryanodine receptors are present in pancreatic acinar cells (15.Fitzsimmons T.J. Gukovsky I. McRoberts J.A. Rodriguez E. Lai F.A. Pandol S.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and participate in the generation of Ca2+ signals (16.Wakui M. Osipchuk Y.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17.Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgstahler A.D. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 116: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a potential regulator of hormone-induced Ca2+ signals could be cADP-ribose, which modifies the ability of ryanodine receptors to mediate Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in many cell systems (19.Lee H.C. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another candidate that may play a role in Ca2+ release is nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (20.Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 108-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21.Galione A. Patel S. Churchill G.C. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been shown that both cADP-ribose and NAADP can induce Ca2+ oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells (22.Thorn P. Gerasimenko O. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23.Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that in addition to IP3-induced Ca2+ release, part of stored Ca2+ is released via other mechanisms, probably by hormone-induced elevation of the cellular cADP-ribose and/or NAADP concentration. Using fluorescence methods we have shown recently that Ca2+stores in distinct regions of pancreatic acinar cells in primary culture release Ca2+ in response to cADP-ribose and IP3 from different and in part from common Ca2+stores (24.Gobel A. Krause E. Feick P. Schulz I. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Primary cultured acinar cells lack the typical polarized organization of a differentiated acinar cell. We therefore used freshly isolated acinar cells from mouse in the present study to obtain more information about the localization of functionally different Ca2+ stores. By use of the mag-fura-2 technique, which allows monitoring of changes in [Ca2+] of intracellular Ca2+ stores ([Ca2+]store) from permeabilized cells (25.Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) we demonstrate directly here that IP3 added to pancreatic acinar cells at low concentrations (0.1–1 μm) releases Ca2+ mainly from stores located in the apical cell pole. In contrast, cADP-ribose and NAADP release Ca2+ exclusively from basolateral stores. These findings may help to explain the typical spatio-temporal pattern of the cytoplasmic Ca2+signal after hormonal stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells. Adult male CD-1 mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the pancreas was rapidly removed and placed into preparation buffer (composition in mm: 130 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 0.2% (w/v) albumin, and 0.01% (w/v) trypsin inhibitor; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). After removing adherent blood vessels and fat tissue we injected the pancreas with 1 ml of the preparation buffer supplemented with collagenase type V (30 units/ml) and incubated it for 10 min at 37 °C. After enzymatic digestion the tissue was cut into small pieces of ∼1 mm3 and pipetted gently through tips of decreasing diameter to dissociate the tissue into cells. Cells were then centrifuged for 2 min at 30 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in preparation buffer without collagenase. With this isolation procedure single cells as well as small clusters consisting of two up to five cells were obtained. Cells were loaded with 5 μm mag-fura-2-AM for 20 min at room temperature in preparation buffer. For permeabilization cells were washed with permeabilization buffer (composition in mm: 125 KCl, 25 NaCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH) and then incubated with ice-cold permeabilization buffer plus 1 unit/ml streptolysin O for 3–5 min. Finally cells were rinsed with intracellular buffer (125 KCl, 25 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, [Ca2+] clamped to 170 nm by using Ca-EGTA, pH 7.2) at 37 °C to allow pore formation and to wash out cytoplasmatic dye. During the experiments cells were perfused with intracellular buffer at room temperature. 0.5 mm ATP was always added to the perfusion solution to prevent depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by insufficient activity of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. The [Ca2+]store was monitored using the fluorescent low affinity Ca2+ indicator mag-fura-2 (Molecular Probes) in combination with a microscopic imaging system (T.I.L.L.-Photonics, Germany) coupled to an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Cells were excited alternately at 345 and 380 nm for 30–50 ms, and the resultant emission was collected above 510 nm every 10 s. Experiments were done at room temperature (21–24 °C), and cells were perfused continuously with intracellular buffer with different test compounds as indicated in the figures. To estimate the free [Ca2+]store from the measured fluorescence ratio we used the Grynkiewicz relation (26.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with a determined KD of 17 μm for the Ca2+ binding of mag-fura-2. To check to what extent the subcellular organization of pancreatic acinar cells is perturbed by streptolysin O, permeabilized cells were loaded with the intracellular membrane marker 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6, 1 μg/ml for 2 min) (27.Sabnis R.W. Deligeorgiev T.G. Jachak M.N. Dalvi T.S. Biotech. Histochem. 1997; 72: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in the preparation buffer. After loading, cells were washed in preparation buffer, and confocal pictures of the cells were taken with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC1024) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm before and after permeabilization. We used freshly isolated pancreatic acinar cells from mice loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye mag-fura-2. This dye not only stains the cytoplasm of the cell but is also taken up into intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum. To estimate [Ca2+]store not influenced by the cytoplasmic dye and to test the effects of IP3, cADP-ribose, and NAADP on these stores, cells had to be permeabilized with streptolysin O before each experiment as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Using this method about 30% of the cells lost cytoplasmic dye, demonstrating successful permeabilization. The remaining cells that had been permeabilized showed a discrete distribution of fura dye with a high intensity at the apical cell pool and a low intensity at the basolateral cell side (not shown). Light microscopy with differential interference contrast showed that the nucleus and the zymogen granules of these cells did not redistribute after permeabilization (Fig. 1, A and B). Confocal microscopy of DiOC6-stained cells before and after permeabilization verified that even the stained membranes (of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) were largely kept in position (Fig. 1, A and B). When permeabilized cells were analyzed we found that a concentration of 5 μmIP3 induced a maximal Ca2+ release in all regions of the cell. Further release of Ca2+ could only be achieved by the application of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (10 μm), by which Ca2+ stores were completely depleted (Fig. 2A). The maximal IP3-induced Ca2+ release as estimated by the decrease in the fluorescence ratio was 91.8 ± 7.0% of the ionomycin effect (n = 8 experiments, 43 cells; Fig. 2B). The so-called “quantal Ca2+ release,” which means that an increase in submaximal [IP3] leads to stepwise release of discrete amounts of Ca2+, could also be observed by direct monitoring of [Ca2+]store (Fig. 2A). The IP3 effect was reversible. Washing the cells with intracellular buffer, subsequently to IP3-induced Ca2+ release, resulted in complete refilling of the stores (data not shown; n = 8 experiments, 25 cells). The use of video imaging allowed us to analyze simultaneously Ca2+ release from different regions within a single cell. We found that all regions of a cell responded to 5.0 μm IP3 with a maximal release of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). However, the fluorescence ratio before stimulation was always higher in the basolateral cell side compared with the apical cell side. This does not essentially mean that the [Ca2+]store is higher basolaterally. It is more probable that the typical spatial distribution of organelles (high proportion of endoplasmic reticulum at the basolateral side versus high proportion of zymogen granules at the apical cell pole) is responsible for these different fluorescence ratios in the opposite cell poles. Assuming that compartments in the apical cell region take up fluorescence dye but no Ca2+, fluorescence from these stores will quench part of the mag-fura-2 signal from functional Ca2+ stores in the apical cell pole. This problem of the so-called “silent compartments” has been considered earlier (28.Hofer A.M. Schulz I. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus it did not seem appropriate to use the ratio signal itself for estimation of different IP3 sensitivities in different cell regions. We therefore standardized the data for the IP3-induced decrease in the mag-fura-2 ratio by comparison with the maximal ratio decrease induced by ionomycin in the respective cell region (set at 100%). By this procedure it became obvious that a low concentration of IP3showed different efficiencies in the apical and in the basolateral side of the cell. At a submaximal [IP3] of 0.1 μm, Ca2+ release was 55.3 ± 23.8% of the maximal ionomycin-inducible ratio decrease in the apical side of the cell, whereas it was only 20.51 ± 9.8% (Fig. 3, B–D) in the basolateral cell side. Based on this result we tested different concentrations of IP3 between 0.1 and 5.0 μm IP3 and found that the dose-response curve for IP3 was shifted to the left for the apical compared with that for the basolateral cell regions (Fig. 3C). The half-maximal effective concentration for IP3 in the apical cell side was 89 nmcompared with 256 nm in the basolateral cell side (n = 10). The distribution pattern of different IP3-sensitive stores described in the last paragraph led us to assume that start and propagation of hormone-induced Ca2+ waves from the apical to the basolateral cell sides (14.Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgstahler A.D. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) are related to the functions of Ca2+ stores in these cell regions. In particular we addressed the question of whether cADP-ribose- and NAADP-induced Ca2+ release from stores in pancreatic acinar cells could be involved in propagation of the Ca2+ wave toward the basolateral cell side. We therefore first superfused permeabilized cells with up to 100 μm cADP-ribose, a concentration known to be supermaximal for Ca2+ release from the stores of rat pancreatic acinar cells in primary culture (24.Gobel A. Krause E. Feick P. Schulz I. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, cADP-ribose was ineffective in freshly prepared cells. The inability of cADP-ribose to release Ca2+ from permeabilized cells could be caused by the loss of a cytoplasmic factor necessary for the releasing process. We therefore tried application of 5 μg/ml calmodulin, described to be a cofactor for the cADP-ribose effect (31.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Gurnack M.E. Walseth T.F. Nature. 1994; 370: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). But this did not result in cADP-ribose-induced Ca2+ release from the stores either. A pharmacological tool often used to sensitize the Ca2+-induced Ca2+release mechanism is caffeine. We tested cADP-ribose in the presence of caffeine, which alone had no effect on Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores (n = 3 experiments, 14 cells). At 50 μm cADP-ribose and in the presence of 10 mm caffeine, Ca2+ was released from the stores (n = 11 experiments, 39 cells; Fig. 4A), and the effect was maximal (33 ± 15% of the ionomycin-induced ratio decrease). Neither an increase in caffeine nor an increase in [cADP-ribose] further induced Ca2+ release. Therefore the following cADP-ribose experiments were performed in the presence of 10 mm caffeine without further mention in this text. Similar to cADP-ribose, NAADP was able to release Ca2+ from permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells (Fig. 4B). In a concentration of 50 nm the ratio decrease that could be induced by NAADP was 35 ± 18% of the ionomycin-induced ratio decrease (n = 4 experiments, 8 cells). Increasing the NAADP concentration to 100 nm did not change this result (data not shown). The effects of cADP-ribose- and NAADP-induced Ca2+ release were reversible. Removal of cADP-ribose or NAADP from the intracellular buffer resulted in refilling of the stores (data not shown). Comparing the effect of cADP-ribose, NAADP, and IP3 on Ca2+ release it became evident that IP3released Ca2+ with higher efficiency than either cADP-ribose or NAADP. After a supermaximal concentration of IP3 (5.0–10 μm), the addition of 50 μm cADP-ribose or 50 nm NAADP did not result in a further Ca2+ release (Fig. 4, C and D). However, the addition of supermaximal doses of IP3 subsequently to supermaximal effective concentrations of either cADP-ribose or NAADP further decreased the [Ca2+]store (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, although IP3 is additive to cADP-ribose and NAADP, these two substances are not additive to each other. As shown in Fig. 4E application of NAADP subsequently to cADP-ribose did not increase Ca2+ release further. This led us to conclude that there are at least two types of Ca2+ stores in pancreatic acinar cells: one type with IP3 receptors and another one with all three IP3, cADP-ribose, and NAADP receptors. Heparin, an IP3 receptor antagonist, should discriminate between both IP3- and cADP-ribose-induced Ca2+release. As shown in Fig. 5, IP3-induced Ca2+ release could be completely inhibited by 100 μg/ml heparin (n = 4 experiments, 22 cells; Fig. 5, A–C), whereas cADP-ribose-induced release of Ca2+ was unaffected by heparin (n = 3 experiments, 13 cells; Fig. 5, B and C). As was shown in the second last paragraph, Ca2+ stores highly sensitive to IP3 are located in the apical cell region, where the hormone-induced Ca2+ wave starts. We then analyzed discrete regions in a cell with respect to their Ca2+ releasing properties in response to cADP-ribose and NAADP. We found that release of Ca2+ in response to the application of 50 μm cADP-ribose and 50 nmNAADP occurred only from basolateral Ca2+ stores (Fig. 6, A and B). In a series of 10 similar experiments with 37 cells for cADP-ribose and 4 experiments with 8 cells for NAADP, we never observed any Ca2+ release from stores at the apical side of the cell. We therefore assume that the distribution of Ca2+ stores that are highly sensitive to IP3 in the apical cell pole and which respond to cADP-ribose and NAADP in the basolateral cell area could explain the start and propagation of Ca2+ waves from the apical to the basolateral cell side. Ca2+ stores play an important role in the regulation of free [Ca2+]i, a trigger for different cellular events. In pancreatic acinar cells an increase in [Ca2+]i in the apical cell pole is necessary for fusion of zymogen granules with the apical plasma membrane and for opening of Cl− channels, which leads to exocytosis of proteins and secretion of Cl−, respectively. An increase in [Ca2+]i at the basolateral cell side leads to opening of cation channels, which results in Na+ influx and in sustained NaCl and water secretion from the cell at the apical side (32.Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Opening and closing of these Ca2+-sensitive channels is coordinated spatially and temporally by the Ca2+ signal itself (push-pull model (2.Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar)). Hypotheses concerning this phenomenon predict different Ca2+ stores (i.e. different affinities for agonists or different receptor densities) within a single cell (5.Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 6.Tojyo Y. Tanimura A. Matsumoto Y.

Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study we have characterized different Ca2+pools at the apical and basolateral cell side of permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells from mouse. Permeabilization of the cells was necessary for two reasons: first, cytoplasmic mag-fura-2 dye had to be removed from the cytoplasm; and second, the cytoplasmic region of the cell had to be accessible for membrane-impermeant compounds such as IP3, cADP-ribose, NAADP, and heparin. As indicated in Fig. 7 and also suggested by others (34.van de Put F.H. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the permeabilization procedure did not change the distribution of the major compartments of the cell (nucleus, mitochondria, zymogen granules) dramatically. However it is likely to assume that permeabilization favors the loss of some smaller cytoplasmic constituents that are also necessary for a normal Ca2+ release process. This may be why we had to use 50 μm cADP-ribose, which is a high concentration compared with other systems (31.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Gurnack M.E. Walseth T.F. Nature. 1994; 370: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) to obtain maximal effects. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum had been disturbed by permeabilization. Recently it has been suggested that in pancreatic acinar cells the endoplasmic reticulum is continuous (35.Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36.Park M.K. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5729-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This would make determination of discrete Ca2+-releasing structures difficult if not impossible because Ca2+ release at any site from a tubular system with a continuous space should finally empty it. This was obviously not the case in our experiments. But even if the endoplasmic reticulum should have been disconnected by permeabilization our main conclusion that in different cell regions the distribution of IP3, cADP-ribose, and NAADP receptors is different, remains unaffected. We conclude from our studies that Ca2+ pools highly sensitive for IP3 but not for cADP-ribose or NAADP are located in the apical cell pole, whereas Ca2+ pools less sensitive for IP3 and sensitive for cADP-ribose and NAADP are located at the basolateral cell side. In an earlier study on the distribution of IP3 receptors it had been concluded that Ca2+ release in response to IP3 is spatially homogeneous in rat pancreatic acinar cells (34.van de Put F.H. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we used mouse cells that differ from rat pancreatic acinar cells in some features concerning Ca2+ homoeostasis (37.Krause E. Pfeiffer F. Schmid A. Schulz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32523-32528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because of limited spatial resolution we could not identify the structural source for Ca2+ release in the apical cell pool. Gerasimenko et al. (38.Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that isolated zymogen granules can release Ca2+ in response to both IP3 and cADP-ribose. This result had been questioned by Yule et al. (13.Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), who could not find IP3receptors in highly purified granular preparations. Because we could not detect any cADP-ribose-induced Ca2+ release from the apical cell side where zymogen granules are located, the present study does not support the observation of Gerasimenko et al. on cADP-ribose-induced Ca2+ release from zymogen granules (38.Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Spatial resolution of our technique does not allow a decision as to whether IP3, cADP-ribose, and NAADP, which are all effective in the basolateral cell side, release Ca2+ from one structural pool or if there are different pools. However, our data, which show that the actions of NAADP and cADP-ribose are not additive, argue for the hypotheses that receptors for both substances are present in the same basolaterally located pools. The finding that IP3 alone could induce maximal Ca2+ release, which could not be enhanced by either cADP-ribose or NAADP, suggests that in addition to Ca2+ pools only sensitive to IP3 in the apical pool, basolateral located pools contain all three types of receptor, for IP3, cADP-ribose, and NAADP. Previous observations that hormone-induced Ca2+ release starts in the apical cell pole (2.Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3.Thorn P.

Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 14.Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J.

Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is followed by spreading of the Ca2+ signal to the basolateral cell pole via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release can now be interpreted more substantially by our present data. An arrangement of IP3- and cADP-ribose- and/or NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ pools in sequence should explain initiation of the apical Ca2+ signal with low [IP3] and the spreading of the Ca2+ wave to the basolateral cell side when [IP3] increases and cADP-ribose and/or NAADP is produced probably during hormonal stimulation. IP3 receptors act as a trigger for the apical Ca2+ signal, whereas cADP-ribose and NAADP receptors are amplifiers in the Ca2+wave propagation. This view is in part similar to the conclusion of Cancela et al. (39.Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), who claim that acetylcholine initially activates IP3 receptors and that this signal is modified by cADP-ribose and NAADP. On the other hand these authors conclude from their data that the initial Ca2+ release in the apical cell pole in response to another secretagog, cholecystokinin, is mediated by NAADP and not by IP3 (39.Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Even though no data are available to show hormone-induced production of NAADP in pancreatic acinar cells so far, our present study does not support the idea that NAADP receptors are present in the apical cell pole. In summary we speculate that IP3 receptors in Ca2+ stores with decreasing sensitivities for IP3 toward the basolateral cell side lead to a Ca2+ response from pool to pool in form of a Ca2+ wave in the direction opposite that of the IP3 gradient. This Ca2+ wave is modulated by cADP-ribose- and NAADP-induced Ca2+ release. Because both IP3 receptors and cADP-ribose receptors are regulated by [Ca2+]i (19.Lee H.C. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40.Lee H.C. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41.Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Smedt H.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the IP3 receptor in addition by the [Ca2+]store (41.Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Smedt H.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), local changes in [Ca2+] in both the stores and in the cytoplasm because of IP3-, NAADP- and cADP-ribose-induced Ca2+release should also contribute to the regulation of Ca2+signals in pancreatic acinar cells. The knowledge of different Ca2+ pools in the cell opens the question of whether activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (42.Putney Jr., J.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is activated by one (solely IP3-sensitive) or both (IP3-sensitive as well as IP3-, cADP-ribose- and NAADP-sensitive) types of stores. Further studies on the characteristics of different Ca2+ pools in the cell could help to identify and to characterize the Ca2+ pool that generates the message to activate capacitative Ca2+entry."
