https://openalex.org/W1991069262,Supercooled water and two species of insects froze at higher temperatures than normally when placed in an electrostatic field. The effect became more certain and occurred earlier as the amount of supercooling was increased. The amount of supercooling in the presence of the electrostatic field was not related to the amount in its absence.

https://openalex.org/W1998148171,Latitudinal variations in the descent of bomb-produced radiocarbon from the stratosphere is suggested by differences in tropospheric carbon-14 activity. The magnitude of a similar latitudinal effect in the pre-bomb steady state is estimated. This effect may be part of the explanation of the short-term oscillations in carbon-14 activity found in treerings from the last 1300 years.

Biology teachers in high schools and colleges are frequently charged with the task of preparing such exhibits in order to found or expand the Museum of the Biological Department as a teaching adjunct. Because an expense acount seldom envisages the preparation of these demonstrations, professional assistance cannot be readily procured. It is for the above reasons that I believe my simple method of mounting small mammals is worth placing on record. This technique was first applied to mouse specimens exhibited at the Harvard Tercentenary in 1936, and more recently it has been employed on rats for the museum collections of the Wistar Institute, where they will be pointed out upon request. There is no reason why this method can not be readily extended with modifications to small birds and mammals generally. For the sake of simplicity I shall here describe the method as applied to the rat. First, kill the rat with a lethal dose of ether, or chloroform or by some other method that will not harm the anatomy. Inject 10 cc of 40 per cent. formaldehyde into the thoradie cavity and another 10 cc into the abdominal cavity, massaging the animal to distribute the injection fluid within the body cavities. Inject smliall amounts into the legs and subcutaneously over the body. Within 15 minutes to half an hour subsequent to this injection the body will stiffen. When fairly rigid, place the rat upon a small temporary base-block of wood in the position desired for the finished specimen. Brad the rat's tail to the block. Then brad the four feet to their proper positions bending the body into the pose desired. The hips may be prevented from moving laterally by hammering several 7-penny nails into the block adjacent to the hips. The head may be held up by resting the teeth on a block of proper dimensions. See Fig. A. When the animal is in the position desired, allow it to stand an hour or so until it has completely hardened. Invert the specimen and wash it thoroughly under a faucet so water will wet the whole outer surface of the skin. Place the inverted specimen, block and all, into a jar of formalin and allow it to stand 24 hours. The previous washing removes all air caught in the fur that might prevent areas of the skin from coming in contact with formalin. After the specimen has cured 24 hours in formalin, wash under the faucet for a few minutes to remove all traces of formalin, which will attack the skin of the operator 's hands, unless they are otherwise protected. Lay the specimen on its back, and with a sharp razor blade cut the skin along the mid-ventral line from throat to geni1 Reprinted in part from Science."
