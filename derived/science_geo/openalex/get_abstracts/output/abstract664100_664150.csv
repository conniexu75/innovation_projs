https://openalex.org/W3106791064,"The newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a pandemic respiratory disease. Moreover, thromboembolic events throughout the body, including in the CNS, have been described. Given the neurological symptoms observed in a large majority of individuals with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 penetrance of the CNS is likely. By various means, we demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein in anatomically distinct regions of the nasopharynx and brain. Furthermore, we describe the morphological changes associated with infection such as thromboembolic ischemic infarction of the CNS and present evidence of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. SARS-CoV-2 can enter the nervous system by crossing the neural–mucosal interface in olfactory mucosa, exploiting the close vicinity of olfactory mucosal, endothelial and nervous tissue, including delicate olfactory and sensory nerve endings. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 appears to follow neuroanatomical structures, penetrating defined neuroanatomical areas including the primary respiratory and cardiovascular control center in the medulla oblongata. The authors demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx and brain, suggesting that the virus is present in the CNS and may enter through the olfactory mucosa, exploiting the close vicinity of olfactory mucosal, endothelial and nervous tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3107212993,"Nanopore sequencers can be used to selectively sequence certain DNA molecules in a pool by reversing the voltage across individual nanopores to reject specific sequences, enabling enrichment and depletion to address biological questions. Previously, we achieved this using dynamic time warping to map the signal to a reference genome, but the method required substantial computational resources and did not scale to gigabase-sized references. Here we overcome this limitation by using graphical processing unit (GPU) base-calling. We show enrichment of specific chromosomes from the human genome and of low-abundance organisms in mixed populations without a priori knowledge of sample composition. Finally, we enrich targeted panels comprising 25,600 exons from 10,000 human genes and 717 genes implicated in cancer, identifying PML–RARA fusions in the NB4 cell line in <15 h sequencing. These methods can be used to efficiently screen any target panel of genes without specialized sample preparation using any computer and a suitable GPU. Our toolkit, readfish, is available at https://www.github.com/looselab/readfish
 . A nanopore sequencer achieves selective sequencing of any region in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W3109164186,"Conventional targeted sequencing methods eliminate many of the benefits of nanopore sequencing, such as the ability to accurately detect structural variants or epigenetic modifications. The ReadUntil method allows nanopore devices to selectively eject reads from pores in real time, which could enable purely computational targeted sequencing. However, this requires rapid identification of on-target reads while most mapping methods require computationally intensive basecalling. We present UNCALLED ( https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED ), an open source mapper that rapidly matches streaming of nanopore current signals to a reference sequence. UNCALLED probabilistically considers k-mers that could be represented by the signal and then prunes the candidates based on the reference encoded within a Ferragina-Manzini index. We used UNCALLED to deplete sequencing of known bacterial genomes within a metagenomics community, enriching the remaining species 4.46-fold. UNCALLED also enriched 148 human genes associated with hereditary cancers to 29.6× coverage using one MinION flowcell, enabling accurate detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions, structural variants and methylation in these genes."

https://openalex.org/W3107940478,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer an unprecedented opportunity to model diverse cell types and tissues. To enable systematic exploration of the programming landscape mediated by transcription factors (TFs), we present the Human TFome, a comprehensive library containing 1,564 TF genes and 1,732 TF splice isoforms. By screening the library in three hPSC lines, we discovered 290 TFs, including 241 that were previously unreported, that induce differentiation in 4 days without alteration of external soluble or biomechanical cues. We used four of the hits to program hPSCs into neurons, fibroblasts, oligodendrocytes and vascular endothelial-like cells that have molecular and functional similarity to primary cells. Our cell-autonomous approach enabled parallel programming of hPSCs into multiple cell types simultaneously. We also demonstrated orthogonal programming by including oligodendrocyte-inducible hPSCs with unmodified hPSCs to generate cerebral organoids, which expedited in situ myelination. Large-scale combinatorial screening of the Human TFome will complement other strategies for cell engineering based on developmental biology and computational systems biology."

https://openalex.org/W3109203712,"Filamentous actin (F-actin) provides cells with mechanical support and promotes the mobility of intracellular structures. Although F-actin is traditionally considered to be cytoplasmic, here we reveal that nuclear F-actin participates in the replication stress response. Using live and super-resolution imaging, we find that nuclear F-actin is polymerized in response to replication stress through a pathway regulated by ATR-dependent activation of mTORC1, and nucleation through IQGAP1, WASP and ARP2/3. During replication stress, nuclear F-actin increases the nuclear volume and sphericity to counteract nuclear deformation. Furthermore, F-actin and myosin II promote the mobility of stressed-replication foci to the nuclear periphery through increasingly diffusive motion and directed movements along the nuclear actin filaments. These actin functions promote replication stress repair and suppress chromosome and mitotic abnormalities. Moreover, we find that nuclear F-actin is polymerized in vivo in xenograft tumours after treatment with replication-stress-inducing chemotherapeutic agents, indicating that this pathway has a role in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W3107304136,"The effectiveness of control measures to contain coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wanzhou, China was assessed. Epidemiological data were analyzed for 183 confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from five generations of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 throughout the entire COVID-19 outbreak in Wanzhou. Approximately 67.2% and 32.8% of cases were symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission accounted for 75.9% of the total recorded transmission. The reproductive number was 1.64 (95% confidence interval: 1.16–2.40) for G1-to-G2 transmission, decreasing to 0.31–0.39 in later generations, concomitant with implementation of rigorous control measures. Substantially higher infection risk was associated with contact within 5 d after the infectors had been infected, frequent contact and ≥8 h of contact duration. The spread of COVID-19 was effectively controlled in Wanzhou by breaking the transmission chain through social distancing, extensive contact tracing, mass testing and strict quarantine of close contacts. Analysis of five generations of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from cases to contacts identifies a high rate of symptomless transmission and risk factors associated with spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3108530058,"X-chromosome dosage compensation in female placental mammals is achieved by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Human pre-implantation embryos are an exception, in which dosage compensation occurs by X-chromosome dampening (XCD). Here, we examined whether XCD extends to human prenatal germ cells given their similarities to naive pluripotent cells. We found that female human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) display reduced X-linked gene expression before entering meiosis. Moreover, in hPGCs, both X chromosomes are active and express the long non-coding RNAs X active coating transcript (XACT) and X inactive specific transcript (XIST)-the master regulator of XCI-which are silenced after entry into meiosis. We find that XACT is a hPGC marker, describe XCD associated with XIST expression in hPGCs and suggest that XCD evolved in humans to regulate X-linked genes in pre-implantation embryos and PGCs. Furthermore, we found a unique mechanism of X-chromosome regulation in human primordial oocytes. Therefore, future studies of human germline development must consider the sexually dimorphic X-chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms in the prenatal germline."
https://openalex.org/W3107223977,"Background Ectopic fat obesity and triglycerides are risk factors for diabetes and multiple cardiovascular diseases. However, there have been limited studies on the association between triglycerides and ectopic fat obesity. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between triglycerides and ectopic fat obesity. Methods and results In this cross-sectional study, we retrospectively analyzed 15464 adult participants recruited by Murakami Memorial Hospital (8430 men and 7034 women, average age of 43.71 ± 8.90). All patients were divided into two groups according to the threshold used to diagnose hypertriglyceridemia. The logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between triglycerides and the risk of ectopic fat obesity, and the generalized additive model was used to identify the nonlinear association. In this study population, the prevalence of ectopic fat obesity was 17.73%. After adjusting other covariables, triglycerides were positively correlated with the risk of ectopic fat obesity (OR: 1.54, 95% CI:1.41–1.69, P &lt;0.0001). Through smooth curve fitting, we found that there was an inverted U-shaped curve association between triglycerides and ectopic fat obesity. This association remained unchanged even if the adjusted covariables were removed from the model, and the inflection point of the curve was 3.98. When triglyceride levels were ≤3.98, triglycerides were positively correlated with the risk of ectopic fat obesity (OR:1.784, 95% CI:1.611–1.975, P &lt;0.0001). When triglyceride levels were &gt;3.98 (right side of the inflection point), there was a negative correlation (OR:0.519, 95% CI:0.333–0.810, P = 0.0039). Conclusions Our research showed that there is a significant association between triglycerides and ectopic fat obesity. This relation is not a simple linear relationship but instead an inverted U-shaped curve association."
https://openalex.org/W3107582387,"Background Although randomized trials provide a high level of evidence regarding the efficacy of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs), the results of such trials may differ from those observed in day-to-day clinical practice. Aims To compare the risk of stroke/systemic embolism (S/SE) and major bleeding (MB) between NOAC and warfarin in clinical practice. Methods Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who started warfarin/NOACs between January 2015 and November 2016 were retrospectively identified from Korea’s nationwide health insurance claims database. Using inpatient diagnosis and imaging records, the Cox models with inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity scores were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for NOACs relative to warfarin. Results Of the 48,389 patients, 10,548, 11,414, 17,779 and 8,648 were administered apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and warfarin, respectively. Many patients had suffered prior strokes (36.7%, 37.7%, 31.4%, and 32.2% in apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin group, respectively), exhibited high CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (4.8, 4.6, 4.6, and 4.1 in apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin group, respectively) and HAS-BLED (3.7, 3.6, 3.6, and 3.3 in apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin group, respectively) scores, had received antiplatelet therapy (75.4%, 75.7%, 76.8%, and 70.1% in apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin group, respectively), or were administered reduced doses of NOACs (49.8%, 52.9%, and 42.8% in apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban group, respectively). Apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban showed a significantly lower S/SE risk [HR, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.62, 0.54–0.71; 0.60, 0.53–0.69; and 0.71, 0.56–0.88, respectively] than warfarin. Apixaban and dabigatran (HR, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.51–0.66 and 0.75, 0.60–0.95, respectively), but not rivaroxaban (HR, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.69–1.04), showed a significantly lower MB risk than warfarin. Conclusions Among Asian patients who were associated with higher bleeding risk, low adherence, and receiving reduced NOAC dose than that provided in randomised controlled trials, all NOACs were associated with a significantly lower S/SE risk and apixaban and dabigatran with a significantly lower MB risk than warfarin."
https://openalex.org/W3108800484,"Genetic linkage causes the fate of new mutations in a population to be contingent on the genetic background on which they appear. This makes it challenging to identify how individual mutations affect fitness. To overcome this challenge, we developed marginal path likelihood (MPL), a method to infer selection from evolutionary histories that resolves genetic linkage. Validation on real and simulated data sets shows that MPL is fast and accurate, outperforming existing inference approaches. We found that resolving linkage is crucial for accurately quantifying selection in complex evolving populations, which we demonstrate through a quantitative analysis of intrahost HIV-1 evolution using multiple patient data sets. Linkage effects generated by variants that sweep rapidly through the population are particularly strong, extending far across the genome. Taken together, our results argue for the importance of resolving linkage in studies of natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W3107727822,"Wheat is one of the best-domesticated cereal crops and one of the vital sources of nutrition for humans. An investigation was undertaken to reveal the potential of novel bio-inoculants enriching micronutrients in shoot and grains of wheat crop to eliminate the hazards of malnutrition. Sole as well as consortia inoculation of bio-inoculants significantly enhanced mineral nutrients including zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) concentrations in shoot and grains of wheat. Various treatments of bio-inoculants increase Zn and Fe content up to 1–15% and 3–13%, respectively. Sole inoculation of Bacillus aryabhattai (S10) impressively improves the nutritious of wheat. However, the maximum increase in minerals contents of wheat was recorded by consortia inoculation of Paenibacillus polymyxa ZM27, Bacillus subtilis ZM63 and Bacillus aryabhattai S10. This treatment also showed a maximum bacterial population (18 × 10 4 cfu mL -1 ) in the rhizosphere. The consortium application of these strains showed up to a 17% increase in yield. It is evident from the results that the consortium application was more effective than sole and co-inoculation. A healthy positive correlation was found between growth, yield, and the accessibility of micronutrients to wheat crops at the harvesting stage. The present investigations revealed the significance of novel bacterial strains in improving the nutritional status of wheat crops. These strains could be used as bio-inoculants for the biofortification of wheat to combat hidden hunger in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3109766959,"Antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and their genes (ARGs) have become recognised as significant emerging environmental pollutants. ARB and ARGs in sewage sludge can be transmitted back to humans via the food chain when sludge is recycled to agricultural land, making sludge treatment key to control the release of ARB and ARGs to the environment. This study investigated the fate of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli and a large set of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during full scale anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge at two U.K. wastewater treatment plants and evaluated the impact of thermal hydrolysis (TH) pre-treatment on their abundance and diversity. Absolute abundance of 13 ARGs and the Class I integron gene intI1 was calculated using single gene quantitative (q) PCR. High through-put qPCR analysis was also used to determine the relative abundance of 370 ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Results revealed that TH reduced the absolute abundance of all ARGs tested and intI1 by 10–12 , 000 fold . After subsequent AD, a rebound effect was seen in many ARGs. The fate of ARGs during AD without pre-treatment was variable. Relative abundance of most ARGs and MGEs decreased or fluctuated, with the exception of macrolide resistance genes, which were enriched at both plants, and tetracyline and glycopeptide resistance genes which were enriched in the plant employing TH. Diversity of ARGs and MGEs decreased in both plants during sludge treatment. Principal coordinates analysis revealed that ARGs are clearly distinguished according to treatment step, whereas MGEs in digested sludge cluster according to site. This study provides a comprehensive within-digestor analysis of the fate of ARGs, MGEs and antibiotic resistant E . coli and highlights the effectiveness of AD, particularly when TH is used as a pre-treatment, at reducing the abundance of most ARGs and MGEs in sludgeand preventing their release into the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3106426554,"Measuring executive function (EF) among adults is important, as the cognitive processes involved in EF are critical to academic achievement, job success and mental health. Current evidence on measurement and structure of EF largely come from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) countries. However, measuring EF in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) is challenging, because of the dearth of EF measures validated across LMICs, particularly measures that do not require extensive training, expensive equipment, or professional administration. This paper uses data from three LMIC cohorts to test the feasibility, validity and reliability of EF assessment in adults using three sub-tests (representing key components of EF) of the NIH Toolbox Cognitive battery. For each cohort, all three EF measures (inhibition, flexibility and working memory) loaded well onto a unidimensional latent factor of EF. Factor scores related well to measures of fluid intelligence, processing speed and schooling. All measures showed good test-retest reliability across countries. This study provides evidence for a set of sound measures of EF that could be used across different cultural, language and socio-economic backgrounds in future LMIC research. Furthermore, our findings extend conclusions on the structure of EF beyond those drawn from WEIRD countries."
https://openalex.org/W3107648769,"Kinases are annotated in many nucleoside biosynthetic gene clusters but generally are considered responsible only for self-resistance. Here, we report an unexpected 2'-phosphorylation of nucleoside biosynthetic intermediates in the nikkomycin and polyoxin pathways. This phosphorylation is a unique cryptic modification as it is introduced in the third of seven steps during aminohexuronic acid (AHA) nucleoside biosynthesis, retained throughout the pathway's duration, and is removed in the last step of the pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of reported nucleoside biosynthetic gene clusters indicates the presence of cryptic phosphorylation in other pathways and the importance of functional characterization of kinases in nucleoside biosynthetic pathways in general. This study also functionally characterized all of the enzymes responsible for AHA biosynthesis and revealed that AHA is constructed via a unique oxidative C-C bond cleavage reaction. The results indicate a divergent biosynthetic mechanism for three classes of antifungal nucleoside natural products."
https://openalex.org/W3109748592,"In this population-based propensity score matched (PSM) cohort study, we aimed to investigate the risk of developing dementia with the use of acid suppressants, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 antagonists). Cohorts of PPI users (n = 2,778), H2 antagonist users (n = 6,165), and non-users (n = 86,238) were selected from a dataset covering the years 2000 to 2010 in Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients in the three groups were PSM at a ratio of 1:1 within each comparison cohort (CC). Three CCs were created: (1) PPI users compared to non-users (CC1, n = 2,583 pairs); (2) H2 antagonist users compared to non-users (CC2, n = 5,955 pairs); and (3) PPI users compared to H2 antagonist users (CC3, n = 2,765 pairs). A multivariable robust Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of developing dementia. The multivariable analysis results show that the aHR of developing dementia during the follow-up period was 0.72 (CC1: 95% CI = 0.51–1.03, P = 0.07) for PPI users and 0.95 (CC2: 95% CI = 0.74–1.22, P = 0.69) for H2 antagonist users, when compared to non-users. Between the patients using acid suppressants, there was no difference between PPI and H2 antagonist users in the risk of developing dementia (CC3: aHR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.58–1.17, P = 0.28). In conclusion, no association was observed between the use of acid suppressants and the risk of developing dementia in any of the three CCs. Further, randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3107156836,"Members of the IL-6/IL-12 cytokine family are critical regulators of innate and adaptive immunity and have emerged as key players controlling inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. This cytokine family comprises of IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, and IL-35, each consisting of distinct α- and β-cytokine subunits that form heterodimers. A new member of this family, IL-39, was identified in the murine species and was shown to consist of the IL-23p19 and Epstein-Barr Virus-induced 3 (EBI3) subunits. Subsequently, it was shown that IL-39 was implicated in the immunopathogenesis of murine experimental lupus erythematosus. The existence of IL-39 in the human system has yet to be confirmed. Based on the clinical success of IL-23p19 neutralizing approaches in moderate-to-severe psoriasis, anti-IL-23p19 antibodies in the clinic may not only neutralize IL-23, but additionally IL-39, implying that IL-39 might also contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. It is therefore pivotal to demonstrate IL-39 expression and to characterize its function in the human system. In this study, we provided evidence for the existence of secreted heterodimeric p19 and EBI3 complexes in supernatants originating from p19 and EBI3 transfected HEK293FT cells. We attempted to detect IL-39 expression from stimulated human primary B cells, human keratinocytes and in vitro polarized human macrophages. Whereas, the expression of p19 and EBI3 mRNA was elevated, we failed to detect p19 and EBI3 heterodimers. Functional assays were conducted with conditioned media containing human IL-39 or with a human recombinant IL-39 Fc protein. Immune cells targeted by IL-39 in mouse, such as neutrophils and PBMCs, did not respond to human IL-39 stimulation and IL-39 failed to activate STAT3 in a reporter cell line. These results suggest that, while the secretion of p19/EBI3 complexes can be forced in human cells, it is secreted below the lower quantity of detection or it has no functional role."
https://openalex.org/W3108566421,"Objectives Loss of body weight is often seen in pancreatic cancer and also predicts poor prognosis. Thus, maintaining muscle mass is an essential treatment goal. The primary aim was to investigate whether progressive resistance training impacts muscle and adipose tissue compartments. Furthermore, the effect of body composition on overall survival (OS) was investigated. Methods In the randomized SUPPORT-study, 65 patients were assigned to 6-month resistance training (2x/week) or a usual care control group. As secondary endpoint, muscle strength of the upper and lower extremities was assessed before and after the intervention period. Routine CT scans were assessed on lumbar L3/4 level for quantification of total-fat-area, visceral-fat-area, subcutaneous-fat-area, intramuscular-fat-area, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VFR), muscle-area (MA), muscle-density and skeletal-muscle-index (SMI). OS data were retrieved. Results Of 65 patients, 53 had suitable CT scans at baseline and 28 completed the intervention period with suitable CT scans. There were no significant effects observed of resistance training on body composition (p&gt;0.05; effect sizes ω 2 p &lt;0.02). Significant moderate to high correlations were found between MA and muscle strength parameters (r = 0.57–0.85; p&lt;0.001). High VFR at baseline was a predictor of poor OS (VFR≥1.3 vs. &lt;1.3; median OS 14.6 vs. 45.3 months; p = 0.012). Loss of muscle mass was also a predictor of poor OS (loss vs. gain of SMI; median OS 24.6 vs. 50.8 months; p = 0.049). Conclusion There is anabolic potential in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. A progressive resistance training may help patients to maintain their muscle mass and avoid muscle depletion. CT-quantified muscle mass at the level of L3/4 showed a good correlation to muscle strength. Therefore, maintaining muscle mass and muscle strength through structured resistance training could help patients to maintain their physical functioning. A high VFR at baseline and a high loss of muscle mass are predictors of poor OS. Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01977066)."
https://openalex.org/W3108882837,"The bone marrow microenvironment (BME) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) consists of various cell types that support the growth of AML cells and protect them from chemotherapy. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the BME have been shown to contribute immensely to leukemogenesis and chemotherapy resistance in AML cells. However, the mechanism of stroma-induced chemotherapy resistance is not known. Here, we hypothesized that stromal cells promote a stem-like phenotype in AML cells, thereby inducing tumorigenecity and therapy resistance. To test our hypothesis, we co-cultured AML cell lines and patient samples with BM-derived MSCs and determined aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and performed gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing. We found that the percentage of ALDH + cells increased dramatically when AML cells were co-cultured with MSCs. However, among the 19 ALDH isoforms, ALDH2 and ALDH1L2 were the only two that were significantly upregulated in AML cells co-cultured with stromal cells compared to cells cultured alone. Mechanistic studies revealed that the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-regulated gene signature is activated in AML cells co-cultured with MSCs. Knockdown of TGF-β1 in BM-MSCs inhibited stroma-induced ALDH activity and ALDH2 expression in AML cells, whereas treatment with recombinant TGF-β1 induced the ALDH + phenotype in AML cells. We also found that TGF-β1-induced ALDH2 expression in AML cells is mediated by the non-canonical pathway through the activation of p38. Interestingly, inhibition of ALDH2 with diadzin and CVT-10216 significantly inhibited MSC-induced ALDH activity in AML cells and sensitized them to chemotherapy, even in the presence of MSCs. Collectively, BM stroma induces ALDH2 activity in AML cells through the non-canonical TGF-β pathway. Inhibition of ALDH2 sensitizes AML cells to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3110359196,"Magnesium isotope ratios ( 26 Mg/ 24 Mg) can provide insights into the origin of Mg pools and fluxes in catchments where Mg sources have distinct isotope compositions, and the direction and magnitude of Mg isotope fractionations are known. Variability in Mg isotope compositions was investigated in three small, spruce-forested catchments in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) situated along an industrial pollution gradient. The following combinations of catchment characteristics were selected for the study: low-Mg bedrock + low Mg deposition (site LYS, underlain by leucogranite); high-Mg bedrock + low Mg deposition (site PLB, underlain by serpentinite), and low-Mg bedrock + high Mg deposition (site UDL, underlain by orthogneiss). UDL, affected by spruce die-back due to acid rain, was the only investigated site where dolomite was applied to mitigate forest decline. The δ 26 Mg values of 10 catchment compartments were determined on pooled subsamples. At LYS, a wide range of δ 26 Mg values was observed across the compartments, from -3.38 ‰ (bedrock) to -2.88 ‰ (soil), -1.48% (open-area precipitation), -1.34 ‰ (throughfall), -1.19 ‰ (soil water), -0.99 ‰ (xylem), -0.95 ‰ (needles), -0.82 ‰ (bark), -0.76 ‰ (fine roots), and -0.76 ‰ (runoff). The δ 26 Mg values at UDL spanned 1.32 ‰ and were thus less variable, compared to LYS. Magnesium at PLB was isotopically relatively homogeneous. The δ 26 Mg systematics was consistent with geogenic control of runoff Mg at PLB. Mainly atmospheric/biological control of runoff Mg was indicated at UDL, and possibly also at LYS. Our sites did not exhibit the combination of low-δ 26 Mg runoff and high-δ 26 Mg weathering products (secondary clay minerals) reported from several previously studied sites. Six years after the end of liming at UDL, Mg derived from dolomite was isotopically undetectable in runoff."
https://openalex.org/W3110576573,"The aim of this study was to capture and understand the immediate recovery journey of patients following lumbar spinal fusion surgery and explore the interacting constructs that shape their journey. A qualitative study using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach. A purposive sample of 43 adult patients (≥16 years) undergoing ≤4 level instrumented fusion for back and/or leg pain of degenerative cause, were recruited pre-surgery from 4 UK spinal surgery centres. Patients completed a weekly diary expressed in their own words for the first 4 weeks following surgery to capture their life as lived. Diary content was based on previous research findings and recorded progress, recovery, motivation, symptoms, medications, healthcare appointments, rehabilitation, positive/negative thoughts, and significant moments; comparing to the previous week. To maximise completion and data quality, diaries could be completed in paper form, word document, as online survey or as audio recording. Strategies to enhance diary adherence included a weekly prompt. A framework analysis for individual diaries and then across participants (deductive and inductive components) captured emergent themes. Trustworthiness was enhanced by strategies including reflexivity, attention to negative cases and use of critical co-investigators. Twenty-eight participants (15 female; n = 18 (64.3%) aged 45–64) contributed weekly diaries (12 withdrew post-surgery, 3 did not follow through with surgery). Adherence with diaries was 89.8%. Participants provided diverse and vivid descriptions of recovery experiences. Three distinct recovery trajectories were identified: meaningful recovery (engagement in physical and functional activities to return to functionality/mobility); progressive recovery (small but meaningful improvement in physical ability with increasing confidence); and disruptive recovery (limited purpose for meaningful recovery). Important interacting constructs shaped participants’ recovery including their pain experience and self-efficacy. This is the first account of immediate recovery trajectories from patients’ perspectives. Recognition of a patient’s trajectory may inform patient-centred recovery, follow-up and rehabilitation to improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3107572046,"Background The prevalence of hypertension in Nigeria is high and growing. The burden and risk factor distribution also vary by geographical zone. Information about prevalence, risk factors and disease status awareness are needed to guide evidence based public health response at the national and sub- national levels. Purpose This paper describes the prevalence of hypertension and its correlates, as well as hypertension status awareness among men in North Central, Nigeria. Methods A cross sectional survey was administered to male partners of pregnant women participating in the Healthy Beginning Initiative program from 2016–2018. Information on socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors, physical measurement and blood pressure readings were collected using a standardized protocol. Data was analyzed with simple and multiple logistic regression. Results The 6,538 men had a median age of 31 years [IQR: 26–37]. The prevalence of hypertension was 23.3% (95% CI: 22.3%-24.4%), while 46.7% had prehypertension. The odds of hypertension was associated with increasing age (OR:1.02, CI:1.01–1.03), being overweight (aOR:1.5,CI:1.3–1.8), being obese (aOR:2.6,CI:2.0–3.3), living in an urban area (aOR:1.6,CI:1.2–2.1), and alcohol use in the 30 days prior (aOR:1.2,CI:1.1–1.4). Overall, 4.5% (297/6,528) of participants had ever been told they have hypertension. Among the 23.3% (1,527/6,528) with hypertension, 7.1% (109/1,527) were aware of their disease status. Men aged 41–50 years (aOR: 1.8, CI: 1.0–3.3), and &gt; 50 years (aOR: 2.2, CI: 1.1–4.3), had higher odds disease status awareness. Living in an urban area was associated with lower odds (aOR: 0.2, CI: 0.03–0.7) of hypertension status awareness. Conclusion This study showed that hypertension is already a significant public health burden in this population and that disease awareness level is very low. Alcohol use and obesity were associated with hypertension, highlighting some modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors that are prevalent in the study population. Taken together, these findings can inform the design of interventions for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in Nigeria and similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W3107189771,"Neurotrophic factor prosaposin (PS) is a precursor for saposins A, B, C, and D, which are activators for specific sphingolipid hydrolases in lysosomes. Both saposins and PS are widely contained in various tissues. The brain, skeletal muscle, and heart cells predominantly contain unprocessed PS rather than saposins. PS and PS-derived peptides stimulate neuritogenesis and increase choline acetyltransferase activity in neuroblastoma cells and prevent programmed cell death in neurons. We previously detected increases in PS immunoactivity and its mRNA in the rat facial nucleus following facial nerve transection. PS mRNA expression increased not only in facial motoneurons, but also in microglia during facial nerve regeneration. In the present study, we examined the changes in immunoreactivity of the PS receptors GPR37 and GPR37L1 in the rat facial nucleus following facial nerve transection. Following facial nerve transection, many small Iba1- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells with strong GPR37L1 immunoreactivity, including microglia and astrocytes, were observed predominately on the operated side. These results indicate that GPR37 mainly works in neurons, whereas GPR37L1 is predominant in microglia or astrocytes, and suggest that increased PS in damaged neurons stimulates microglia or astrocytes via PS receptor GPR37L1 to produce neurotrophic factors for neuronal recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3107860140,"DEC-205 (CD205), a member of the macrophage mannose receptor protein family, is the prototypic endocytic receptor of dendritic cells, whose ligands include phosphorothioated cytosine–guanosine oligonucleotides, a motif often seen in bacterial or viral DNA. However, despite growing biological and clinical significance, little is known about the structural arrangement of this receptor or any of its family members. Here, we describe the 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of human DEC-205, thereby illuminating the structure of the mannose receptor protein family. The DEC-205 monomer forms a compact structure comprising two intercalated rings of C-type lectin-like domains, where the N-terminal cysteine-rich and fibronectin domains reside at the central intersection. We establish a pH-dependent oligomerization pathway forming tetrameric DEC-205 using solution-based techniques and ultimately solved the 4.9 Å cryo-EM structure of the DEC-205 tetramer to identify the unfurling of the second lectin ring which enables tetramer formation. Furthermore, we suggest the relevance of this oligomerization pathway within a cellular setting, whereby cytosine–guanosine binding appeared to disrupt this cell-surface oligomer.

Accordingly, we provide insight into the structure and oligomeric assembly of the DEC-205 receptor. The macrophage mannose receptor (MR) protein family constitutes a group of large (∼160–200 kDa) membrane-bound multidomain receptors that includes the MR (1Wileman T.E. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D.

The receptor DEC-205 expressed by dendritic cells and thymic epithelial cells is involved in antigen processing.Nature. 1995; 375: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The MR protein family is characterized by a conserved domain architecture that comprises an N-terminal cysteine-rich (CysR) domain, a fibronectin type II (FNII) domain, and 8 or 10 contiguous C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs). In addition, each receptor possesses consensus motifs within their cytoplasmic regions that facilitate their recruitment to clathrin-coated pits and ultimately allow continuous endocytosis of exogenous cargo to the cell interior (5East L. Isacke C.M. The mannose receptor family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Although structurally related, the MR family exhibits a broad range of functions spanning phagocytosis of pathogens, internalization of soluble enzymes (PLA2R) or antigens (DEC-205). DEC-205 (LY75 or CD205) is predominantly found on dendritic cells (DCs) (4Jiang W. Swiggard W.J. Heufler C. Peng M. Mirza A. Steinman R.M. Nussenzweig M.C.

Here, DEC-205 is thought to function as a promiscuous endocytic receptor that captures a diverse repertoire of foreign and self-antigens and internalize them for antigen processing and cross-presentation (8Mahnke K. Guo M. Lee S. Sepulveda H. Swain S.L. Nussenzweig M. Steinman R.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Unlike other MR family members, DEC-205 is not predicted to bind sugars, as it lacks key residues implicated in oligosaccharide binding (9Taylor M.E. Evolution of a family of receptors containing multiple C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains.Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 10Google Scholar) but does mediate the internalization of phosphorothioated cytosine–guanosine (CpG) oligonucleotides (10Lahoud M.H. Ahmet F. Zhang J.G. Meuter S. Policheni A.N. Kitsoulis S. Lee C.N. O'Keeffe M. Sullivan L.C. Brooks A.G. Berry R. Rossjohn J. Mintern J.D. Vega-Ramos J. Villadangos J.A. et al.DEC-205 is a cell surface receptor for CpG oligonucleotides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 16270-16275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a widely used vaccine adjuvant (11Davila E. Celis E.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, CpG oligonucleotides may not represent the natural ligand of DEC-205 because of their phosphorothioation at every position of the nucleotide backbone. In addition, DEC-205+ DCs are involved in the sensing of necrotic and apoptotic cells in a manner thought to promote peripheral tolerance (12Shrimpton R.E. Butler M. Morel A.-S. Eren E. Hue S.S. Ritter M.A. CD205 (DEC-205): a recognition receptor for apoptotic and necrotic self.Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, DEC-205 is implicated in the detection of cell-death in tumor settings (13Cao L. Shi X. Chang H. Zhang Q. He Y. pH-Dependent recognition of apoptotic and necrotic cells by the human dendritic cell receptor DEC205.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 7237-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with DEC-205 suggested to play a pH-dependent role in the binding of apoptotic cells via the recognition of the C-terminal tails of Keratin 1 and 10 upon cell death (14Cao L. Chang H. Shi X. Peng C. He Y. Keratin mediates the recognition of apoptotic and necrotic cells through dendritic cell receptor DEC205/CD205.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 13438-13443Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Despite the diverse functional roles of the MR family, they seem to be united in their regulation by pH-induced structural rearrangements. Namely, DEC-205, PLA2R, and the avian IgY receptor FcRY are all reported to exist in a compact conformation at low pH and transition to an extended state under basic conditions (13Cao L. Shi X. Chang H. Zhang Q. He Y. pH-Dependent recognition of apoptotic and necrotic cells by the human dendritic cell receptor DEC205.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further, the MR is thought to exist as a monomer in acidic conditions but multimerize at neutral pH (17Boskovic J. Arnold J.N. Stilion R. Gordon S. Sim R.B. Rivera-Calzada A. Wienke D. Isacke C.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8780-8787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, such structural rearrangements are thought to influence receptor function with DEC-205 binding of keratins occurring in a pH-dependent fashion (14Cao L. Chang H. Shi X. Peng C. He Y. Keratin mediates the recognition of apoptotic and necrotic cells through dendritic cell receptor DEC205/CD205.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2011; 108: 12431-12436Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To understand the biological role of the MR family, high-resolution structural insight into such remodeling is required. While characterization of truncated MR family proteins have offered insight into ligand binding (18Feinberg H. Park-Snyder S. Kolatkar A.R. Heise C.T. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I.

Med. 2000; 191: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a complete picture of the receptor structure has remained unclear. Indeed, tracts of CTLDs, a conserved feature of the MR family, have been suggested to be too dynamic for high-resolution analysis. Further, cryo-EM studies of the MR family have been limited to low-resolution reconstructions (MR, 30 Å; Endo180, 25 Å; FcRY, 23 Å; DEC-205, 14.6 Å; PLA2R, 9.6 Å) (13Cao L. Shi X. Chang H. Zhang Q.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8780-8787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which are insufficient to accurately place domains and highlights the dynamic nature of the MR protein family ectodomains (ECDs). Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the human DEC-205 monomer at 3.2 Å resolution, revealing a compact lemniscate structure formed of two concatenated rings of CTLDs. Further, we describe a pH-dependent and ligand-dependent oligomerization of DEC-205 in vitro as well as the cryo-EM structure of the DEC-205 tetramer at 4.9 Å resolution. The tetrameric form of DEC-205 showed an extensive remodeling of the secondary CTLD ring and suggested a role for the β2-3 loop of CTLD5 in mediating this transition state. The potential physiological relevance of the DEC-205 tetramer was suggested using molecular imaging techniques in the absence and presence of CpG ligand. Our structural analysis of DEC-205 provides a fundamental advance in our understanding of this promiscuous endocytic receptor and the mannose-receptor family more broadly. We produced and purified the soluble DEC-205 ECD (residues 1–1664 spanning the N-terminal CysR to the C-terminal CTLD10) from mammalian expression to yield protein that was well behaved and suitable for structural studies. Given that DEC-205 adopts a compact conformation at low pH (13Cao L. Shi X. Chang H. Zhang Q. He Y. pH-Dependent recognition of apoptotic and necrotic cells by the human dendritic cell receptor DEC205.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 7237-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we prepared samples for single-particle cryo-EM data collection at pH 6.0 consistent with early late endosomes where DEC-205 traffics. The structure of the DEC-205 ECD was determined to a resolution of 3.2 Å (Fig. 1, Table 1 and Fig. S1). The cryo-EM reconstruction allowed unambiguous placement of the individual DEC-205 domains with almost contiguous density throughout the reconstruction. The DEC-205 ECD domains pack tightly together presenting in a lemniscate (∞) with dimensions of roughly 110 × 70 × 70 Å. Each of the tightly packed DEC-205 ECDs could be built from the N-terminal CysR (R30) to CTLD8 (E1383); however, the C-terminal CTLD 9 and 10 were invisible in the reconstruction. A large proportion of sidechains evident throughout the 2.5 Å core of the protein (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). While the surface of the reconstruction was slightly lower resolution (∼3.8 Å), it was still sufficient to allow visualization of the extended interdomain linkers (Fig. S2A) and N-linked glycans (N529, 1076, and 1158, and an apparent glycosylation at an N-X-C site at 1253)(Fig. S2B).Table 1Cryo-EM data collection, refinement, and validation statisticsData collection, refinement, and validation parametersDEC-205 monomer (EMDB 22422, PDB 7JPT)DEC-205 tetramer (EMDB 22423, PDB 7JPU)Data collection and processing Magnification130,000130,000 Voltage (kV)300300 Electron (e−/Å2)5363 Defocus range (μm)−0.8 to −2.8−0.8 to −3.5 Pixel size (Å)0.531.06 Symmetry imposedC1D2 Initial particle images (No.)610,069185,187 Final particle images (No.)310,803102,569 Map resolution (Å)3.24.9 FSC threshold0.1430.143 Map resolution range (Å)2.9–3.74.2–7.0Refinement Initial models (PDB ID)CysR (1DQO) (19Liu Y.

The overall architecture of the lemniscate comprised of two interwoven rings formed by CTLD1-4 and CTLD5-8, with the CysR and FNII domains located above the central intersect (Fig. 2, A–B). The centrally located and globular CysR and FNII domains lead into a compact 60 Å ring with a central cavity of ∼15 Å comprised of a counter-clockwise arrangement of CTLD1 through to CTLD4 (Fig. 2C). The second and slightly larger ∼65 Å ring comprises of a clockwise arrangement of CTLD5 through to CTLD8. Here, the central cavity of the second ring was occupied by an extended loop of CTLD5 (Fig. 2D). Although the reconstruction was of high quality, surprisingly CTLD9 and CTLD10 were lacking in the final reconstruction, although Western blot targeting the C-terminus confirmed intact protein, and no signs of degradation post imaging (data not shown). Inspection of the 2D class averages (Fig. 1) indeed shows an element of flexibility at the C-terminus; thus, we conclude it is highly mobile. Further, the recent structure of a truncated form of the MR could not determine the position of the C-terminal CTLD because of it being mobile in the crystal structure (20Hu Z. Shi X. Yu B. Li N. Huang Y. He Y. Structural insights into the pH-dependent conformational change and collagen recognition of the human mannose receptor.Structure. 2018; 26: 60-71.e63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that C-terminal CTLDs can be structurally dynamic and may allow the ECD freedom to sample for ligands or antigens. Comprehensive comparisons to the previously described low-resolution DEC-205 model was not possible given a lack of model coordinates; however, the model did identify the double-ringed architecture, although 8 out of 12 domains were incorrectly placed (Fig. S3) (13Cao L. Shi X. Chang H. Zhang Q. He Y. pH-Dependent recognition of apoptotic and necrotic cells by the human dendritic cell receptor DEC205.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 7237-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The CysR domain of DEC-205 adopted the classical β-trefoil architecture of the domain family (Fig. 2A), comprising of 12 antiparallel β-sheets with a loose two-fold internal symmetry (Fig. S4A). Each of the tripartite nodes includes four short β-sheets β1-4, β5-8, and β9-12, respectively, that are stabilized by three anchoring disulfide bonds akin to the CysR domain of the MR (21Fiete D.J. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. A cysteine-rich domain of the “mannose” receptor mediates GalNAc-4-SO4 binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A notable observation for the MR CysR was the identification of a pocket formed by the β11 to 12 loop and neighboring residues (19Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Misulovin Z. Leteux C. Feizi T. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of the cysteine-rich domain of mannose receptor complexed with a sulfated carbohydrate ligand.J. Exp.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This pocket was shown to bind the sulfate group of sulphated carbohydrates, a proposed ligand of the MR (19Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Misulovin Z. Leteux C. Feizi T. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of the cysteine-rich domain of mannose receptor complexed with a sulfated carbohydrate ligand.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A similar pocket is found within the DEC-205 CysR domain, and the location of the domain at the intersect of the two CTLD rings could allow ligand to the pocket comprised of A124, I133, N135, and D138 (Fig. 2A). However, although the β11 to 12 loop of the DEC-205 CysR formed a similar confirmation to that in the MR, the deletion of the ligand coordinating N102 found in the MR would likely render DEC-205 unable to coordinate sulfated ligands, corroborating previous findings (19Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Misulovin Z. Leteux C. Feizi T. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J. Crystal structure of the cysteine-rich domain of mannose receptor complexed with a sulfated carbohydrate ligand.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The FNII of DEC-205 formed a compact domain formed by two antiparallel β-sheet stacks of β1-2 and β3-4 which are tethered by two disulfide bonds that bridge over β3-4 to stabilize neighboring loops (Fig. 2B). Overall, the domain closely resembled that of the recently solved MR FNII notwithstanding subtle movements within the connecting loops (Fig. S4B) (20Hu Z. Shi X. Yu B. Li N. Huang Y. He Y. Structural insights into the pH-dependent conformational change and collagen recognition of the human mannose receptor.Structure. 2018; 26: 60-71.e63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic groove first observed in the MR FNII and subsequently in the related Endo180 FNII (22Paracuellos P. Briggs David C. Carafoli F. Lončar T. Hohenester E.

In DEC-205, the hydrophobic groove along the surface of the domain formed by H189, W193, Y200, and W206 persists. However in the context of the DEC-205 ECD, the hydrophobic pocket is partially occluded by the linker between CTLD 7 and 8, meaning key residues thought to dictate collagen reactivity in the MR would not be available for ligand binding (Fig. 2B) (20Hu Z. Shi X. Yu B. Li N. Huang Y. He Y. Structural insights into the pH-dependent conformational change and collagen recognition of the human mannose receptor.Structure. 2018; 26: 60-71.e63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A defining feature of the MR family is the tracts of CTLD domains, here each of the DEC-205 CTLDs adopted the prototypic double loop structure of the CTLD fold (23Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. The C-type lectin-like domain superfamily.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6179-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), comprising of two α-helices encasing an antiparallel stack of five β-sheets that was conserved throughout with a root mean squared deviation of ∼1.7 ± 0.7 Å, (Fig. S4, C–J). Each of the CTLDs adopted a compact β2-3 loop architecture with the exclusion of CTLD5 that stood in stark contrast with a fully extended β2-3 loop that played a role in coordinating the secondary CTLD ring (Fig. S4G) and thus in stabilizing the DEC-205 ECD. The first CTLD ring of the DEC-205 ECD had a 15 Å cavity with no loop plugging the core to serve a similar coordinating role. Owing to divergent amino acid sequences, the 10 contiguous CTLDs of DEC-205 are thought to be a structural scaffolds for ligand binding and are not predicted to bind calcium ions which facilitate oligosaccharide binding in other CTLDs (Fig. S5) (9Taylor M.E. Evolution of a family of receptors containing multiple C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains.Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 10Google Scholar). Indeed, the β2-3 loops and the β3 of each respective CTLD domain lack the necessary sidechain chemistry needed to coordinate calcium ions which coordinate vicinal hydrogen bonds that impart sugar-binding capacity to other CTLDs (Fig. S5). Notably, the reconstructed map showed no unambiguous evidence of coordinated sugars or Ca2+ although we cannot exclude this possibility. Structural comparison to the structure of a truncated N-terminal fragment of the MR showed a high amount of structural conservation with ∼2.2 Å root mean squared deviation when aligning to the corresponding CysR-CTLD2 of the DEC-205. Within the respective structures, there are subtle domain movements, most notably in the CysR that rotates 8° and moves 2 Å in the context of the DEC-205 ECD relative to the truncated MR structure (Fig. 3, A–B). Similarly, the FNII domain moves 9° and translates 5 Å in the DEC-205 ECD, whereas the CTLD1 and 2 rotate ∼6° and move 5 and 2 Å, respectively, although the individual domains are relatively similar (Fig. 3, C–F). In short, the cryo-EM structure of the DEC-205 ECD is of high quality, revealing the atomic architecture of the mannose-receptor family in new light and will serve as a platform for further characterization of DEC-205 The compact DEC-205 ECD was stabilized by an extensive network of interdomain interactions. Given the central position of the CysR domain, it made numerous contacts to CTLD4 and 7 and the neighboring FNII. The contacts from the CysR includes Q72 and H73 of the β4-5 loop that projects toward the CTLD rings and are buried within Q1168-D1170 of the retracted β2-3 loop of CTLD7 (Fig. 2E). Further, W69 of the β4 sheet of the CysR accommodates F743 of CTLD4, which projects up from the first CTLD ring (Fig. 2E). The neighboring Q745 of CTLD4 contacts Q1168-D1170 of the retracted β2-3 loop of CTLD7 to stabilize the interface around H73 (Fig. 2E). Although a much more compact domain, the FNII made peripheral contact to CTLD7 and 8 but mainly interacts with the α1 and face of the β1, driven by a salt bridge from R167 (FNII) to E242 (CTLD1). In addition to the extensive contacts from the CysR and the FNII, CTLD1 made extensive contact to the terminal CTLDs of the two rings, namely CTLD4 and 8, which serves to stabilize the first CTLD ring. Instead of calcium-binding, the CTLD β2-3 loops seem to have been repurposed toward stabilizing the overall arrangement of the DEC-205 ECD. In fact, around ∼50% of the total interdomain buried surface area (BSA) of the DEC-205 ECD is accounted for by β2-3 loop-mediated interactions (Fig. 2F). Most striking was the extended β2-3 loop of CTLD5, which acted as a “recruitment hub”, whereby it co-ordinated several domains within the secondary ring including CTLDs 6, 7, and 8. Intriguingly, the β2-3 loop of CTLD5 contained an apical charged cluster of, W893, H894, and R895 that interacted with CTLD7. Here, R895 seemed to tether the loop apex via sidechain interaction with a neutral pocket composed of L1172, N1173, and Q1193 within CTLD7 with peripheral interaction between W893 and H1183, which further stabilized the extended long-loop conformation (Fig. 2G). The extensive interdomain BSA and interactions of the DEC-205 ECD included major contributions from the central domains of the lemniscate, namely CysR, CTLD1, CTLD4, and CTLD5 and 8 (summarized Fig. 2H and Table S1). The cryo-EM structure of the DEC-205 ECD provided profound insight into the structural arrangement of a MR family member. Moreover, the high-resolution of the DEC-205 ECD allowed unambiguous placements of the domains and robust placement of the sidechains beyond those previously identified for DEC-205 (13Cao L. Shi X.

Less attention is paid to the improvement of scars, especially in aesthetically relevant areas of the body, which can dramatically affect patients’ wellbeing. We explored patients’ perspectives about treatment options and the social and psychological burden of disease (lesion and scar). Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with ten confirmed CL patients at two L . major endemic sites in Southern Tunisia (Sidi Bouzid and Gafsa). Participants were selected using a sampling approach along a spectrum covering e.g. age, sex, and clinical presentation. Patients’ experiences, opinions and preferences were explored, and their detailed accounts gave an insight on the impact of CL on their everyday lives. The impact of CL was found to be considerable. Most patients were not satisfied with treatment performance and case management. They expected a shorter healing time and better accessibility of the health system. Tolerance of the burden of disease was variable and ranged from acceptance of hidden scars to suicidal thoughts resulting from the fear to become handicapped, and the stress caused by close relatives. Some believed CL to be a form of skin cancer. Unexpectedly, this finding shows the big gap between the perspectives of patients and assumptions of health professionals regarding this disease. This study provided valuable information for better case management emphasizing the importance of improving communication with patients, and accessibility to treatment. It generated context-specific knowledge to policy makers in Tunisia to implement effective case management in a country where access to treatment remains a challenge due to socio-economic and geographic barriers despite a long tradition in CL control."
https://openalex.org/W3110611107,"In recent years, the popularity of tablets has skyrocketed and there has been an explosive growth in apps designed for children. Howhever, many of these apps are released without tests for their effectiveness. This is worrying given that the factors influencing children’s learning from touchscreen devices need to be examined in detail. In particular, it has been suggested that children learn less from passive video viewing relative to equivalent live interaction, which would have implications for learning from such digital tools. However, this so-called video deficit may be reduced by allowing children greater influence over their learning environment. Across two touchscreen-based experiments, we examined whether 2- to 4-year-olds benefit from actively choosing what to learn more about in a digital word learning task. We designed a tablet study in which “active” participants were allowed to choose which objects they were taught the label of, while yoked “passive” participants were presented with the objects chosen by their active peers. We then examined recognition of the learned associations across different tasks. In Experiment 1, children in the passive condition outperformed those in the active condition (n = 130). While Experiment 2 replicated these findings in a new group of Malay-speaking children (n = 32), there were no differences in children’s learning or recognition of the novel word-object associations using a more implicit looking time measure. These results suggest that there may be performance costs associated with active tasks designed as in the current study, and at the very least, there may not always be systematic benefits associated with active learning in touchscreen-based word learning tasks. The current studies add to the evidence that educational apps need to be evaluated before release: While children might benefit from interactive apps under certain conditions, task design and requirements need to consider factors that may detract from successful performance."
https://openalex.org/W3106989191,"Objective To describe the feasibility of a fresh frozen human cadaver model for research and training of endovascular image guided procedures in the aorta and lower extremity. Methods The cadaver model was constructed in fresh frozen human cadaver torsos and lower extremities. Endovascular access was acquired by inserting a sheath in the femoral artery. The arterial segment of the specimen was restricted by ligation of collateral arteries and, in the torsos, clamping of the contralateral femoral artery and balloon occlusion of the supratruncal aorta. Tap water was administered through the sheath to create sufficient intraluminal pressure to manipulate devices and acquire digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Endovascular cannulation tasks of the visceral arteries (torso) or the peripheral arteries (lower extremities) were performed to assess the vascular patency of the model. Feasibility of this model is based on our institute’s experiences throughout the use of six fresh frozen human cadaver torsos and 22 lower extremities. Results Endovascular simulation in the aortic and peripheral vasculature was achieved using this human cadaver model. Acquisition of DSA images was feasible in both the torsos and the lower extremities. Approximately 84 of the 90 target vessels (93.3%) were patent, the remaining six vessels showed signs of calcified steno-occlusive disease. Conclusions Fresh frozen human cadavers provide a feasible simulation model for aortic and peripheral endovascular interventions, and can potentially reduce the need for animal experimentation. This model is suitable for the evaluation of new endovascular devices and techniques or to master endovascular skills."
https://openalex.org/W3108099845,"Infectious diseases are considered major threats to biodiversity, however strategies to mitigate their impacts in the natural world are scarce and largely unsuccessful. Chytridiomycosis is responsible for the decline of hundreds of amphibian species worldwide, but an effective disease management strategy that could be applied across natural habitats is still lacking. In general amphibian larvae can be easily captured, offering opportunities to ascertain the impact of altering the abundance of hosts, considered to be a key parameter affecting the severity of the disease. Here, we report the results of two experiments to investigate how altering host abundance affects infection intensity in amphibian populations of a montane area of Central Spain suffering from lethal amphibian chytridiomycosis. Our laboratory-based experiment supported the conclusion that varying density had a significant effect on infection intensity when salamander larvae were housed at low densities. Our field experiment showed that reducing the abundance of salamander larvae in the field also had a significant, but weak, impact on infection the following year, but only when removals were extreme. While this suggests adjusting host abundance as a mitigation strategy to reduce infection intensity could be useful, our evidence suggests only heavy culling efforts will succeed, which may run contrary to objectives for conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3108595237,"Mexico is one of the world’s major poultry producing countries. Two significant challenges currently facing the poultry industry are the responsible and judicious use of antimicrobials, and the potential occurrence of infectious disease outbreaks. For example, repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H7N3 have occurred in poultry since its first detection in Mexico in 2012. Both of these challenges can be addressed through good husbandry practices and the application of on-farm biosecurity measures. The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the biosecurity measures practiced across different types of poultry farms in Mexico, and (ii) to collect information regarding antimicrobial usage. A cross-sectional study was carried out through on-farm interviews on 43 poultry farms. A multiple correspondence analysis was performed to characterize the farms based on their pattern of biosecurity practices and antimicrobial usage. Three clusters of farms were identified using an agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis. In each cluster, a specific farm type was predominant. The biosecurity measures that significantly differentiated the visited farms, thus allowing their clusterization, were: the use of personal protective equipment (e.g. face masks, hair caps, and eye protection), the requirement for a hygiene protocol before and after entering the farm, the use of exclusive working clothes by staff and visitors, footbath presence at the barn entrance, and the mortality disposal strategy. The more stringent the biosecurity measures on farms within a cluster, the fewer the farms that used antimicrobials. Farms with more biosecurity breaches used antimicrobials considered critically important for public health. These findings could be helpful to understand how to guide strategies to reinforce compliance with biosecurity practices identified as critical according to the farm type. We conclude by providing certain recommendations to improve on-farm biosecurity measures."
https://openalex.org/W3109533405,"Background Oral drugs can have side effects such as diarrhea that indicate the perturbation of the gut microbial community. To further understand the dynamics of perturbation, we have assessed the strain relatedness of samples from previously published data sets from pre and post bowel evacuation, episodes of diarrhea, and administration of oral drugs to treat diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Methods We analyzed a total of published five data sets using our strain-tracking tool called Window-based Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) Similarity (WSS) to identify related strains from the same individual. Results Strain-tracking analysis using the first data set from 8 individuals pre and 21–50 days post iso-osmotic bowel wash revealed almost all microbial strains were related in an individual between pre and post samples. Similarly, in a second study, strain-tracking analysis of 4 individuals pre and post sporadic diarrhea revealed the majority of strains were related over time (up to 44 weeks). In contrast, the analysis of a third data set from 22 individuals pre and post 3-day exposure of oral metformin revealed that no individuals had a related strain. In a fourth study, the data set taken at 2 and 4 months from 38 individuals on placebo or metformin revealed individual specific sharing of pre and post strains. Finally, the data set from 18 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis given disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs methotrexate or glycosides of the traditional Chinese medicinal component Tripterygium wilfordii showed individual specific sharing of pre and post strains up to 16 months. Conclusion Oral drugs used to treat chronic disease can result in individual specific microbial strain change for the majority of species. Since the gut community provides essential functions for the host, our study supports personalized monitoring to assess the status of the dominant microbial strains after initiation of oral drugs to treat chronic disease."

This study aimed to compare postoperative clinical outcomes and inflammatory markers among patients who were anesthetized using local, spinal, or general anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair. Methods This randomized controlled trial included patients scheduled to undergo elective unilateral inguinal hernioplasty at Siriraj Hospital during November 2014 to September 2015 study period. Patients were randomly assigned to the local (LA), spinal (SA), or general (GA) anesthesia groups. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain at rest and on mobilization at 8 and 24 hours after surgery. Results Fifty-four patients were included, with 18 patients randomly assigned to each group. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among groups. There were no significant differences among groups for postoperative pain at rest or on mobilization at 8 and 24 hours after surgery. No significant differences were observed for interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 at any time points in any groups. Patients with local anesthesia was associated with less time spent in anesthesia ( p = 0.010) and surgery ( p = 0.009), lower intraoperative cost ( p = 0.003) and total cost in hospital ( p = 0.036); however, patient satisfaction in the local anesthesia group (94/100) was statistically significantly lower than the spinal and general anesthesia groups (100/100) ( p = 0.010). Conclusions No statistically significant difference was observed among groups for postoperative pain scores, duration of hospital stays, complications, or change in inflammatory markers. However, time spent in anesthesia and surgery, the intraoperative cost and total cost for hernia repair, and patient satisfaction were significantly lower in the local anesthesia group than in the other two groups."
https://openalex.org/W3107278582,"Donor brain death (BD) is initiated by an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), which subsequently damages the donor lung. In this study, we investigated whether the speed of ICP increase affects quality of donor lungs, in a rat model for fast versus slow BD induction. Rats were assigned to 3 groups: 1) control, 2) fast BD induction (ICP increase over 1 min) or 3) slow BD induction (ICP increase over 30 min). BD was induced by epidural inflation of a balloon catheter. Brain-dead rats were sacrificed after 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours to study time-dependent changes. Hemodynamic stability, histological lung injury and inflammatory status were investigated. We found that fast BD induction compromised hemodynamic stability of rats more than slow BD induction, reflected by higher mean arterial pressures during the BD induction period and an increased need for hemodynamic support during the BD stabilization phase. Furthermore, fast BD induction increased histological lung injury scores and gene expression levels of TNF-α and MCP-1 at 0.5 hours after induction. Yet after donor stabilization, inflammatory status was comparable between the two BD models. This study demonstrates fast BD induction deteriorates quality of donor lungs more on a histological level than slow BD induction."

https://openalex.org/W3108110407,"Introduction To explore the ethnobiological wisdom of the tribals of three western districts of West Bengal, India against poisonous and non-poisonous bites and stings, a quantitative approach was adopted. These age-old yet unexplored knowledge can be utilized in finding lead-molecules against poisonous and non-poisonous animal-bites. Further, an evidence-based approach is needed to assess the venom-neutralization ability of plants by experimental studies. Materials and methods During 2008–2009 and 2012–2017, 11 ethnomedicinal surveys were carried out to explore the use of medicinal flora and fauna via conducting open semi-structured interviews with 47 traditional healers (THs) or informants. The retrieved dataset was statistically evaluated using seven quantitative-indexes: use-value (UV), informants'-consensus-factor (ICF), fidelity-level (FL), relative-importance (RI), cultural importance-index (CI), index of agreement on remedies (IAR) and cultural agreement-index (CAI). Anti-phospholipaseA 2 (PLA 2 ) properties of selected plant extracts were also examined. In addition, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the water extract of the plants showing high FL as well as significant PLA 2 inhibitory potential were investigated using Allium cepa root tip assay. Results A total of 41 traditional-formulations (TFs) containing 40 plant species (of 39 genera from 28 families) and 3 animal species were prescribed by the THs. Fabaceae exhibited most number of medicinal plants. Piper nigrum (1.78) and Apis cerana indica and Crossopriza lyoni (both 0.21) exhibited the highest UV among the plants and the animals respectively. Stinging of centipede and dog/cat/hyena bite displayed highest ICF (1.00 each). Among the plants, the maximum RI (0.91) and CI (4.98) values were observed for Aristolochia indica . IAR (1.00) was recorded maximum for Achyranthes aspera , Gloriosa superba , Lycopodium cernuum , Smilax zeylanica and Streblus asper . Maximum CAI value was noted for Piper nigrum (5.5096). Among the animals, Apis cerana indica (0.31) and Crossopriza lyoni (1.52) displayed the highest RI and CI values respectively. Crossopriza lyoni (0.99) and Apis cerana indica (1.3871) exhibited maximum IAR and CAI values respectively. Plants showing higher FL exhibited higher anti-PLA 2 activity via selective inhibition of human-group PLA 2 . In addition, Allium cepa root tip assay has indicated the safety and/or toxicity of the plant parts prescribed by the THs. Root water extracts of Aristolochia indica and Gloriosa superba exhibited significant genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Conclusions Three western districts of West Bengal is the natural abode for many tribal and non-tribal communities. A noteworthy correlation was established between the plants used against poisonous-bites and their anti-PLA 2 activity. A few plant parts used by the THs also exhibited high toxicity. Such alternative medical practices serve as the only option in these underprivileged and backward areas during medical-exigencies."
https://openalex.org/W3108236414,"Aim Subclasses of different glycaemic disturbances could explain the variation in characteristics of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to examine the association between subgroups based on their glucose curves during a five-point mixed-meal tolerance test (MMT) and metabolic traits at baseline and glycaemic deterioration in individuals with T2D. Methods The study included 787 individuals with newly diagnosed T2D from the Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification (IMI-DIRECT) Study. Latent class trajectory analysis (LCTA) was used to identify distinct glucose curve subgroups during a five-point MMT. Using general linear models, these subgroups were associated with metabolic traits at baseline and after 18 months of follow up, adjusted for potential confounders. Results At baseline, we identified three glucose curve subgroups, labelled in order of increasing glucose peak levels as subgroup 1–3. Individuals in subgroup 2 and 3 were more likely to have higher levels of HbA1c, triglycerides and BMI at baseline, compared to those in subgroup 1. At 18 months (n = 651), the beta coefficients (95% CI) for change in HbA1c (mmol/mol) increased across subgroups with 0.37 (-0.18–1.92) for subgroup 2 and 1.88 (-0.08–3.85) for subgroup 3, relative to subgroup 1. The same trend was observed for change in levels of triglycerides and fasting glucose. Conclusions Different glycaemic profiles with different metabolic traits and different degrees of subsequent glycaemic deterioration can be identified using data from a frequently sampled mixed-meal tolerance test in individuals with T2D. Subgroups with the highest peaks had greater metabolic risk."

The intensive use of sea areas has become an important method in solving the contradiction between ocean supply and demand, thereby ensuring sustainable marine economy development, tapping potential sea-area utilization, reasonably allocating sea-area utilization structures, and increasing marine economic benefits. This paper explores the definition and connotation of intensive sea-area use and constructs an evaluation index system based on marine input intensity, marine utilization structure, marine economic benefit, and marine ecological environment. Multi-objective variable fuzzy set theory and fuzzy decision analysis methods were used to evaluate the intensive sea-area utilization in the Liaoning Coastal Economic Zone of China during 2004–2016. The spatial differentiation characteristics of intensive sea-area use were analysed using cluster analysis. The research result showed that: (1) Intensive utilization level of the Liaoning coastal economic zone has gradually increased, while it is still in a moderately weak level; (2) Sea area intensive utilization varied in degrees and fluctuates in the six cities under the jurisdiction of the Liaoning coastal economic zone; and (3) Marine input intensity, marine utilization structure, marine economic benefit, and marine sustainability indexes have increased in the cities, thereby exhibiting improvements in the Liaoning coastal economic zone."
https://openalex.org/W3109964172,"Background Prevalence estimates from surveys with low response rates are prone to non-response bias if respondents and non-respondents differ on the outcome of interest. This study assessed the external validity of prevalence estimates of selected maternity indicators from four national maternity surveys in England which had similar survey methodology but different response rates. Methods A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the national maternity surveys in 2006 (response rate = 63%), 2010 (response rate = 54%), 2014 (response rate = 47%) and 2018 (response rate = 29%). Unweighted and (for the 2014 and 2018 surveys) weighted survey prevalence estimates (with 95%CIs) of caesarean section, preterm birth, low birthweight and breastfeeding initiation were validated against population-based estimates from routine data. Results The external validity of the survey estimates varied across surveys and by indicator. For caesarean section, the 95%CIs for the unweighted survey estimates included the population-based estimates for all surveys. For preterm birth and low birthweight, the 95%CIs for the unweighted survey estimates did not include the population-based estimates for the 2006 and 2010 surveys (or the 2014 survey for preterm birth). For breastfeeding initiation, the 95%CIs for the unweighted survey estimates did not include the population-based estimates for any survey. For all indicators, the effect of weighting (on the 2014 and 2018 survey estimates) was mostly a shift towards the population-based estimates, yet the 95%CIs for the weighted survey estimates of breastfeeding initiation did not include the population-based estimates. Conclusion There were no clear differences in the external validity of prevalence estimates according to survey response rate suggesting that prevalence estimates may still be valid even when survey response rates are low. The survey estimates tended to become closer to the population-based estimates when weights were applied, yet the effect was insufficient for breastfeeding initiation estimates."

Through a questionnaire survey, the construction of the knowledge management model of construction-related enterprises and engineering cost consulting enterprises is discussed. First, through the analysis and discussion of ontology-based data mining (OBDM) algorithm and association analysis (Apriori) algorithm, a data mining algorithm (ML-AR algorithm) on account of ontology-based multilayer association and machine learning is proposed. The performance of the various algorithms is compared and analyzed. Second, based on the knowledge management level, analysis and statistics are conducted on the levels of knowledge acquisition, sharing, storage, and innovation. Finally, according to the foregoing, the knowledge management model based on engineering cost consulting enterprises is built and analyzed. The results show that the reliability coefficient of this questionnaire is above 0.8, and the average extracted value is above 0.7, verifying excellent reliability and validity. The efficiency of the ML-AR algorithm at both the number of transactions and the support level is better than the other two algorithms, which is expected to be applied to the enterprise knowledge management model. There is a positive correlation between each level of knowledge management; among them, the positive correlation between knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing is the strongest. The enterprise knowledge management model has a positive impact on promoting organizational innovation capability and industrial development. The research work provides a direction for the development of enterprise knowledge management and the improvement of innovation ability."
https://openalex.org/W3109830627,"Background Chronic subclinical hemolysis is frequent in patients implanted with Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) and is associated with adverse outcomes. Consequences of LVADs-induced subclinical hemolysis on kidney structure and function is currently unknown. Methods Thirty-three patients implanted with a Heartmate II LVAD (Abbott, Inc, Chicago IL) were retrospectively studied. Hemolysis, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and the evolution of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate were analyzed. Proximal Tubulopathy (PT) groups were defined according to proteinuria, normoglycemic glycosuria, and electrolytic disorders. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze threshold of LDH values associated with PT. Results Median LDH between PT groups were statistically different, 688 IU/L [642–703] and 356 IU/L [320–494] in the “PT” and “no PT” groups, respectively p = 0.006. To determine PT group, LDH threshold &gt; 600 IU/L was associated with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 42.1–99.6) and a specificity of 84.6% (95% CI, 65.1–95.6). The ROC's Area Under Curve was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.68–0.98). In the “PT” group, patients had 4.2 [2.5–5.0] AKI episodes per year of exposure, versus 1.6 [0.4–3.7] in the “no PT” group, p = 0.03. A higher occurrence of AKI was associated with subsequent development of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (p = 0.02) and death (p = 0.05). Conclusions LVADs-induced subclinical hemolysis is associated with proximal tubular functional alterations, which in turn contribute to the occurrence of AKI and subsequent CKD. Owing to renal toxicity of hemolysis, measures to reduce subclinical hemolysis intensity as canula position or pump parameters should be systematically considered, as well as specific nephroprotective therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3109982860,"During studies on the absorption and interactions between silver nanoparticles and mammalian cells grown in vitro it was observed that large extracellular rings of silver nanoparticles were deposited on the microscope slide, many located near post-mitotic cells. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP, 80nm), coated with citrate, were incubated at concentrations of 0.3 to 30 μg/ml with a human-derived culture of retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and observed using darkfield and fluorescent microscopy, 24 h after treatment. Approximately cell-sized extracellular rings of deposited AgNP were observed on the slides among a field of dispersed individual AgNP. The mean diameter of 45 nanoparticles circles was 62.5 +/-12 microns. Ring structures were frequently observed near what appeared to be post-mitotic daughter cells, giving rise to the possibility that cell membrane fragments were deposited on the slide during mitosis, and those fragments selectively attracted and retained silver nanoparticles from suspension in the cell culture medium. These circular structures were observable for the following technical reasons: 1) darkfield microscope could observe single nanoparticles below 100 nm in size, 2) a large concentration (10 8 and 10 9 ) of nanoparticles was used in these experiments 3) negatively charged nanoparticles were attracted to adhesion membrane proteins remaining on the slide from mitosis.

Our assays reveal a proinflammatory response of neutrophils after A . baumannii infection, since intracellular transcription of effector proteins such as COX-2, transcription factors, and proinflammatory cytokines resulted significantly upregulated in neutrophils infected by A . baumannii , compared with unstimulated human neutrophils. Translation and release of CXCL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α by neutrophils was confirmed by protein quantification in culture supernatants. Results obtained in this report reinforce the importance of human neutrophils in controlling A . baumannii infections but also emphasize the proinflammatory nature of these host-pathogen interactions as a target for future immunomodulatory therapies."

Methods In this prospective, monocentric study, patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were offered to wear an electronic bracelet. The main objective was to measure the physical activity recovery. Secondary objectives were the predictors of the correct use of the monitoring system, of the physical recovery and, if any, the relationship between physical activity and out-of-hospital morbidity. Results One hundred patients were included. Most patients (86%) were interested in participating in the study. The compliance to the device and to the study protocol was good (94%). At discharge, the mean number of daily steps was 1454 ± 145 steps, increasing quite homogeneously, reaching 5801±1151 steps at Day 60. The best fit regression curve gave a maximum number of steps at 5897±119 (r 2 = 0.97). The 85% level of activity was achieved at Day 30±3. No predictor of noncompliance was found. At discharge, age was independently associated with a lower number of daily steps (p &lt;0.001). At Day 60, age, peripheral arterial disease and cardio-pulmonary bypass duration were independently associated with a lower number of daily steps (p = 0.039, p = 0.041 and p = 0.033, respectively). Conclusions After cardiac surgery, wearing a smart bracelet recording daily steps is simple, well tolerated and suitable for measuring physical activity. Standard patients achieved around 6000 daily steps 2 months after discharge. 85% of this activity is reached in the first month. Clinical trial registry number NCT03113565"
https://openalex.org/W3109608625,"Word-production theories argue that during language production, a concept activates multiple lexical candidates in left temporal cortex, and the intended word is selected from this set. Evidence for theories on spoken-word production comes, for example, from the picture-word interference task, where participants name pictures superimposed by congruent (e.g., picture: rabbit, distractor “rabbit”), categorically related (e.g., distractor “sheep”), or unrelated (e.g., distractor “fork”) words. Typically, whereas congruent distractors facilitate naming, related distractors slow down picture naming relative to unrelated distractors, resulting in semantic interference. However, the neural correlates of semantic interference are debated. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that the left mid-to-posterior STG (pSTG) is involved in the interference associated with semantically related distractors. To probe the functional relevance of this area, we targeted the left pSTG with focal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) while subjects performed a picture-word interference task. Unexpectedly, pSTG stimulation did not affect the semantic interference effect but selectively increased the congruency effect (i.e., faster naming with congruent distractors). The facilitatory TMS effect selectively occurred in the more difficult list with an overall lower name agreement. Our study adds new evidence to the causal role of the left pSTG in the interaction between picture and distractor representations or processing streams, only partly supporting previous neuroimaging studies. Moreover, the observed unexpected condition-specific facilitatory rTMS effect argues for an interaction of the task- or stimulus-induced brain state with the modulatory TMS effect. These issues should be systematically addressed in future rTMS studies on language production."
https://openalex.org/W3109878387,"Background Psychological distress following traumatic injury can influence the patient health, well-being and quality of life; however, this impact may partly vary according to the type and severity of injury. We aimed to study the predominant distress causing cluster and individual symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) at the clinical and subthreshold level in patients with traumatic injuries, based on the mechanism of injury (MOI). Methods A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted at a Level 1 Trauma Center utilizing PTSD Checklist to diagnose PTSD after one month of the traumatic event. All patients suffering from psychological distresses were assessed by a clinical psychologist in the trauma section. PTSD diagnostic criteria from DSM-5 were used to classify the patients. The inclusion criteria comprised of adult trauma patients who were directly involved in traumatic injuries and admitted under the Trauma Surgery services for a minimum of one day; have ability to provide written informed consent and can be assessed with the PCL-5 checklist after 4 weeks post-injury. Results Two hundred patients completed PCL-5 checklist, of them 26 (13.0%) were positive for PTSD and 174 (87%) had subthreshold scores. The mean age of participants was 34.4±11.8 years and males constituted 90.5%. Road traffic injury (RTI) was most the frequent injury mechanism (59%). PTSD positive patients with RTI, fall of heavy objects, pedestrian injury and assaults had highest average scores on clusters of negative alterations in mood and cognitions (16.9, 18.0, 18.5, 17.0 respectively), followed by hyperarousal. Symptom of always being on the guard and having repeated unwanted or disturbing memories of the incident, was reported by nearly 100% PTSD positive patients. Patients with subthreshold scores also reported distressing symptoms on all four clusters of PTSD. Conclusions Patients with different MOI showed a broad range of psychological problems with respect to symptom clusters. Negative alteration in mood and cognition followed by hyperarousal caused higher level of distress in patients post traumatic injuries. Subthreshold symptoms of PTSD are more common and deserve more attention."
https://openalex.org/W3107322052,"Myosin-1C is a single-headed, short-tailed member of the myosin class I subfamily that supports a variety of actin-based functions in the cytosol and nucleus. In vertebrates, alternative splicing of the MYO1C gene leads to the production of three isoforms, myosin-1C0, myosin-1C16, and myosin-1C35, that carry N-terminal extensions of different lengths. However, it is not clear how these extensions affect the chemomechanical coupling of human myosin-1C isoforms. Here, we report on the motor activity of the different myosin-1C isoforms measuring the unloaded velocities of constructs lacking the C-terminal lipid-binding domain on nitrocellulose-coated glass surfaces and full-length constructs on reconstituted, supported lipid bilayers. The higher yields of purified proteins obtained with constructs lacking the lipid-binding domain allowed a detailed characterization of the individual kinetic steps of human myosin-1C isoforms in their productive interaction with nucleotides and filamentous actin. Isoform-specific differences include 18-fold changes in the maximum power output per myosin-1C motor and 4-fold changes in the velocity and the resistive force at which maximum power output occurs. Our results support a model in which the isoform-specific N-terminal extensions affect chemomechanical coupling by combined steric and allosteric effects, thereby reducing both the length of the working stroke and the rate of ADP release in the absence of external loads by a factor of 2 for myosin-1C35. As the large change in maximum power output shows, the functional differences between the isoforms are further amplified by the presence of external loads."
https://openalex.org/W3107838488,"Our previous work has shown myometrial PKA activity declines in term and twin-preterm labour in association with an increase in the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OTR). Here we investigate the action of cAMP/PKA in basal conditions, with the addition of progesterone (P4) and/or IL-1β to understand how cAMP/PKA acts to maintain pregnancy and whether the combination of cAMP and P4 would be a viable therapeutic combination for the prevention of preterm labour (PTL). Further, given that we have previously found that cAMP enhances P4 action we wanted to test the hypothesis that changes in the cAMP effector system are responsible for the functional withdrawal of myometrial P4 action. Myometrial cells were grown from biopsies obtained from women at the time of elective Caesarean section before the onset of labour. The addition of forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, repressed basal OTR mRNA levels at all doses and P4 only enhanced this effect at its highest dose. Forskolin repressed the IL-1β-induced increase in OTR mRNA and protein levels in a PKA-dependent fashion and repressed IL-1β-activation and nuclear transfer of NFκB and AP-1. P4 had similar effects and the combination P4 and forskolin had greater effects on OTR and NFκB than forskolin alone. While PKA knockdown had no effect on the ability of P4 to repress IL-1β-induced OTR expression it reversed the repressive effect of the combination of P4 and forskolin and resulted in a greater increase than observed with IL-1β alone. These studies suggest that cAMP acts via PKA to repress inflammation-driven OTR expression, but that when PKA activity is reduced, the combination of cAMP and P4 actually enhances the OTR response to inflammation, promoting the onset of labour and suggesting that changes in the cAMP effector system can induce a functional P4 withdrawal."
