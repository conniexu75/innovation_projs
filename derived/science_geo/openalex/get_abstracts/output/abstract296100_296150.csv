The knowledge forms complex schemata that can guide a problem's interpretation and solution and that constitute a large part of what we call physical intuition."
https://openalex.org/W2047305618,Intensive forest management led to elevated losses of nitrogen from a recently harvested loblolly pine plantation in North Carolina. Measurements of nitrogen-15 retention in the field demonstrated that microbial uptake of nitrogen during the decomposition of residual organic material was the most important process retaining nitrogen. Management practices that remove this material cause increased losses of nitrogen to aquatic ecosystems and the atmosphere.
https://openalex.org/W2094047451,Mite populations grew more rapidly on new growth of cotton seedlings that had never been exposed to mites than on new growth of plants whose cotyledons had been previously exposed to them. Experiments in which a second mite introduction on the exposed plants involved a different mite species produced this same result. The substance or substances responsible for the response are transported systemically among leaves of cotton seedlings.
https://openalex.org/W2031002680,"Potassium-argon dating of five basalts from the three main islands of the Juan Fern√°ndez (or Robinson Crusoe) Islands of Chile in the southeastern Pacific gives ages of 1.01 +/- 0.12 and 2.44 +/- 0.14 million years for Masafuera, 3.79 +/- 0.20 and 4.23 +/- 0.16 for Masatierra, and 5.8 +/- 2.1 for Santa Clara. These ages are much younger than that of the underlying oceanic plate and are consistent with the origin of the island-seamount chain from a mantle hot spot beneath the eastward moving Nazca plate. The young age for the archipelago suggests that speciation within endemic genera has occurred within the past 4 to 5 million years. Endemic genera of apparently more ancient origins, such as Lactoris and Thyrsopteris, have apparently dispersed to the islands and survive refugially."
https://openalex.org/W1973692209,"Some advances have been made in teleoperator technology through the introduction of various sensors, computers, automation, and new man-machine interface devices and techniques for remote manipulator control. The development of dexterous articulated mechanisms, smart sensors, flexible computer controls, intelligent man-machine interfaces, and innovative system designs for advanced teleoperation is, however, far from complete, and poses many interdisciplinary challenges. This article summarizes the state of the art, gives a brief outline of the basic problems, and presents the results of teleoperator research and development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W2031386154,"The Very Large Array has been used to survey a small region of sky at a wavelength of 6 centimeters down to a completeness level of 60 microjanskys-about 100 times weaker than the faintest radio sources that have been detected with other instruments. The observed source count at flux densities below 100 millijanskys converges in a manner similar to the lower frequency counts, although there is some evidence for an excess of sources weaker than 100 microjanskys. The sources in the survey are preferentially identified with faint galaxies."

https://openalex.org/W1967267749,"Over the past 20 years computer technology has advanced rapidly, especially in the areas of logic and memory. Continued growth at a similar pace can be expected through and probably beyond the 1980's. The technology has already had such major effects on scientific research and engineering that it is of practical importance to try to predict its evolution and uses. It is likely that the trend toward smaller, faster, and cheaper circuits made possible by improved lithographic techniques will continue, resulting in a factor of 10 increase in speed of central processing units and an even greater increase in speed of single-chip microprocessors by the end of the decade. Similar progress is expected in the areas of memory, magnetic storage, printers, and displays. Overall, approximately 20 percent growth annually in the capability of computing systems can be projected. How this continually increasing computing power will affect scientific and engineering activity is more difficult to predict, but some patterns are emerging. Observations of technical personnel at the IBM research laboratory at Yorktown, New York, where the average user has access to a large amount of computing capability and to a worldwide computer network, indicate that workers in different areas have reacted to computer technology in different ways. Whereas engineers have used computing power, displays, and the ability to communicate or share information more or less equally, management has used communication most and scientists have put the greatest value on computing power and displays."
https://openalex.org/W2057043099,"In view of the Supreme Court decision in Chakrabarty v. Diamond, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, it is possible that plant varieties can be protected under three different U.S. statutes: the Plant Variety Protection Act, the Plant Patent Law, and the General Patent Law. The Plant Variety Protection Act protects varieties that are reproduced by seed, whereas the Plant Patent Law protects varieties reproduced asexually. Varieties, irrespective of how they are reproduced, could be patentable under the General Patent Statute. It is not clear whether parts of plants can be protected by grants under the Plant Patent Law or Plant Variety Protection Act and it is possible that they will be best protected under the General Patent Statute and by maintaining them as trade secrets. Only time will show whether the existing statutes are sufficient to provide both guidance and adequate protection or whether changes in the law will be required."
https://openalex.org/W2022416771,"Forecasters have been revising downward te figures for energy demand during the past decade at such a rate that what was once considered a utopian vision is becoming accepted as conventional wisdom. Old econometric models are bein discarded as new relationships are introduced. A striking indication of change lies in the shifting relation between energy and the gross national product. Before the 1973 to 1974 oil embargo, energy use increased faster than economic growth. Since then, however, that trend has reversed. Energy demand now increases less rapidly than the economy. The experts' forecasts for energy use in the United States for the year 2000 or 2010 have changed so radically that the lowest energy-demand projection (125 x 10/sup 15/ Btu) made in 1972 by Amory Lovins, a low-growth advocate, was higher than the highest projection (124 x 10/sup 15/ Btu) made in 1977 to 1978 by Ralph Lapp. The author cautions that it does not mean the new trend in energy prophecy will produce more-accurate information than the old trend. The abrupt reversal does suggest, according to the author, that a radical change is working its way through the economy. (SAC)"

https://openalex.org/W2158285427,"Prodded by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Congress has asked the Pentagon to provide what amounts to an environmental impact statement on the potential for nuclear weapons explosions to create enough soot and dust to cause a nuclear winter. The request has implications for arms control and civil defense as well as for weapons procurement and deployment. Little attention was given to the atmospheric and climatic effects of nuclear war until the nuclear winter concept was introduced in October of 1983. Only the Navy and the DOE took steps to follow up until pressure was put on Congress and the Pentagon for further study. Pentagon criticism of the nuclear winter presentation argues that the scenario assumptions that cities will be targeted and that a conflict will involve 5000-6500 megatons are incorrect."
https://openalex.org/W2011465669,"The Soviet Union is actively considering two plans to divert large northern lakes and rivers to the south of the country. If adopted, these would rank among the most expensive and complicated engineering projects ever undertaken, with unforeseeable but possibly far-reaching environmental effects. The plans, now at an advanced stage, have aroused a spirited public controversy, providing an unusual glimpse of Soviet policy-making and technology assessment. Major decisions are due by 1985. The question is, what will happen to the quality and openness of this debate as the political stakes rise and the time of decision draws near?"
