https://openalex.org/W4281754639,"The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2, which was first described in November 2021, spread rapidly to become globally dominant and has split into a number of sublineages. BA.1 dominated the initial wave but has been replaced by BA.2 in many countries. Recent sequencing from South Africa's Gauteng region uncovered two new sublineages, BA.4 and BA.5, which are taking over locally, driving a new wave. BA.4 and BA.5 contain identical spike sequences, and although closely related to BA.2, they contain further mutations in the receptor-binding domain of their spikes. Here, we study the neutralization of BA.4/5 using a range of vaccine and naturally immune serum and panels of monoclonal antibodies. BA.4/5 shows reduced neutralization by the serum from individuals vaccinated with triple doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine compared with BA.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, using the serum from BA.1 vaccine breakthrough infections, there are, likewise, significant reductions in the neutralization of BA.4/5, raising the possibility of repeat Omicron infections."

The initial explosion and subsequent plume triggered atmospheric waves that propagated around the world multiple times4. A global-scale wave response of this magnitude from a single source has not previously been observed. Here we show the details of this response, using a comprehensive set of satellite and ground-based observations to quantify it from surface to ionosphere. A broad spectrum of waves was triggered by the initial explosion, including Lamb waves5,6 propagating at phase speeds of 318.2 ± 6 m s-1 at surface level and between 308 ± 5 to 319 ± 4 m s-1 in the stratosphere, and gravity waves7 propagating at 238 ± 3 to 269 ± 3 m s-1 in the stratosphere. Gravity waves at sub-ionospheric heights have not previously been observed propagating at this speed or over the whole Earth from a single source8,9. Latent heat release from the plume remained the most significant individual gravity wave source worldwide for more than 12 h, producing circular wavefronts visible across the Pacific basin in satellite observations. A single source dominating such a large region is also unique in the observational record. The Hunga Tonga eruption represents a key natural experiment in how the atmosphere responds to a sudden point-source-driven state change, which will be of use for improving weather and climate models."
https://openalex.org/W4283716873,"The consensus molecular subtype (CMS) classification of colorectal cancer is based on bulk transcriptomics. The underlying epithelial cell diversity remains unclear. We analyzed 373,058 single-cell transcriptomes from 63 patients, focusing on 49,155 epithelial cells. We identified a pervasive genetic and transcriptomic dichotomy of malignant cells, based on distinct gene expression, DNA copy number and gene regulatory network. We recapitulated these subtypes in bulk transcriptomes from 3,614 patients. The two intrinsic subtypes, iCMS2 and iCMS3, refine CMS. iCMS3 comprises microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) cancers and one-third of microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. iCMS3 MSS cancers are transcriptomically more similar to MSI-H cancers than to other MSS cancers. CMS4 cancers had either iCMS2 or iCMS3 epithelium; the latter had the worst prognosis. We defined the intrinsic epithelial axis of colorectal cancer and propose a refined 'IMF' classification with five subtypes, combining intrinsic epithelial subtype (I), microsatellite instability status (M) and fibrosis (F)."
https://openalex.org/W4283732121,"Multiple clinical trials of allogeneic T cell therapy use site-specific nucleases to disrupt T cell receptor (TCR) and other genes1–6. In this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated genome editing outcomes in primary human T cells transfected with CRISPR–Cas9 and guide RNAs targeting genes for TCR chains and programmed cell death protein 1. Four days after transfection, we found a loss of chromosome 14, harboring the TCRα locus, in up to 9% of the cells and a chromosome 14 gain in up to 1.4% of the cells. Chromosome 7, harboring the TCRβ locus, was truncated in 9.9% of the cells. Aberrations were validated using fluorescence in situ hybridization and digital droplet PCR. Aneuploidy was associated with reduced proliferation, induced p53 activation and cell death. However, at 11 days after transfection, 0.9% of T cells still had a chromosome 14 loss. Aneuploidy and chromosomal truncations are, thus, frequent outcomes of CRISPR–Cas9 cleavage that should be monitored and minimized in clinical protocols. Aneuploidy and chromosomal truncations are frequent outcomes of CRISPR–Cas9 editing in human T cells."
https://openalex.org/W4283726242,"The intermolecular forces among volatile organic molecules are usually weaker than water, making them more difficult to absorb. We prepared alkaline earth cations-bridged polyoxometalate nanoclusters subnanometer nanowires through a facile room-temperature reaction. The nanowires can form three-dimensional networks, trapping more than 10 kinds of volatile organic liquids effectively with the mass fraction of nanowires as low as 0.53%. A series of freestanding, elastic, and stable organogels were obtained. We prepared gels that encapsulate organic liquids at the kilogram scale. Through removing solvents in gels by means of distillation and centrifugation, the nanowires can be recycled more than 10 times. This method could be applied to the effective trapping and recovery of organic liquids."

https://openalex.org/W4283717327,"Regaining arm control is a top priority for people with paralysis. Unfortunately, the complexity of the neural mechanisms underlying arm control has limited the effectiveness of neurotechnology approaches. Here, we exploited the neural function of surviving spinal circuits to restore voluntary arm and hand control in three monkeys with spinal cord injury, using spinal cord stimulation. Our neural interface leverages the functional organization of the dorsal roots to convey artificial excitation via electrical stimulation to relevant spinal segments at appropriate movement phases. Stimulation bursts targeting specific spinal segments produced sustained arm movements, enabling monkeys with arm paralysis to perform an unconstrained reach-and-grasp task. Stimulation specifically improved strength, task performances and movement quality. Electrophysiology suggested that residual descending inputs were necessary to produce coordinated movements. The efficacy and reliability of our approach hold realistic promises of clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W4283721041,"Abstract Argonaute proteins use nucleic acid guides to find and bind specific DNA or RNA target sequences. Argonaute proteins have diverse biological functions and many retain their ancestral endoribonuclease activity, cleaving the phosphodiester bond between target nucleotides t10 and t11. In animals, the PIWI proteins—a specialized class of Argonaute proteins—use 21–35 nucleotide PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to direct transposon silencing, protect the germline genome, and regulate gene expression during gametogenesis 1 . The piRNA pathway is required for fertility in one or both sexes of nearly all animals. Both piRNA production and function require RNA cleavage catalysed by PIWI proteins. Spermatogenesis in mice and other placental mammals requires three distinct, developmentally regulated PIWI proteins: MIWI (PIWIL1), MILI (PIWIL2) and MIWI2 2–4 (PIWIL4). The piRNA-guided endoribonuclease activities of MIWI and MILI are essential for the production of functional sperm 5,6 . piRNA-directed silencing in mice and insects also requires GTSF1, a PIWI-associated protein of unknown function 7–12 . Here we report that GTSF1 potentiates the weak, intrinsic, piRNA-directed RNA cleavage activities of PIWI proteins, transforming them into efficient endoribonucleases. GTSF1 is thus an example of an auxiliary protein that potentiates the catalytic activity of an Argonaute protein."
https://openalex.org/W4283763731,"Arterial stenosis is a common cardiovascular disease that restricts blood flow. A stenotic blood vessel creates tangent stress pressure, which lessens the arterial side and causes an aneurysm. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate blood flowing via an inclination pipe with stricture and expansion after stricture (widening) underneath the influence of a constant incompressible Casson liquid flowing with the magnetism field. The relations for surface shearing stress, pressure drop, flow resistance, and velocity are calculated analytically by applying a mild stenosis approximation. The effect of different physical characteristics on liquid impedance to flowing, velocity, and surface shearing stress are studied. With a non-Newtonian aspect of the Casson liquid, the surface shearing stress declines, and an impedance upturn. Side resistivity and shear-stress increase with the elevations of stricture, whilst together decreasing with a dilatation height."
https://openalex.org/W4283749492,"Orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) is induced by biomechanical stimuli and facilitated by periodontal tissue remodeling, where multiple immune cells participate in this progression. It has been demonstrated that macrophage is essential for mechanical force-induced tissue remodeling. In this study, we first found that mechanical force significantly induced macrophage proliferation in human periodontal samples and murine OTM models. Yet, how macrophages perceive mechanical stimuli and thereby modulate their biological behaviors remain elusive. To illustrate the mechanisms of mechanical force-induced macrophage proliferation, we subsequently identified Piezo1, a novel mechanosensory ion channel, to modulate macrophage response subjected to mechanical stimuli. Mechanical force upregulates Piezo1 expression in periodontal tissues and cultured bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Remarkably, suppressing Piezo1 with GsMTx4 retarded OTM through reduced macrophage proliferation. Moreover, knockdown of Piezo1 effectively inhibited mechanical force-induced BMDMs proliferation. RNA sequencing was further performed to dissect the underlying mechanisms of Piezo1-mediated mechanotransduction utilizing mechanical stretch system. We revealed that Piezo1-activated AKT/GSK3β signaling was closely associated with macrophage proliferation upon mechanical stimuli. Importantly, Cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) was authenticated as a critical downstream factor of Piezo1 that facilitated proliferation by enhancing Rb phosphorylation. We generated genetically modified mice in which Ccnd1 could be deleted in macrophages in an inducible manner. Conditional ablation of Ccnd1 inhibited periodontal macrophage proliferation and therefore delayed OTM. Overall, our findings highlight that proliferation driven by mechanical force is a key process by which macrophages infiltrate in periodontal tissue during OTM, where Piezo1-AKT-Ccnd1 axis plays a pivotal role."
https://openalex.org/W4283776702,"We aim to apply deep learning to achieve fully automated detection and classification of the Cervical Vertebrae Maturation (CVM) stages. We propose an innovative custom-designed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a built-in set of novel directional filters that highlight the edges of the Cervical Vertebrae in X-ray images.A total of 1018 Cephalometric radiographs were labeled and classified according to the Cervical Vertebrae Maturation (CVM) stages. The images were cropped to extract the cervical vertebrae using an Aggregate Channel Features (ACF) object detector. The resulting images were used to train four different Deep Learning (DL) models: our proposed CNN, MobileNetV2, ResNet101, and Xception, together with a set of tunable directional edge enhancers. When using MobileNetV2, ResNet101 and Xception, data augmentation is adopted to allow adequate network complexity while avoiding overfitting. The performance of our CNN model was compared with that of MobileNetV2, ResNet101 and Xception with and without the use of directional filters. For validation and performance assessment, k-fold cross-validation, ROC curves, and p-values were used.The proposed innovative model that uses a CNN preceded with a layer of tunable directional filters achieved a validation accuracy of 84.63%84.63% in CVM stage classification into five classes, exceeding the accuracy achieved with the other DL models investigated. MobileNetV2, ResNet101 and Xception used with directional filters attained accuracies of 78.54%, 74.10%, and 80.86%, respectively. The custom-designed CNN method also achieves 75.11% in six-class CVM stage classification. The effectiveness of the directional filters is reflected in the improved performance attained in the results. If the custom-designed CNN is used without the directional filters, the test accuracy decreases to 80.75%. In the Xception model without the directional filters, the testing accuracy drops slightly to 79.42% in the five-class CVM stage classification.The proposed model of a custom-designed CNN together with the tunable Directional Filters (CNNDF) is observed to provide higher accuracy than the commonly used pre-trained network models that we investigated in the fully automated determination of the CVM stages."
https://openalex.org/W4283714573,"Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a central component of the Hippo pathway, plays an important role in tumor metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Invadopodia are actin-rich protrusions containing multiple proteases and have been widely reported to promote cell invasiveness by degrading the extracellular matrix. In the present study, we report that YAP1 induces invadopodia formation and promotes tumor metastasis in breast cancer cells. We also identify TIAM1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as a target of the YAP1-TEAD4 complex. Our results demonstrate that YAP1 could promote TEAD4 binding to the enhancer region of TIAM1, which activates TIAM1 expression, subsequently increasing RAC1 activity and inducing invadopodia formation. These findings reveal the functional role of Hippo signaling in the regulation of invadopodia and provide potential molecular targets for preventing tumor metastasis in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W4283717005,"CD8+ T cells are central mediators of immune responses against infections and cancer. Here we identified Dapl1 as a crucial regulator of CD8+ T cell responses to cancer and infections. Dapl1 deficiency promotes the expansion of tumour-infiltrating effector memory-like CD8+ T cells and prevents their functional exhaustion, coupled with increased antitumour immunity and improved efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy. Dapl1 controls activation of NFATc2, a transcription factor required for the effector function of CD8+ T cells. Although NFATc2 mediates induction of the immune checkpoint receptor Tim3, competent NFATc2 activation prevents functional exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, exhausted CD8+ T cells display attenuated NFATc2 activation due to Tim3-mediated feedback inhibition; Dapl1 deletion rescues NFATc2 activation and thereby prevents dysfunction of exhausted CD8+ T cells in chronic infection and cancer. These findings establish Dapl1 as a crucial regulator of CD8+ T cell immunity and a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Zhu et al. identify Dapl1 as a negative regulator of CD8+ T cell responses by modulating NFATc2 activation and T cell exhaustion, leading to dysregulated control of chronic infection and cancer."

https://openalex.org/W4283715025,"Background Varicella is a contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus and varicella vaccine (VarV) is the most effective way to prevent and control varicella. Despite high VarV coverage there were still varicella outbreaks in schools and kindergartens. We aim to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of varicella outbreaks in Huangpu District, Shanghai, China from 2011 to 2020. Methods For varicella outbreaks, case information and vaccination history were collected. Mann–Kendall test and descriptive methods were used to analyzed the trend and epidemiological catachrestic of varicella outbreaks. Results A total of 57 varicella outbreaks were reported from 2011 to 2020, including 30 outbreaks (52.6%) in primary schools. The results of the Mann–Kendall trend test (z = 1.97, p = 0.049) showed an upward trend in the number of cases during the study period, but the trend change was not statistically significant. Emergency vaccination was carried out in 42 (73.7%) outbreaks which influenced the duration of the epidemic (F = 4.53, p = 0.0379). A total of 573 varicella cases were reported, including 357 cases (62.3%) who had received at least one dose of varicella vaccine. Conclusions The number of varicella outbreaks has not changed significantly in the decade from 2011 to 2020. The strategy of varicella vaccination, the development and application of varicella vaccine, and the control measures after the occurrence of varicella outbreaks need to be optimized. In addition to vaccination, as a disease transmitted by contact, quarantine measures, good personal hygiene, environmental disinfection, and ventilation are also important."

https://openalex.org/W4283770073,"Background Utilization of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) declined during COVID-19 pandemic, but most of the studies analyzed components of the EMS system individually. The study aimed to evaluate the indirect impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization of all the components of the EMS system of Tuscany Region (Italy) during the first pandemic wave. Methods Administrative data from the health care system of Tuscany were used. Changes in utilization for out-of-hospital emergency calls and emergency vehicle dispatched, emergency department (ED) visits, and patients being admitted from the ED to an inpatient hospital bed (hospitalizations from ED) during the first pandemic wave were analyzed in relation with corresponding periods of the previous two years. Percentage changes and 95%CI were calculated with Poisson models. Standardized Ratios were calculated to evaluate changes in in-hospital mortality and hospitalizations requiring ICU. Results Significant declines were observed in the utilization of all the EMS considered starting from the week in which the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Italy till the end of the first pandemic wave. During the epidemic peak, the maximum decreases were observed: -33% for the emergency calls, -45% for the dispatch of emergency vehicles, -71% for ED admissions. Furthermore, a decline of 37% for hospitalizations from ED was recorded. Significant decreases in ED admissions for life threatening medical conditions were observed: acute cerebrovascular disease (-36%, 95% CI: -43, -29), acute myocardial infarction (-42%, 95% CI: -52, -31) and renal failure (-42%, 95% CI: -52, -31). No significant differences were found between the observed and the expected in-hospital mortality and hospitalizations requiring ICU during the epidemic peak. Conclusion All the components of the EMS showed large declines in their utilization during COVID-19 pandemic; furthermore, major reductions were observed for admissions for time-dependent and life-threatening conditions. Efforts should be made to ensure access to safe and high-quality emergency care during pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4283775954,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges for working conditions for scientists, but little is known for how the associations of these challenges with scientists' mental health and productivity differ by sex and status as a parent. This online survey study in six languages collected data from 4,494 scientists in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine fields across 132 countries during October-December 2021. We compared the type of challenges for work, changes in work hours, and perception in productivity during the pandemic by sex and status as a parent (children <18 years living at home). Regression analyses analyzed the impacts of changed working conditions and work-life factors on productivity and mental health. We found that the percentage of participants with increased work hours was the highest in female participants, especially without children. Disproportionately higher increases in work hours were found for teaching and administration in women than men and for research/fundraising in non-parent participants than parent participants (p-value<0.001). Female participants were more concerned about the negative impacts of the pandemic on publications and long-term career progress, and less satisfied with their career progress than their male counterparts. There were differences in the type of institutional actions for the pandemic across study regions. The identified obstacles for work and home-life factors were associated with higher risks of experiencing depression, anxiety, and stress. Decision makers should consider the gender differences in the pandemic's adverse impacts on productivity in establishing equitable actions for career progress for scientists during pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4283586485,"Mutations in the SLC35C1 gene encoding the Golgi GDP-fucose transporter are known to cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency II. However, improvement of fucosylation in leukocyte adhesion deficiency II patients treated with exogenous fucose suggests the existence of an SLC35C1-independent route of GDP-fucose transport, which remains a mystery. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed and characterized a human cell–based model deficient in SLC35C1 activity. The resulting cells were cultured in the presence/absence of exogenous fucose and mannose, followed by examination of fucosylation potential and nucleotide sugar levels. We found that cells displayed low but detectable levels of fucosylation in the absence of SLC35C1. Strikingly, we show that defects in fucosylation were almost completely reversed upon treatment with millimolar concentrations of fucose. Furthermore, we show that even if fucose was supplemented at nanomolar concentrations, it was still incorporated into glycans by these knockout cells. We also found that the SLC35C1-independent transport preferentially utilized GDP-fucose from the salvage pathway over the de novo biogenesis pathway as a source of this substrate. Taken together, our results imply that the Golgi systems of GDP-fucose transport discriminate between substrate pools obtained from different metabolic pathways, which suggests a functional connection between nucleotide sugar transporters and nucleotide sugar synthases.

Taken together, our results imply that the Golgi systems of GDP-fucose transport discriminate between substrate pools obtained from different metabolic pathways, which suggests a functional connection between nucleotide sugar transporters and nucleotide sugar synthases. Fucose is an abundant component of many N- and O-glycans as well as some glycolipids. Except for O-fucosylation, where it is the first sugar in the sequence, fucose is always the terminal sugar in the structure of oligosaccharides. Fucose can be attached to other sugars or proteins via one of four types of glycosidic bonds: α-1,2, α-1,3, α-1,4, and α-1,6. In N-glycans, fucose is predominantly α-1,6-linked to the first (Asn-bound) N-acetylglucosamine residue. This type of fucose is referred to as a core fucose, and it is incorporated into the oligosaccharide structure only after the attachment of at least one N-acetylglucosamine residue to mannose. For a broader overview of the consecutive steps of N-glycan processing, see the study by Varki et al. (1Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Essentials of Glycobiology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor, New York2015-2017Google Scholar).Fucosylated oligosaccharides have many biologically relevant functions. AB0 blood group antigens are among the best known fucosylated glycans. O-linked fucose may affect certain ligand–receptor interactions involved in signal transduction. Fucose decorates certain oligosaccharides that are exposed on the surface of leukocytes and serve as ligands for selectins. Binding of the latter to the former initiates the leukocyte adhesion cascade, a multistep process of leukocyte migration to the site of injury or infection.Incorporation of fucose into glycoconjugates is mediated by fucosyltransferases, which are predominantly Golgi-resident type II membrane proteins. Fucosyltransferases use the active form of fucose, that is, GDP-fucose, as a substrate. GDP-fucose is synthesized in the cytoplasm by two different pathways (shown in Fig. 1). The main source of this nucleotide sugar is the so-called de novo pathway, which is estimated to provide 90 to 95% of the total GDP-fucose pool in the cell (2Yurchenco P.D. Atkinson P.H. Equilibration of fucosyl glycoprotein pools in HeLa cells.Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Yurchenco P.D. Atkinson P.H. Fucosyl-glycoprotein and precursor polls in HeLa cells.Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The primary substrate for this three-step pathway is mannose. First, this monosugar is converted into GDP-mannose and then GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase converts GDP-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. This keto intermediate is then converted into GDP-fucose by an epimerase/reductase enzyme complex termed the FX protein or GDP-l-fucose synthase (also known as GFUS, FCL, SDR4E1, or TSTA3) (4Moriwaki K. E. Miyoshi E. Fucosylation and gastrointestinal cancer.World J. Hepatol. 2010; 2: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The second alternative way of GDP-fucose synthesis is the so-called salvage pathway. This route uses the cytoplasmic pool of free fucose, which on the one hand is recovered from glycoconjugates by lysosomal α-fucosidase activity and on the other hand is supplied from the environment. Little is known about the fucose transport system from the extracellular space to the interior of the cell, but it appears to function through facilitated diffusion through specific channel(s) (5Wiese T.J. Dunlap J.A. Yorek M.A. L-fucose is accumulated via a specific transport system in eukaryotic cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22705-22711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step of the salvage pathway involves ATP-dependent synthesis of fucose-1-phosphate by the enzyme fucokinase (FUK; also known as FCSK). Fucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (FPGT; GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase), the second enzyme acting in the pathway, catalyzes the conversion of fucose-1-phosphate and GTP to GDP-fucose (6Pastuszak I. Ketchum C. Hermanson G. Sjoberg E.J. Drake R. Elbein A.D. GDP-L-fucose pyrophosphorylase. Purification, cDNA cloning, and properties of the enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30165-30174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As already mentioned, it is estimated that only 5 to 10% of the total GDP-fucose pool is synthesized by this pathway (2Yurchenco P.D. Atkinson P.H. Equilibration of fucosyl glycoprotein pools in HeLa cells.Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Yurchenco P.D. Atkinson P.H. Fucosyl-glycoprotein and precursor polls in HeLa cells.Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).To reach lumenally oriented catalytic centers of fucosyltransferases, GDP-fucose has to be transported across the Golgi membrane. This function is thought to be played by GDP-fucose–specific nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs), which are hydrophobic type III membrane proteins with 6 to 10 transmembrane domains. NSTs are believed to act as antiporters; an imported nucleotide sugar is exchanged with the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate (7Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Mechanisms of glycosylation and sulfation in the Golgi apparatus: Evidence for nucleotide sugar/nucleoside monophosphate and nucleotide sulfate/nucleoside monophosphate antiports in the Golgi apparatus membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After reaching the Golgi lumen, the activated monosugar constitutes a substrate for a respective glycosyltransferase, which attaches the monosugar to an acceptor, whereas the released nucleoside diphosphate is broken down into a nucleoside monophosphate and an inorganic phosphate (8Kuhn N.J. White A. The role of nucleoside diphosphatase in a uridine nucleotide cycle associated with lactose synthesis in rat mammary-gland Golgi apparatus.Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In mammals, the role of the main GDP-fucose transporter is attributed to the product of the SLC35C1 gene, which was identified by two independent groups in 2001 (9Lübke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Körner C.

Although SLC35C1 is thought to be the major transporter in mammals, GDP-fucose has also been shown to translocate through its homolog, SLC35C2. SLC35C2 was shown to localize predominantly in the Golgi, but a small subset of it was found in the endoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment. SLC35C2 is specifically required for O-fucosylation of certain proteins, including the Notch receptor, which in turn does not require SLC35C1 activity (11Ishikawa H.O. Ayukawa T. Nakayama M.

This syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC35C1 gene (13Ma B. Simala-Grant J.L. Taylor D.E. Fucosylation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 158-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The characteristic symptoms of this disease include psychomotor retardation, facial dysmorphism, Bombay phenotype, short stature, immunodeficiency, leukocytosis, as well as recurrent and frequent bacterial infections (14Gazit Y.

Pioneering experiments were performed with lymphoblastic cells obtained from one of the patients bearing the Arg147Cys mutation in the SLC35C1 amino acid sequence. Supplementation of the cell culture with 10 mM fucose for 5 days triggered an increase in the number of fucosylated structures (24Karsan A. Cornejo C.J. Winn R.K. Schwartz B.R. Way W.

These results paved the way to the concept of using fucose supplementation in patients themselves. Since 1999, several LADII patients were treated with oral fucose. For some of them, such treatment was successful, resulting in an improvement in psychomotor development and a reduction in neutrophil count (22Cooper N. Li Y.T. Möller A. Schulz-Weidner N. Sachs U.J.

An improvement in fucosylation was also achieved when the LADII patient–derived fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of 0.1 to 10 mM fucose (18Helmus Y. Denecke J. Yakubenia S. Robinson P. Lühn K. Watson D.L. et al.Leukocyte adhesion deficiency II patients with a dual defect of the GDP-fucose transporter.Blood. 2006; 107: 3959-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).To explain the effectiveness of the fucose treatment in responsive LADII patients, it was postulated that the mutant SLC35C1 variants display some residual transport activity (9Lübke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Körner C. Complementation cloning identifies CDG-IIc, a new type of congenital disorders of glycosylation, as a GDP-fucose transporter deficiency.Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Therefore, a therapy causing an increase in the cytosolic concentration of this nucleotide sugar could potentially allow the insufficient transporting activity of the defective SLC35C1 variants to be overcome. However, direct proof of an increase in the cytosolic GDP-fucose concentration in the fucose-fed cells bearing mutations in the SLC35C1 gene has not been presented to date. An alternative hypothesis to explain the efficiency of the oral fucose therapy could be the existence of an accessory GDP-fucose transport system. However, no such route has been identified so far.In 2007, a knockout-based study conducted in mice revealed that the fucose treatment works even in the absence of SLC35C1 (27Hellbusch C.C. Sperandio M. Frommhold D. Yakubenia S. Wild M.K. Popovici D. et al.Golgi GDP-fucose transporter-deficient mice mimic congenital disorder of glycosylation IIc/leukocyte adhesion deficiency II.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10762-10772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings for the first time suggested the existence of an SLC35C1-independent GDP-fucose transport into the Golgi, as the observed effect could no longer be explained by a residual activity of the SLC35C1 mutants. It was hypothesized that the SLC35C1 deficiency could be overcome by the SLC35C2 activity, but this has never been proved. In general, no studies that could possibly explain this phenomenon in greater detail have been undertaken so far.Since the responsiveness of the cells completely devoid of the SLC35C1 activity to fucose treatment has not been elucidated to date, in this study, we carried out a more in-depth investigation of this intriguing effect. Within our general interest in the metabolism of fucose and protein fucosylation, specific goals included (i) generation of single SLC35C1 and double SLC35C1/SLC35C2 knockouts, (ii) optimization of fucose-feeding conditions, (iii) establishment of a method allowing quantification of the extent of N-glycan fucosylation, (iv) structural characterization of N- and O-glycans produced by the wildtype and knockout cells, (v) investigation of N-glycan fucosylation in response to various ranges of exogenous fucose concentrations, (vi) single-point and time-course analyses of intracellular GDP-fucose concentration in control and fucose-fed cells, (vii) determination of the contribution of de novo and salvage GDP-fucose biosynthetic pathways to fucose incorporation into N-glycans in the wildtype and knockout cells, and (viii) assessment of a potential cellular genetic response to fucose supplementation.In this study, we developed an approach coupling exoglycosidase digestion with HPLC to quantify the percentage of the core-fucosylated N-glycans with great precision. We found that in the knockout cells, the core fucosylation of N-glycans is greatly reduced but can be nearly completely restored by supplementing the cells with millimolar concentrations of fucose. Supplementation with 5 mM fucose caused a significant increase in the intracellular GDP-fucose concentration, regardless of the presence/absence of GDP-fucose transporters. Next, by feeding low (nanomolar) concentrations of radioactive fucose and mannose into the culture medium, we were able to follow the metabolic fate of the supplemented compounds and attribute radioactivity to fucosylated structures using our HPLC-based method. Surprisingly, the SLC35C1 knockouts showed a dramatic impairment of the ability to incorporate mannose-derived radioactivity into the fucosylated N-glycans. In sharp contrast, they were able to incorporate even higher quantities of radiolabeled fucose than the wildtype cells. To explain these observations, we hypothesize that in the SLC35C1 knockouts, the salvage pathway is preferred over the de novo pathway as a source of GDP-fucose for fucosylation of N-glycans. We also investigated the potential genetic response of the SLC35C1 knockouts to fucose treatment. No major gene upregulation/downregulation was observed. Finally, we excluded SLC35C2 as an alternative supplier of GDP-fucose for N-glycan fucosylation.ResultsGeneration of the single SLC35C1, SLC35C2, and double SLC35C1/SLC35C2 knockoutsTo develop research models for our study, SLC35C1 knockouts (C1KO) were generated in two human cell lines, that is, human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and HepG2, and SLC35C2 knockout (C2KO) was generated in HEK293T cell line using the CRISPR–CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) approach. In addition, a double SLC35C1/SLC35C2 knockout (C1/C2KO) was developed in HEK293T cells to evaluate the influence of SLC35C2 protein on the N- and O-glycosylation in the SLC35C1 knockout cells and to examine the effect of fucose treatment in cells lacking both GDP-fucose transporters.The knockouts were confirmed by both RT–PCR performed on total RNA and PCR performed on genomic DNA (Fig. S1, A–C). The forward/reverse primers were designed to align upstream/downstream of the CRISPR/Cas9-mutated regions of the SLC35C1/SLC35C2 genes and to yield 133 to 236 bp fragments (Table 1). As the relative electrophoretic mobility changes are significant, such short fragments allow the observation of even small (in terms of base pair) effects of CRISPR–Cas9 activity on a gel.Table 1Primers used in this studyNo.Primer namePrimer sequence 5ʹ-3ʹProduct length (bp)Primers used in RT–PCR analysis with total RNA as a template1F_C1KOCTTCCCCAGCTTGCGCCTG1332R_C1KOGCGGCCCACATTGTAGAAGGC1333F_C1/C2KOGCTTCTCTACTACTGCTTCTC2334R_C1/C2KOTCAAGCGCCGTCGCCAGAGCT233Primers used in PCR analysis with genomic DNA as a template5F_C1KOCTTCCCCAGCTTGCGCCTG2366R_C1KOTTGTTCTTCACTGCTTCAGTC2367F_C1/C2KOATTTCCCCCTCTTCATGACG1658R_C1/C2KOTTCTCATCCTATGGTTCCCCA165Primer used in gene amplification and site-directed mutagenesis9F_HAC1AAAAAGTCGACATGGCATACCCATACGACGTACCAGACT ACGCAATGAATAGGGCCCCTCTGAAGCGGTNA10R_HAC1AAAAAGTCGACTCACACCCCCATGGCGCTCTTNA11F_C1_420_PAMACGTCGGTGTAGCCTTCTACANA12R_C1_420_PAMACTTGAGGCAGAGGTTATTGNA Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic separation of the RT–PCR/PCR products on 2% agarose gel (Fig. S1, A–C) showed multiple bands corresponding to the CRISPR–Cas9-mutated SLC35C1/SLC35C2 gene fragments. The fact that no bands corresponding to the wildtypes were observed even after 35 (genomic DNA) or 40 (mRNA) RT–PCR/PCR cycles excludes the presence of the wildtype allele.The SLC35C1 knockout was in addition verified at the protein level using an anti-SLC35C1 antibody by Western blotting, where no band was detected in the knockouts in contrast to the wildtype cells (Fig. S1D), as well as by double staining with the latter antibody and fucose-specific Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL; Vector Laboratories; Fig. S1E). Unfortunately, because of the lack of a suitable antibody, a similar confirmation was not possible in the case of the SLC35C2 gene. Hence, the SLC35C2 knockout was in addition verified by genomic DNA sequencing (Figs. S2 and S3 for single SLC35C2 and double SLC35C1/SLC35C2 knockouts, respectively). All the resulting sequences contained deletions that either cause a frameshift or introduce a premature stop codon, whereas the wildtype SLC35C2 sequence was not detected in any of the analyzed clones.To show that the knockout phenotype was specifically associated only with the disruption of the SLC35C1 gene, we also developed SLC35C1-deficient clones stably overexpressing a recombinant hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SLC35C1 (in both HEK293T and HepG2 cell lines). The overexpression was confirmed by Western blotting performed on cell lysates using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. S1F). The obtained stable transfectants were also subjected to immunostaining to confirm the Golgi localization of the overexpressed protein (Fig. S1G).Optimization of fucose supplementation conditionsIn order to establish a system to study the effect of fucose supplementation on the restoration of fucosylation in the SLC35C1 knockouts, feeding parameters, that is, fucose concentration in the culture medium as well as duration of the treatment, had to be optimized. In the first stage, we employed a dot blot analysis using AAL (Fig. 2, A and B). Several concentrations of fucose were tested, that is, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mM (concentration range inspired by Helmus et al. (18Helmus Y. Denecke J. Yakubenia S. Robinson P. Lühn K. Watson D.L. et al.Leukocyte adhesion deficiency II patients with a dual defect of the GDP-fucose transporter.Blood. 2006; 107: 3959-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). We found that after 5 days, 5 mM concentration was sufficient to substantially restore fucosylation of glycoconjugates in the SLC35C1 knockouts. AAL staining performed on the SLC35C1 knockouts cultured in the presence of 5 mM fucose for 0 to 48 h demonstrated that the level of fucosylation gradually increased over time and an optimum (i.e., fucosylation compared with the wildtype) was reached after 24 h. After another 12 h, however, the cells became overloaded with aggregated fucose-containing structures (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Optimization of the conditions of fucose supplementation.

In our approach, we used specific glycosidases to reduce all multibranched complex-type N-glycan species into a simple biantennary (GlcNAc)2(Man)3 structure, either fucosylated or nonfucosylated (Fig. 2, D and E). Then by taking a ratio of the area of the fucosylated peak over the sum of areas of both peaks (fucosylated and nonfucosylated), we determined the percentage of fucosylated structures for each sample. To confirm that the fucosylated peak contains only the (GlcNAc)2(Man)3Fuc structure, α-fucosidase digestion was performed (Fig. 2F).By employing our method, we tested supplementation of selected fucose concentrations (50 μM–100 mM) for different periods (1–5 days) in wildtype and SLC35C1 knockout HEK293T cells. Feeding the cells with 50 μM or 1 mM fucose even for as long as 5 days was not sufficient to restore the wildtype α-1,6-fucosylation level in the SLC35C1 knockout cells. Only supplementation of the SLC35C1 knockout cells with 5 mM fucose restored the fucosylation phenotype to a level comparable to the wildtype cells, but at the same time, it did not affect core fucosylation in the wildtype cells. At the same time, supplementation with a very high fucose concentration (100 mM) did not increase the level of core fucosylation in the wildtype cells (Fig. 2G). Therefore, for the final experiments, the conditions of 5 mM fucose and 24 h were"

However, the significance and underlying mechanisms by which aberrant hemidesmosome assembly may modulate tumorigenesis remain elusive. Using an extensive CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic engineering approaches in different prostate cancer cell lines combined with in vivo tumorigenesis studies in mice, bone marrow-on-chip assays and bioinformatics, as well as histological analysis of prostate cancer patient cohorts, we demonstrated that simultaneous loss of PTEN and hemidesmosomal adhesions induced several tumorigenic properties including proliferation, migration, resistance to anoikis, apoptosis, and drug treatment in vitro, and increased metastatic capacity in vivo. These effects were plectin-depended and plectin was associated with actin-rich adhesions upon hemidesmosome disruption in PTEN-negative prostate cancer cells leading to activation of EGFR/PI3K/Akt- and FAK/Src-pathways. These results suggest that analysis of PTEN and hemidesmosomal proteins may have diagnostic value helping to stratify prostate cancer patients with high risk for development of aggressive disease and highlight actin-associated plectin as a potential therapeutic target specifically in PTEN/hemidesmosome dual-negative prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4283781869,"Aneuploidy and chromosomal instability are both commonly found in cancer. Chromosomal instability leads to karyotype heterogeneity in tumors and is associated with therapy resistance, metastasis and poor prognosis. It has been hypothesized that aneuploidy per se is sufficient to drive CIN, however due to limited models and heterogenous results, it has remained controversial which aspects of aneuploidy can drive CIN. In this study we systematically tested the impact of different types of aneuploidies on the induction of CIN. We generated a plethora of isogenic aneuploid clones harboring whole chromosome or segmental aneuploidies in human p53-deficient RPE-1 cells. We observed increased segregation errors in cells harboring trisomies that strongly correlated to the number of gained genes. Strikingly, we found that clones harboring only monosomies do not induce a CIN phenotype. Finally, we found that an initial chromosome breakage event and subsequent fusion can instigate breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. By investigating the impact of monosomies, trisomies and segmental aneuploidies on chromosomal instability we further deciphered the complex relationship between aneuploidy and CIN."

The current study used qualitative and quantitative data to identify 1) pandemic-related barriers/stressors, 2) coping strategies employed, and 3) how the stressors and strategies predicted subsequent substance use frequency. Participants were 48 adults (40.5% female; 90.2% White) between 26 and 60 years old (M = 42.66, SD = 8.44) who were part of a larger, multi-year longitudinal study of individuals in recovery from substance use disorders. Individuals completed two interviews, one during the six weeks of initial stay-at-home orders in the state in which data were collected and the second within six to twelve months of their initial interview. Common barriers to recovery included cancelled support meetings, changes in job format (i.e., being fired or furloughed), and lack of social support. Common coping strategies included self-care, leisure activities/hobbies, taking caution against exposure, and strengthening personal relationships. The relationship between cravings at baseline and substance use at follow up was stronger for those who experienced worsening of their mental health (B = 21.80, p &lt; .01) than for those who did not (B = 5.45, p = 0.09), and for those who were taking caution against exposure (B = 24.57, p &lt; .01) than for those who were not (B = 1.87, p = 0.53). Those who engaged in self-care (B = 0.00, p&gt;.99) had lower rates of substance use at follow-up than those who did not employ self-care as a coping mechanism (B = 16.10, p &lt; .01). These findings inform research priorities regarding prospective effects of the pandemic on treatment endeavors, particularly emphasizing treating mental health and encouraging self-care strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4283767307,"Antibiotic resistance via epigenetic methylation of ribosomal RNA is one of the most prevalent strategies adopted by multidrug resistant pathogens. The erythromycin-resistance methyltransferase (Erm) methylates rRNA at the conserved A2058 position and imparts resistance to macrolides such as erythromycin. However, the precise mechanism adopted by Erm methyltransferases for locating the target base within a complicated rRNA scaffold remains unclear. Here, we show that a conserved RNA architecture, including specific bulge sites, present more than 15 Å from the reaction center, is key to methylation at the pathogenic site. Using a set of RNA sequences site-specifically labeled by fluorescent nucleotide surrogates, we show that base flipping is a prerequisite for effective methylation and that distal bases assist in the recognition and flipping at the reaction center. The Erm-RNA complex model revealed that intrinsically flipped-out bases in the RNA serve as a putative anchor point for the Erm. Molecular dynamic simulation studies demonstrated the RNA undergoes a substantial change in conformation to facilitate an effective protein-rRNA handshake. This study highlights the importance of unique architectural features exploited by RNA to impart fidelity to RNA methyltransferases via enabling allosteric crosstalk. Moreover, the distal trigger sites identified here serve as attractive hotspots for the development of combination drug therapy aimed at reversing resistance."

Although hyperactivity of basolateral amygdala glutamatergic (BLAGlu) neurons is required for the somatosensory and emotional processing of pain, the precise excitatory inputs to BLAGlu neurons and their roles in mediating different aspects of pain are unclear. Here, we identified two discrete glutamatergic neuronal circuits in male mice: a projection from the insular cortex glutamatergic (ICGlu) to BLAGlu neurons, which modulates both the somatosensory and affective components of pain, and a projection from the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDGlu) to BLAGlu neurons, which modulates only the aversive-affective component of pain. Using whole-cell recording and fiber photometry, we found that neurons within the IC→BLA and MD→BLA pathways were activated in mice upon inflammatory pain induced by injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into their paws. Optical inhibition of the ICGlu→BLA pathway increased the nociceptive threshold and induced behavioral place preference in CFA mice. In contrast, optical inhibition of the MDGlu→BLA pathway did not affect the nociceptive threshold but still induced place preference in CFA mice. In normal mice, optical activation of the ICGlu→BLA pathway decreased the nociceptive threshold and induced place aversion, while optical activation of the MDGlu→BLA pathway only evoked aversion.

Depressive-like states heighten the aversion to painful stimuli in a rat model of comorbid chronic pain and depression.Anesthesiology. 2012; 117: 613-625Google Scholar). However, the precise cell types and neural circuits mediating sensory discrimination and the emotional experience of pain remain largely unknown. The amygdala is primarily composed of the basolateral complex (BLA), the central nucleus (CeA), and the intercalated cell clusters and plays a critical role in processing emotions and pain (9Tye K.M. Prakash R. Kim S.Y. Fenno L.E. Grosenick L. Zarabi H. et al.Amygdala circuitry mediating reversible and bidirectional control of anxiety.Nature. 2011; 471: 358-362Google Scholar, 10Huang J.

Li W. Bird G.C. Han J.S. The amygdala and persistent pain.Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 221-234Google Scholar). The CeA is called the “nociceptive amygdala” and serves as the main output nucleus for the amygdala (11Neugebauer V. Li W. Bird G.C. Han J.S. The amygdala and persistent pain.Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 221-234Google Scholar). Inhibition of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projection from the CeA to the lateral parabrachial nucleus is involved in the perception and pathogenesis of chronic pain (12Raver C. Uddin O. Ji Y. Li Y. Cramer N. Jenne C. et al.An amygdalo-parabrachial pathway regulates pain perception and chronic pain.J. Neurosci. 2020; 40: 3424-3442Google Scholar). In contrast, BLA is considered as the input nucleus of the amygdala and receives inputs from external nuclei, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. It is involved in processing pain and anxiety (13Ji G. Sun H. Fu Y. Li Z. Pais-Vieira M. Galhardo V. et al.Cognitive impairment in pain through amygdala-driven prefrontal cortical deactivation.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5451-5464Google Scholar, 14Jhang J. Lee H. Kang M.S. Lee H.-S. Park H. Han J.-H. Anterior cingulate cortex and its input to the basolateral amygdala control innate fear response.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 2744Google Scholar). A previous study demonstrated that BLA lesions, rather than the CeA, inhibited chronic neuropathic pain (15Li Z. W J. Chen L. Zhang M. Wan Y. Basolateral amygdala lesion inhibits the development of pain chronicity in neuropathic pain rats.PLoS One. 2013; 8e70921Google Scholar) and abolished the aversion component of inflammatory pain (16Cai Y.Q. Wang W. Paulucci-Holthauzen A. Pan Z.Z. Brain circuits mediating opposing effects on emotion and pain.J. Neurosci. 2018; 38: 6340-6349Google Scholar, 17Corder G. Ahanonu B. Grewe B.F. Wang D. Schnitzer M.J. Scherrer G. An amygdalar neural ensemble that encodes the unpleasantness of pain.Science. 2019; 363: 276-281Google Scholar). Additionally, functional MRI studies in rodents and humans showed that neural hyperactivity and altered functional connectivity in the BLA are associated with the onset of chronic pain (18Gandhi W. Rosenek N.R. Harrison R. Salomons T.V. Functional connectivity of the amygdala is linked to individual differences in emotional pain facilitation.PAIN. 2020; 161: 300-307Google Scholar, 19Simons L.E. Moulton E.A. Linnman C. Carpino E. Becerra L. Borsook D. The human amygdala and pain: evidence from neuroimaging.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2014; 35: 527-538Google Scholar). Activation of the excitatory projection from the BLA to the ventral hippocampus robustly increased anxiety-related behavior (20Felix-Ortiz A.C. Beyeler A. Seo C. Leppla C.A. Wildes C.P. Tye K.M. BLA to vHPC inputs modulate anxiety-related behaviors.Neuron. 2013; 79: 658-664Google Scholar). The BLA is primarily composed of glutamatergic neurons (21Neugebauer V. Li W. Bird G.C. Han J.S. The amygdala and persistent pain.Neuroscientist. 2016; 10: 221-234Google Scholar). In arthritic rats, the glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the BLA was enhanced (22Ren W. Neugebauer V. Pain-related increase of excitatory transmission and decrease of inhibitory transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala are mediated by mGluR1.Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 93Google Scholar), and inhibition of the enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission effectively increased the nociceptive threshold (an indicator of the somatosensory component of pain) and alleviated the aversive behaviors of pain (13Ji G. Sun H. Fu Y. Li Z. Pais-Vieira M. Galhardo V. et al.Cognitive impairment in pain through amygdala-driven prefrontal cortical deactivation.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5451-5464Google Scholar, 23Ciocchi S. Herry C. Grenier F. Wolff S.B. Letzkus J.J. Vlachos I. et al.Encoding of conditioned fear in central amygdala inhibitory circuits.Nature. 2010; 468: 277-282Google Scholar). In mice with chronic pain, the expression levels of TNF-α increased, which subsequently induced anxiety-like behavior by enhancing AMPA receptor–mediated glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission (24Chen J. Song Y. Yang J. Zhang Y. Zhao P. Zhu X.J. et al.The contribution of TNF-alpha in the amygdala to anxiety in mice with persistent inflammatory pain.Neurosci. Lett. 2013; 541: 275-280Google Scholar). In addition, the AMPA receptor antagonist tezampanel is used to treat pain (25Pogatzki E.M. Niemeier J.S. Sorkin L.S. Brennan T.J. Spinal glutamate receptor antagonists differentiate primary and secondary mechanical hyperalgesia caused by incision.Pain. 2003; 105: 97-107Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Goffer Y. AMPA receptors and pain—a future therapeutic intervention?.Tech. Reg. Anesth. Pain Manag. 2010; 14: 59-64Google Scholar). Therefore, excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA plays an important role in the development and maintenance of pain. However, the source of excitatory inputs to the BLA and their roles in mediating different aspects of pain require further investigation. Combining viral tracing, optogenetics, fiber photometry, and electrophysiological recordings, we found that the ICGlu→BLA pathway processes both the somatosensory and aversive components of pain. In contrast, the MDGlu→BLA pathway was only involved in processing the aversive component of pain. We established an inflammatory pain mouse model by administering complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the left hind paw (Fig. 1, A and B). Three days later (3D), the expression levels of c-Fos, an immediate-to-early gene marker, significantly increased in the BLA in CFA-treated mice compared to the saline-treated control mice (Saline 3D; Fig. 1, C and D). Meanwhile, immunostaining showed that the c-Fos+ neurons were predominantly colocalized with glutamate immunofluorescence signals (Fig. 1, E and F). Moreover, we crossed CaMKII-Cre mice that express Cre recombinase in the excitatory neurons with Ai14 reporter mice to produce transgenic mice (CaMKII-tdT) with tdTomato expression in glutamatergic neurons for visualized recording. Whole-cell recordings of visualized basolateral amygdala glutamatergic (BLAGlu) neurons showed an increase in the spike number and resting membrane potential (RMP) and decreased rheobase in CFA 3D mice compared to those recorded in the control group (Fig. 1, G–J). An adeno-associated virus expressing the Cre-dependent fluorescent Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m (AAV-DIO-GCaMP6m) was then injected into the BLA of CaMKII-Cre mice to monitor the Ca2+ transient frequency of BLAGlu neurons in freely moving mice (Fig. 1, K and L). Application of subthreshold stimulation (0.07-g von Frey filament) onto the hind paw rapidly increased the Ca2+ transient frequency of BLAGlu neurons in CFA 3D but not in saline-treated mice (Fig. 1M, N). For artificial activation of BLAGlu neurons, an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry) was injected into the BLA of CaMKII-Cre mice (Fig. 2A). Optical activation of BLAGlu neurons decreased the nociceptive threshold of normal mice and induced real-time place aversion (RTPA) for the light delivery side (Fig. 2, B–D). Furthermore, an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-dependent eNpHR3.0-EYFP (AAV-DIO-eNpHR3.0-EYFP) was injected into the BLA of CaMKII-Cre mice to selectively inhibit BLAGlu neurons (Fig. 2E). Optical inhibition of the BLAGlu neurons increased the mechanical nociceptive threshold and induced real-time place preference (RTPP) for the stimulation paired side in CFA mice (Fig. 2, F–H). These data suggest that the hyperactivity of BLAGlu neurons was involved in processing the somatosensory and aversive-affective components of pain. Increased excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA is important for pain sensation (27Zhang M.M. Geng A.Q. Chen K. Wang J. Wang P. Qiu X.T. et al.Glutamatergic synapses from the insular cortex to the basolateral amygdala encode observational pain.Neuron. 2022; 110: 1993-2008.e6Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated how increased excitatory synaptic transmission impacts pain-induced hyperactivity of BLAGlu neurons. First, whole-cell recording of BLAGlu neurons showed that the frequency and amplitude of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current were enhanced in CFA 3D mice compared to the controls (Fig. 3, A–D). Excitatory synaptic transmission was then blocked by the perfusion of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (DNQX) and DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5). After blocking the excitatory synaptic transmission, the differences in firing rate, RMP, and rheobase between CFA 3D and control mice were eliminated (Fig. 3, E–G). Furthermore, microinjection of DNQX and AP5 into the BLA significantly increased the nociceptive threshold of CFA 3D mice and induced a conditioned place preference for the drug-paired side (Fig. 3, H–K). Based on the above data, we then explored the excitatory inputs to BLAGlu neurons. The Cre-dependent helper viruses (AAV-EF1α-DIO-TVA-mCherry and AAV-EF1α-DIO-RVG) were injected into the BLA of CaMKII-Cre mice. After 3 weeks, the rabies virus (RV, EnvA-pseudotyped RV-ΔG-EGFP) was injected into the same site (Fig. 4, A and B). Intense enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled neurons were observed in the piriform cortex, ectorhinal cortex, posterior thalamic nuclear group, parafascicular thalamic nucleus, auditory cortex, insular cortex (IC), and MD (Figs. 4, C and F, and S1). Because the IC and MD are known to modulate different components of pain, we subsequently focused on the IC→BLA and MD→BLA circuits. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the EGFP+ neurons in the IC were mainly colocalized with glutamate-specific antibodies but not GABA antibodies (Fig. 4, D and E). Similar immunostaining results were observed in the MD (Fig. 4, G–I). We then examined the roles of the ICGlu→BLA and MDGlu→BLA pathways in pain processing. To characterize the role of the ICGlu→BLA pathway, we delivered AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry into the IC of CaMKII-Cre mice and performed whole-cell recording on BLA neurons (Fig. 5, A and B). Brief optical stimulation of ChR2-containing ICGlu terminals elicited excitatory postsynaptic currents in BLA neurons, which could be blocked by administering the antagonist DNQX (Fig. 5, C and D). We then recorded the BLA-projecting IC neurons labeled by the retrograde tracer CTB-488 injected in the BLA (Fig. 5, E and F). The whole-cell recording showed that the firing rate and RMP of the BLA-projecting IC neurons increased and rheobase decreased in CFA 3D mice compared to those in the control mice (Fig. 5,G–I). We then injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry into the IC and implanted an optical fiber that targeted the BLA to selectively activate the ICGlu→BLA pathway (Fig. 6, A and B). After 4 weeks, optical activation of ChR2-containing fibers in the BLA decreased the nociceptive threshold of normal mice (Fig. 6C). Additionally, this manipulation induced RTPA and conditioned place aversion for the light delivery side (Fig. 6, D and E). In contrast, optical inhibition of eNpHR-containing ICGlu terminals in the BLA increased the nociceptive threshold of CFA 3D mice and induced RTPP (Fig. 6, F–H). We then evaluated the role of the MDGlu→BLA pathway in pain processing. The light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents, which could be blocked by administering DNQX, were reliably recorded from the BLA neurons following optical stimulation of ChR2-containing MDGlu terminals (Fig. 7, A–D). Additionally, electrophysiological recordings showed that the firing rate and RMP of the BLA-projecting MD neurons, labeled by the retrograde tracer CTB-488 injected in the BLA, were higher in CFA 3D mice compared to the controls (Fig. 7, E–H). However, rheobase was decreased (Fig. 7I). Optical activation of the MDGlu→BLA pathway did not affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold of normal mice (Fig. 8, A–C) but induced RTPA and conditioned place aversion on the light delivery side (Fig. 8, D and E). In addition, no overt change was observed in the nociceptive threshold (Fig. 8, F and G), but RTPP was induced in the CFA 3D mice following optical inhibition of this pathway (Fig. 8H). Together, we identified two discrete glutamatergic neuronal circuits that mediate, at least in part, the somatosensory and aversion components of pain. In this study, we found that the enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA is essential for maintaining the hyperactivity of BLAGlu neurons and inflammation-induced pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, through viral tracing and optogenetics, we determined that the ICGlu→BLA pathway modulates both the somatosensory and aversive components of pain, but the MDGlu→BLA pathway is only involved in modulating the aversive component of pain. Previous field studies have primarily focused on the maladaptation caused by pain in the spinal cord and brain and explored promising targets for treating chronic pain (28Seymour B. The maladaptive brain: excitable pathways to chronic pain.Brain. 2012; 135: 316-318Google Scholar, 29Jutzeler C.R. Huber E. Callaghan M.F. Luechinger R. Curt A. Kramer J.L. et al.Association of pain and CNS structural changes after spinal cord injury.Sci. Rep. 2016; 618534Google Scholar). However, pain is an intricate and emotional experience, and the underlying neural circuits remain unclear. Previous in vivo calcium imaging studies reported that the activation of BLA pyramidal neurons is required for the negative affective components of pain (17Corder G. Ahanonu B. Grewe B.F. Wang D. Schnitzer M.J. Scherrer G. An amygdalar neural ensemble that encodes the unpleasantness of pain.Science. 2019; 363: 276-281Google Scholar). Inhibiting excitatory synaptic transmission by microinjection of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 antagonist into the BLA produced analgesic effects (30Luongo L. de Novellis V. Gatta L. Palazzo E. Vita D. Guida F. et al.Role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 in the basolateral amygdala-driven prefrontal cortical deactivation in inflammatory pain in the rat.Neuropharmacology. 2013; 66: 317-329Google Scholar). However, the underlying precise neural circuits remain unexplored. The essential role of the increased excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA in pain processing is known, but the precise excitatory inputs remain elusive. BLA receives polymodal information from the cortex and thalamus. The IC is a multisensory integration region that processes pain perception, memory, empathy, and emotion (31Berret E. Kintscher M.

Direct electrical stimulation of the IC enhanced pain perception, and chemical inhibition of the IC produced analgesia (35Ostrowsky K. Magnin M. Ryvlin P. Isnard J. Guenot M. Mauguière F.

Peyron R. Guenot M. Mauguiere F. Somatotopic organization of pain responses to direct electrical stimulation of the human insular cortex.Pain. 2009; 146: 99-104Google Scholar). Patients with strokes, including those affecting the IC, suffer from a lack of pain and emotional response to painful stimuli (37Nieuwenhuys R. The insular cortex: a review.Prog. Brain Res. 2012; 195: 123-163Google Scholar, 38Nagasaka K. Takashima I. Matsuda K. Higo N. Brain activity changes in a monkey model of central post-stroke pain.Exp. Neurol. 2020; 323: 113096Google Scholar). In addition, there are massive connections between the IC and the amygdala, but the functional role of these connections remains elusive. Using viral tracing, optogenetics, and whole-cell recording, we revealed that the ICGlu→BLA pathway was required for the sensory discriminative and aversive-affective components of pain. The multiple effects of the ICGlu→BLA pathway in pain processing are likely caused by different subregions of the IC because the posterior IC is preferentially involved in processing somatosensory features of pain, while the anterior IC preferentially mediates the affective component (39Alonso-Matielo H. Gonçalves E.S. Campos M. Oliveira V.R.S. Toniolo E.F.

Previous studies in humans revealed abnormal activity of the MD in patients with chronic pain (43Rinaldi P. Young R.F. Albe-Fessard D. Chodakiewitz J. Spontaneous neuronal hyperactivity in the medial and intralaminar thalamic nuclei of patients with deafferentation pain.J. Neurosurg. 1991; 74: 415-421Google Scholar, 44Groh A. Krieger P. Mease R.A. Henderson L. Acute and chronic pain processing in the thalamocortical system of humans and animal models.Neuroscience. 2018; 387: 58-71Google Scholar). In rats, both spontaneous firing rates and responses to noxious stimuli of MD neurons were increased following spinal cord injuries (45Whitt J.L. Masri R. Pulimood N.S. Keller A. Pathological activity in mediodorsal thalamus of rats with spinal cord injury pain.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 3915-3926Google Scholar). A previous study showed that the directly ascending projections from the spinal cord to the MD are required for painful stimuli-induced coping behaviors (46Huang T. Lin S.H. Malewicz N.M. Zhang Y. Zhang Y. Goulding M. et al.Identifying the pathways required for coping behaviours associated with sustained pain.Nature. 2019; 565: 86-90Google Scholar). Moreover, the MD is heavily connected to cortical areas, such as medial prefrontal cortex, IC, and anterior cingulate cortex, which function in pain-related aversion (47Ouhaz Z. Ba-M'hamed S. Bennis M. Morphological, structural, and functional alterations of the prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala after early lesion of the rat mediodorsal thalamus.Brain Struct.

Phillipson O.T. Afferent projections to the dorsal thalamus of the rat as shown by retrograde lectin transport--I. The mediodorsal nucleus.Neuroscience. 1988; 24: 1035-1049Google Scholar). Therefore, MD is one of the main components of the medial pain pathway that is involved in the affective dimension of pain (51Yen C.T. Lu P.L. Thalamus and pain.Acta Anaesthesiol Taiwan. 2013; 51: 73-80Google Scholar). Our optogenetic experiments revealed that activation of the MDGlu→BLA pathway primarily mediated the aversive dimension of pain rather than the somatosensory discrimination of pain. This study characterized the ICGlu→BLA and MDGlu→BLA pathways through which the somatosensory and aversion components of pain perception are generated. Our results provide a preliminary description of cortical and thalamic neural circuits for coding the somatosensory and aversive-affective components of pain. Male mice (8–12-week-old), including C57BL/6J, CaMKII-Cre, and Ai14 (RCL-TDT), were purchased from the Charles River or Jackson Laboratories. Mice (3–5/cage) were raised at room temperature (23–25 °C), under a 12-h light/dark cycle, and allowed free access to water and food (standard mouse chow). All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Science and Technology of China. Persistent inflammatory pain was induced by administering CFA (20 μl; Sigma-Aldrich) into the plantar vein of the left hind paw using an insulin syringe (BD Corp.) under deep anesthesia with isoflurane. The control mice were administered normal saline (0.9% NaCl). Von Frey test was used to measure the mechanical nociceptive threshold, as reported previously (52Zhang Z. Cai Y.-Q. Zou F. Bie B. Pan Z.Z. Epigenetic suppression of GAD65 expression mediates persistent pain.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1448-1455Google Scholar). Before the experiment, mice were placed in the testing room for at least 30 min for habituation. Then, the mice were placed separately in a transparent plastic chamber on a wire mesh and the calibrated von Frey filaments were applied to the surface of the hind paw with subsequently increasing force. The mechanical response threshold was determined as the minimal force filament that induced mice to present licking, biting, or sudden withdrawal of the hind paw. For optogenetic manipulations, the von Frey filaments were applied 1 min after the light was delivered, and the withdrawal threshold was calculated as the average of five applications. After deep anesthesia with isoflurane, mice were fixed in a stereotactic frame (RWD) and a heating pad was used to maintain the core body temperature at 36 °C. The virus used for tracing and optogenetic manipulation was delivered into the target regions using an infusion pump (micro 4, WPI) at a rate of 25 nl/min. The coordinates were defined as dorsoventral (DV) from the brain surface, anterior-posterior (AP) from the bregma, and mediolateral (ML) from the midline (in mm). Since the CFA was injected into the left hind paws and the nociceptive signals from the hind paws were transmitted to the contralateral brain, the virus was unilaterally injected in the right hemispheres. For retrograde monosynaptic tracing, helper viruses that contained rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-RVG-WPRE-pA (AAV-DIO-RVG, AAV2/9, 2 × 1012 viral genome, vg/ml) and rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-mCherry-2a-TVA-WPRE-pA (AAV-DIO-TVA-mCherry, AAV2/9, 2 × 1012 vg/ml; 1:1, 200 nl) were coinjected into the BLA (AP, −1.25 mm; ML, −3.05 mm; DV, −4.05 mm) of CaMKII-Cre mice. Three weeks later, the rabies virus RV-ENVA-ΔG-EGFP (2 × 108 IFU/ml, 250 nl) was delivered to the same site. Ten days after the RV injection, mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused. Finally, the brain was sliced and prepared for detecting the EGFP signal or performing immunofluorescence staining with glutamate-specific or GABA-specific antibodies. For anterograde tracing, the Cre-dependent virus rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-hChR2(H134 R)-mCherry-WPRE-pA (AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry, AAV2/9, 1.63 × 1013 vg/ml, 200 nl) was delivered into the IC and M"

In this study, we sought to examine the inequities in adverse perinatal outcomes between Black and White pregnant people in Ontario, Canada. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study that included all Black and White pregnant people who attended prenatal screening and had a singleton birth in any Ontario hospital (April 1 st , 2012-March 31 st , 2019). Poisson regression with robust error variance models were used to estimate the adjusted relative risks of adverse perinatal outcomes for Black people compared with White people while adjusting for covariates. Results Among 412,120 eligible pregnant people, 10.1% were Black people and 89.9% were White people. Black people were at an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm birth (&lt;37, &lt;34, &lt;32 weeks), spontaneous preterm birth, all caesarean sections, emergency caesarean section, low birth weight (&lt;2500g, &lt;1500g), small-for-gestational-age (&lt;10th percentile, &lt;3 rd percentile) neonates, 5-minute Apgar score &lt;4 and &lt;7, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and hyperbilirubinemia requiring treatment but had lower risks of elective caesarean section, assisted vaginal delivery, episiotomy, 3rd and 4th degree perineal tears, macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age neonates, and arterial cord pH≤7.1, as compared with White people. No difference in risks of gestational hypertension and placenta previa were observed between Black and White people. Conclusion There are differences in several adverse perinatal outcomes between Black and White people within the Ontario health care system. Findings might have potential clinical and health policy implications, although more studies are needed to further understand the mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4283746592,"There are limited systematic reviews on the prevalence of uncorrected refractive errors in children. We aimed to summarize the prevalence and causes of pediatric uncorrected refractive error (URE) from studies in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) sub-regions.The pooled analysis used the individual participant data (ages less than 20 years old) from population-based studies around the world by regions. URE was defined as presenting VA < 6/18 and improving to ≥ 6/18 or ≥1 line on using a pinhole in either eye, with main causes of myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism. Each study provided data on any URE, myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism by age, gender, and ethnicity. Prevalence rates were directly age and gender standardized to the 2020 world population with all age groups. Estimates were calculated by study and sub-regions after pooling. Summary estimates included studies in which URE was assessed from a pinhole-corrected refraction in the better eye.The combined pooled data contained 302,513,219 patients including 8 963 URE cases individuals from 57 studies. Prevalence varied by age and GBD sub-regions and differed by gender. The age- and region-standardized prevalence of URE was 3.41 per 1000 (CI, 1.53~7.62) in Western Pacific region (12 studies), 2.26 per 1000 (CI, 0.85~6.01) in South-East Asia region (14 studies), 5.85 per 1000 (CI, 3.75~9.13) in Americans (11 studies) and 4.40 per 1000 (CI, 3.0~6.45) in Eastern Mediterranean region (13 studies). On the basis of these data, myopia was the first-leading cause in female children with 12~17 age group, with the prevalence rate 18.2 per 1000 (CI, 11.52~23.61). Astigmatism was detected in 27.2 per 1000 male children with 6~11 age group (CI: 19.12-30.68).Prevalence of URE available data within these sub-regions are widely disparate. Myopia and astigmatism in young age children continue as the leading cause of URE worldwide. Providing appropriate refractive correction to those individuals whose vision can be improved is an important public health endeavor with implications for safety and quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4283752694,"Motivation Single-cell Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation DNA-Sequencing (scChIP-seq) analysis is challenging due to data sparsity. High degree of sparsity in biological high-throughput single-cell data is generally handled with imputation methods that complete the data, but specific methods for scChIP-seq are lacking. We present SIMPA, a scChIP-seq data imputation method leveraging predictive information within bulk data from the ENCODE project to impute missing protein-DNA interacting regions of target histone marks or transcription factors. Results Imputations using machine learning models trained for each single cell, each ChIP protein target, and each genomic region accurately preserve cell type clustering and improve pathway-related gene identification on real human data. Results on bulk data simulating single cells show that the imputations are single-cell specific as the imputed profiles are closer to the simulated cell than to other cells related to the same ChIP protein target and the same cell type. Simulations also show that 100 input genomic regions are already enough to train single-cell specific models for the imputation of thousands of undetected regions. Furthermore, SIMPA enables the interpretation of machine learning models by revealing interaction sites of a given single cell that are most important for the imputation model trained for a specific genomic region. The corresponding feature importance values derived from promoter-interaction profiles of H3K4me3, an activating histone mark, highly correlate with co-expression of genes that are present within the cell-type specific pathways in 2 real human and mouse datasets. The SIMPA’s interpretable imputation method allows users to gain a deep understanding of individual cells and, consequently, of sparse scChIP-seq datasets. Availability and implementation Our interpretable imputation algorithm was implemented in Python and is available at https://github.com/salbrec/SIMPA ."
https://openalex.org/W4283758863,"Distant or online learning on digital platforms has become the norm in education worldwide, putting students under immense mental strain. The present study examined the association between psychological distress and coping strategies among students engaged in online learning. This study used a cross-sectional design. A structured questionnaire was sent to each of the 210 university students at two prestigious public and private universities in Bangladesh through email. Data was collected from March 26 to April 27, 2021. Severe psychological distress was found in 55.2 percent of the population. Younger age groups, public university students, students with no self-income, moderate aid from the university in providing resources from home, and students with existing mental health illnesses were significantly associated with psychological distress (p-value<0.05). Among all 14 items of Brief COPE, active coping, using emotional support, and self-blame significantly influenced the psychological distress instrument Kessler-10 (p-value<0.01). Given the perspective of this study, coping strategies alleviate stress and facilitate positive psychological outcomes. Students' mental health is a prioritized issue that needs more attention. Because of its higher prevalence and adverse consequences, institution authorities should support each student by providing study materials, student loans, and scholarships. Routine screening will allow identifying students going through a difficult time who can get help from experts through counseling."
https://openalex.org/W4283776896,"Meta-analyses have found that people high in psychopathy categorize (or ""recognize"") others' prototypical facial emotion expressions with reduced accuracy. However, these have been contested with remaining questions regarding the strength, specificity, and mechanisms of this ability in psychopathy. In addition, few studies have tested holistically whether psychopathy is related to reduced facial mimicry or autonomic arousal in response to others' dynamic facial expressions. Therefore, the current study presented 6 s videos of a target person making prototypical emotion expressions (anger, fear, disgust, sadness, joy, and neutral) to N = 88 incarcerated adult males while recording facial electromyography, skin conductance response (SCR), and heart rate. Participants identified the emotion category and rated the valence and intensity of the target person's emotion. Psychopathy was assessed via the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). We predicted that overall PCL-R scores and scores for the interpersonal/affective traits, in particular, would be related to reduced emotion categorization accuracy, valence ratings, intensity ratings, facial mimicry, SCR amplitude, and cardiac deceleration in response to the prototypical facial emotion expressions. In contrast to our hypotheses, PCL-R scores were unrelated to emotion categorization accuracy, valence ratings, and intensity ratings. Stimuli failed to elicit facial mimicry from the full sample, which does not allow drawing conclusions about the relationship between psychopathy and facial mimicry. However, participants displayed general autonomic arousal responses, but not to prototypical emotion expressions per se. PCL-R scores were also unrelated to SCR and cardiac deceleration. These findings failed to identify aberrant behavioral and physiological responses to prototypical facial emotion expressions in relation to psychopathy."

We compared ventilatory parameters, biochemical and physiological data and mortality between the first and second COVID-19 surges in the United Kingdom, where distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2 were the dominant stain. We performed a retrospective cohort study investigating critically unwell patients admitted with COVID-19 across three tertiary regional ICUs in London, UK. Of 1782 adult ICU patients screened, 330 intubated and ventilated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. In the second wave where B.1.1.7 variant was the dominant strain, patients were had increased severity of ARDS whilst compliance was greater (p&lt;0.05) and d-dimer lower. The 28-day mortality was not statistically significant (1st wave: 42.2% vs 2nd wave: 39.8%). However, when adjusted for key covariates, the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality in those patients with B.1.1.7 was 3.79 (CI 1.04–13.8; p = 0.043) compared to the original strain. During the second surge in the UK, where the COVID-19 variant B.1.1.7 was most prevalent, significantly more patients presented to critical care with severe ARDS. Furthermore, mortality risk was significantly greater in our ICU population during the second wave of the pandemic in those patients with B.1.1.7. As ICUs are experiencing further waves (particularly by the delta (B.1.617.2) variant), we highlight the urgent need for prospective studies describing immunological and pathophysiological differences across novel emerging variants."
https://openalex.org/W4283741995,"Self-stigma is common among people with mental disorders. A large body of research has examined associations between self-stigma and sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial factors but the results are still conflicting. The aim of this study was to describe self-stigma among persons with affective and psychotic disorders and identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with experiences of self-stigma. A cross-sectional survey was performed with Finnish clients (N = 898) at 16 psychiatric clinics using self-reported questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and with one-way and multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that clients in community settings experience self-stigma (a total mean SSMIS-SF score of 74.8 [SD 22.3]). Having a diagnosis of an affective disorder, having a long history of mental disorder (&gt;16 years) and the severity of depressive symptoms were the key factors associated with experiences of self-stigma. Clients living in community settings should be assessed regularly for depressive symptoms of mental disorders, and interventions should be conducted, especially at an early stage of the illness, to reduce self-stigma. Factors associated with self-stigma should be taken into account in the future development of interventions to reduce stigma."
https://openalex.org/W4283756186,"Over the last 60 years, Arctic goose populations have increased while many sympatric tundra nesting bird populations have declined. Hyperabundant geese have well-documented effects on tundra habitats, which can alter habitat use by sympatric bird species. These habitat changes may also alter invertebrate communities and abundances, with potentially important, but as of yet, undocumented effects on insectivorous birds such as shorebirds. Here, we determined the effects of goose-induced habitat alteration on invertebrate communities and relate the observed changes to shorebird diet. At sites and habitat types representing a gradient of goose influence, we identified goose-related changes in ground cover and linked these factors to variation in invertebrate communities. We then used DNA metabarcoding to characterize the diet of six shorebird species across sites and identify inter-site variation in abundance, biomass, and timing of emergence of dominant shorebird prey items. Invertebrate diversity and richness did not vary either among sites or habitat types. However, for prey items identified as part of the shorebird diet, we found significantly higher abundances and biomasses at a moderately goose-influenced site than at either low or high goose-influenced sites. Biomass of Tipulidae, the dominant prey taxon for shorebirds at the study sites, was 7.5 times higher at the moderately goose-influenced site compared to the site where goose influence was minor. We attribute this enhancement of prey biomass to both the fertilizing effect of goose fecal pellets and the moderate grazing pressure. Many studies have documented adverse effects of overabundant geese, but here we show that a moderate degree of goose grazing can lead to enhanced biomass of invertebrates, with the potential for improved shorebird foraging success and chick growth. These benefits, however, might be outweighed by negative effects of goose-induced habitat alteration and predation pressure."
https://openalex.org/W4283773940,"In this study, we propose an improved unbiased estimator in estimating the finite population mean using a single auxiliary variable and rank of the auxiliary variable by adopting the Hartley-Ross procedure when some parameters of the auxiliary variable are known. Expressions for the bias and mean square error or variance of the estimators are obtained up to the first order of approximation. Four real data sets are used to observe the performances of the estimators and to support the theoretical findings. It turns out that the proposed unbiased estimator outperforms as compared to all other considered estimators. It is also observed that using conventional measures have significant contributions in achieving the efficiency of the estimators."
https://openalex.org/W4283781413,"To control the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China, Guangxi government launched the 5-year Guangxi AIDS Conquering Project (GACP, Phase I: 2010-2014, Phase II: 2015-2020). In the project, three measures are implemented, such as great improvements of the coverage of HIV/AIDS education, promotion of HIV voluntary counseling and testing, and enhancement of antiretroviral treatment. In this paper, we explore the effects of the three measures of GACP by construction of a Susceptible-Infected-Diagnosed-Treated population compartments model and via evaluation of the basic reproduction number derived from the model. A computational framework is developed for estimating the model parameters based on the HIV surveillance data, with application of the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method and Nonlinear Least Squares method. By estimating the new infections and evaluating the basic reproduction number, we find that the implementation of the three measures of GACP has a significant effect on controlling the rise of HIV/AIDS cases and the epidemic trend. Compared with HIV voluntary counseling and testing, strengthening HIV/AIDS education and expanding the coverage of antiretroviral treatment show a greater impact on HIV/AIDS epidemic control, which provides a reference project for other provinces with a similar epidemic situation in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. At the same time, our research fills the current research gap for the evaluation of large-scale AIDS prevention and control projects in developing areas."
https://openalex.org/W4283575560,"DNA and core histones are hierarchically packaged into a complex organization called chromatin. The nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) family of histone chaperones is involved in the deposition of histone complexes H2A/H2B and H3/H4 onto DNA and prevents nonspecific aggregation of histones. Testis-specific Y-encoded protein (TSPY)-like protein 5 (TSPYL5) is a member of the TSPY-like protein family, which has been previously reported to interact with ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 and regulate cell proliferation and is thus implicated in various cancers, but its interaction with chromatin has not been investigated. In this study, we characterized the chromatin association of TSPYL5 and found that it preferentially binds histone H3/H4 via its C-terminal NAP-like domain both in vitro and ex vivo. We identified the critical residues involved in the TSPYL5-H3/H4 interaction and further quantified the binding affinity of TSPYL5 toward H3/H4 using biolayer interferometry. We then determined the binding stoichiometry of the TSPYL5-H3/H4 complex in vitro using a chemical cross-linking assay and size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle laser light scattering. Our results indicate that a TSPYL5 dimer binds to either two histone H3/H4 dimers or a single tetramer. We further demonstrated that TSPYL5 has a specific affinity toward longer DNA fragments and that the same histone-binding residues are also critically involved in its DNA binding. Finally, employing histone deposition and supercoiling assays, we confirmed that TSPYL5 is a histone chaperone responsible for histone H3/H4 deposition and nucleosome assembly. We conclude that TSPYL5 is likely a new member of the NAP histone chaperone family."
https://openalex.org/W4283590056,"The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis, otherwise known as Chagas disease. To survive in the host, the T. cruzi parasite needs antioxidant defense systems. One of these is a hybrid heme peroxidase, the T. cruzi ascorbate peroxidase-cytochrome c peroxidase enzyme (TcAPx-CcP). TcAPx-CcP has high sequence identity to members of the class I peroxidase family, notably ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), as well as a mitochondrial peroxidase from Leishmania major (LmP). The aim of this work was to solve the structure and examine the reactivity of the TcAPx-CcP enzyme. Low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra support the formation of an exchange-coupled [Fe(IV)=O Trp233•+] compound I radical species, analogous to that used in CcP and LmP. We demonstrate that TcAPx-CcP is similar in overall structure to APX and CcP, but there are differences in the substrate-binding regions. Furthermore, the electron transfer pathway from cytochrome c to the heme in CcP and LmP is preserved in the TcAPx-CcP structure. Integration of steady state kinetic experiments, molecular dynamic simulations, and bioinformatic analyses indicates that TcAPx-CcP preferentially oxidizes cytochrome c but is still competent for oxidization of ascorbate. The results reveal that TcAPx-CcP is a credible cytochrome c peroxidase, which can also bind and use ascorbate in host cells, where concentrations are in the millimolar range. Thus, kinetically and functionally TcAPx-CcP can be considered a hybrid peroxidase."

https://openalex.org/W4283736593,"In bioinformatics, alignment is an essential technique for finding similarities between biological sequences. Usually, the alignment is performed with the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm, a well-known sequence alignment technique of high-level precision based on dynamic programming. However, given the massive data volume in biological databases and their continuous exponential increase, high-speed data processing is necessary. Therefore, this work proposes a parallel hardware design for the SW algorithm with a systolic array structure to accelerate the forward and backtracking steps. For this purpose, the architecture calculates and stores the paths in the forward stage for pre-organizing the alignment, which reduces the complexity of the backtracking stage. The backtracking starts from the maximum score position in the matrix and generates the optimal SW sequence alignment path. The architecture was validated on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and synthesis analyses have shown that the proposed design reaches up to 79.5 Giga Cell Updates per Second (GCPUS)."
https://openalex.org/W4283737487,"The Rho family Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) ARHGEF17 (also known as TEM4) is a large protein with only 3 annotated regions: an N-terminal actin-binding domain, a Rho-specific dbl homology (DH)- pleckstrin homology (PH) type GEF domain and a seven bladed β propeller fold at the C-terminus with unknown function. TEM4 has been implicated in numerous activities that rely on regulation of the cytoskeleton including cell migration, cell-cell junction formation and the spindle assembly checkpoint during mitosis. Here we have assessed the specificity of a TEM4 polyclonal antibody that has been commonly used as a Western blotting and immunocytochemistry probe for TEM4 in mammalian cells. We find that this antibody, in addition to its intended target, cross-reacts with the Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus Protein 1 (NuMA) in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, and detects NuMA preferentially in immunocytochemistry. This cross-reactivity, with an abundant chromatin- and mitotic spindle-associated factor, is likely to affect the interpretation of experiments that make use of this antibody probe, in particular by immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation."
https://openalex.org/W4283739756,"This study seeks to provide a basic approach to fulfill the spatial visualization of geopolitical environmental factors required for the navigation of vessels in the Arctic. Multi-dimensional geopolitical environmental factors of the Arctic Passage are analyzed and classified into geopolitics, geoeconomics, geo-military, geoculture, and laws and regulations related to geography. Their characteristics are extracted to form an attribute information table matching spatial layers. Based on the information category and basic characteristics, the spatial match method is applied and connected with the spatial layers to examine the spatial point, polyline, and polygon. According to the qualitative description, the study extracted the quantitative indicators for the following spatial–temporal pattern analysis. The standard deviational ellipse is used to analyze the spatial–temporal patterns and trends of the geopolitical environmental indicators of the Arctic Passage in the Arctic and Northeast Asia. The expansion and contraction of geoinformation coexist in the countries surrounding the Arctic Passage. The spatial–temporal changes indicate that the Arctic channel has a great economic impact on the Nordic countries and Northeast Asia, especially the coastal areas of China and Japan. The characteristic extraction and spatial match of the geopolitical environment provide integrated Arctic geoinformation inquiry and services for the diplomatic, administrative, and legal preparations required for Arctic navigation. Therefore, the geospatial analysis conducted provides scientific support and a basis for the geographical distribution and developing trends of visualization and spatial–temporal pattern in Arctic navigation. The results of this research will help decision-makers to make a comprehensive judgment on governance related to the sustainable development of the Arctic Passage."
https://openalex.org/W4283744840,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a trinucleotide repeat disorder affecting multiple organs. However, most of the research is focused on studying and treating its muscular symptoms. On the other hand, despite the significant impact of the neurological symptoms on patients’ quality of life, no drug therapy was studied due to insufficient reproducibility in DM1 brain-specific animal models. To establish DM1 neuronal model, human skin fibroblasts were directly converted into neurons by using lentivirus expressing small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against poly-pyrimidine tract binding protein (PTBP). We found faster degeneration in DM1 human induced neurons (DM1 hiNeurons) compared to control human induced neurons (ctrl hiNeurons), represented by lower viability from 10 days post viral-infection (DPI) and abnormal axonal growth at 15 DPI. Nuclear RNA foci were present in most of DM1 hiNeurons at 10 DPI. Furthermore, DM1 hiNeurons modelled aberrant splicing of MBNL 1 and 2, MAPT , CSNK1D and MPRIP at 10 DPI. We tested two drugs that were shown to be effective for DM1 in non-neuronal model and found that treatment of DM1 hiNeurons with 100 nM or 200 nM actinomycin D (ACT) for 24 h resulted in more than 50% reduction in the number of RNA foci per nucleus in a dose dependent manner, with 16.5% reduction in the number of nuclei containing RNA foci at 200 nM and treatment with erythromycin at 35 μM or 65 μM for 48 h rescued mis-splicing of MBNL 1 exon 5 and MBNL 2 exons 5 and 8 up to 17.5%, 10% and 8.5%, respectively. Moreover, erythromycin rescued the aberrant splicing of MAPT exon 2, CSNK1D exon 9 and MPRIP exon 9 to a maximum of 46.4%, 30.7% and 19.9%, respectively. These results prove that our model is a promising tool for detailed pathogenetic examination and novel drug screening for the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W4283754028,"Background Disease surveillance using adequate case definitions is very important. The objective of the study was to compare the performance of influenza case definitions and influenza symptoms in the first two epidemic weeks with respect to other epidemic weeks. Methods We analysed cases of acute respiratory infection detected by the network of sentinel primary care physicians of Catalonia for 10 seasons. We calculated the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the first two epidemic weeks and for other epidemic weeks. Results A total of 4,338 samples were collected in the epidemic weeks, of which 2,446 (56.4%) were positive for influenza. The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the WHO case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the first two epidemic weeks (DOR 2.10; 95% CI 1.57–2.81) and in other epidemic weeks (DOR 2.31; 95% CI 1.96–2.72). The most predictive symptom was fever. After knowing that epidemic threshold had been reached, the DOR of the ILI WHO case definition in children aged &lt;5 years and cough and fever in this group increased (190%, 170% and 213%, respectively). Conclusions During influenza epidemics, differences in the performance of the case definition and the discriminative ability of symptoms were found according to whether it was known that the epidemic threshold had been reached or not. This suggests that sentinel physicians are stricter in selecting samples to send to the laboratory from patients who present symptoms more specific to influenza after rather than before an influenza epidemic has been declared."

This article first applies statistical techniques to help find and evaluate rule-breaking photographs, and then from these photographs discover those patterns that justify their rule-breaking. With this approach, this article discovered some significant patterns that explain why some high-quality photographs successfully break the common photographic rules by positioning the subject in the center or the horizon in the vertical center.

https://openalex.org/W4283767928,"The Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC) score has been advocated as a screening tool for nutrition risk assessment in critically ill patients. It was developed and validated to predict 28-day mortality using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score as one of its components. However, nowadays the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) demonstrates better performance. We aimed to test the performance of NUTRIC score in predicting 28-day mortality after replacement of APACHE II by SAPS 3, and the interaction between nutrition adequacy and mortality.Adult patients who received nutrition therapy and remained >3 days in intensive care unit were retrospectively evaluated. In order to replace APACHE II component, we used ranges of SAPS 3 with similar predicted mortality. Discrimination between these tools in predicting 28-day mortality was assessed using the ROC curve, calibration was evaluated with calibration belt, and correlation with intraclass correlation. The relationship between nutritional adequacy and mortality was assessed in a subgroup with available data.542 patients were analyzed (median age of 78 years old, 73.4% admitted for non-surgical reasons and 28-day mortality was 18.1%). Mortality prediction discrimination did not differ between tools (p>0.05), but showed a good agreement (intraclass correlation 0.86) with good calibration. In the subgroup analysis for nutritional adequacy (n = 99), no association with mortality was observed.Performance of NUTRIC score with SAPS 3 is similar to the original tool. Therefore, it might be used in settings where APACHE II is not available."

Japanese clinical practice guidelines recommend rifaximin to treat overt HE (OHE). However, the usefulness of rifaximin against CHE is not thoroughly investigated in Japanese patients. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of rifaximin against hyperammonemia and CHE in Japan. We observed 102 patients with HE showing hyperammonemia secondary to LC and examined various biochemical and behavioral parameters following rifaximin treatment. CHE was diagnosed when the patients exhibited two or more abnormal neuropsychological test (NPT) scores but did not indicate OHE symptoms. In the 102 cases, a significant therapeutic effect of rifaximin on hyperammonemia was observed from 2 to 48 weeks after starting treatment. Excluding 10 patients diagnosed with OHE upon starting rifaximin treatment, 12 of the 92 remaining patients (11.8%) transitioned to OHE within 1 year. The 1 year cumulative OHE transition rate was 14.5%. Among the 24 patients with CHE diagnosed by the NPT for whom NPT results could be evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks after starting treatment, 10 (41.6%) had recovered from CHE at 12 weeks. When the factors contributing to recovery from CHE were examined by multivariate analysis, an ammonia level <129 μg/dL was a significant factor. Rifaximin was thus significantly effective against both hyperammonemia and CHE in Japanese patients."

Moreover, a paucity of evidence exists regarding social protection grants' countervailing effects against such shocks. This study examined the effects of job loss (labour income loss) on child and household hungers (our two measures food insecurity) during COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. It also ascertained whether these effect were offset by alternative social grant programs to document the protective role of the latter.We used South Africa's National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) and the Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (CRAM) data. These data cover a nationally representative sample of 7073 individuals. We employed a probit model to estimate the effect of job loss and receipts of various social grants on child and households' hungers. We also estimated the double-selection logit model to account for the model's uncertainty surrounding the variable selection and treatment-effects estimation using lasso (Telasso) for causal inference of our analysis.Our analyses showed that households exposed to a labour market shock during the pandemic experienced a significant increase in our measures of food insecurity (child and household hungers). Specifically, we found that compared with households containing employed respondents, households with respondents who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 lockdown were 5.4% more likely to report child hunger and 2.6% more likely to report household hunger in the past seven days A receipt of child support grant reduces the likelihood of reporting child hunger and household hunger by 21.7%and 16.9% respectively among these households. A receipt of old age pension grant reduces the likelihood of reporting household hunger by 24% with no significant effect on child hunger.The COVID-19 lockdown resulted in unprecedent job losses with significant implications for food insecurity. Job loss due to COVID-19 lockdown significantly increased food insecurity in South Africa. Receipts of social grants effectively offset this adverse effect. The protective effect of the social grant is heterogenous across its alternative programs (child support grant and old age pension grant) and food insecurity, suggesting the differences in the size of transfers and motivations for sending these transfers."

It differs from other institutional investors in a number of ways, including investment size, horizon, duration, risk, and so on. However, only a small portion of the extant literature focuses on in-depth and extensive analysis of Insurance Institutional Investors' holdings (IIIs). This study analyses the impact of shareholding by insurance institutions on the value of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies in China's capital market. The paper offers three major contributions. First, we discovered that long-term equity-holding IIIs have both value selection and value creation functions. Second, the value creation function becomes more significant among long-term stock-holding IIIs with an increase in the period during which they retain the company's shares; Third, fast-in and fast-out (FIFO) IIIs have a value-inhibiting effect on the held company and serve a value selection role, rather than a value creation function. This study provides more insight on the lack of academic interest in insurance institutions and serves as a foundation and reference for the design of regulatory policies for insurance institutions' involvement in stock markets. It also gives empirical evidence for corporations to accurately analyze shareholding by insurance institutions. Furthermore, since this study concentrates on China's capital market, it can serve as a benchmark for other nations, particularly, those designated as developing market economies."
