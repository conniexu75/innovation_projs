While previous methods sacrificed sensitivity for speed gains, the parallelized, open-source software MMseqs2 overcomes this trade-off: In three-iteration profile searches it reaches 50% higher sensitivity than BLAST at 83-fold speed and the same sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at 270 times its speed. MMseqs2 therefore offers great potential to increase the fraction of annotatable (meta)genomic sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2761575992,"The mechanisms by which immune checkpoint blockade modulates tumor evolution during therapy are unclear. We assessed genomic changes in tumors from 68 patients with advanced melanoma, who progressed on ipilimumab or were ipilimumab-naive, before and after nivolumab initiation (CA209-038 study). Tumors were analyzed by whole-exome, transcriptome, and/or T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. In responding patients, mutation and neoantigen load were reduced from baseline, and analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity during therapy demonstrated differential clonal evolution within tumors and putative selection against neoantigenic mutations on-therapy. Transcriptome analyses before and during nivolumab therapy revealed increases in distinct immune cell subsets, activation of specific transcriptional networks, and upregulation of immune checkpoint genes that were more pronounced in patients with response. Temporal changes in intratumoral TCR repertoire revealed expansion of T cell clones in the setting of neoantigen loss. Comprehensive genomic profiling data in this study provide insight into nivolumab's mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2767090914,"Ultra-high signal-to-background in vivo imaging is enabled by biocompatible semiconducting polymer nanoparticles. Afterglow optical agents, which emit light long after cessation of excitation, hold promise for ultrasensitive in vivo imaging because they eliminate tissue autofluorescence. However, afterglow imaging has been limited by its reliance on inorganic nanoparticles with relatively low brightness and short-near-infrared (NIR) emission. Here we present semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) <40 nm in diameter that store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence at 780 nm with a half-life of ∼6 min. In vivo, the afterglow intensity of SPNs is more than 100-fold brighter than that of inorganic afterglow agents, and the signal is detectable through the body of a live mouse. High-contrast lymph node and tumor imaging in living mice is demonstrated with a signal-to-background ratio up to 127-times higher than that obtained by NIR fluorescence imaging. Moreover, we developed an afterglow probe, activated only in the presence of biothiols, for early detection of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in living mice."
https://openalex.org/W2762158227,"Sympathetic neuron–associated macrophages act as a local sink for norepinephrine, leading to reduced thermogenesis and increased obesity. The cellular mechanism(s) linking macrophages to norepinephrine (NE)-mediated regulation of thermogenesis have been a topic of debate. Here we identify sympathetic neuron–associated macrophages (SAMs) as a population of cells that mediate clearance of NE via expression of solute carrier family 6 member 2 (SLC6A2), an NE transporter, and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a degradation enzyme. Optogenetic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) upregulates NE uptake by SAMs and shifts the SAM profile to a more proinflammatory state. NE uptake by SAMs is prevented by genetic deletion of Slc6a2 or inhibition of the encoded transporter. We also observed an increased proportion of SAMs in the SNS of two mouse models of obesity. Genetic ablation of Slc6a2 in SAMs increases brown adipose tissue (BAT) content, causes browning of white fat, increases thermogenesis, and leads to substantial and sustained weight loss in obese mice. We further show that this pathway is conserved, as human sympathetic ganglia also contain SAMs expressing the analogous molecular machinery for NE clearance, which thus constitutes a potential target for obesity treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2766837662,"Concomitant overexpression of microRNAs miR-100 and miR-125b-1 within the host long non-coding RNA MIR100HG induces cetuximab resistance in cancer in the absence of previously associated genetic alterations. miR-100 and miR-125b target negative regulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and sustain drug resistance through feedback inhibition of GATA6 expression and this resistance can be overcome by pharmacological inhibition of Wnt activity. These findings, together with those by Tan et al. in the previous issue, highlight the emerging functional role of non-coding RNAs in modulating the response to anti-cancer therapies. De novo and acquired resistance, which are largely attributed to genetic alterations, are barriers to effective anti-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor (EGFR) therapy. To generate cetuximab-resistant cells, we exposed cetuximab-sensitive colorectal cancer cells to cetuximab in three-dimensional culture. Using whole-exome sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we found that the long non-coding RNA MIR100HG and two embedded microRNAs, miR-100 and miR-125b, were overexpressed in the absence of known genetic events linked to cetuximab resistance. MIR100HG, miR-100 and miR-125b overexpression was also observed in cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer cell lines and in tumors from colorectal cancer patients that progressed on cetuximab. miR-100 and miR-125b coordinately repressed five Wnt/β-catenin negative regulators, resulting in increased Wnt signaling, and Wnt inhibition in cetuximab-resistant cells restored cetuximab responsiveness. Our results describe a double-negative feedback loop between MIR100HG and the transcription factor GATA6, whereby GATA6 represses MIR100HG, but this repression is relieved by miR-125b targeting of GATA6. These findings identify a clinically actionable, epigenetic cause of cetuximab resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2761941966,"Microenvironmental pressures in glioblastoma select for glioma stem cells (GSCs) subpopulations that are maintained through preferential activation of BMI1 and EZH2 in different niches. Given the high degree of intratumor heterogeneity, combined pharmacological inhibition of Polycomb repressive complexes targets proneural and mesenchynmal GSCs and expands lifespan in mice, warranting the therapeutic evaluation of this approach in patients with glioblastoma. Glioblastomas are lethal cancers defined by angiogenesis and pseudopalisading necrosis. Here, we demonstrate that these histological features are associated with distinct transcriptional programs, with vascular regions showing a proneural profile, and hypoxic regions showing a mesenchymal pattern. As these regions harbor glioma stem cells (GSCs), we investigated the epigenetic regulation of these two niches. Proneural, perivascular GSCs activated EZH2, whereas mesenchymal GSCs in hypoxic regions expressed BMI1 protein, which promoted cellular survival under stress due to downregulation of the E3 ligase RNF144A. Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition, we found that proneural GSCs are preferentially sensitive to EZH2 disruption, whereas mesenchymal GSCs are more sensitive to BMI1 inhibition. Given that glioblastomas contain both proneural and mesenchymal GSCs, combined EZH2 and BMI1 targeting proved more effective than either agent alone both in culture and in vivo, suggesting that strategies that simultaneously target multiple epigenetic regulators within glioblastomas may be effective in overcoming therapy resistance caused by intratumoral heterogeneity."

https://openalex.org/W2762198049,"Posttranslational modification with ubiquitin chains controls cell fate in all eukaryotes. Depending on the connectivity between subunits, different ubiquitin chain types trigger distinct outputs, as seen with K48- and K63-linked conjugates that drive protein degradation or complex assembly, respectively. Recent biochemical analyses also suggested roles for mixed or branched ubiquitin chains, yet without a method to monitor endogenous conjugates, the physiological significance of heterotypic polymers remained poorly understood. Here, we engineered a bispecific antibody to detect K11/K48-linked chains and identified mitotic regulators, misfolded nascent polypeptides, and pathological Huntingtin variants as their endogenous substrates. We show that K11/K48-linked chains are synthesized and processed by essential ubiquitin ligases and effectors that are mutated across neurodegenerative diseases; accordingly, these conjugates promote rapid proteasomal clearance of aggregation-prone proteins. By revealing key roles of K11/K48-linked chains in cell-cycle and quality control, we establish heterotypic ubiquitin conjugates as important carriers of biological information."

However, the molecular links between lipid metabolism and IL-1β production remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) by macrophages is required to prevent inflammasome activation by the DNA sensor protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). We find that in response to bacterial infection or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, macrophages upregulate Ch25h to maintain repression of SREBP2 activation and cholesterol synthesis. Increasing macrophage cholesterol content is sufficient to trigger IL-1β release in a crystal-independent but AIM2-dependent manner. Ch25h deficiency results in cholesterol-dependent reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol. AIM2 deficiency rescues the increased inflammasome activity observed in Ch25h−/−. Therefore, activated macrophages utilize 25-HC in an anti-inflammatory circuit that maintains mitochondrial integrity and prevents spurious AIM2 inflammasome activation.

Therefore, activated macrophages utilize 25-HC in an anti-inflammatory circuit that maintains mitochondrial integrity and prevents spurious AIM2 inflammasome activation. Cholesterol is a crucial structural component of mammalian cell membranes. However, unlike fatty acids, cholesterol cannot be used as an energy source, necessitating feedback mechanisms to control cellular cholesterol content. The molecular basis for cholesterol feedback inhibition involves the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) pathway, whereby increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cholesterol content causes the chaperone protein SCAP to bind more tightly to INSIG, which results in SREBP2 sequestration in the ER (Goldstein et al., 2006Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Protein sensors for membrane sterols.Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). In states of low ER cholesterol, SCAP dissociates from INSIG, allowing for translocation of the SCAP-SREBP2 complex to the Golgi apparatus, where SREBP2 is cleaved (Goldstein et al., 2006Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Protein sensors for membrane sterols.Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). This releases the transcription factor domain of SREBP2, which translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. While cholesterol can inhibit sterol biosynthesis, the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is even more potent than cholesterol in its capacity to inhibit SREBP2 in biochemical studies (Goldstein et al., 2006Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Protein sensors for membrane sterols.Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Whereas cholesterol is sensed by SCAP, 25-HC binds directly to INSIG, causing increased association with SCAP-SREBP2. However, it has been unclear whether endogenously produced 25-HC contributes to cholesterol regulation in mammalian cells. Mice deficient in the enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h), which produces 25-HC from cholesterol, do not show defects in baseline cholesterol homeostasis, raising the question of whether this metabolite has a physiologic function (McDonald and Russell, 2010McDonald J.G. Russell D.W. Editorial: 25-Hydroxycholesterol: a new life in immunology.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2010; 88: 1071-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has recently been appreciated that Ch25h is an interferon (IFN)-inducible gene in macrophages. Stimulation of mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or poly(I:C) results in IFNAR1-dependent upregulation of Ch25h and 25-HC synthesis (Cyster et al., 2014Cyster J.G. Dang E.V. Reboldi A. Yi T. 25-Hydroxycholesterols in innate and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 731-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Consistent with the key role of type I IFN in responses to viruses, 25-HC has antiviral activity (Blanc et al., 2013Blanc M. Hsieh W.Y. Robertson K.A. Kropp K.A. Forster T. Shui G. Lacaze P. Watterson S. Griffiths S.J.

Type I IFN additionally acts to inhibit interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-driven inflammation (Cyster et al., 2014Cyster J.G. Dang E.V. Reboldi A. Yi T. 25-Hydroxycholesterols in innate and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 731-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This occurs by repression of Il1b transcription and inflammasome-dependent IL-1β processing (Guarda et al., 2011Guarda G. Braun M. Staehli F. Tardivel A. Mattmann C. Förster I. Farlik M. Decker T. Du Pasquier R.A. Romero P. Tschopp J. Type I interferon inhibits interleukin-1 production and inflammasome activation.Immunity. 2011; 34: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that the inhibitory action of type I IFN on IL-1β requires induction of Ch25h/25-HC (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that form within the cytosol following exposure to a wide variety of pathogen-derived stimuli (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016Rathinam V.A.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Inflammasome complexes: emerging mechanisms and effector functions.Cell. 2016; 165: 792-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Inflammasome activation requires recognition of ligand by a sensor protein followed by recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016Rathinam V.A.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Inflammasome complexes: emerging mechanisms and effector functions.Cell. 2016; 165: 792-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). This results in ASC oligomerization and the recruitment and activation of caspase-1, a protease that processes pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β. How 25-HC represses inflammasome activation has been unclear. The effects of Ch25h deficiency on pro-IL-1β processing could be rescued by overexpression of INSIG1 or deletion of SCAP, suggesting a contribution by the SREBP pathway, but the nature of this contribution has not been defined (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a metabolic circuit that links regulation of cellular cholesterol content to the prevention of inflammasome activation. We find LPS-activated macrophages shut down cholesterol biosynthesis and decrease their cholesterol content in a Ch25h-dependent manner. Enforcement of increased macrophage cholesterol content after LPS stimulation is sufficient to drive inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production. Cholesterol-dependent inflammasome activation unexpectedly requires the cytosolic DNA sensor AIM2. Metabolic studies reveal that Ch25h−/− and cholesterol-loaded macrophages have impaired mitochondrial respiration and membrane polarization. This results in increased cytosolic mtDNA content and depletion of mtDNA reduces cholesterol-dependent IL-1β release. Finally, we find that Ch25h/Aim2 double deficiency reverses inflammasome activation caused by Ch25h deficiency. These findings suggest that macrophage upregulation of 25-HC after pathogen recognition prevents cholesterol-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and spurious crosstalk between mtDNA and the inflammasome. Ch25h−/− BMDMs overproduce IL-1β in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection and show increased control of intracellular bacterial growth (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To determine whether these responses were due to increased inflammasome activity, we generated Ch25h−/−Asc−/− mice. BMDMs from these mice and controls were treated with carrier (ethanol) or 25-HC (1 μM) and infected with L. monocytogenes for 24 hr. Ch25h−/−Asc+/+ BMDMs had increased production of IL-1β, which could be inhibited by addition of 25-HC as expected (Figure 1A) (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, in the setting of ASC deficiency, Ch25h−/− BMDMs showed no elevation in extracellular IL-1β and 25-HC addition to these cultures did not reduce IL-1β levels (Figure 1B). We also observed decreased L. monocytogenes colony-forming units (CFUs) in Ch25h−/−Asc+/+ BMDMs, which could be rescued by the addition of 25-HC (Figure 1C). Asc−/− BMDMs showed an overall increase in L. monocytogenes CFUs, and the protective effect of Ch25h deficiency was lost (Figure 1D). In previous work, we demonstrated that Ch25h−/− BMDMs overproduced IL-1β following exposure to LPS and the NLRP3 inflammasome activator ATP (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, LPS+ATP-treated Ch25h−/− cells produced more IL-1β than control cells (Figure 1E). However, in the setting of Asc−/−, neither Ch25h genotype produced detectable IL-1β, ruling out the possibility that the increased cytokine production by Ch25h−/− cells was due to passive loss of membrane integrity (Figure 1E). These data support a model in which IL-1β overproduction and decreased bacterial replication in Ch25h−/− BMDMs are due to increased activity of ASC-dependent inflammasomes. These observations led us to more deeply explore how Ch25h acts to restrain inflammasome activity. Type I IFN has been described to repress the SREBP2 pathway in macrophages (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, York et al., 2015York A.G. Williams K.J. Argus J.P. Zhou Q.D. Brar G. Vergnes L. Gray E.E. Zhen A. Wu N.C. Yamada D.H. et al.Limiting cholesterol biosynthetic flux spontaneously engages type I IFN signaling.Cell. 2015; 163: 1716-1729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but it is not clear to what extent this process depends on 25-HC. We therefore performed time-course analyses of cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme mRNA expression in control and Ch25h−/− BMDMs after stimulation with LPS. As expected, Ch25h transcript levels peaked ∼4 hr post-LPS stimulation and subsequently declined (Figure 2A) (Cyster et al., 2014Cyster J.G. Dang E.V. Reboldi A. Yi T. 25-Hydroxycholesterols in innate and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 731-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similar Ch25h induction kinetics was observed following L. monocytogenes infection (Figure S1A). The sterol biosynthetic enzymes Hmgcs1, Lss, Dhcr24, and Sqle were initially repressed 2 hr post-LPS, regardless of the genetic status of Ch25h (Figure 2A). However, by 8 hr of LPS stimulation, Ch25h−/− BMDMs showed increased expression of sterol biosynthetic enzyme mRNAs (Figure 2A). Overexpression of these mRNAs was also observed after 8 hr of L. monocytogenes infection (Figure S1B). These data suggest that Ch25h is induced in macrophages by bacterial sensing and acts to repress sterol biosynthetic enzyme expression. However, Ch25h is not required for initial shutdown of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway but instead enforces sustained repression.Figure S1Listeria Infection and In Vivo LPS Injection Cause Dysregulated Cholesterol Synthesis in Ch25h−/− BMDM and mTORC1 Dependence of LPS-Induced S6 Phosphorylation in BMDMs, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) qRT-qPCR analysis of Ch25h mRNA in Ch25h+/−, Ch25h−/−, or Ifnar1−/− BMDMs infected with L. monocytogenes (MOI = 10:1) for 0, 4, or 8 hr.

As a second approach to determine whether Ch25h represses cholesterol biosynthesis in activated macrophages, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for sterol biosynthetic intermediates after 8 hr of LPS treatment. Ch25h−/− BMDMs showed the expected reduction in 25-HC but increased levels of desmosterol, lanosterol, and 7-dehydrocholesterol, indicating that Ch25h acts to repress cholesterol biosynthesis pathway activity (Figure 2B). We next tested whether cholesterol content itself was altered in Ch25h−/− macrophages. Using a cholesterol fluorescence assay, Ch25h−/− BMDMs showed an initial increase in total cholesterol content compared to wild-type cells (Figure 2C). LPS stimulation resulted in decreased cholesterol content in both genotypes by 4 hr, whereas only Ch25h−/− cells showed an increase in total cholesterol by 8 hr (Figure 2C). Similarly, staining with filipin, a fluorescent cholesterol-binding antibiotic, showed higher fluorescence intensity in 8-hr LPS-activated Ch25h−/− macrophages (Figure 2D). LC-MS analysis confirmed the increased cholesterol content (Figure 2E). To determine whether Ch25h−/− macrophages increase their cholesterol in vivo, we injected mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with LPS and sorted peritoneal macrophages after 8 hr. LPS caused Ch25h−/− macrophages to increase their cholesterol content, whereas cholesterol levels in controls remained constant (Figure S1C). The increased expression of SREBP2-responsive genes between 4 and 8 hr of LPS exposure in the Ch25h−/− setting suggested that there is a latent positive drive for cholesterol synthesis that is limited by 25-HC. mTORC1 signaling has been shown to drive SREBP1 and SREBP2 activation and is activated by TLR stimulation (Düvel et al., 2010Düvel K. Yecies J.L. Menon S. Raman P. Lipovsky A.I. Souza A.L. Triantafellow E. Ma Q. Gorski R. Cleaver S. et al.Activation of a metabolic gene regulatory network downstream of mTOR complex 1.Mol.

SREBP activity is regulated by mTORC1 and contributes to Akt-dependent cell growth.Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 224-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether this pathway was active in LPS-stimulated BMDMs. Phospho-flow cytometry for total S6K1, pS6K1 (Thr389), and pS6 (Ser240/244) showed that LPS stimulation resulted in a time-dependent increase in mTORC1 activity (Figure 2F). We confirmed that S6 phosphorylation during LPS stimulation was mTORC1 dependent, since it was prevented by rapamycin treatment (Figure S1D). Consistent with mTORC1 activity driving SREBP2 activation, the augmented expression of Hmgcs1 mRNA in Ch25h−/− cells was largely prevented by rapamycin (Figure 2G). Moreover, in accord with a connection between SREBP activity and IL-1β production (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), rapamycin reversed the overproduction of IL-1β in response to ATP in LPS-stimulated Ch25h−/− macrophages while having a minimal effect on IL-1β production by Ch25h+/− cells (Figure 2H). Taken together, these data indicate that Ch25h/25-HC are required in 8-hr LPS-activated macrophages to antagonize mTORC1-induced SREBP2 pathway activity and prevent cholesterol over-accumulation. To determine whether increased cholesterol biosynthesis can be linked to inflammasome activation, we used a retrovirus system to transduce cDNAs expressing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (Hmgcr) and dehydrocholesterol 24-reductase (Dhcr24), enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, into BMDMs. Using a fluorescent peptide that acts as a reporter for caspase-1 activity, we found that overexpression of either of these cDNAs resulted in increased inflammasome activity after 8 hr of LPS stimulation (Figure 3A). Inflammasome activation in mouse macrophages typically requires addition of a “second signal” (such as ATP) to engage an inflammasome sensor protein (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016Rathinam V.A.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Inflammasome complexes: emerging mechanisms and effector functions.Cell. 2016; 165: 792-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, the effect of increased expression of Hmgcr and Dhcr24 mRNAs on caspase-1 was observed in the absence of an exogenous second signal. Attempts to measure IL-1β in the LPS-stimulated macrophage supernatant by ELISA were unsuccessful, consistent with a low amount of inflammasome activity. We therefore used an IL-17A-based IL-1β bioassay (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) to test whether cholesterol synthesis could drive inflammasome activation. Supernatants from BMDMs transduced with either Hmgcr or Dhcr24 had augmented capacity to stimulate IL-17A production from T cells, whereas this capacity was lost in the setting of ASC deficiency (Figure 3B). To determine whether cholesterol itself was involved in driving inflammasome activity, we treated BMDMs with LPS and cholesterol that had been solubilized by forming complexes with the carrier methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) at a 25:1 ratio of MCD/cholesterol (MCD-chol). Strikingly, treatment of LPS activated macrophages with 100 μg/mL MCD-chol, a concentration typical of other studies (Robinson et al., 2014Robinson L.E. Shridar M. Smith P. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Plasma membrane cholesterol as a regulator of human and rodent P2X7 receptor activation and sensitization.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 31983-31994Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, York et al., 2015York A.G. Williams K.J. Argus J.P. Zhou Q.D. Brar G. Vergnes L. Gray E.E. Zhen A. Wu N.C. Yamada D.H. et al.Limiting cholesterol biosynthetic flux spontaneously engages type I IFN signaling.Cell. 2015; 163: 1716-1729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), was sufficient to promote IL-1β production as measured by ELISA (Figure 3C). A 10-fold lower dose of MCD-chol also triggered IL-1β production as detected using the IL-1β bioassay (Figure 3D). Previous work has suggested that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by cholesterol crystals in macrophages (Franklin et al., 2016Franklin B.S. Mangan M.S. Latz E. Crystal formation in inflammation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34: 173-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether our observed IL-1β release in response to MCD-chol was due to crystal formation, we noted that crystalline inflammasome activators depend on phagocytic uptake (Hornung et al., 2008Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). We treated LPS-activated BMDMs with cytochalasin D to inhibit actin polymerization and challenged them with MCD-chol, ATP, or alum. Whereas IL-1β release by the crystalline activator alum was blocked by cytochalasin D treatment, IL-1β release in response to MCD-chol or ATP was unaffected, providing evidence that MCD-chol is acting in a soluble fashion (Figure 3E). To determine whether 25-HC can prevent cholesterol-dependent IL-1β release, we reconstituted Ch25h−/− BMDMs with wild-type Ch25h, a mutant Ch25h that cannot synthesize 25-HC (Reboldi et al., 2014Reboldi A. Dang E.V. McDonald J.G. Liang G. Russell D.W. Cyster J.G. Inflammation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol suppresses interleukin-1-driven inflammation downstream of type I interferon.Science. 2014; 345: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), or empty vector. Overexpression of Ch25h could repress the sterol biosynthesis enzyme Sqle mRNA, whereas vector and Ch25hmut had no effect, confirming the functional status of these constructs (Figure S2A). We found that while overexpression of Ch25h had a small capacity to diminish IL-1β release in response to ATP, it more substantially reduced the capacity of MCD-chol to stimulate IL-1β release, whereas Ch25hmut had no effect (Figure 3F). In addition to its ability to inhibit SREBP2 activation, 25-HC could possibly protect cells from cholesterol overloading by acting as an LXR agonist. Reconstitution of LXRα/β double-knockout BMDMs with wild-type versus mutant Ch25h showed the same repressive effect on MCD-chol-dependent IL-1β release, suggesting that this phenomenon does not involve LXRs (Figure S2B). These observations provide further evidence that a key function of Ch25h/25-HC induction in activated macrophages is to prevent cholesterol-dependent IL-1β production. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) have been implicated as activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to a diverse range of stimuli (Zhou et al., 2011Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J. A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nature. 2011; 469: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar). Additionally, diseases associated with cholesterol dysregulation have been shown to induce mtROS (Kennedy et al., 2014Kennedy B.E. Madreiter C.T. Vishnu N. Malli R. Graier W.F. Karten B. Adaptations of energy metabolism associated with increased levels of mitochondrial cholesterol in Niemann-Pick type C1-deficient cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16278-16289Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether mtROS induction could be responsible for cholesterol-dependent IL-1β production. While LPS plus ATP treatment increased mtROS as expected (Yu et al., 2014Yu J. Nagasu H. Murakami T. Hoang H. Broderick L. Hoffman H.M. Horng T. Inflammasome activation leads to caspase-1-dependent mitochondrial damage and block of mitophagy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 15514-15519Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2011Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J. A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nature. 2011; 469: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar) Ch25h−/− BMDMs had heightened mtROS production compared to control BMDMs (Figure 4A). Retroviral reconstitution of Ch25h−/− BMDMs with Ch25h reduced mtROS, whereas Ch25hmut showed no effect (Figure 4B). Treatment of Ch25h+/− and Ch25h−/− BMDMs with the mtROS scavenger MitoTEMPO inhibited IL-1β in both genotypes (Figure S3A). Furthermore, treatment of uninfected BMDMs with LPS plus MCD-chol resulted in increased mtROS compared to LPS alone, consistent with data suggesting that elevated cholesterol content can cause mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure 4C). Moreover, using a 293T NLRP3 inflammasome reconstitution system, we found that SREBP2 overexpression was capable of promoting IL-1β cleavage and release (Figures S3B–S3D). Combined, these observations suggested that IL-1β release by macrophages following cholesterol accumulation would occur via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Surprisingly, however, BMDMs lacking NLRP3 had no defect in IL-1β production in response to LPS plus MCD-chol treatment, whereas these cells failed to respond to LPS plus ATP (Figure 4D).Figure S3MitoTempo Represses ATP-Induced IL-1b Processing in BMDM and SREBP2 Drives NLRP3 Activation in a 293T Inflammasome Reconstitution System, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Immunoblot for IL-1β on cell pellets and trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitated supernatants from Ch25h+/− and Ch25h−/− BMDMs treated with LPS alone, LPS+ATP, or LPS+ATP+MitoTEMPO.

Traditional evolution techniques typically produce AARSs with greatly reduced activity and selectivity compared to their wild-type counterparts. We designed phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) selections to rapidly produce highly active and selective orthogonal AARSs through hundreds of generations of evolution. PACE of a chimeric Methanosarcina spp. pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) improved its enzymatic efficiency (kcat/KMtRNA) 45-fold compared to the parent enzyme. Transplantation of the evolved mutations into other PylRS-derived synthetases improved yields of proteins containing noncanonical residues up to 9.7-fold. Simultaneous positive and negative selection PACE over 48 h greatly improved the selectivity of a promiscuous Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase variant for site-specific incorporation of p-iodo-L-phenylalanine. These findings offer new AARSs that increase the utility of orthogonal translation systems and establish the capability of PACE to efficiently evolve orthogonal AARSs with high activity and amino acid specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2763332188,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are ∼100 MDa transport channels assembled from multiple copies of ∼30 nucleoporins (Nups). One-third of these Nups contain phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-rich repeats, forming a diffusion barrier, which is selectively permeable for nuclear transport receptors that interact with these repeats. Here, we identify an additional function of FG repeats in the structure and biogenesis of the yeast NPC. We demonstrate that GLFG-containing FG repeats directly bind to multiple scaffold Nups in vitro and act as NPC-targeting determinants in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the GLFG repeats of Nup116 function in a redundant manner with Nup188, a nonessential scaffold Nup, to stabilize critical interactions within the NPC scaffold needed for late steps of NPC assembly. Our results reveal a previously unanticipated structural role for natively unfolded GLFG repeats as Velcro to link NPC subcomplexes and thus add a new layer of connections to current models of the NPC architecture."

Their findings suggest that NK cells are specifically recruited to follicles in AGMs and regulate SIV replication in the lymph node. Natural killer (NK) cells play an essential role in antiviral immunity, but knowledge of their function in secondary lymphoid organs is incomplete. Lymph node follicles constitute a major viral reservoir during infections with HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac). In contrast, during nonpathogenic infection with SIV from African green monkeys (SIVagm), follicles remain generally virus free. We show that NK cells in secondary lymphoid organs from chronically SIVagm-infected African green monkeys (AGMs) were frequently CXCR5+ and entered and persisted in lymph node follicles throughout the follow-up (240 d post-infection). These follicles were strongly positive for IL-15, which was primarily presented in its membrane-bound form by follicular dendritic cells. NK cell depletion through treatment with anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody during chronic SIVagm infection resulted in high viral replication rates in follicles and the T cell zone and increased viral DNA in lymph nodes. Our data suggest that, in nonpathogenic SIV infection, NK cells migrate into follicles and play a major role in viral reservoir control in lymph nodes."
https://openalex.org/W2763090644,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is becoming the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries, and limited therapeutic options are available. Here we uncovered a role for intestinal hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in hepatic steatosis. Human-intestine biopsies from individuals with or without obesity revealed that intestinal HIF-2α signaling was positively correlated with body-mass index and hepatic toxicity. The causality of this correlation was verified in mice with an intestine-specific disruption of Hif2a, in which high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis and obesity were substantially lower as compared to control mice. PT2385, a HIF-2α-specific inhibitor, had preventive and therapeutic effects on metabolic disorders that were dependent on intestine HIF-2α. Intestine HIF-2α inhibition markedly reduced intestine and serum ceramide levels. Mechanistically, intestine HIF-2α regulates ceramide metabolism mainly from the salvage pathway, by positively regulating the expression of Neu3, the gene encoding neuraminidase 3. These results suggest that intestinal HIF-2α could be a viable target for hepatic steatosis therapy."

A mouse model that recapitulates key histopathological features of human melanomagenesis was created by inducing a BRafV600E-driven melanomagenic program in tail interfollicular melanocytes. Most targeted mature, melanin-producing melanocytes expanded clonally within the epidermis before losing their differentiated features through transcriptional reprogramming and eventually invading the dermis. Tumors did not form within interscales, which contain both mature and dormant amelanotic melanocytes. The hair follicle bulge, which contains melanocyte stem cells, was also refractory to melanomagenesis. These studies identify varying tumor susceptibilities within the melanocytic lineage, highlighting pigment-producing cells as the melanoma cell of origin, and indicate that regional variation in tumor predisposition is dictated by microenvironmental cues rather than intrinsic differences in cellular origin.

Critically, this work provides in vivo evidence that differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed into cancer initiating cells. Identification of the cancer cell of origin is a critical step toward earlier detection of malignancies, better prediction of tumor behavior, and development of preventive therapies. Cutaneous melanoma is the leading cause of death from diseases of the skin. One way to reduce the morbidity and mortality from cutaneous melanoma is diagnosis at an early stage when the prognosis for cure by surgical removal is excellent. There is indeed much evidence that thin melanomas have a favorable prognosis (Balch et al., 2001Balch C.M. Buzaid A.C. Soong S.J. Atkins M.B. Cascinelli N. Coit D.G. Fleming I.D. Gershenwald J.E. Houghton Jr., A. Kirkwood J.M. et al.Final version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for cutaneous melanoma.J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 3635-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Identifying and characterizing the melanoma cell-of-origin will not only help identifying markers for early detection but also elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying melanoma plasticity and intra-tumor heterogeneity, which, in turn, should help understand tumor cell responses to clinical treatments, drug resistance, tumor relapse, and metastatic spread. All melanocytic neoplasms, ranging from benign lesions (or neavi) to malignant melanomas, originate from the neural-crest-derived melanocytic lineage. During embryonic development, melanoblasts, the precursors of differentiated melanocytes, colonize the skin and few other tissues throughout the body (Mort et al., 2015Mort R.L. Jackson I.J. Patton E.E. The melanocyte lineage in development and disease.Development. 2015; 142: 1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In human skin, the vast majority of melanocytes reside at the dermo-epidermal junction, where their main function is to provide melanin pigment to their neighboring keratinocytes. Similarly, the murine tail contains interfollicular (IF) melanocytes and a pigmented IF epidermis. Both mouse and human melanocytes also colonize hair follicles (HFs), where they contribute melanin to the hair shaft (Mort et al., 2015Mort R.L. Jackson I.J. Patton E.E. The melanocyte lineage in development and disease.Development. 2015; 142: 1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The HF undergoes cyclic expansion (anagen) and regression (catagen) in response to normal growth or as a stress response following hair removal. During the catagen phase, virtually all differentiated, pigmented melanocytes are eliminated by apoptosis. During the anagen phase, there is expansion of the melanocyte pool from the non-pigment-producing melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) that are located in the hair bulge and differentiation of the transient amplifying cells into melanin-producing melanocytes, which repopulate the lower HF or matrix. HF MSCs can be stimulated by wound healing or ultraviolet radiation to migrate to the IF epidermis and differentiate into pigment-producing melanocytes (Chou et al., 2013Chou W.C. Takeo M. Rabbani P. Hu H. Lee W. Chung Y.R. Carucci J. Overbeek P. Ito M. Direct migration of follicular melanocyte stem cells to the epidermis after wounding or UVB irradiation is dependent on Mc1r signaling.Nat.

Dominant role of the niche in melanocyte stem-cell fate determination.Nature. 2002; 416: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrated that HFs are not the only source of IF melanocytes (Glover et al., 2015Glover J.D. Knolle S. Wells K.L. Liu D. Jackson I.J. Mort R.L. Headon D.J. Maintenance of distinct melanocyte populations in the interfollicular epidermis.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2015; 28: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mouse tail skin lacking appendages does maintain a stable number of melanocytes, including a low frequency (1.5% of the total melanocyte population) of amelanotic melanocytes, into adult life (Glover et al., 2015Glover J.D. Knolle S. Wells K.L. Liu D. Jackson I.J. Mort R.L. Headon D.J. Maintenance of distinct melanocyte populations in the interfollicular epidermis.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2015; 28: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these amelanotic melanocytes may serve as a reservoir used for repopulation upon large scale melanocyte loss and therefore function as IF MSCs (Glover et al., 2015Glover J.D. Knolle S. Wells K.L. Liu D. Jackson I.J. Mort R.L. Headon D.J. Maintenance of distinct melanocyte populations in the interfollicular epidermis.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2015; 28: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whether, just like in the HF bulge, IF melanocyte and keratinocyte stem cells share a common niche is unknown. Importantly, recognition of these distinct melanocyte cell populations and their potential for different behaviors also raises major questions about their respective roles in melanomagenesis. In particular, whether (hair follicle bulge and IF) melanocyte stem cells and/or mature pigment-producing melanocytes are equally competent for tumorigenesis is unknown (Boiko et al., 2010Boiko A.D. Razorenova O.V. van de Rijn M. Swetter S.M. Johnson D.L. Ly D.P. Butler P.D. Yang G.P. Joshua B.

Here, we used mouse genetics, lineage-tracing approaches, time-lapse imaging, and single-cell profiling techniques to identify the cell of origin of BRAFV600E-induced melanoma and study the temporal morphological and molecular changes that occur in tumor-initiating cells from the first oncogenic hit to the development of invasive melanoma. Our studies identify varying tumor susceptibilities among the different melanocytic lineage subpopulations in the mouse skin, unexpectedly highlighting mature pigment-producing cells as “hot spots” for tumor initiation. HFs are well-recognized reservoirs of both MSCs and their differentiated progeny. To determine whether HF MSCs and their progeny are similarly competent to induce melanoma formation, we expressed BRafV600E, the most prevalent mutation in human melanoma, in both melanocytic compartments. We used mice expressing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)-inducible form of Cre under the control of the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter, designated Tyr::CreERT2/+ (Bosenberg et al., 2006Bosenberg M. Muthusamy V. Curley D.P. Wang Z. Hobbs C. Nelson B. Nogueira C. Horner 2nd, J.W. Depinho R. Chin L. Characterization of melanocyte-specific inducible Cre recombinase transgenic mice.Genesis. 2006; 44: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This particular allele was chosen because its ability to drive Cre-dependent recombination in both bulge MSCs and all of their progeny upon topical application of 4-HT to dorsal skin had previously been suggested based on long-term lineage-tracing experiments (Bosenberg et al., 2006Bosenberg M.

Accordingly, genetic ablation of Sox10 in adult mice using this particular allele led to a permanent reduction in the number of MSCs and an inability of remaining MSCs to fully replenish the bulb melanocyte population in newly generated hairs, thus unambiguously demonstrating efficient Cre-mediated locus recombination in the MSC compartment (Harris et al., 2013Harris M.L.

The Tyr::CreERT2/+ mice were crossed to mice carrying a conditional BRafV600E allele (BRafCA/+), which expresses BRafV600E only after 4-HT administration (Dankort et al., 2007Dankort D. Filenova E.

Because loss-of-function of Pten, an event commonly seen in BRAFV600E mutant human melanomas, is required to initiate full-blown melanomagenesis (Damsky et al., 2011Damsky W.E. Curley D.P.

In order to fate map the cells that undergo Cre-mediated recombination, we crossed these compound mice with mice carrying two different inducible ROSA26R promoter-driven reporter alleles, the YFP (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S.

Tracing the fate of limbal epithelial progenitor cells in the murine cornea.Stem Cells. 2015; 33: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we generated homozygous Confetti mice (Tyr::CreERT2/+; BRafCA/+; Ptenl/l; ROSA26RLSL-Confetti/LSL-Confetti hereafter BRaf/Pten/Confetti) expressing 2 color tags per cell. Five days after depilation, the dorsal skin of adult BRaf/Pten/Reporter mice was treated with 4-HT (Figure 1A). At this time point, HFs contain both bulge amelanotic melanocytes and their progeny, including melanin-producing melanocytes in the lower HF region or matrix (Müller-Röver et al., 2001Müller-Röver S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. A comprehensive guide for the accurate classification of murine hair follicles in distinct hair cycle stages.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, macroscopic melanoma lesions appeared within 5 weeks post-4-HT exposure (Damsky et al., 2011Damsky W.E. Curley D.P. Santhanakrishnan M. Rosenbaum L.E. Platt J.T. Gould Rothberg B.E. Taketo M.M. Dankort D. Rimm D.L. McMahon M. Bosenberg M. β-catenin signaling controls metastasis in Braf-activated Pten-deficient melanomas.Cancer Cell. 2011; 20: 741-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Prior to this, at 7 days post-4-HT exposure, reporter gene expression was only detected in HFs (Figure 1B). Clonal expansion was clearly visible in multiple HFs and appeared confined to the lower HF region, eventually leading to the rupture of HFs and dissemination of melanoma cells into the dermis (Figure 1B). Experiments performed with BRaf/Pten/Confetti mice demonstrated the multiclonal nature of these lesions (Figure 1B). A detailed kinetic analysis was performed on BRaf/Pten/tdTomato mouse background. As described above, the Tyr::CreERT2/+ allele was previously shown to drive recombination in both bulge MSCs and all of their progeny (Bosenberg et al., 2006Bosenberg M. Muthusamy V. Curley D.P. Wang Z. Hobbs C. Nelson B. Nogueira C. Horner 2nd, J.W. Depinho R. Chin L. Characterization of melanocyte-specific inducible Cre recombinase transgenic mice.Genesis. 2006; 44: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, because the efficiency of the CreER recombinase varies substantially with different combinations of CreER source and loxP target (i.e., reporter allele chosen), the genetic background of the mice and the level and timing of 4-HT exposure, we carefully quantified the activity of the Cre-driver in the entire melanocytic lineage on the BRaf/Pten/tdTomato background. Importantly, shortly after CreER induction, the frequency of tdTomato-positive cells in the upper (bulge) and lower (matrix) HF melanocytic compartments was comparable (Figures 1C and 1D). A PCR-based approach further demonstrated that Cre-mediated recombination at both the BRafCA and Pten loci was as efficient in the bulge compartment as in the entire melanocytic lineage (Figures S2B and S2C). Consistent with a high efficiency of targeting at both loci, expression of phosphorylated Erk (P-Erk) and Akt (P-Akt) was systematically detected in the bulge compartment of BRaf/Pten/tdTomato, but not wild-type, mice 3–5 days following 4-HT exposure (Figure S2D). Unexpectedly, and despite the above-described evidence of activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling, the number of reporter-positive cells remains constant in the bulge region over the course of the experiment (Figure 1E). In contrast, clonal expansion was observed from day 5 onward in the lower HF region (Figure 1E), a compartment that only contains differentiated, melanin-pigment-producing cells. Accordingly, expression of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation, was only detected in the lower HF, but not in the bulge (Figure 1F). These data indicated that melanocytes located in the bulge are resistant to BRafV600E-induced melanoma formation. To further substantiate this finding, we activated the melanomagenic program specifically in the bulge compartment by treating the animals with 4-HT at P20, when HFs are in the first telogen phase and thought to contain exclusively quiescent bulge MSCs (Müller-Röver et al., 2001Müller-Röver S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. A comprehensive guide for the accurate classification of murine hair follicles in distinct hair cycle stages.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although reporter-positive cells were readily detectable in the bulge compartment 2 days following 4-HT treatment, there was no evidence of expansion of the targeted cells (none of the 30 tdTomato-positive HFs exhibited more than 3 tdTomato-positive cells in the bulge; n = 3 mice) up to 13 days following induction (Figure S3). Depilation removes the hair shafts, which contain all pigmented matrix melanocytes, and thereby synchronizes the HF in the telogen phase (Müller-Röver et al., 2001Müller-Röver S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. A comprehensive guide for the accurate classification of murine hair follicles in distinct hair cycle stages.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure also stimulates telogen HFs to enter anagen by removing an inner bulge layer of cells that maintain immature melanocyte stem cells, located in the outer bulger layer, in a quiescent state (Hsu et al., 2011Hsu Y.-C. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Dynamics between stem cells, niche, and progeny in the hair follicle.Cell. 2011; 144: 92-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to target specifically activated bulge melanocytes by exposing BRaf/Pten/tdTomato mice (age 49 days) to 4-HT immediately after depilation (Figure 1G). 54% of telogen HFs contained tdTomato-positive cells within their bulge (27 out of 50 HFs; n = 3) 2 days post-4-HT exposure. There was no evidence of proliferation nor of clonal expansion of cells within the bulge (0 out of 50; n = 3) up to 12 days post-treatment. In contrast, clonal expansion and evidence of cell proliferation were seen in 84% (42 out of 50; n = 3) of HFs containing tdTomato-positive cells within their bulge, but only in the lower HF region and 5 (and 12) days post-treatment (Figure 1H). These data are consistent with the HF bulge microenvironment being refractory to BRafV600E-driven tumor initiation and indicate that melanoma lesions can originate from bulge melanocytes but only after these cells have migrated out of the bulge niche and reached the lower HF region as mature melanogenic melanocytes. Because BRaf/Pten back-skin melanomas lack epidermal involvement (Figure S4), and HF involvement is seen only rarely in human melanoma, the clinical relevance of the above-described model of melanoma remains limited. Because the vast majority of human melanoma arises from melanoma in situ, an early stage of melanomagenesis in which transforming melanocytes proliferate in an irregular pattern entirely within the interfollicular-epidermis (IFE), it has been postulated that the cell of origin of most human melanomas may reside in the IFE (Shain and Bastian, 2016Shain A.H. Bastian B.C. From melanocytes to melanomas.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Similarly to human skin, and unlike dorsal skin, mouse tail skin contains interfollicular melanocytes. We therefore sought to induce the BRafV600E-dependent melanomagenic program in tail IF melanocytes. Lineage tracing experiments in BRaf/Pten/YFP mice demonstrated that the topical application of a low dose of 4-HT on the mouse tail permits targeting of the IF melanocytic compartment at clonal density and eventually the development of tail melanomas (Figures 2A–2C). Interfollicular BRaf/Pten/YFP mutant cells expanded radially in the epidermis to form lesions that resembled human in situ melanomas (Figure 2D). In this radial growth phase (RGP), primary melanoma cells, which still rely on growth factors produced by the surrounding keratinocytes, proliferate above the epidermal basement membrane and are strictly confined to the epidermis. At later time points (1.5–2 months post-4-HT), multifocal dermal invasions of atypical melanoma cells became apparent. This is reminiscent of the human invasive RGP (iRGP) melanomas, a stage in which individual or small clusters of melanoma cells invade shallowly into the superficial reticular dermis and have little or no initial capacity for proliferation (Figure 2D). After 2–2.5 months, dermally invasive and S100-positive melanomas were observed that resembled human vertical growth phase (VGP) lesions (Figure 2D). VGP defines tumors that acquire proliferative capacity and grow vertically, filling the papillary dermis. Thus, the application of low dose 4-HT to the tails of Tyr::CreERT2/+; BRafCA/+; Ptenl/l mice initiates a sequence of events that recapitulate the characteristic bi-phasic growth pattern and key histological features observed during development of the most common histogenetic subtypes of human melanoma (Clark et al., 1975Clark Jr., W.H. Ainsworth A.M. Bernardino E.A. Yang C.H. Mihm Jr., C.M. Reed R.J. The developmental biology of primary human malignant melanomas.Semin. Oncol. 1975; 2: 83-103PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse tail IFE contains both mature, pigment-producing melanocytes and a low frequency of amelanotic melanocytes, which may serve as reservoirs of interfollicular MSCs (Glover et al., 2015Glover J.D. Knolle S. Wells K.L. Liu D. Jackson I.J. Mort R.L. Headon D.J. Maintenance of distinct melanocyte populations in the interfollicular epidermis.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2015; 28: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To assess whether the amelanotic tail compartment is efficiently targeted by the Tyr::CreERT2 allele, we performed lineage tracing at homeostasis by generating Tyr::CreERT2/+; ROSA26RLSL-tdTomato/+ mice and painting their tails with 4-HT. We performed immunofluorescence analysis on tail sections using an antibody directed against gp100, a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in pigment-producing but not in amelanotic melanocytes. tdTomato/gp100-double positive cells and tdTomato-positive/gp100-negative cells were identified post-4-HT exposure indicating that the Tyr::CreERT2 allele is capable of driving Cre-mediated recombination in both interfollicular melanocytic subpopulations (Figure S5A). The tail epidermis is divided into two distinct compartments, scale (K10-negative) and interscale (K10-positive) (Didierjean et al., 1983Didierjean L. Wrench R. Saurat J.H.

Dermatol. 1977; 69: 198-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas few (on average 7.5 cells out of 43.7 per tail unit; 10 units were analyzed; n = 3) tdTomato/gp100-double positive cells were identified in the interscale hinges, the majority (on average 34.9 cells out of 43.7 per tail unit; 10 units were analyzed; n = 3) of these cells are located within the scale regions. In contrast, all tdTomato-positive tdTomato-positive/gp100-negative amelanotic cells (on average 1.3 cells out of 43.7 per tail unit; 10 units were analyzed, n = 3) were detected in the interscales (Figures S5B and S5C). To further substantiate this regionalized cell distribution, we used the iDct-GFP mouse model, which allowed doxycycline-inducible expression of H2BGFP in all melanocytic compartments of the HF including MSCs and all their descendants (Zaidi et al., 2011Zaidi M.R. Hornyak T.J. Merlino G. A genetically engineered mouse model with inducible GFP expression in melanocytes.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2011; 24: 393-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, this model permits long-term lineage tracing at single-cell resolution and quantification of the proliferation history in vivo from the amount of H2BGFP fluorescence retained in cells following injection of a single intraperitoneal dose (pulse) of doxycycline (Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T.

Tumbar T. Quantitative proliferation dynamics and random chromosome segregation of hair follicle stem cells.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Whole-mount tail epidermis demonstrated that H2BGFP-positive cells were detected in both scale (K10-negative) and (K10-positive) interscale compartments (Figure 3B). Importantly, both gp100-positive melanin-producing melanocytes and gp100-negative amelanotic cells could be labeled using this approach (Figure 3C) and, consistent with the tdTomato-lineage tracing experiment, all H2BGFP-positive gp100-negative cells were located in the interscale hinges (Figure 3C). Thus, in contrast to their pigment-producing counterparts, amelanotic melanocytes exclusively localize to interscales. Long-term pulse chase experiments showed that the intensity of GFP-positivity within scales varied from cell to cell from 2 months post-doxycycline exposure onward, indicating that these cells completed a varying number of cell divisions (Figure 3D). The number of GFP-positive cells within scales gradually decreased over the next few months with only very few positive cells remaining 9 months post-doxycycline exposure (Figures 3D and 3E). This observation indicated that the pigment-producing gp100-positive scale melanocytes are slow dividing cells. In contrast, the number of GFP-positive gp100-negative cells within the interscales (on average 1.1 cells per tail unit, 30 units were analyzed; n = 3) remained constant over the entire duration of the experiment (Figures 3E and 3F). Thus, during homeostasis, in contrast to their comparatively more rapidly dividing neighbors, the interscale amelanotic cells represent a quiescent and constant cell population. We next asked whether these two distinct IF melanocytic subpopulations are both competent to induce melanoma formation. Lineage tracing experiments confirmed that amelanotic (gp100-negative) and melanin-producing melanocytes (gp100-positive) compartments are both targeted on the BRaf/Pten/Reporter backgrounds (Figure 4A and data not shown). Critically, evidence of clonal expansion of reporter-positive cells was only readily detectable within K10-negative scales. In contrast, the number of reporter-positive cells remained constant within the interscale hinges (Figure 4B). Consistently, expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 was only detected in scale, and not in interscale, reporter-positive cells (data not shown). In keeping with their gp100-immunoreactivity, scale reporter-positive cells exhibited the characteristic dendritic"
https://openalex.org/W2760978152,"Human brain evolution is associated with expansion and folding of the neocortex. Increased diversity in neural progenitor (NP) populations (such as basally located radial glia [RG], which reside in an enlarged outer subventricular zone [OSVZ]) likely contributes to this evolutionary expansion, although their characteristics and relative contributions are only partially understood. Through single-cell transcriptional profiling of sorted human NP subpopulations, we identified the primate-specific TMEM14B gene as a marker of basal RG. Expression of TMEM14B in embryonic NPs induces cortical thickening and gyrification in postnatal mice. This is accompanied by SVZ expansion, the appearance of outer RG-like cells, and the proliferation of multiple NP subsets, with proportional increases in all cortical layers and normal lamination. TMEM14B drives NP proliferation by increasing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IQGAP1, which in turn promotes G1/S cell cycle transitions. These data show that a single primate-specific gene can drive neurodevelopmental changes that contribute to brain evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2764295362,"Melanoma is one of the deadliest cancers, yet the cells of origin and mechanisms of tumor initiation remain unclear. The majority of melanomas emerge from clear skin without a precursor lesion, but it is unknown whether these melanomas can arise from melanocyte stem cells (MCSCs). Here we employ mouse models to define the role of MCSCs as melanoma cells of origin, demonstrate that MCSC quiescence acts as a tumor suppressor, and identify the extrinsic environmental and molecular factors required for the critical early steps of melanoma initiation. Specifically, melanomas originate from melanoma-competent MCSCs upon stimulation by UVB, which induces MCSC activation and translocation via an inflammation-dependent process. Moreover, the chromatin-remodeling factor Hmga2 in the skin plays a critical role in UVB-mediated melanomagenesis. These findings delineate melanoma formation from melanoma-competent MCSCs following extrinsic stimuli, and they suggest that abrogation of Hmga2 function in the microenvironment can suppress MCSC-originating cutaneous melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2764065365,"Cross-talk among oncogenic signaling and metabolic pathways may create opportunities for new therapeutic strategies in cancer. Here we show that although acute inhibition of EGFR-driven glucose metabolism induces only minimal cell death, it lowers the apoptotic threshold in a subset of patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that after attenuated glucose consumption, Bcl-xL blocks cytoplasmic p53 from triggering intrinsic apoptosis. Consequently, targeting of EGFR-driven glucose metabolism in combination with pharmacological stabilization of p53 with the brain-penetrant small molecule idasanutlin resulted in synthetic lethality in orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft models. Notably, neither the degree of EGFR-signaling inhibition nor genetic analysis of EGFR was sufficient to predict sensitivity to this therapeutic combination. However, detection of rapid inhibitory effects on [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, assessed through noninvasive positron emission tomography, was an effective predictive biomarker of response in vivo. Together, these studies identify a crucial link among oncogene signaling, glucose metabolism, and cytoplasmic p53, which may potentially be exploited for combination therapy in GBM and possibly other malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2761921473,"Presynaptic NMDA receptors (preNMDARs) control synaptic release, but it is not well understood how. Rab3-interacting molecules (RIMs) provide scaffolding at presynaptic active zones and are involved in vesicle priming. Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been implicated in regulation of spontaneous release. We demonstrate that, at connected layer 5 pyramidal cell pairs of developing mouse visual cortex, Mg2+-sensitive preNMDAR signaling upregulates replenishment of the readily releasable vesicle pool during high-frequency firing. In conditional RIM1αβ deletion mice, preNMDAR upregulation of vesicle replenishment was abolished, yet preNMDAR control of spontaneous release was unaffected. Conversely, JNK2 blockade prevented Mg2+-insensitive preNMDAR signaling from regulating spontaneous release, but preNMDAR control of evoked release remained intact. We thus discovered that preNMDARs signal differentially to control evoked and spontaneous release by independent and non-overlapping mechanisms. Our findings suggest that preNMDARs may sometimes signal metabotropically and support the emerging principle that evoked and spontaneous release are distinct processes. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2767046452,"Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) is a major tool in genetic code expansion using noncanonical amino acids, yet its structure and function are not completely understood. Here we describe the crystal structure of the previously uncharacterized essential N-terminal domain of this unique enzyme in complex with tRNAPyl. This structure explains why PylRS remains orthogonal in a broad range of organisms, from bacteria to humans. The structure also illustrates why tRNAPyl recognition by PylRS is anticodon independent: the anticodon does not contact the enzyme. Then, using standard microbiological culture equipment, we established a new method for laboratory evolution-a noncontinuous counterpart of the previously developed phage-assisted continuous evolution. With this method, we evolved novel PylRS variants with enhanced activity and amino acid specificity. Finally, we employed an evolved PylRS variant to determine its N-terminal domain structure and show how its mutations improve PylRS activity in the genetic encoding of a noncanonical amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W2766594096,"In rodent models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy, seizure-dependent induction of ΔFosB results in epigenetic silencing of calbindin. Hippocampal inhibition of ΔFosB or elevation of calbindin rescues spatial memory deficits in mouse models of AD. The calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k is critical for hippocampal function and cognition1,2,3, but its expression is markedly decreased in various neurological disorders associated with epileptiform activity and seizures4,5,6,7. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy, both of which are accompanied by recurrent seizures8, the severity of cognitive deficits reflects the degree of calbindin reduction in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)4,9,10. However, despite the importance of calbindin in both neuronal physiology and pathology, the regulatory mechanisms that control its expression in the hippocampus are poorly understood. Here we report an epigenetic mechanism through which seizures chronically suppress hippocampal calbindin expression and impair cognition. We demonstrate that ΔFosB, a highly stable transcription factor, is induced in the hippocampus in mouse models of AD and seizures, in which it binds and triggers histone deacetylation at the promoter of the calbindin gene (Calb1) and downregulates Calb1 transcription. Notably, increasing DG calbindin levels, either by direct virus-mediated expression or inhibition of ΔFosB signaling, improves spatial memory in a mouse model of AD. Moreover, levels of ΔFosB and calbindin expression are inversely related in the DG of individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or AD and correlate with performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We propose that chronic suppression of calbindin by ΔFosB is one mechanism through which intermittent seizures drive persistent cognitive deficits in conditions accompanied by recurrent seizures."
https://openalex.org/W2766661864,"Gender inequity in science and academia, especially in senior positions, is a recognised problem. The reasons are poorly understood, but include the persistence of historical gender ratios, discrimination and other factors, including gender-based behavioural differences.

Accounting for audience gender ratio, male attendees asked 1.8 questions for each question asked by a female attendee. Amongst only younger researchers, male attendees also asked 1.8 questions per female question, suggesting the pattern cannot be attributed to the temporary problem of demographic inertia. We link our findings to the 'chilly' climate for women in STEM, including wider experiences of discrimination likely encountered by women throughout their education and careers. We call for a broader and coordinated approach to understanding and addressing the barriers to women and other under-represented groups. We encourage the scientific community to recognise the context in which these gender differences occur, and evaluate and develop methods to support full participation from all attendees."
https://openalex.org/W2766736478,"Africa is currently host to a number of international genomics research and biobanking consortia, each with a mandate to advance genomics research and biobanking in Africa. Whilst most of these consortia promise to transform the way international health research is done in Africa, few have articulated exactly how they propose to go about this. In this paper, we report on a qualitative interviewing study in which we involved 17 genomics researchers in Africa. We describe their perceptions and expectations of international genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa.All interviewees were of the view that externally funded genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa, have played a critical role in building capacity for genomics research and biobanking in Africa and in providing an opportunity for researchers in Africa to collaborate and network with other researchers. Whilst the opportunity to collaborate was seen as a benefit, some interviewees stressed the importance of recognizing that these collaborations carry mutual benefits for all partners, including their collaborators in HICs. They also voiced two major concerns of being part of these collaborative initiatives: the possibility of exploitation of African researchers and the non-sustainability of research capacity building efforts. As a way of minimising exploitation, researchers in Africa recommended that genuine efforts be made to create transparent and equitable international health research partnerships. They suggested that this could be achieved through,: having rules of engagement, enabling African researchers to contribute to the design and conduct of international health projects in Africa, and mutual and respectful exchange of experience and capacity between research collaborators. These were identified as hallmarks to equitable international health research collaborations in Africa.Genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa such as H3Africa have gone some way in defining aspects of fair and equitable research collaborations in Africa. However, they will need to strive at achieving equitable health research collaborations if they truly aim at setting a gold standard for how international health research should be conducted in Africa."

Hitherto, all microtubule-crosslinking motors have been shown to slide microtubules at a constant velocity until no overlap remains between them, leading to the breakdown of the initial microtubule geometry. Here, we show in vitro that the sliding velocity of microtubules, driven by human kinesin-14 HSET, decreases when microtubules start to slide apart, resulting in the maintenance of finite-length microtubule overlaps. We quantitatively explain this feedback using the local interaction kinetics of HSET with overlapping microtubules that cause retention of HSET in shortening overlaps. Consequently, the increased HSET density in the overlaps leads to a density-dependent decrease in sliding velocity and the generation of an entropic force that antagonizes the force exerted by the motors. Our results demonstrate that a spatial arrangement of microtubules can regulate the collective action of molecular motors through the local alteration of their individual interaction kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2766145236,"MRI assessment of the brain has demonstrated four different patterns of atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD): typical AD, limbic-predominant AD, hippocampal-sparing AD, and a subtype with minimal atrophy, previously referred to as no-atrophy AD. The aim of the present study was to identify and describe the differences between these four AD subtypes in a longitudinal memory-clinic study.The medial temporal lobes, the frontal regions, and the posterior regions were assessed with MRI visual rating scales to categorize 123 patients with mild AD according to ICD-10 and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and the clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) into atrophy subtypes. Demographic data, neuropsychological measures, cerebrospinal-fluid biomarkers, and progression rate of dementia at two-year follow-up were compared between the groups.Typical AD was found in 59 patients (48%); 29 (24%) patients had limbic-predominant AD; 19 (15%) had hippocampal-sparing AD; and 16 (13%) belonged to the group with minimal atrophy. No differences were found regarding cognitive test results or progression rates between the different subtypes. Using adjusted logistic regression analysis, we found that the patients in the minimal-atrophy group were less educated, had a lower baseline CDR sum of boxes score, and had higher levels of amyloid β in the cerebrospinal fluid.Previous results concerning the prevalence and the similar phenotypic expressions of the four AD subtypes were confirmed. The main finding was that patients with minimal atrophy as assessed by MRI had less education than the other AD subtypes and that this could support the cognitive reserve hypothesis and, at least in part, explain the lower degree of atrophy in this group. Patients with less formal education might present with clinically typical AD symptoms before they have positive biomarkers of AD and this finding might challenge suggested biomarker-based criteria for AD."

Several candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been previously identified but the clinical utility of these SNPs in the prediction of INH-DILI remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the association between selected candidate SNPs and the risk of INH-DILI and to assess the clinical validity of associated variants in a Singaporean population.This was a case-control study where 24 INH-DILI cases and 79 controls were recruited from the TB control unit in a tertiary hospital. Logistic regression was used to test for the association between candidate SNPs and INH-DILI. NAT2 acetylator status was inferred from genotypes and tested for association with INH-DILI. Finally, clinical validity measures were estimated for significant variants.Two SNPs in NAT2 (rs1041983 and rs1495741) and NAT2 slow acetylators (SA) were significantly associated with INH-DILI (OR (95% CI) = 13.86 (4.30-44.70), 0.10 (0.03-0.33) and 9.98 (3.32-33.80), respectively). Based on an INH-DILI prevalence of 10%, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of NAT2 SA were 75%, 78%, 28% and 97%, respectively. The population attributable fraction (PAF) and number needed to test (NNT) for NAT2 SA were estimated to be 0.67 and 4.08, respectively. A model with clinical and NAT2 acetylator status provided significantly better prediction for INH-DILI than a clinical model alone (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.863 vs. 0.766, respectively, p = 0.027).We show the association between NAT2 SA and INH-DILI in a Singaporean population and demonstrated its clinical utility in the prediction of INH-DILI."
https://openalex.org/W2767028788,"The transcriptional regulation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) contributes to an enhanced HER2 expression in HER2-positive breast cancers with HER2 gene amplification and HER2-low or HER2-negative breast cancers following radiotherapy or endocrine therapy, and this drives tumorigenesis and the resistance to therapy. Epigenetic mechanisms are critical for transcription regulation, however, such mechanisms in the transcription regulation of HER2 are limited to the involvement of tri-methylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and acetylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) at the HER2 promoter region. Here, we report the identification of a novel enhancer in the HER2 3’ gene body, which we have termed HER2 gene body enhancer (HGE). The HGE starts from the 3’ end of intron 19 and extends into intron 22, possesses enhancer histone modification marks in specific cells and enhances the transcriptional activity of the HER2 promoters. We also found that TFAP2C, a known regulator of HER2, binds to HGE and is required for its enhancer function and that DNA methylation in the HGE region inhibits the histone modifications characterizing enhancer and is inversely correlated with HER2 expression in breast cancer samples. The identification of this novel enhancer sheds a light on the roles of epigenetic mechanisms in HER2 transcription, in both HER2-positive breast cancer samples and individuals with HER2-low or HER2-negative breast cancers undergoing radiotherapy or endocrine therapy."

A total of 69 index cases followed at the Endocrinology Unit in Pisa over a period of 19 years, including 54 MEN1 and 15 FIHP kindreds were enrolled. Seven index cases with MEN1 but MEN1 mutation-negative, followed at the University Hospital of Cagliari, were also investigated. FIHP were also tested for CDC73 and CaSR gene alterations. MEN1 germline mutations were identified in 90% of the index cases of familial MEN1 (F-MEN1) and in 23% of sporadic cases (S-MEN1). MEN1 and CDC73 mutations accounted for 13% and 7% of the FIHP cohort, respectively. A CDKN1B mutation was identified in one F-MEN1. Two AIP variants of unknown significance were detected in two MEN1-negative S-MEN1. A MEN1 positive test best predicted the onset of all three major MEN1-related manifestations or parathyroid and gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors during follow-up. A comparison between the clinical characteristics of F and S-MEN1 showed a higher prevalence of a single parathyroid disease and pituitary tumors in sporadic compared to familial MEN1 patients. No significant correlation was found between the type and location of MEN1 mutations and the clinical phenotype. Since all MEN1 mutation-positive sporadic patients had a phenotype resembling that of familial MEN1 (multiglandular parathyroid hyperplasia, a prevalence of gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors and/or the classic triad) we might hypothesize that a subset of the sporadic MEN1 mutation-negative patients could represent an incidental coexistence of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism and pituitary tumors or a MEN1 phenocopy, in our cohort, as in most cases described in the literature."

https://openalex.org/W2766201442,"Human and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses (HRSV/BRSV) are major causes of severe lower respiratory tract infections in children and calves, respectively. Shared epidemiological, clinical, pathological and genetic characteristics of these viruses make comparative research highly relevant. To characterise the host response against BRSV infection, bronchoalveolar lavage supernatant (BAL) from i) non-vaccinated, BRSV-infected ii) vaccinated, BRSV-infected and iii) non-infected calves was analysed by tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins were semi-quantified and protein expression was validated by immunoblotting. Correlations between selected proteins and pathology, clinical signs and virus shedding were investigated. Calves with BRSV-induced disease had increased total protein concentrations and a decreased number of proteins identified in BAL. The protein profile was characterised by neutrophil activation and a reduction in identified antioxidant enzymes. The presence of neutrophils in alveolar septa, the expression level of neutrophil-related or antioxidant proteins and LZTFL1 correlated significantly with disease. Citrullinated histone 3, an indicator of extracellular traps (ETs), was only detected in non-vaccinated, BRSV-infected animals. By bringing disequilibrium in the release and detoxification of reactive oxygen species, generating ETs and causing elastine degradation, exaggerated neutrophil responses might exacerbate RSV-induced disease. Neutrophil-mitigating or antioxidant treatments should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2766812266,"Disinfectants and biocidal products have been widely used to combat Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in homes and healthcare environments. Although disruption of cytoplasmic membrane integrity has been documented as the main bactericidal effect of biocides, little is known about the biochemical alterations induced by these chemical agents. In this study, we used Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and chemometric tools as an alternative non-destructive technique to determine the bactericidal effects of commonly used disinfectants against MRSA USA-300. FTIR spectroscopy permits a detailed characterization of bacterial reactivity, allowing an understanding of the fundamental mechanism of action involved in the interaction between bacteria and disinfectants. The disinfectants studied were ethanol 70% (N = 5), isopropanol (N = 5), sodium hypochlorite (N = 5), triclosan (N = 5) and triclocarban (N = 5). Results showed less than 5% colony forming units growth of MRSA treated with triclocarban and no growth in the other groups. Nearly 70,000 mid-infrared spectra from the five treatments and the two control (untreated; N = 4) groups of MRSA (bacteria grown in TSB and incubated at 37°C (Control I) / at ambient temperature (Control II), for 24h) were pre-processed and analyzed using principal component analysis followed by linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA). Clustering of strains of MRSA belonging to five treatments and the discrimination between each treatment and two control groups in MRSA (untreated) were investigated. PCA-LDA discriminatory frequencies suggested that ethanol-treated spectra are the most similar to isopropanol-treated spectra biochemically. Also reported here are the biochemical alterations in the structure of proteins, lipid membranes, and phosphate groups of MRSA produced by sodium hypochlorite, triclosan, and triclocarban treatments. These findings provide mechanistic information involved in the interaction between MRSA strains and hygiene products; thereby demonstrating the potential of spectroscopic analysis as an objective, robust, and label-free tool for evaluating the macromolecular changes involved in disinfectant-treated MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W2766082696,"Pollination syndromes and their predictive power regarding actual plant-animal interactions have been controversially discussed in the past. We investigate pollination syndromes in Balsaminaceae, utilizing quantitative respectively categorical data sets of flower morphometry, signal and reward traits for 86 species to test for the effect of different types of data on the test patterns retrieved. Cluster Analyses of the floral traits are used in combination with independent pollinator observations. Based on quantitative data we retrieve seven clusters, six of them corresponding to plausible pollination syndromes and one additional, well-supported cluster comprising highly divergent floral architectures. This latter cluster represents a non-syndrome of flowers not segregated by the specific data set here used. Conversely, using categorical data we obtained only a rudimentary resolution of pollination syndromes, in line with several earlier studies. The results underscore that the use of functional, exactly quanitified trait data has the power to retrieve pollination syndromes circumscribed by the specific data used. Data quality can, however, not be replaced by sheer data volume. With this caveat, it is possible to identify pollination syndromes from large datasets and to reliably extrapolate them for taxa for which direct observations are unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W2765587633,"Promoter methylation is the most significant mechanism to regulate O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) expression. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MGMT promoter region may also play a role. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of SNPs in the MGMT promoter region of glioblastoma. Genomic DNAs from 118 glioblastomas were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Sanger sequencing was used to sequence the MGMT promoter region to detect SNPs. The results were correlated with MGMT status and patient survival. Rs1625649 was the only polymorphic SNP located at the MGMT promoter region in 37.5% of glioblastomas. Homozygous rs1625649 (AA genotype) was correlated with a higher MGMT methylation level and a lower protein expression, but the result was not statistically significant. In patients with MGMT methylated glioblastoma, cases with homozygous rs1625649 (AA genotype) were significantly associated with a lack of MGMT protein expression and a better progression-free survival (PFS) than the cases with wild type rs1625649 (CC genotype) or heterozygous rs1625649 (CA genotype). The survival impact was significant in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, the MGMT promoter homozygous rs1625649 (AA genotype) was found to correlate with a better PFS in patients with MGMT methylated glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2766439711,"The formation of the coccolith biominerals by a group of marine algae (the Coccolithophores) offers fascinating research avenues both from the biological and geological sides. It is surprising how biomineralisation by a key phytoplanktonic group remains underconstrained, yet is influential on ocean alkalinity and responsible for the built up of our paleoclimatic archive over the last 200 Myrs. Here, we report two close relative coccolith taxa exhibiting substantial bioaccumulation of strontium: Scyphosphaera and Pontosphaera grown in the laboratory or retrieved from Pliocene sediments. This strontium enrichment relative to calcium is one order of magnitude greater than reported in other coccoliths of the orders Isochrysidales and Coccolithales, and extends well beyond established controls on Sr/Ca ratios by temperature and growth rate. We discuss this prominent vital effect in relation with possible specific uptake of strontium relative to calcium from the extracellular environment to the coccolith vesicle in coccolithophores excreting very large scale coccoliths. The report of Sr-rich biominerals challenges our current understanding of the cellular acquisition and intracellular trafficking of alkaline earth cations in phytoplanktonic calcifying eukaryotic algae. The presence of Sr-rich coccolith species in the geological record has to be quantitatively considered in future Sr/Ca-based palaeoceanographic reconstruction."

The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to B. canis-induced abortion are unknown, but heavily infected trophoblasts are consistently observed. As trophoblasts responses to other pathogens contribute to placental inflammation leading to abortion, the aim of the present study was to characterize the cytokine response of canine trophoblasts to B. canis infection. To achieve this, trophoblasts isolated from term placenta of healthy female dogs were infected with B. canis, culture supernatants were harvested for cytokine determinations, and the load of intracellular viable B. canis was determined at different times post-infection. Additionally, cytokine responses were assessed in non-infected trophoblasts stimulated with conditioned media (CM) from B. canis-infected canine monocytes and neutrophils. Finally, cytokine response and bacteria replication were assessed in canine placental explants infected ex vivo. B. canis successfully infected and replicated in primary canine trophoblasts, eliciting an increase in IL-8 and RANTES (CCL5) secretion. Moreover, the stimulation of trophoblasts with CM from B. canis-infected monocytes and neutrophils induced a significant increase in IL-8, IL-6 and RANTES secretion. B. canis replication was confirmed in infected placental explants and the infection elicited an increased secretion of TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6 and RANTES. This study shows that canine trophoblasts produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to B. canis infection and/or to stimulation with factors produced by infected monocytes and neutrophils. These cytokines may contribute to placental inflammation leading to abortion in B. canis-infected pregnant bitches."

So far we know only little of the family’s early evolutionary history and the origin of the modern genus, Moschus. Here we present a comprehensive description of cranial material, including the ear region and the dentition, of fossil moschid material from the Middle Miocene locality Steinheim am Albuch (13.5 Ma; Germany). This study provides the first exhaustive dataset for the cranial osteology of Micromeryx flourensianus, the most likely oldest true moschid. It furthermore reveals the presence of a second, so far undescribed moschid species, we here name Micromeryx? eiselei, in the abundant material from the locality. The two taxa can be clearly distinguished by characters of the skull, the ear region, the dentition, as well as by size. This evidences the sympatric occurrence of two moschid species in the locality Steinheim am Albuch."
https://openalex.org/W2766917485,"Preterm birth is associated with altered angiogenesis and with increased risk of cardiovascular dysfunction and hypertension at adulthood. We previously demonstrated that in preterm newborns circulating cord blood endothelial progenitor cells (ECFC), responsible for angio/vasculogenesis, are reduced in number and display altered angiogenic properties. Altered angiogenic function was associated with a decreased expression of pro-angiogenic genes, among which the AMOT gene which is a strong positive regulator of angiogenesis. Such dysregulation may be related to epigenetic factors. In this study we analyse the methylation profiling of the AMOT gene during development, through a comparative analysis of the cord blood ECFC of preterm newborns and their term counterpart.We used both cloning-sequencing and pyrosequencing experiments to perform a comparative analysis of the DNA methylation profile of the promoter CpG island of AMOT gene in the cord blood ECFC of 16 preterm newborns (28-35 weeks gestational age-GA) and 15 term newborns (>37 weeks GA).Twenty nine clones (obtained from 2 term newborns) and forty clones (obtained from 3 preterm newborns) were sequenced. The AMOT gene methylation rate was significantly higher in preterm compared to term newborns (4.5% versus 2.5% respectively: χ2 = 3.84; P = 1.8 10-02). Bisulfite pyrosequencing identified four CpG dinucleotides with significantly higher methylation levels in preterm newborns. This CpG-targeted methylation significantly decreased with increasing gestational age.These findings highlight importance of pro-angiogenic AMOT gene methylation in ECFC, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may control the regulation of angiogenesis during development. Therefore they pave the way to specific short term and long term complications of preterm birth by altered angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2767007087,"Morphometric measurements of systemic atherosclerosis and direct quantification of visceral fat are only possible using materials from autopsy studies. However, the few autopsy studies that have investigated the association of visceral fat with atherosclerosis had small sample sizes and focused on coronary arteries of young or middle-aged White subjects. We aimed to investigate the association of pericardial fat (PF) and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) with atherosclerosis in the aorta, coronary, carotid, and cerebral arteries in a large autopsy study.We evaluated deceased subjects aged 30 years or above. We dissected and weighted the PF and the AVF and evaluated the atherosclerotic burden in the aorta, as well as the carotid, coronary, and cerebral arteries using morphometric measurements. We also investigated the interaction of PF and AVF with age regarding the atherosclerotic burden.The mean age of the 240 included subjects was 64.8±15.3 years, and 63% was male. Greater PF was associated with a higher degree of aortic atherosclerosis after adjusting for confounding variables (coefficient = 4.39, 95% CI = 0.83; 7.94, p = 0.02). Greater AVF was associated with a higher coronary stenosis index (coefficient = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.15; 2.83, p = 0.03) and a greater number of coronary plaques (coefficient = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.24; 1.19, p = 0.003). We did not find an association of PF or AVF with carotid or cerebral atherosclerotic burden. We found a significant interaction of AVF (coefficient = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.14; -0.02, p = 0.009) and PF (coefficient = -0.87, 95% CI = -1.70; -0.04, p = 0.04) with age regarding carotid artery atherosclerotic burden.Greater AVF was associated with greater atherosclerotic burden and extent in coronary arteries, while greater PF correlated with a higher degree of atherosclerosis in the aorta."

Thus, in the present study, the antitumor mechanism of BK10007S was elucidated in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Herein, BK10007S showed significant cytotoxicity by 3-[4,5-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium bromide (MTT) assay and anti-proliferative effects by colony formation assay in HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells. Also, apoptotic bodies and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) positive cells were observed in BK10007S treated HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylinodole (DAPI) staining and TUNEL assay, respectively. Consistently, BK10007S increased sub G1 population in HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells by cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, Western blotting revealed that BK10007S activated the caspase cascades (caspase 8, 9 and 3), cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and downregulated the expression of cyclin D1, survivin and for CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1 or CELF1) in HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cells. Conversely, overexpression of CUGBP1 reduced cleavages of PARP and caspase 3, cytotoxicity and subG1 population in BK10007S treated HepG2 cells. Overall, these findings provide scientific evidences that BK10007S induces apoptosis via inhibition of CUGBP1 and activation of caspases in hepatocellular carcinomas as a potent anticancer candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2766498950,"Juvenile myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoantibody mediated autoimmune disorder targeting the neuromuscular endplate. The clinical hallmark is muscle weakness and fatigability. Disease aetiology is complex, including both genetic and environmental factors. The involvement of genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is well established in adult MG. However, HLA associations in European juvenile MG have not been studied. This case-control study aimed to investigate and characterize genetic risk factors in prepubertal and postpubertal onset juvenile MG.A population based Norwegian cohort of 43 juvenile MG patients (17 with prepubertal onset, 26 with postpubertal onset) and 368 controls were included. Next generation sequencing of five HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1) was performed, and a positive association was seen with HLA-B*08 (OR (95% CI) = 3.27 (2.00-5.36), Pc = 0.00003) and HLA-DRB1*04:04 (OR (95% CI) = 2.65 (1.57-4.24), Pc = 0.03). Stratified in postpubertal and prepubertal onset, HLA-DRB1*04:04 was only positively associated with the latter (P = 0.01). The HLA-B*08 allele (12.9% in the controls), previously described associated with early onset adult MG, was most frequently observed in postpubertal onset MG (40.4%, P = 0.0002) but also increased among prepubertal onset MG (23.5%, P = 0.05).This study provides novel information about HLA susceptibility alleles in Norwegian juvenile MG where HLA-DRB1*04:04 was associated with prepubertal onset."
https://openalex.org/W2766553480,"Purpose To analyze internal spherical aberration in pseudophakic eyes that underwent aspheric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, and to investigate the relationships between biometric data and the effectiveness of aspheric IOL implantation. Methods This retrospective study included 40 eyes of 40 patients who underwent implantation of an IOL having a negative spherical aberration of -0.20 μm (CT ASPHINA 509M; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Germany). The IOLMaster (version 5.0; Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) was used for preoperative biometric measurements (axial length, anterior chamber depth, central corneal power) and the measurement of postoperative anterior chamber depth. The spherical aberrations were measured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively using the iTrace (Tracey Technologies, Houston, TX, USA) at a pupil diameter of 5.0 mm. We investigated the relationships between preoperative biometric data and postoperative internal spherical aberration, and compared biometric measurements between 2 subgroups stratified according to internal spherical aberration (spherical aberration ≤ -0.06 μm vs. spherical aberration > -0.06 μm). Results The mean postoperative internal spherical aberration was -0.087 ± 0.063 μm. Preoperative axial length and residual total spherical aberration showed statistically significant correlations with internal spherical aberration (p = 0.041, 0.002). Preoperative axial length, postoperative anterior chamber depth, IOL power, and residual spherical aberration showed significant differences between the 2 subgroups stratified according to internal spherical aberration (p = 0.020, 0.029, 0.048, 0.041 respectively). Conclusion The corrective effect of an aspheric IOL is influenced by preoperative axial length and postoperative anterior chamber depth. Not only the amount of negative spherical aberration on the IOL surface but also the preoperative axial length should be considered to optimize spherical aberration after aspheric IOL implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2766518443,"Dystroglycan (DG) is a highly glycosylated protein complex that links the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix, mediating fundamental physiological functions such as mechanical stability of tissues, matrix organization and cell polarity. A crucial role in the glycosylation of the DG α subunit is played by its own N-terminal region that is required by the glycosyltransferase LARGE. Alteration in this O-glycosylation deeply impairs the high affinity binding to other extracellular matrix proteins such as laminins. Recently, three missense mutations in the gene encoding DG, mapped in the α-DG N-terminal region, were found to be responsible for hypoglycosylated states, causing congenital diseases of different severity referred as primary dystroglycanopaties.To gain insight on the molecular basis of these disorders, we investigated the crystallographic and solution structures of these pathological point mutants, namely V72I, D109N and T190M. Small Angle X-ray Scattering analysis reveals that these mutations affect the structures in solution, altering the distribution between compact and more elongated conformations. These results, supported by biochemical and biophysical assays, point to an altered structural flexibility of the mutant α-DG N-terminal region that may have repercussions on its interaction with LARGE and/or other DG-modifying enzymes, eventually reducing their catalytic efficiency."

The handwritten information provided the occupation of parents, the legitimacy status, life events (e.g. marriage, divorce), and the precise date of death when after 1945 (i.e. age 31 years (y) in the cohort). We used the median age at death (MAD) as a global measure of mortality, then studied separately survival to and after 31 y. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and mixed effect Cox models were used.MAD showed large variations according to paternal occupation. The lowest MAD in both sexes was that of workers' children: it was 56.3 y (95% CI: [48.6-62.7]) in men and 67.4 y (95% CI: [60.8-72.7]) in women, respectively (95% CI: 13.4 y [5.7-21.3]) and 12.3 y (95% CI: [4.0-19.2]) below the highest MAD attained. MAD experienced by illegitimate children was 18.9 y (95% CI: [13.3-32.3]) shorter than of legitimate children. The multivariate analysis revealed that in both sexes survival to age 31 y was predicted independently by legitimacy and paternal occupation. Paternal occupation was found significantly associated with mortality after age 31 y in females only: accordingly difference in life expectancy at age 31 y was 4.4 y (95% CI: [1.2-7.6]) between upper class and workers' daughters.Paternal occupation and legitimacy status were strong predictors of offspring longevity in this one-century historical cohort born during World War One."
https://openalex.org/W2765898579,"Objective The objective of this study was to assess the differences and similarities in dietary patterns among migrants and natives. Methods A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of São Paulo. The study population included internal migrants, defined as individuals born outside São Paulo city who had lived in the city for ten years or longer. The final population (n = 999) was divided into three groups: natives of São Paulo (n = 354), migrants from the Southeast (n = 349) and migrants from the Northeast (n = 296). Factor and principal component analysis was employed to derive dietary patterns. The standardized scores were compared among groups using linear regression. Results Differences in income per capita, years of education, self-reported race, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, nutritional status and prevalence of hypertension were found for place of birth. Three dietary patterns were identified: prudent (salad dressings, vegetables, natural flavorings, fruits, whole-grain bread, white cheeses and juices), traditional (rice, beans, bread/toast/crackers, butter/margarine, whole milk, coffee/teas, sugar), and modern (sodas, pastries/sandwiches/pizzas, yellow cheeses, pastas, sauces, alcoholic beverages, sweets, processed meats). Compared to natives, migrants from the Southeast had an inversely proportional adherence to the modern pattern whereas migrants from the Northeast had an inverse association with the prudent and modern patterns and a positive association with the traditional pattern. Conclusions São Paulo natives and internal migrants from other regions of Brazil exhibited different dietary patterns. The results presented here add perspectives to be considered in the study of non-communicable diseases and its different incidences among migrants and natives."
https://openalex.org/W2766514972,"The prediction of object stability on earth requires the establishment of a perceptual frame of reference based on the direction of gravity. Across three experiments, we measured the critical angle (CA) at which an object appeared equally likely to fall over or right itself. We investigated whether the internal representation of the gravity direction, biased by either simulated tilt (rotating visual surround) or real body tilt situations, influences in a similar fashion the judgment of stability. In the simulated tilt condition, the estimated CA and the perceived gravity are both deviated in the same direction. In the real tilt condition, the orientation of the body affects the perception of gravity direction but has no effect on the estimated CA. Results suggest that people differently weigh gravity direction information provided by visual motion and by visual polarity cues for estimating the stability of objects."
https://openalex.org/W2766606789,"Drosophila atonal (ato) is required for the specification of founding R8 photoreceptors during retinal development. ato is regulated via dual eye-specific enhancers; ato-3' is subject to initial induction whereas 5'-ato facilitates Notch-mediated autoregulation. Notch is further utilized to induce bHLH repressors of the E(spl) locus to restrict Ato from its initial broad expression to individual cells. Although Notch operates in two, distinct phases, it has remained unclear how the two phases maintain independence from one another. The difference in these two phases has attributed to the hypothesized delayed expression of E(spl). However, immunofluorescence data indicate that E(spl) are expressed during early Ato patterning, suggesting a more sophisticated underlying mechanism. To probe this mechanism, we provide evidence that although E(spl) exert no influence on ato-3', E(spl) repress 5'-ato and deletion of the E(spl) locus elicits precocious 5'-ato activity. Thus, E(spl) imposes a delay to the timing in which Ato initiates autoregulation. We next sought to understand this finding in the context of E(spl)D, which encodes a dysregulated variant of E(spl)M8 that perturbs R8 patterning, though, as previously reported, only in conjunction with the mutant receptor Nspl. We established a genetic interaction between E(spl)D and roughened eye (roe), a known modulator of Notch signaling in retinogenesis. This link further suggests a dosage-dependence between E(spl) and the proneural activators Ato and Sens, as indicated via interaction assays in which E(spl)D renders aberrant R8 patterning in conjunction with reduced proneural dosage. In total, the biphasicity of Notch signaling relies, to some degree, on the post-translational regulation of individual E(spl) members and, importantly, that post-translational regulation is likely necessary to modulate the level of E(spl) activity throughout the progression of Ato expression."
https://openalex.org/W2766221680,"Myostatin is a negative regulator of myogenesis and has been suggested to be an important factor in the development of muscle wasting during viral infection. The objective of this study was to characterize the main regulatory element of the grouper myostatin promoter and to study changes in promoter activity due to viral stimulation. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the E-box E6 is a positive cis-and trans-regulation motif, and an essential binding site for MyoD. In contrast, the E-box E5 is a dominant negative cis-regulatory. The characteristics of grouper myostatin promoter are similar in regulation of muscle growth to that of other species, but mainly through specific regulatory elements. According to these results, we conducted a study to investigate the effect of viral infection on myostatin promoter activity and its regulation. The nervous necrosis virus (NNV) treatment significantly induced myostatin promoter activity. The present study is the first report describing that specific myostatin motifs regulate promoter activity and response to viral infection."
