In this report, we demonstrate that overexpression of the transcription factor Bach1 in Hep-G2 cells negatively regulated NQO1 gene expression and induction in response to antioxidant t-BHQ. Bandshift and supershift assays revealed that Bach1 binds to the ARE as a heterodimer with small Maf proteins but not as a homodimer or heterodimer with Nrf2. The transfection and ChIP assays revealed that Bach1 and Nrf2 competed with each other to regulate ARE-mediated gene expression. Heme, a negative regulator of Bach1 relieved the Bach1 repression of NQO1 gene expression in transfected cells. The transcription of Bach1 and Nrf2 did not change in response to t-BHQ. Immunofluorescence assays and Western blot analysis revealed that both Bach1 and Nrf2 localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the untreated cells. The treatment of cells with t-BHQ resulted in the nuclear accumulation of both Bach1 and Nrf2. Interestingly, the t-BHQ-induced nuclear accumulation of Bach1 was significantly delayed over that of Nrf2. These results led to the conclusion that a balance of Nrf2 versus Bach1 inside the nucleus influences up- or down-regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression. The results further suggest that antioxidant-induced delayed accumulation of Bach1 contributes to the down-regulation of ARE-regulated genes, presumably to reduce the antioxidant enzymes to normal levels.

These include NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) that catalyzes the two-electron reductive metabolism and detoxification of quinones (3Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y.

Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The coordinated induction of this battery of genes protects cells against free radical damage, oxidative stress, and neoplasia (1Dhakshinamoorthy II, S. Long D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Reg. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Jaiswal A.K. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The ARE contains AP1/AP1-like elements arranged either as inverse or direct repeats followed by a GC box (1Dhakshinamoorthy II, S. Long D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Reg. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Several nuclear proteins have been shown to bind to the ARE either as homodimers or heterodimers (1Dhakshinamoorthy II, S. Long D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Reg. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Jaiswal A.K. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Analysis of ARE-nuclear protein complexes have identified a number of nuclear transcription factors including c-Jun, Jun-B, Jun-D, c-Fos, Fra1, Nrf1, Nrf2, YABP, ARE-BP1, MafG, MafK, Ah (aromatic hydrocarbon) receptor, and the estrogen receptor (1Dhakshinamoorthy II, S.

Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Among these transcription factors, c-Jun, Jun-B, Jun-D, c-Fos, Fra1, Nrf1, and Nrf2 and small Maf proteins have been shown to bind to the human NQO1 gene ARE (1Dhakshinamoorthy II, S. Long D.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). More recently, a cytosolic inhibitor of Nrf2 (Keap1/INrf2) was identified (9Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar, 10Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, Keap1/INrf2 retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. Exposure of cells to antioxidants leads to the release of Nrf2 from Keap1/INrf2. Nrf2 then translocates to the nucleus leading to the activation of ARE-mediated gene expression (9Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar, 10Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Small Maf (MafG, MafK, and MafF) proteins are b-Zip proteins that lack a transcriptional activation domain. They are known to form homodimers and heterodimers with other b-Zip proteins including Nrf2. Maf-Maf homodimers repressed, but Maf-Nrf2 heterodimers activated, the transcription of Maf recognition element (MARE)-regulated β-globin gene (11Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The role of small Maf proteins has also been investigated in ARE-mediated detoxifying enzyme gene regulation (8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The Maf-Maf homodimers repressed NQO1, GST Ya, and γ-GCS gene expression and antioxidant induction (8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Nguyen T. Huang H.C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, the role of Nrf2-Maf heterodimers in ARE-mediated gene regulation is controversial and requires further investigation (8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Nguyen T. Huang H.C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The mammalian transcription factors Bach1 and Bach2 belong to the cap′n′collar (CNC), b-Zip family of proteins that include Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3 (14Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In addition to CNC and b-Zip domains, the Bach proteins also have a BTB domain at the N terminus. Bach proteins are the only transcription factors in which the BTB domains are associated with the b-Zip domains. The Bach proteins were originally identified as a heterodimeric partner molecule of MafK (14Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Bach proteins are known to bind to the NF-E2 site and MARE as heterodimers with MafK (14Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 15Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that in normal cells Bach1 heterodimerizes with MafK and is bound to the β-globin gene MARE resulting in the repression of the gene. Upon induction, Bach1 is replaced by Nrf2, resulting in activation and suggesting competition between Bach1 and Nrf2 for the same DNA binding site in different cellular states (16Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Bach1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Bach2 is specific for neural tissues and B lymphoid cells (14Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 17Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternatively spliced truncated form of Bach1, Bach1t, was cloned and sequenced (18Kanezaki R. Toki T. Yokoyama M. Yomogida K. Sugiyama K. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Ito E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Bach1t recruits Bach1 to the nucleus through BTB domain-mediated interaction. Recent molecular investigation of Bach2 has revealed that the subcellular localization of Bach2 is regulated by oxidative stress-sensitive nuclear export, mediated by crm1/exportin1 protein. This process of nuclear export is directed by the cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS) found in the C-terminal region of Bach2 (17Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The heavy metal cadmium induced the nuclear export of Bach1, a transcriptional repressor of the heme oxygenase-1 gene (19Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Sun J. Doi H. Satomi S. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49246-49253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Heme was identified as a negative regulator of Bach1 (20Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Heme is known to bind directly with Bach1, inhibiting its binding to DNA and thus leading to increased MARE-mediated gene expression (20Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The ChIP assays in a recent report have suggested the dynamic exchange of Bach1- and NF-E2-related factors in the Maf transcription factor network at the MARE site (16Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). A role of Bach1 protein in antioxidant regulation of detoxifying enzyme genes is expected because of its sensitivity to oxidative stress. However, the experimental evidence suggesting a role for Bach1 protein in the antioxidant regulation of ARE-mediated detoxifying enzyme genes is lacking. In the present report, we investigated the role of Bach1 in ARE-mediated gene expression and induction in response to antioxidants. We demonstrate that overexpression of Bach1 represses endogenous and transfected NQO1 gene expression. The studies also demonstrate that Bach1 forms heterodimers with small Maf to bind to ARE. The studies further suggest that Bach1 and Nrf2 compete with each other to regulate ARE-mediated gene expression in transfected cells. The Bach1 repression was reversed by heme, which is known to inhibit Bach1. The treatment of the cells with the antioxidant t-BHQ did not alter the Bach1 and Nrf2 mRNA transcript level. Bach1 and Nrf2 both were found localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus under normal conditions. In response to t-BHQ, Bach1, and Nrf2 both accumulated in the nucleus. However, the rate of accumulation of Bach1 in the nucleus was significantly slower than Nrf2. These results suggest that Bach1 in association with small Maf proteins play a role in repression of ARE-mediated gene expression and induction presumably to participate in homeostatic control of ARE-regulated gene expression. Materials—The enzymes used in this study, pcDNA3.1/V-5-His-TOPO, and anti-V5 antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. α-minimum essential medium and Dulbecco's modified essential medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Effectene transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The Nrf2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Actin antibodies, t-BHQ, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The pGL2 promoter plasmid containing firefly luciferase gene, internal control plasmid pRL-TK that encodes Renilla luciferase, the Dual Luciferase assay kit, and the TnT T7/T3-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The mouse liver Marathon ready cDNA library was obtained from Clontech Laboratories Inc, Palo Alto, CA. The Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane, ECL Western blot analysis kit, and Amplify NAMP1000 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid Construction—The construction of the reporter plasmids pGL2-NQO1 ARE-Luc, pGL2-NQO1 mutant ARE-Luc, GST Ya ARE-Luc, and the expression plasmids pcDNA-Nrf2, pcDNA-MafG, pcDNA-MafK, pcDNA-MafG-V5, pcDNA-MafK-V5 are described (8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The mouse Bach1 cDNA was amplified from mouse liver marathon ready cDNA library using mouse Bach1-specific primers (forward, 5′-ACCATGTCTGTGAGTGAGAGTGCG and reverse, 5′-CTCGTCAGTAGTGCACTTGTCAGAC). The cDNA was cloned in pcDNA and designated as pcDNA-Bach1. The Bach1 cDNA was also subcloned inframe with the V5 epitope of the pcDNA expression plasmid. This plasmid encodes the V5-tagged Bach1 protein. The V5 epitope contains 14 amino acids in the sequence Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn-Pro-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser-Thr. The various constructs were checked and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection of Bach1 Expression Plasmid, and Analysis of Endogenous NQO1 Gene Expression—Human hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cells were grown in monolayer cultures containing α-minimum essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. The Effectene transfection reagent kit was used to perform the transfections by previously described procedures (8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, varying concentrations of pcDNA-Bach1 expression plasmid were transfected into Hep-G2 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, Hep-G2 cells were washed with 1× PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, and collected by centrifugation. The cells were homogenized briefly in 0.25 m sucrose supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to yield a homogenate with a protein concentration of 1–5 mg/ml. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed and analyzed for NQO1 protein and activity. The NQO1 protein in the 14,000-rpm supernatant fraction was analyzed by 12% SDS/PAGE, Western blotting, and probing with NQO1 antibody as described (21Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Lee H. Kimura S. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7382-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The NQO1 activity was determined by previously described procedures (21Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Lee H. Kimura S. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7382-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The final reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.18 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μm FAD, 0.01% Tween 20, 200 μm NADH, and 50 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The reaction rate was monitored by measuring the decrease in absorption caused by reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol at 600 nm. The activity was measured in the absence or presence of 20 μm dicoumarol, a specific inhibitor of NQO1 activity. The dicoumarol inhabitable NQO1 activity was determined by subtracting activity in the presence of dicoumarol from total activity. Cotransfection of Reporter and Expression Plasmids—0.5 μg of reporter constructs (NQO1 ARE-Luc, mutant ARE-Luc, and GST Ya ARE-Luc) were mixed individually and in combination with different concentrations of the pcDNA alone or pcDNA expression plasmids (Bach1, MafK, and Nrf2) and transfected into Hep-G2 cells. The plasmid pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was used as the internal control in each transfection. In related experiments, the NQO1 gene ARE-Luc was replaced with luciferase reporter plasmids in which 1.85 kb of the NQO1 promoter containing ARE or the NQO1 promoter containing an internal deletion of ARE-driving luciferase gene, and transfection assays were repeated. These NQO1 gene promoter plasmids were previously described (22Jaiswal A.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10647-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed in 1× Passive lysis buffer from the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system kit. The same kit was used to assay samples for luciferase activity. The luciferase assay was performed by previously described procedures (8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Each set of transfections was repeated three times. For induction studies, the cells were treated with 50 μm t-BHQ, dissolved in Me2SO for 16 h, and analyzed for luciferase activity by procedures described above. The transfection experiments were performed using untagged and V5-tagged Bach1 and MafK expression constructs. Both sets of expression plasmids gave similar results. The presence or absence of V5 epitope tagged to the proteins had no effect on their activity/function. Therefore, we have shown transfection data only on proteins that do not have the V5 tag. The addition of the V5 tag to Maf and Bach1 proteins enabled us to use antibodies against V5 peptide in supershift assays (Ref. 8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar and present report). This was necessary because the commercially available Bach1 antibodies are good only for Western and immunofluorescence assays, but not for supershift assays. In contrast, very good anti-V5 antibodies are commercially available from Invitrogen. Gel Shift/Supershift Assays—The in vitro transcription/translation of the plasmids encoding Bach1, Bach1-V5, Nrf2, MafK, and MafK-V5 were performed using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system by procedures suggested in the manufacturer's protocol. l-[35S]Methionine was substituted for methionine in the reactions. After the coupled transcription/translation assay, proteins were checked for their correct size on a 10% PAGE gel with Western blot analysis. Briefly, 5 μl of the translated proteins were resolved on a 10% PAGE gel, treated with Amplify solution (NAMP 100; Amersham Biosciences) to enhance the 35S signal, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. In similar experiments, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane and probed with V5 antibodies. V5 antibodies were used to detect the V5-tagged Bach1 and Maf proteins. All of the in vitro translated proteins gave the expected size products. The NQO1 gene ARE was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled ARE was incubated with the in vitro translated proteins. Bandshift and supershift assays were performed by previously described procedures (8Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Equimolar concentrations of the in vitro translated proteins were used in the gel shift and supershift experiments. Two micrograms of anti-V5 antibody or IgG was used in the supershift assays. Northern Analysis—Hep-G2 cells were treated for different time intervals with either Me2SO (control) or t-BHQ dissolved in Me2SO. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS without calcium and magnesium. The cells were scraped and RNA isolated using an RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. Ten micrograms of total RNA were run on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted by procedures as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding Bach1, NQO1, and GAPDH were labeled in separate reactions using a Prime-a-Gene labeling kit (Promega) or Nick translation kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used as probe to hybridize RNA blots. Prehybridization and hybridization were done according to a method described previously (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar, 24Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Hep-G2 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with pcDNA, pcDNA-Bach1, or pcDNA-Nrf2 using the Effectene transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed, and the ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP-IT kit from Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, proteins and DNA were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in media for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and treated with glycine to stop fixation. The cells were scraped in PBS containing protease inhibitors, collected by centrifugation, lysed in SDS-lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, and sonicated for 20 cycles (20-s pulse and 30-s rest on ice). The sonication conditions were optimized by procedures as described in the manufacturer's instructions and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine generation of DNA fragments between 200 and 1000 base pairs in length. Sheared chromatin was immunocleared with protein G-agarose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. A portion of the precleared chromatin was stored and labeled as “input DNA.” The remaining chromatin was immunoprecipitated with IgG (control) and Bach1 and Nrf2 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially with wash buffers for 2 min each. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the antibody with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Formaldehyde cross-links were reversed by addition of 200 mm NaCl and heating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was purified using proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCR was performed using 1:10-diluted input DNA and 5 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA from a 100-μl DNA extraction with a primer pair spanning the human NQO1 gene ARE. The primers used were: forward, 5′-CAGTGGCATGCACCCAGGGAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCATGCCCCTTTTAGCCTTGGCA-3′. A 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide was used to separate and examine the PCR products. The PCR products were confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization with γ-32P-labeled human NQO1 gene ARE using the ExpressHyb hybridization protocol by procedures described in the manufacturer's instructions. Effect of Heme on ARE-mediated Gene Expression—Hep-G2 cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid hARE-Luc and Renilla luciferase as internal control, individually or in combination with pcDNA alone or pcDNA-Bach1 and/or pcDNA-Nrf2. After 36 h of transfection, heme was added to the culture medium at 10, 15, and 25 μm concentrations for 4 h as previously described (16Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed with 1× PBS, and cell lysates were prepared using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system kit (by procedures suggested in the manufacturer's protocol) and analyzed for luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. It is noteworthy that hemin (ferric protoporphyrin IX) is reduced inside the cells to heme (ferroprotoporphyrin IX). Nrf2 and Bach1 Localization and Immunofluorescence—Mouse hepatoma (Hepa-1) cells were grown on Lab-Tek II chamber slides in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were treated with 50 μm t-BHQ for 15 min, 1 h, and 2 h. Cells were then fixed in formalin from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA) and permeabilized with cold acetone from Fisher Scientific. The cells were probed with either Nrf2 (H-300) or Bach1 (C-20) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibodies from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) by procedures previously described (25Bloom D. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44675-44682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The cells were stained with Hoechst stain from Bio-Rad to visualize the nuclei. The fluorescent images were captured using appropriate filters in a Nikon eclipse TE 2000-U fluorescent microscope fitted with a Photometrics CoolSnap CF camera. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—HepG-2 cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates and treated with Me2SO or t-BHQ for 15 min or 2 h. At the end of treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in PBS using a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min. Biochemical fractionation of the cells was done using the Nuclear Extract kit (Active Motif) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cell pellet was suspended in"

https://openalex.org/W2018824203,"Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 are associated with limb and craniofacial defects in humans with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The molecular mechanism underlying these phenotypes is poorly understood. We show that ectopic expression of the related basic helix-loop-helix factor Hand2 phenocopies Twist1 loss of function in the limb and that the two factors have a gene dosage–dependent antagonistic interaction. Dimerization partner choice by Twist1 and Hand2 can be modulated by protein kinase A– and protein phosphatase 2A–regulated phosphorylation of conserved helix I residues. Notably, multiple Twist1 mutations associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome alter protein kinase A–mediated phosphorylation of Twist1, suggesting that misregulation of Twist1 dimerization through either stoichiometric or post-translational mechanisms underlies phenotypes of individuals with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2171216672,"Consumption of a naturally occurring polyphenol, resveratrol, in particular through drinking moderate amounts of red wine, has been suggested to be beneficial to health. A plethora of in vitro studies published demonstrate various anti-inflammatory actions of resveratrol. The aim of this research was to determine whether any of these anti-inflammatory effects translate in vivo in a rodent model of LPS induced airway inflammation. Resveratrol reduced lung tissue neutrophilia to a similar magnitude as that achieved by treatment with budesonide. This was associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostanoid levels. Interestingly, the reduction did not appear to be due to an impact on NF-κB activation or the expression of the respective genes as suggested by various in vitro publications. These results suggest that resveratrol may possess anti-inflammatory properties via a novel mechanism. Elucidation of this mechanism may lead to potential new therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1983575720,"Mutations in BRAF, a component of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK) cascade, are frequent in melanoma. It is important to understand how BRAF mutations contribute to malignant traits including anchorage- and growth factor-independence. We have previously shown that efficient activation of ERK in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) requires both adhesion to the extracellular matrix and growth factors. Mutant V599E BRAF is sufficient to promote ERK activation independent of adhesion and growth factors. Here, we analysed regulation of G1 cell cycle events in NHEM and human melanoma cells. We show that S phase entry in NHEM requires both adhesion and growth factor signaling through the MEK-ERK pathway. This control correlates with induction of cyclin D1 and downregulation of p27Kip1, two key G1 cell cycle events. In melanoma cells expressing V599E BRAF, cyclin D1 was constitutively expressed independent of adhesion but dependent upon MEK activation and nuclear accumulation of ERK. Reduction of cyclin D1 levels by RNA interference inhibited S phase entry in melanoma cells. Importantly, expression of V599E BRAF in NHEM was sufficient to promote cyclin D1 promoter activity in the absence of adhesion. Additionally, p27Kip1 levels were downregulated in V599E BRAF-expressing melanoma cells and active BRAF was sufficient to downregulate p27Kip1 in serum-starved NHEM. Thus, adhesion-growth factor cooperation, leading to efficient activation of ERK, regulates cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 levels in human melanocytes and mutant BRAF overrides adhesion-growth factor control of these two G1 cell cycle proteins in melanomas. These findings provide important insight into how BRAF mutations contribute to aberrant human melanocyte proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2141760038,"The human gene, human giant larvae (Hugl-1/Llg1 /Lgl1) has significant homology to the Drosophila tumour suppressor gene lethal(2)giant larvae (lgl). The lgl gene codes for a cortical cytoskeleton protein, Lgl, that binds Myosin II and is involved in maintaining cell polarity and epithelial integrity. The human protein, Hugl-1 contains several conserved functional domains found in Lgl, suggesting that these proteins may have closely related functions. Whether loss of Hugl expression plays a role in human tumorigenesis has so far not been extensively investigated. Thus, we evaluated tumour tissues from 94 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) for loss of Hugl-1 transcription and compared our findings with the clinical data from each of these patients. We found that Hugl-1 was lost in 75% of tumour samples and these losses were associated with advanced stage and particularly with lymph node metastases. Reduced Hugl-1 expression during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence occurring as early as in colorectal adenomas was detected by both immunohistochemical and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis. Functional assays with ecdysone-inducible cell lines revealed that Hugl-1 expression increased cell adhesion and decreased cell migration. Our studies thus indicate that downregulation of Hugl-1 contributes to CRC progression."

Here, we have demonstrated that TGFβ induces the expression of the adaptor molecule disabled-2 (Dab2) concomitant with the promotion of EMT. We show that TGFβ induces a transient accumulation of Dab2 to the membrane and increases Dab2 binding to β1 integrin. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of Dab2 expression in mouse mammary gland epithelial cells results in inhibition of integrin activation, shown by a decrease of both TGFβ-induced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and cellular adherence, leading to apoptosis and inhibition of EMT. Forced re-expression of human Dab2, not targeted by the mouse siRNA sequence, rescues cells from apoptosis and restores TGFβ-mediated integrin activation and EMT. These results are confirmed in the F9 teratocarcinoma cell line, a model for retinoic acid-induced visceral endoderm differentiation in which we demonstrate that ablation of retinoic acid-induced Dab2 expression levels, by stable siRNA silencing of Dab2, blocks visceral endoderm differentiation.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) 1The abbreviations used are: EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation; Dab2, disabled-2; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; NMuMG cells, normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; RA, retinoic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is a fundamental multistep process that occurs during both physiological and pathological states (1Savagner P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 2Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). By allowing cells to detach from the epithelial tissue where they originate and to migrate, such transitions are necessary for proper embryonic development. However, they also provide a way for epithelium-derived tumors from a benign stage to become invasive and metastasize throughout the body. It has been demonstrated that there is commonality in the signaling pathways regulating EMT during both embryonic development and tumor progression, suggesting that similar molecular mechanisms underlie these processes and raising the possibility that tumor metastasis might simply be considered as a reactivation of some aspects of the embryonic program of EMT. The process of EMT requires loss of cell-cell interaction and acquisition of fibroblastic morphology with increased expression of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin (3Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Among growth factors that can promote this structural conversion, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) has been well characterized as an important inducer of EMT during development as well as during cancerogenesis (4Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Indeed, although TGFβ is considered a tumor suppressor during the first stage of tumorigenesis, principally through its ability to cause growth arrest and apoptosis in many non-transformed epithelial cell types, numerous reports show that TGFβ can also promote tumor progression, particularly through its ability to promote EMT (4Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 5Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8621-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that blocking TGFβ signaling in transgenic mice that develop multifocal metastatic mammary tumors reduces mammary tumor intravasation and lung metastasis and increases mammary tumor cell apoptosis (6Muraoka R.S. Dumont N. Ritter C.A. Dugger T.C. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Easterly E. Roebuck L.R. Ryan S. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V. Arteaga C.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). TGFβ exerts its biological effects by inducing the formation of a heteromeric complex composed of type I and type II serine/threonine kinases receptors. The activated receptor complex, in turn, phosphorylates and activates the receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3. Once activated these Smads complex with the common mediator, Smad4, to transmit the signal to the nucleus, where the Smads regulate transcription of target genes through their interaction with a wide variety of transcriptional regulators (4Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). In addition, TGFβ has been shown to activate diverse parallel downstream pathways, for example, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, or p38 kinase (4Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Intensive investigation into the molecular mechanism of TGFβ-induced EMT in mammary epithelium has led to the identification of different mediators of this process including the Smads, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, RhoA, p38, and β1 integrin, among others (3Bhowmick N.A.

However, it is clear from the results that the process of EMT is quite complex, involving not only structural and cytoskeletal reorganization but also extensive genetic changes. Thus, much remains to be determined regarding the molecular events mediating a TGFβ-induced EMT. Disabled-2 (Dab2) was first identified as DOC-2, for differentially expressed in ovarian carcinoma (12Mok S.C. Wong K.K. Chan R.K. Lau C.C. Tsao S.W. Knapp R.C. Berkowitz R.S. Gynecol.

Dab2 has been shown to be involved in regulation of cytoskeleton-based functions by regulating cell positioning (14Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Xu X.X.

Homma K. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An important role for Dab2 in regulating the homeostasis of epithelial differentiation has been suggested (14Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a role recently confirmed by several genetic studies demonstrating a function for Dab2 in endodermal cell formation, differentiation, and organization (16Morris S.M.

Indeed, it has been reported that Dab2 interferes with mitogenic growth factor signal transduction (24Smith E.R. Capo-chichi C.D. He J. Smedberg J.L. Yang D.H. Prowse A.H. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3084-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Dab2 can also be a positive mediator of TGFβ signaling by bridging the heteromeric TGFβ receptor complex to the Smad proteins (29Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the biological role of Dab2 in TGFβ signaling has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report for the first time a role for Dab2 during TGFβ-induced EMT in normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells. NMuMG epithelial cells were chosen because they are a well established model system for studying TGFβ-induced EMT. We observed that during TGFβ-induced EMT in these cells, the expression of Dab2 is increased and Dab2 transiently accumulates in the membrane fraction and binds to β1 integrin. Furthermore, stable siRNA-mediated silencing of Dab2 in NMuMG cells results in inhibition of integrin activation, shown by a decrease of both TGFβ-induced FAK phosphorylation and cellular adherence, leading to apoptosis and inhibition of EMT. Thus, we propose a model in which Dab2 acts as a critical switch during TGFβ-mediated EMT, determining whether the cell proceeds toward an EMT rather than apoptosis. Cell Culture and Reagents—Non-transformed NMuMG epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). F9 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, NMuMG cells were plated onto culture dishes precoated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma). TGFβ2 was a generous gift from Genzyme Inc. (Cambridge, MA) and was used at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) was purchased from Sigma and was used at a final concentration of 100 nm. Antibodies to Dab2, β1 integrin, and FAK were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The antibody to phospho-397 FAK was purchased from BIOSOURCE. The antibody to phosphotyrosine 4G10 (PY) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The polyclonal antibody to Bim was purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies to Hsp90 and to N-cadherin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmids—The pSUPER siRNA vector was a gift from Dr. Xiao-Xi Li and has been previously described (30Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). To generate the pSUPER-Dab2si construct, a 19-nt sequence was selected from mouse Dab2 cDNA (5′-CAAATGGAGTCACCTCCTG-3′). Human Dab2 cDNA (WTDab2) has been described previously (29Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection—Stable transfected cell lines were generated by co-transfection of NMuMG cells with pSUPER-siDab2 or pSUPER (control vector), respectively (see above), and a plasmid expressing puromycin resistance, pPuro (Clontech). Cells were selected in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin and maintained as a population. NMuMG-siDab2humanDab2 cells were obtained by co-transfection of the human form of Dab2, WTDab2, with a plasmid expressing neomycin resistance, pSV2Neo. Cells were selected in medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml) and maintained as a population. A control population of cells was transfected with pSV2Neo alone. F9-siDab2 cells were generated by co-transfection of the pSUPER-siDab2 and pPuro plasmids. Cells were selected in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin and maintained as a population. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen. 20 μg of total RNA were denatured, size fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and immobilized by UV cross-linking. Equivalent loading of intact RNA was assured by visualization of ethidium bromide-stained 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands. pcDNA3-Dab2 vector (29Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was linearized with KpnI, purified using a Wizard Prep column (Promega), and used as a template for riboprobe synthesis. The Dab2 riboprobe was then generated by in vitro transcription by using SP6 polymerase and the RiboMAX kit (Promega). Blot was then hybridized to the [32P]-labeled-riboprobe overnight at 65 °C in northernMax Hyb buffer (Ambion), washed 3× 20 min with 0.5 SSC/0.1 SDS at 65 °C, 1× 20 min with 0.2 SSC/0.1 SDS at 65 °C, and then autoradiographed. Subcellular Fractionation, Western Blot, and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cytosolic and membrane fractionation was performed as described (28Hocevar B.A. Mou F. Rennolds J.L. Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3084-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed on 500 μg of the membrane lysates with β1 integrin antibody or normal mouse IgG overnight, followed by adsorption to Sepharose-protein G (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The beads were washed five times in lysis buffer, and samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer TNMG (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture Complete from Roche Diagnostic) followed by sonication and then centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and probed with the indicated primary antibody. Specific binding of antibodies was then detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Adhesion Assay—Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 1 ml of medium at 5 × 106 cells/ml. 100 μl of this cell suspension was added per well to a 96-well tissue culture plate and allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by washing. The color reaction substrate (MTT; 100 μl) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the formazan salt was dissolved in 100 μl of isopropanol. The optical density was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Apoptosis Assays—For DNA fragmentation assay, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and lysed in HL buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100). After centrifugation for 15 min at room temperature at 14,000 rpm, the supernatants were collected. The supernatants were extracted with an equal volume of phenol and then phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated at–20 °C with an equal volume of isopropanol and 0.1 volume of 5 m NaCl. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, the precipitated DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in Tris/EDTA, pH 8.0, containing DNase-free RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The electrophoresis was performed in 1× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) buffer on 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Apoptosis was also measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Diagnostics) following the kit protocol. Briefly, cells were collected and resuspended in 200 μl of kit lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant, containing the cytoplasmic fraction, was applied to streptavidin-coated microplates. A mix of biotinylated anti-DNA antibody and peroxidase-conjugated antihistone antibody was added to the wells, and binding was allowed for 3 h. The plates were washed thoroughly followed by the addition of 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazolin-sulfonate) (ABTS) substrate. Color development was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Disabled-2 (Dab2) Expression Is Increased during TGFβ-induced EMT—As shown in Fig. 1A by microscopic examination, treatment of NMuMG cells with TGFβ induces a drastic alteration in cell shape. Whereas untreated cells display the typical cuboidal cobblestone-like characteristic of epithelial cells, a 24-h treatment with TGFβ induces an elongated and spindle-shaped phenotype characteristic of fibroblasts (Fig. 1A) (31Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Confirming this morphologic analysis of a TGFβ-induced EMT, the biochemical results presented in Fig. 1B demonstrate that TGFβ treatment induces a progressive increase of N-cadherin, a fibroblastic marker (Fig. 1B) (3Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Because we have previously identified Dab2 as a TGFβ signaling molecule (29Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether its level of expression varies during TGFβ-induced EMT. As can be seen in Fig. 1C by immunoblot analysis of NMuMG cellular lysate, Dab2 levels are significantly up-regulated in response to TGFβ. Analysis of the mRNA levels of Dab2 by Northern blot shows a TGFβ-induced increase in Dab2 mRNA in accordance with the corresponding increase in Dab2 protein levels (Fig. 1D). This result was also confirmed by reverse transcription PCR (data not shown). Taken together, these data show a significant up-regulation of Dab2 during TGFβ-induced EMT, suggesting a potential role of Dab2 during this process. Dab2 Is Necessary during TGFβ-induced EMT—To determine the significance of the increase in Dab2 levels in cells undergoing an EMT, we decided to suppress Dab2 activity. Because no dominant negative form of Dab2 exists, we chose to stably down-regulate Dab2 expression by using a mammalian expression vector that directs intracellular synthesis of small interfering RNA (30Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). NMuMG cells that stably express Dab2 siRNA (NMuMG-siDab2), but not the control cells expressing the empty vector (NMuMG-siControl), exhibited a reduction in the basal expression levels of Dab2 as well as in the induction of Dab2 during the differentiation process induced by TGFβ (Fig. 2A). We then monitored TGFβ-induced EMT in these cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, we observed that 24 h of TGFβ treatment in NMuMG-siDab2 cells does not result in EMT, whereas under the same conditions TGFβ can induce a mesenchymal transition in control cells. We confirmed that the silencing of Dab2 expression blocks TGFβ-mediated fibroblastic conversion by demonstrating that there was a concomitant loss in the up-regulation of N-cadherin levels in response to TGFβ in NMuMG-siDab2 cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, in addition to retaining their epithelial morphology in response to TGFβ, we observed that some NMuMG-siDab2 cells displayed apoptosis-like morphological changes. These cells rounded-up and became detached following TGFβ treatment (Fig. 2B). The presence of DNA fragmentation visualized by oligonucleosomal DNA ladder formation on agarose gel (Fig. 2D) or quantified by ELISA (Fig. 2E) confirmed that, indeed, cell death through apoptosis was occurring upon treatment of the NMuMG-siDab2 cells with TGFβ. We (52Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and others (32Reginato M.J. Mills K.R. Paulus J.K. Lynch D.K. Sgroi D.C. Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the BH3 domain-only pro-apoptotic protein Bim is induced during apoptosis. We, therefore, examined whether TGFβ-mediated apoptosis in NMuMG-siDab2 cells is associated with changes in Bim expression. Indeed, we found that TGFβ treatment provokes a marked increase in Bim expression levels in NMuMG-siDab2 cells, in contrast to NMuMG-siControl cells (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these results suggest that Dab2 up-regulation is necessary for a proper TGFβ-induced EMT, apparently required to prevent apoptosis. To determine whether the role of Dab2 in EMT and differentiation is specific to TGFβ and/or the NMuMG cells, we investigated Dab2 levels in response to other differentiation factors and in another differentiation model. Previous reports have shown that Dab2 is induced in response to RA-induced differentiation in the F9 teratocarcinoma cell line in which RA induces embryonic stem cell-like epithelial cells to differentiate into visceral endoderm (24Smith E.R. Capo-chichi C.D. He J. Smedberg J.L. Yang D.H. Prowse A.H. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47303-47310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). First, we investigated whether RA could induce differentiation in NMuMG cells and whether there was a concomitant increase in the level of Dab2 as demonstrated above with TGFβ stimulation. The results demonstrate that RA (100 nm) significantly increases Dab2 protein levels in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3A) that is accompanied with an increase in the differentiation marker N-cadherin (Fig. 3A) and morphological alteration characteristic of EMT (data not shown). We next chose to analyze the role of Dab2 in the F9 teratocarcinoma cell line. As shown in Fig. 3B, and similar to that previously reported (24Smith E.R. Capo-chichi C.D. He J. Smedberg J.L. Yang D.H. Prowse A.H. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47303-47310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), RA (100 nm) dramatically induces Dab2 expression in F9 cells in a time-dependent fashion with maximal effects observed following 72 h. RA treatment of F9 cells has also been shown to be accompanied by growth suppression (24Smith E.R. Capo-chichi C.D. He J. Smedberg J.L. Yang D.H. Prowse A.H. Godwin A.K. Hamilton T.C. Xu X.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47303-47310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and morphological alteration phenotypic of cells differentiating into visceral endoderm (Fig. 3D) and characterized by the endoderm differentiation marker GATA-4 (Fig. 3C). In F9 cells, in which we stably ablated Dab2 expression levels with the Dab2 siRNA vector (F9-siDab2), we did not observe RA induction of Dab2 protein levels (Fig. 3B), and the cells failed to differentiate into visceral endoderm (Fig. 3D) and express the endoderm marker GATA-4 (Fig. 3C). As described above for NMuMG and TGFβ, F9 cells stably expressing the siRNA to Dab2 not only failed to differentiate in response to the differentiating agent RA but instead proceeded to undergo apoptosis as analyzed by induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that Dab2 protein levels mediate an important regulatory step in the differentiation process and that inhibition in the induction of Dab2 levels in the presence of a differentiating agent (i.e. TGFβ or RA) induces apoptosis instead of differentiation. Re-expression of Dab2 Rescues TGFβ-induced Apoptosis and Restores TGFβ-induced EMT—To confirm that the effects observed in NMuMG-siDab2 cells are specific to a down-regulation of Dab2 expression, we attempted to restore Dab2 expression in these cells. Because the siRNA sequence that we used targets only mouse Dab2, we stably transfected a cDNA encoding the human form of Dab2 to ectopically re-express Dab2 protein. As shown in Fig. 4A, the human form of Dab2 is not targeted by stable expression of mouse Dab2 siRNA and is stably expressed in the cells. Restoration of Dab2 expression in NMuMG-siDab2 cells reverses the apoptotic effects of TGFβ and, most importantly, restores TGFβ-induced EMT as depicted morphologically in Fig. 4B. Up-regulation in the expression of the fibroblastic marker N-cadherin in response to TGFβ is restored in the cells (NMuMG-siDab2-humanDab2) re-expressing human Dab2 (Fig. 4C). We also confirmed that re-expression of Dab2 abrogated TGFβ-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4D) and TGFβ-induced Bim expression (Fig. 4E). Integrins Prevent Apoptosis during TGFβ-induced EMT— We next explored the possible mechanism whereby the absence or down-regulation of Dab2 mediates apoptosis in response to TGFβ. Rosenbauer et al. (15Rosenbauer F. Kallies A. Scheller M. Knobeloch K.P. Rock C.O. Schwieger M. Stocking C. Horak I. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have previously reported that Dab2 can augment bone marrow-derived macrophage adhesion. We, therefore, compared the adhesive capability of NMuMG-siDab2 cells to NMuMG-siControl cells. As seen in Fig. 5A, 2–4 h after seeding the cells in tissue culture plates most of the NMuMG-siDab2 cells were still “rounded up” compared with the control cells, which had begun to exhibit an adhered and “spread-out” shape. Quantitatively, NMuMG cells that lack Dab2 were ∼50% less adherent than control NMuMG cells (Fig. 5B). We, therefore, hypothesized that the decreased adherence and spreading observed in NMuMG-siDab2 cells could play a role in the ability of TGFβ to induce apoptosis in these cells. Previous results in the NMuMG/TGFβ EMT model have demonstrated that integrin β1 is required for TGFβ-mediated EMT when cells were grown on collagen-coated dishes (8Bhowmick N.A. Zent R. Ghiassi M. McDonnell M. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46707-46713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the loss of adhesion in cells with the down-regulated Dab2 expression reported above could be due to lack of integrin engagement. Confirming the work of Bhowmick et al. (8Bhowmick N.A. Zent R. Ghiassi M. McDonnell M. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46707-46713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the results demonstrate that the RGD peptide, which blocks integrin β1, when added to NMuMG cells is able to block TGFβ-in"

An elevated level of homocysteine in vivo and in cell culture systems results in a decrease in the activity of cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx1), an intracellular antioxidant enzyme that reduces hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides. In this study, we show that homocysteine interferes with GPx1 protein expression without affecting transcript levels. Expression of the selenocysteine (SEC)-containing GPx1 protein requires special translational cofactors to “read-through” a UGA-stop codon that specifies SEC incorporation at the active site of the enzyme. These factors include a selenocysteine incorporation sequence (SECIS) in the 3′-untranslated region of the GPx1 mRNA and cofactors involved in the biosynthesis and translational insertion of SEC. To monitor SEC incorporation, we used a reporter gene system that has a UGA codon within the protein-coding region of the luciferase mRNA. Addition of either the GPx1 or GPx3 SECIS element in the 3′-untranslated region of the luciferase gene stimulated read-through by 6–11-fold in selenium-replete cells; absence of selenium prevented translation. To alter cellular homocysteine production, we used methionine in the presence of aminopterin, a folate antagonist, co-administered with hypoxanthine and thymidine (HAT/Met). This treatment increased homocysteine levels in the media by 30% (p < 0.01) and decreased GPx1 enzyme activity by 45% (p = 0.0028). HAT/Met treatment decreased selenium-mediated read-through significantly (p < 0.001) in luciferase constructs containing the GPx1 or GPx3 SECIS element; most importantly, the suppression of selenium-dependent read-through was similar whether an SV40 promoter or the GPx1 promoter was used to drive transcription of the SECIS-containing constructs. Furthermore, HAT/Met had no effect on steady-state GPx1 mRNA levels but decreased GPx1 protein levels, suggesting that this effect is not transcriptionally mediated. These data support the conclusion that homocysteine decreases GPx1 activity by altering the translational mechanism essential for the synthesis of this selenocysteine-containing protein. Hyperhomocysteinemia contributes to vascular dysfunction and an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Normal plasma homocysteine levels range from 5 to 15 μm (1Jacobsen D.W. Gatautis V.J. Green R. Robinson K. Savon S.R. Secic M.

Chem. 1993; 39: 1764-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar); however, clinical studies suggest that high normal levels may contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. Elevated levels of homocysteine contribute to endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of vascular injury in atherogenesis (3Lawrence de Koning A.B. Werstuck G.H. Zhou J. Austin R.C. Clin. Biochem. 2003; 36: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In animal models of hyperhomocysteinemia, such as the heterozygous cystathionine β-synthase-deficient (CBS+/–) mouse, a modest doubling of homocysteine levels is sufficient to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses in mesenteric arteries that have normal endothelium-independent vasodilator responses (4Eberhardt R.T. Forgione M.A. Cap A. Leopold J.A. Rudd M.A. Trolliet M. Heydrick S. Stark R. Klings E.S. Moldovan N.I. Yaghoubi M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Farber H.W. Cohen R. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). CBS+/– mice have other detectable signs of oxidative stress, including a deficiency in acetylcholine-stimulated cGMP accumulation in isolated aorta, an increase in immunodetectable aortic 3-nitrotyrosine, and an increase in the levels of plasma F2-isoprostanes (4Eberhardt R.T.

We have proposed that homocysteine contributes to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent inactivation of nitric oxide by decreasing the activity of cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx1), 1The abbreviations used are: GPx1, cellular glutathione peroxidase; Hcy, homocysteine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcriptase; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; UTR, untranslated region; SEC, selenocysteine; SECIS, SEC incorporation sequence; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; hSECIS, human SECIS; GPx3, plasma glutathione peroxidase; HAT, hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine; CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase. a major intracellular antioxidant enzyme. In vivo, modest hyperhomocysteinemia decreases GPx1 activity (5Weiss N. Zhang Y.Y. Heydrick S. Bierl C. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, in cultured endothelial cells, micromolar concentrations of homocysteine are sufficient to decrease the activity of this important antioxidant enzyme (6Weiss N. Heydrick S. Zhang Y.Y.

The molecular mechanism by which homocysteine decreases GPx1 activity is as yet unclear. GPx1 mRNA has been shown to be decreased in cells treated with supraphysiological (5 mm) concentrations of homocysteine (8Upchurch Jr., G.R. Welch G.N. Fabian A.J. Freedman J.E. Johnson J.L.

GPx1 is one of several selenocysteine-containing proteins (10Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), the expression of which is known to be regulated post-transcriptionally by selenium, which increases GPx1 mRNA stability (11Baker R.D. Baker S.S. LaRosa K. Whitney C. Newburger P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Insertion of selenocysteine in the protein involves read-through of a UGA-stop codon that specifies selenocysteine incorporation. Many cofactors are involved in the translational incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine, including cis-acting signals, such as a selenocysteine incorporation sequence (SECIS) in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the GPx1 mRNA (12Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Other cofactors for selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes include the following: selenium; enzymes involved in the synthesis of SEC; a tRNA specific for the selenocysteine amino acid (tRNAsec) that has an anticodon to recognize the UGA; an elongation factor for selenocysteine incorporation (eFsec); and a SECIS-binding protein (SBP2) (12Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 13Shen Q. Leonard J.L. Newburger P.E. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 519-525PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stadtman T.C.

Sci. 2002; 3: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because of the specialized mechanism of translation required for selenocysteine incorporation, we analyzed the potential interference of homocysteine with selenocysteine incorporation and GPx1 activity in cultured cells. Our data suggest that homocysteine interferes with GPx1 translation, resulting in a decrease in cellular production of this antioxidant enzyme. Cell Culture—BAEC and COS7 cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). For selenium depletion, COS7 cells were grown in DMEM with 0.1% FCS for 5 days prior to treatment. To increase levels of homocysteine in culture, we added the following: HAT/Met, which includes aminopterin (800 nm), a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, to decrease cellular folate and homocysteine remethylation; hypoxanthine (200 μm) and thymidine (32 μm), to compensate for adverse effects of aminopterin on nucleotide biosynthesis; and excess (1 mm) methionine (Met), to increase homocysteine synthesis. Homocysteine Measurements—Cell culture media were collected after 48 h of HAT/Met treatment and briefly centrifuged to remove any cellular debris. Total homocysteine (free homocysteine plus homocysteine derived from homocystine or mixed disulfides) levels were measured by electrochemical detection of reduced samples that were deproteinated prior to injection into a C18 column on a BAS LC200A. Samples and standards were mixed with an internal standard to control for sample processing and recovery. Known concentrations of homocystine were reduced and used to generate a standard curve. As little as 2 pmol of homocysteine could be reproducibly detected in this system. GPx1 Enzyme Activity—Cell pellets were collected and sonicated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After the removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, samples were stored at –80 °C. Enzyme activity was determined by an indirect assay that links GPx1-mediated oxidation of glutathione with the recycled reduction of GSSG to GSH by glutathione reductase using NADPH as a reductant. Enzyme activity is calculated from the change of absorbance at 340 nm over time, a measure of NADPH oxidation. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cells cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with the addition of an optional DNase I step to remove residual DNA. For the RT reactions, 1 μg of RNA was used to generate cDNA with oligo(dT) primers and the Moloney murine leukemia virus polymerase according to the RT-for-PCR kit of Clontech. The 20 μl of cDNA mixture was diluted with water to a final volume of 100 μl, aliquoted, and stored frozen at –80 °C. An 833-bp band specific for GPx1 cDNA was detected by PCR with the forward primer LP7F (CTCCCCTTACAGTGCTTGTTCG) and the reverse primer LP10B (CTTTATAGTGGGAACTCGCC). PCR conditions are as follows: an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 PCR cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 63 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. A 938-bp G3PDH fragment was generated in a separate PCR using commercially available human G3PDH amplimers (Clontech). DNA fragments were separated on 3% 3:1 Nusieve-agarose gels (BioWhittaker) and detected by ethidium bromide fluorescence. Luciferase Constructs—The pGL2 UGA and pGL2 UAA vectors were a kind gift from Dr. Donna Driscoll (16Lesoon A. Mehta A. Singh R. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These vectors are modified from the Promega pGL2 control vector. Briefly, the pGL2 UGA vector contains a TGA codon substituted for the glycine 38 codon of the luciferase protein-coding region and has a PvuII site in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the luciferase gene. The pGL2 UGA has an SV40 promoter and enhancer to drive transcription. To add the GPx1 SECIS element to the pGL2 UGA vector, a human GPx1 cDNA construct (5Weiss N. Zhang Y.Y. Heydrick S. Bierl C. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12503-12508Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was digested with AvrII and HindIII to isolate a 215-bp fragment that overlaps the portion of the GPx1 3′-UTR containing the SECIS element. After using Klenow polymerase in a reaction to fill in the restriction endonuclease overhangs, the fragment was ligated to the PvuII enzyme-digested pGL2 UGA vector. Clones were sequenced to identify those with a single copy of the insert in either the sense (UGA/hSECIS/S) or antisense (UGA/hSECIS/AS) orientation. A similar strategy was used to add the GPx1 SECIS element to the pGL2 UAA vector, which has a TAA codon substituted for the glycine 38 codon, creating UAA/hSECIS/S and UAA/hSECIS/AS. The starting vector and the UGA/hSECIS/S and UGA/hSECIS/AS were further modified by replacing the SV40 promoter with a GPx1 promoter fragment that includes ∼540 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site and 46 bp of the 5′-untranslated region of the GPx1 gene. This modification was accomplished by replacing the KpnI/HindIII fragment in each of the SV40 promoter vectors with a KpnI/HindIII fragment containing the GPx1 promoter. The resulting constructs were denoted GPx1/UGA, GPx1/hSECIS/S, and GPx1/hSECIS/AS. A fragment of the plasma GPx (GPx3) 3′-UTR was amplified with the forward primer CCCAGCTGTGCCTACAGGTATGCGTGATTG and the reverse primer CCCAGCTGAAGCCAGTGGACCAGTGAGGGGTGA. The resulting 620-bp fragment has one internal PvuII site;: after PvuII digestion, the 500-bp fragment, which overlapped the SECIS element, was cloned into the PvuII site of the pGL2 UGA vector. The sense (GPx3/SECIS 500/S) and antisense (GPx3/SECIS 500/AS) constructs were used for transfections. Transfections and Read-through Assays—COS7 cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates in DMEM with 0.1% fetal calf serum (FCS), in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml sodium selenite. After 5 days of growth, each well was transfected with 2 μg of luciferase construct, 20 ng of cytomegalovirus Renilla construct, and 5 μl of Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 2 h. After removal of the transfection media, cells were treated with the low serum media plus or minus additives. Cells were harvested 48 h later, and luciferase and Renilla luciferase measurements were made using dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Turner TD-20e luminometer. All luciferase activities were corrected for Renilla luciferase activities before any other comparisons were made. Western Blot—Lysates were prepared as for the GPx1 assay with the addition of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Protein concentrations were measured by the bicinchoninic assay using reagents from Pierce. Samples (50 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) that were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse anti-GPx1 monoclonal antibody (MBL, Woburn, MA) and a polyclonal rabbit anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma or Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect immune complexes. GPx1 Enzyme Activity—GPx1 activity in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) can be reduced by as little as 25 μm homocysteine (Fig. 1A). BAEC were treated with HAT, to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase and homocysteine remethylation, and Met, to increase intracellular levels of homocysteine. Both folate restriction (17Antony A. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and methionine supplementation have been shown to increase production of homocysteine in a variety of cells (18Christensen B. Refsum H. Vintermyr O. Ueland P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HAT/Met treatment resulted in a decrease in GPx1 activity similar to that achieved with 100 μm homocysteine. The GPx1 activity of cells treated with 25 μm homocysteine was further suppressed by the addition of adenosine (50 μm), a cofactor required for S-adenosylation of homocysteine and methionine, in the presence of 10 μm erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor. COS7 cells could be grown in media supplemented with only 0.1% FCS, allowing for depletion of cellular selenium, which is present in normal fetal calf serum. After 7 days of selenium depletion, GPx1 activity is decreased by ∼75% compared with the activity in cells cultured in 0.1% FCS media supplemented with 10 ng/ml sodium selenite. The activity in cells cultured in 0.1% FCS media supplemented with 10 ng/ml sodium selenite is nearly the same as the activity of cells grown in 10% FCS media without additional selenium supplementation (data not shown). Cells supplemented with 1 ng/ml sodium selenite have no apparent increase in GPx1 activity over those grown with no added selenium, suggesting that there is a threshold level of selenium supplementation necessary to increase the production of GPx1. HAT/Met treatment decreased GPx1 activity by 42% in COS7 cells cultured in selenium-replete cells (Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, we found that HAT/Met treatment of COS7 cells increases the cellular release of homocysteine into the media by 30% (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Homocysteine levels are increased by HAT/Met production in COS7 cells. Cells were grown for 7 days in DMEM, 0.1% FCS, with or without 10 ng/ml sodium selenite. Total homocysteine was measured in media collected after 48 h of HAT/Met treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GPx1 mRNA—To determine whether the effects of low levels of homocysteine or HAT/Met treatment affected GPx1 mRNA levels, we used RT-PCR of RNA isolated from COS7 cells that were treated for 48 h with HAT/Met or 100 μm homocysteine (Fig. 3). As has been shown previously (11Baker R.D. Baker S.S. LaRosa K. Whitney C. Newburger P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), selenium increases the levels of GPx1 mRNA by ∼2-fold. Treatment with HAT/Met or 100 μm homocysteine had no effect on the steady-state levels of GPx1 mRNA. Selenium-dependent UGA Read-through—GPx1 expression relies on a unique translational mechanism to incorporate selenocysteine at a UGA codon; thus, we next determined whether treatments that increase homocysteine production can affect read-through of the UGA codon during mRNA translation. To accomplish this end, we utilized a luciferase reporter gene with a substitution of a UGA codon for a glycine codon (GGA) in the protein-coding region of the luciferase mRNA (pGL2 UGA). Theoretically, in the absence of selenium and other necessary cofactors for selenocysteine incorporation, read-through of the UGA to produce a full-length functional luciferase protein would occur infrequently. Therefore, to promote read-through of the UGA as a site for selenocysteine incorporation rather than as a site for termination of translation, the human GPx1 SECIS element was inserted in the 3′-UTR of the luciferase gene in the sense (hSECIS/S) orientation (Fig. 4A). As a negative control for random effects of the SECIS element on luciferase expression, constructs were made with the SECIS element in the antisense orientation (hSECIS/AS). To assess any effect of the GPx1 promoter on luciferase expression, the SV40 promoter was replaced by the GPx1 promoter, resulting in the vectors GPx1/UGA, GPx1/hSECIS/S, and GPx1/hSECIS/AS (Fig. 4A). First, the activity of the pGL2 UGA was compared with that of a control vector without the UGA mutation in the luciferase gene. The activity of the control construct was over 100,000-fold higher than that of the pGL2 UGA (p < 0.0001), consistent with the role of the UGA mutation as a stop codon. The expression of the control vector was unaffected by the addition of selenium. In constructs with the UGA mutation, production of luciferase only occurs in the presence of selenium when a SECIS element is in the sense orientation, such as in the GPx1/hSECIS/S or UGA/hSECIS/S (Fig. 4B). By contrast, the pGL2 UAA constructs had no detectable luciferase activity in the presence or absence of selenium, and the SECIS element had no effect on luciferase activity. In the absence of selenium, the activity of GPx1/hSECIS/S is identical to the activity of the GPx1 construct that lacks the SECIS element (GPx1/UGA) or that of the construct that has the SECIS element in the antisense orientation (GPx1/hSECIS/AS), whether or not selenium is present. Similarly, the activity of the UGA/hSECIS/S in the absence of selenium is identical to the activity of the pGL2 UGA vector or the antisense construct (UGA/hSECIS/AS) with or without selenium. The levels of luciferase activity from cells transfected with the GPx1 promoter constructs is almost 2-fold higher than that of cells transfected with the corresponding SV40 promoter constructs, suggesting that the GPx1 promoter has higher transcriptional activity in COS7 than the SV40 promoter. The selenium-induced increase in UGA read-through, however, is similar (nearly 6-fold) with either the UGA/hSECIS/S or the GPx1/hSECIS/S. Overall, these data show that expression involves selenocysteine incorporation as read-through production of luciferase requires both selenium and the SECIS element and that the read-through is specific for the UGA-codon as the UAA-codon did not allow for selenium-dependent expression. To test the effects of homocysteine on read-through expression, we treated transfected cells with HAT/Met in the presence or absence of selenium (Fig. 4, C and D). In the presence of selenium, HAT/Met treatment caused a significant reduction of read-through of both the GPx1/hSECIS/S (Fig. 4C) and the UGA/hSECIS/S (Fig. 4D) constructs. Similar reduction in read-through expression was obtained when cells were treated with 100 μm homocysteine (data not shown). No significant changes were found with the antisense constructs or in the absence of selenium. These data suggest that the HAT/Met-mediated reduction of selenium-dependent UGA read-through is primarily a translational event in this cell system, as the construct with the GPx1 promoter showed no additional suppression by this treatment. To test whether the HAT/Met suppression of read-through was specific for the GPx1 SECIS element, we compared the function of the GPx3 SECIS element in this assay system. The GPx1 SECIS element has been defined as a form 1 SECIS element, whereas the GPx3 SECIS element has been defined as a form 2 SECIS element on the basis of the predicted secondary structure of the stem-loop region that directs selenocysteine incorporation (19Grundner-Culemann E. Martin G.W. II I Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As expected, there was no read-through if the GPx3 SECIS was in the antisense orientation (data not shown). Selenium stimulates read-through when the GPx3 SECIS element was in the sense orientation and, as with the GPx1 SECIS element, this read-through is significantly affected by HAT/Met treatment (p < 0.005) (Fig. 4E). Immunodetection of GPx1—To confirm the effects of HAT/Met treatment on the expression of the GPx1 protein, we performed Western blots (Fig. 5). After adjusting for the slight lane-to-lane variation in immunodetectable actin levels, HAT/Met treatment leads to a maximum 50% reduction in immunodetectable GPx1, whereas 100 μm homocysteine reduces GPx1 by ∼20%. Overall, these data suggest that an increase in cellular homocysteine results in a decrease in GPx1 activity because of a decrease in the translation of this protein. Current views hold that homocysteine increases vascular oxidative stress (20Title L.M. Cummings P.M. Giddens K. Genest Jr., J.J. Nassar B.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 36: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to a proatherogenic and prothrombotic state. Clinical studies suggest that modest increases in plasma homocysteine levels increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. In vivo, a mere doubling of homocysteine levels is sufficient to cause some proatherogenic changes, such as endothelial dysfunction, reduced bioavailable nitric oxide, increased lipid peroxidation, and increased adhesion molecule expression (4Eberhardt R.T.

In models of hyperlipidemia, moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (i.e. levels of total homocysteine of ∼50 μm or ∼5-fold higher than normal homocysteine levels) has been found to accelerate atherogenesis (21Hofmann M.A. Lalla E.

Mdm2 bound to the Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 complex in primary cells and in cells containing inactivated p53 or p14/p19ARF, a regulator of Mdm2. Further analysis revealed that Mdm2 directly bound to Nbs1 but not to Mre11 or Rad50.

Mdm2 co-localized with Nbs1 to sites of DNA damage following γ-irradiation. Notably, Mdm2 overexpression inhibited DNA double strand break repair, and this was independent of p53 and ARF, the alternative reading frame of the Ink4alocus.

Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar).

Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another report showed that expression of an alternatively spliced variant of Mdm2 increased the proliferation of p53-null MEFs and increased cancer incidence in mice (33Steinman H.A. Burstein E.

Additionally, lymphomas arising in humans and mice that have inactivated p53 also frequently overexpress Mdm2 protein (28Alt J.R. Greiner T.C. Cleveland J.L. Eischen C.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1442-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L.

Finally, tumor cells lacking p53 died when treated with Mdm2 antisense (36Wang H. Yu D. Agrawal S. Zhang R. Prostate. 2003; 54: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Combined, these reports suggest that Mdm2 has functions independent of p53 that contribute to transformation. Therefore, we sought to identify novel Mdm2-binding proteins that influenced tumor development independent of p53. We determined that Mdm2 bound to the M-N-R DNA repair complex in a p53-independent manner at sites of DNA double strand breaks and that Mdm2 inhibited efficient DNA repair, which was dependent on the Nbs1 binding domain in Mdm2. This finding suggests a novel role of Mdm2 in compromising DNA integrity. Silver Staining and Mass Spectrometry—HeLa cells were Dounce-homogenized in complete lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 300 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Total cellular protein (60 mg) was rotated with anti-Mdm2-conjugated beads (SMP14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C, washed in complete lysis buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Following silver staining, protein bands were excised and digested as described previously with slight modifications (37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). After separation on a reversed phase LC column, eluted peptides were analyzed on a Q-TOF Ultima tandem mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (Micromass/Waters, Toronto, Canada). The MS/MS data were processed using Masslynx software (Micromass), and the MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK) search engine was used to search the NCBI nonredundant data base. Protein identifications were based on a minimum random probability score of 25 and with a mass accuracy of 0.1 daltons. Cell Culture Conditions—HeLa, 293T, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, HT1080, HCT116, CLL, K562, NIH3T3, and IMR90 cell lines were cultured as described by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). p53–/–ARF–/–, p53–/–Mdm2–/–, and p53–/– MEFs were isolated as described previously (38Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA) and nonessential amino acids. Saos-2 cells (provided by Dr. Gerard Zambetti, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) were grown as indicated by ATCC. The HCC1937 (a gift from Dr. Kenneth Cowan, Eppley Institute, Omaha, NE) and ATLD3 cell lines (generously provided by Dr. Matthew Weitzman, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal calf serum. GM11261 (A-T lymphoblast), GM07166 fibroblasts (NBS), and GM07078 lymphoblasts (NBS) were purchased from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ) and cultured as their protocols indicated. Generation, Expression, and Purification of Mdm2 and Nbs1 Proteins—Wild-type murine Mdm2 cDNA (generously provided by Dr. Martine Roussel, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) was subcloned into the pGex2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), and wild-type human Nbs1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Tanya Paull, University of Texas, Austin, TX) was subcloned into the pET28B vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA). GST, GST-Mdm2, and GST-Nbs1 were purified from DH5α or BL21 Escherichia coli cells. GST and GST-Mdm2 bacterial supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl2, and stored at –80 °C for use in in vitro binding assays. For GST-Nbs1 and GST used in the Nbs1 reconstitution experiment (see below), glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were packed to a chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and GST-Nbs1 or GST bacterial supernatant was added. Following incubation, the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and GST-Nbs1 and GST purified protein were eluted as fractions with 10 mm glutathione. Fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fisher) to estimate protein concentration. Mammalian Vector Construction and Retroviral Infection—Murine wild-type (amino acids 1–489) and deletion mutant murine Mdm2 constructs (amino acids 198–489, 298–489, 198–400, and 349–489) (generously provided by Dr. Martine Roussel) were subcloned into pJ3H vector for expression of a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N terminus. Wild-type murine Mdm2 was used in PCR amplification to generate other HA-Mdm2 mutants (1–192, 1–314, and 198–314). Wild-type human Nbs1 cDNA (provided by Dr. John Petrini, Memorial Sloan Kettering, New York) and human Nbs1 mutants generated by restriction digestion were cloned into pCMVTag4 or pCMVTag2 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate FLAG-tagged proteins. HA- and FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant constructs were cloned into pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. Murine cells (NIH3T3 and p53–/– MEFs) were infected with an MSCV-IRES-green fluorescence protein (GFP) retrovirus (from Dr. Robert Hawley) encoding wild-type Mdm2, mutant Mdm2-(198–489), mutant Mdm2-(298–489) (gifts from Dr. Martine Roussel), or a control empty vector, as previously reported (38Zindy F.

Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1222-1230PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry immediately prior to analysis for GFP expression, which is an indicator of protein expression from the bicistronic retroviral vector, and only cell populations that were greater than 90% GFP-positive were utilized for analyses. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HA-tagged Mdm2 and/or FLAG-tagged Nbs1 constructs were transfected into 293T cells, and cells were collected for analysis 36 h later. For Western blots, all cells were Dounce-homogenized in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with antibodies specific to Mdm2 (SMP14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA (HA-probe, F-7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (M2; Sigma), Mre11, Rad50 (both from Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), or isotype control antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For wild-type Nbs1 reconstitution experiments (Fig. 4), 1 μg of purified GST or GST-Nbs1 protein was added to NBS fibroblast cell lysate, and Mdm2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Mdm2 antibody (SMP14). For nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, HeLa cell lysates were prepared as previously described (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and then frozen at–80 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were serially Western blotted with antibodies specific for HA (F-7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (M2) Mdm2 (SMP14), Rad50 (Novus Biologicals), Mre11 (Novus Biologicals or Oncogene Research, Boston, MA), Nbs1 (Novus Biologicals or BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), and β-actin (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or Supersignal (Pierce) were used to detect bound immunocomplexes. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Binding Experiments—Plasmids encoding p53, Bax, Nbs1, and Mre11 (generously provided by Drs. Arnold J. Levine (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ), Xu Luo (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE), Tanya Paull (University of Texas, Austin, TX), and John Petrini (Cornell University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York), respectively) were used to generate [35S]Met-labeled proteins by in vitro transcription and translation using TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega, Madison, WI). In vitro binding assays were performed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol). GST or GST-Mdm2 bacterial lysates bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with [35S]Metlabeled proteins at 4 °C. Samples were washed five times, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and 35S activity (decays/min/mm2) was quantified on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Primary human (IMR90) and NBS fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in methanol/acetone 6–8 h following γ-irradiation (12 Gy) with a cesium-137 source. Fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals). Following incubation with antibodies specific for Rad50 (1:150; Novus Biologicals), Nbs1 (1:150; Novus Biologicals), Mdm2 (1:1000; SMP14), and/or p53 (1:400; DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), fixed cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isthiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (1:200; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Coverslips were mounted to slides with Vectashield Mounting Media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Goettinger, Germany) with ×40 or ×63 magnification. DNA Damage Quantitation—Following infection (36 h) of NIH3T3 cells or p53–/– MEFs with wild-type Mdm2, Mdm2-(198–489), Mdm2-(298–489), or Mdm2-(198–400) encoded or empty MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviruses (see above), cells were γ-irradiated with 5 Gy from a cesium-137 source. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for specific intervals and harvested for comet assay analysis. Comet assays were performed under neutral conditions to optimize for detection of DNA double strand breaks, as directed by the manufacturer's protocol (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Samples were blinded, and DNA was stained with ethidium bromide. Multiple pictures per sample were taken by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon E600, Melville, NY) using a TRITC-HYQ filter. DNA damage quantitation was performed by computer scoring at least 50 cells per interval per cell line with TriTekCometScore™ software (TriTek Corp., Summerduck, VA). Tail moments were calculated by the software and represent the length of the comet tail multiplied by the percentage of DNA in the comet tail. Tail moment is a measurement of DNA double strand breaks (41Kobayashi H. Sugiyama C. Morikawa Y. Hayashi M. Sofuni T. MMS Commun. 1995; : 103-115Google Scholar, 42Collins A.R. Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 26: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Following data collection and tabulation, codes identifying each set of pictures were broken to reveal the identity of each sample. The Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 Complex Is Associated with Mdm2 Independent of p53—Mdm2 appears to have functions that are p53-independent (31Jones S.N. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Proc.

Prostate. 2003; 54: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), yet the pathways that mediate these activities are unclear. To uncover potentially novel Mdm2 oncogenic pathways, we isolated and identified proteins that specifically bound to Mdm2 independent of p53. Utilizing unfractionated HeLa cell extracts that express the papillomavirus E6 protein, which inactivates p53, endogenous Mdm2 was immunoprecipitated with an Mdm2-specific antibody. In Mdm2 immunoprecipitates, polypeptides of 200, 150, 115, 95, and 80 kDa were readily evident in silver-stained gels, whereas polypeptides of this size were absent in isotype control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The 150-, 95-, and 80-kDa protein bands were excised, trypsin-digested, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Seventeen peptides from the 150-kDa band, 21 peptides from the 95-kDa band, and nine peptides from the 80-kDa band matched sequences in Rad50, Nbs1, and Mre11, respectively (Fig. 1A). These three proteins comprise the M-N-R complex that is responsible for repairing double strand DNA breaks (1D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). To verify that the M-N-R complex was associated with Mdm2, Mdm2 and its associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell extracts and Western blotted with antibodies specific for Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50. All three proteins co-immunoprecipitated with the same Mdm2-specific antibody used in the previous immunoprecipitations but not with an isotype control antibody (Fig. 1B). To obtain further confirmation of the interaction between Mdm2 and the M-N-R complex, we overexpressed HA-tagged wild-type murine Mdm2 in 293T cells, which also lack functional p53. Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50 were clearly visible in HA immunoprecipitations and absent in isotype control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1C). For unclear reasons, we were unable to detect Mdm2 protein in immunoprecipitations of endogenous Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50. However, when co-transfections of FLAG-tagged Nbs1 and HA-tagged Mdm2 into 293T cells were performed, Mdm2 was detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations and absent in isotype control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1D). Thus, four lines of evidence indicate that the M-N-R complex can specifically associate with Mdm2 and that this interaction appears to occur in cells that lack functional p53. To further test whether p53 or the Mdm2 regulator ARF is required for the association of Mdm2 with the M-N-R complex, we evaluated multiple cell lines. Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50 co-immunoprecipitated with Mdm2 in p53–/–ARF–/– MEFs, whereas in immunoprecipitations with the control p53–/–-Mdm2–/– MEFs, none of the three proteins were detected (Fig. 2A). The slight differences in Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50 expression observed between the two genotypes of MEFs were due to a small difference in protein loading (see β-actin; Fig. 2A) and do not represent differences of the endogenous levels of these proteins in the different MEFs analyzed. Evaluation of human (MDA-MB-231, 293T, Saos-2, CLL, and K562) and murine tumor cell lines that lack functional p53 showed that Mdm2 was associated with the M-N-R complex (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9; and data not shown). Similarly, in whole cell lysates from human and mouse cells lacking ARF expression (MCF7, HT1080, HCT116, and NIH3T3), Mdm2 co-immunoprecipitated Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50 (Fig. 2B lanes 1, 6, and 7; data not shown). In addition, the M-N-R complex precipitated with Mdm2 in primary diploid human fibroblasts (IMR90; Fig. 2B lane 10) and in immortal murine fibroblasts (p53–/–ARF–/– MEFs; Fig. 2A), indicating that the association of Mdm2 with the M-N-R complex is not due to cellular transformation. The small variations in the levels of Nbs1, Mre11, and Rad50 co-immunoprecipitating with Mdm2 in the various cell lines (Fig. 2B) were repeatedly observed and appear to reflect differences in one or more of these proteins between the cell lines. Together, these results demonstrated that the interaction between Mdm2 and the M-N-R complex does not require"
https://openalex.org/W2075780070,"Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are among the most common malignancies in young men. We have previously documented that patients with GCT frequently produce serum antibodies directed against proteins encoded by human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) type K sequences. Transcripts originating from the env gene of HERV-K, including the rec-relative of human immunodeficiency virus rev, are highly expressed in GCTs. We report here that mice that inducibly express HERV-K rec show a disturbed germ cell development and may exhibit, by 19 months of age, changes reminiscent of carcinoma in situ, the predecessor lesion of classic seminoma in humans. This provides the first direct evidence that the expression of a human endogenous retroviral gene previously established as a marker in human germ cell tumors may contribute to organ-specific tumorigenesis in a transgenic mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2147076211,"A hallmark of plasma cells is the expression of syndecan-1, which has major functions in epithelial cells, in particular as the coreceptor of heparin-binding growth factors. We previously found that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a growth factor for malignant plasma cells. As amphiregulin (AREG) is another heparin-binding factor of the EGF family, we investigated its role in multiple myeloma (MM). Using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we show here that the AREG gene was expressed by purified primary myeloma cells from 65 patients and that the expression was higher than in normal bone marrow (BM) plasma cells or plasmablastic cells. AREG stimulated IL-6 production and growth of BM stromal cells. Using real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, we found that MM cells expressed ErbB receptors and that AREG promoted their growth. Furthermore, PD169540 (a pan-ErbB inhibitor) and IRESSA (an ErbB1-specific inhibitor) induced apoptosis of primary myeloma cells from 10/14 and 4/14 patients, respectively, and there was a synergistic effect with dexamethasone. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence that AREG plays an important role in the biology of MM and emphasize the advantages of using ErbB inhibitors, which might target myeloma cells as well as the tumor environment."
https://openalex.org/W1981721183,"Human Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a Cys(2)/His(2) zinc-finger-containing transcriptional factor, which is involved in multiple cellular pathways. Utilizing gene expression profiling to identify aberrantly expressed genes in ovarian cancer, we found that KLF2 was significantly and specifically downregulated in ovarian tumors. After reintroducing KLF2 into ovarian cancer cell lines, we observed decreased cell growth and increased sensitivity to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Analysis of genes that could be potential targets of KLF2 revealed that KLF2 negatively regulated WEE1 expression. WEE1 encodes a tyrosine kinase that regulates the G2/M cell cycle transition. Expression of KLF2 markedly repressed the transcription of WEE1 by directly binding to an SP1/CPBP motif located between -252 bp and the start codon of the WEE1 promoter. Both activation and zinc-finger domains of KLF2 were required for this suppression of Wee1 expression. In addition, we demonstrated that Wee1 expression prevents cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to DNA damage; however, this resistance was abolished by coexpression of KLF2, which inhibits WEE1 transcription. Thus, the level of WEE1 is regulated by KLF2 and enhanced KLF2 expression sensitizes cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis."

Thus, the involvement of hnRNP D in the maintenance of telomere DNA has been implied. hnRNP D consists of 306 amino acid residues and comprises two ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-type DNA/RNA-binding domains (BDs), BD1 (70–173) and BD2 (174–256), and a region rich in glycine and arginine residues (257–306) (4Kajita Y.

Essentially the same surfaces of the BDs are used for the interactions with DNA and RNA. Here, we present the structure of BD2 complexed with d(TTAGGG) determined by NMR. The interactions are decisively identified. The identified interactions have been fully confirmed through gel retardation experiments with series of mutant BD2s and mutant DNAs. It is known that the end of the chromosome possesses a 3′-overhang of the Gua-rich telomeric strand. The complex structure at atomic resolution reveals how the single-stranded Gua-rich telomeric strand is specifically recognized by hnRNP D. We have reported that hnRNP D has the ability to inhibit the formation of the RNA quadruplex structure (10Nagata T. Kurihara Y. Matsuda G. Saeki J. Kohno T. Yanagida Y. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, based on CD and NMR data, we demonstrate that BD2 can unfold the quadruplex of Gua-rich telomeric DNA into a single-stranded form upon binding. The effect of hnRNP D on telomerase activity is also examined. The results suggest how hnRNP D is involved in the maintenance of telomere DNA. Preparation of hnRNP D BD2 and Its Mutants—Non-labeled, 15N-labeled, and 13C,15N-labeled BD2s (amino acid residues Lys-176-Glu-261 of hnRNP D) were expressed and purified as reported previously (11Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Go M. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished with a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to its protocol. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Mutant BD2s with 6 His residues at the N-terminal were expressed and purified with a Ni affinity column (Qiagen). Preparation of DNA Oligomers—Non-labeled DNA oligomers, synthesized with a DNA synthesizer and purified by reverse phase HPLC, were purchased (Nippon Seihun) and further treated on a Dowex 50 cation exchange column as described previously (12Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 13C,15N-labeled d(TTAGGG) and d(GTTAGGGTTA) were synthesized by the hairpin extension method, using a Klenow fragment (3′-5′ exo–) (Daiichi Kagaku) with 13C,15N-labeled dNTPs (Nippon Sanso), and purified following the reported method (13Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). NMR and CD Spectroscopies—For NMR experiments, BD2 (2.0 mm) and d(TTAGGG) (2.4 mm) were dissolved in a solution comprising 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm [2H6]dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NaN3. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a quadruple resonance probe with X, Y, and Z gradients. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid was used as an internal chemical shift reference. The following NMR experiments were performed to assign the resonances of the complex and to obtain distance and dihedral angle constraints: NOESY, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), double quantum filtered COSY, rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; (ROESY), 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, HNHA, 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC, HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY and HNCA. Spectra were processed with XWIN-NMR (Bruker), NMRPipe (14Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

For CD experiments, d(TTAGGG), d(TTAGGGTTAGGG), and d(TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG) (15–60 μm) were dissolved in a solution comprising 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 150 mm KCl. BD2 was added step by step to each DNA sample. CD spectra were recorded with a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter with a 1-mm cell. From the CD spectrum of the DNA·BD2 complex, that for the corresponding protein was subtracted. Structure Determinations—1474 distance constraints (112 intraresidue, 386 sequential, 233 medium-range, and 561 long-range distance for BD2, 62 intraresidue and 25 sequential distance for d(TTAGGG), and 95 BD2-d(TTAGGG) intermolecular distance) were obtained for the complex from NOESY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra as described previously (10Nagata T.

Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) based on analysis of 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 15N chemical shifts. Eight dihedral angle constraints for χ1 were also obtained, together with stereospecific assignment of the β-methylene protons of AMX residues and the γ-methyl protons of valine residues. Additionally, in the later stage of the calculations, 48 distance constraints for 24 hydrogen bonds were included for slowly exchanging amide protons within the identified secondary structure elements and imino protons of bases. Structure calculations were carried out using distance and dihedral angle constraints (1649 constraints in total) with a simulated annealing protocol supplied with X-PLOR Version 3.8 (18Nilges M.

None of them violated the distance constraints by more than 0.4 Å or dihedral angle constraints by more than 5°. A mean structure was obtained by averaging the coordinates of the 20 structures, and a restrained energy-minimized mean structure was obtained by energy minimization of the mean structure under the constraints. The quality of the structures was evaluated with PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Gel Retardation Experiments—Cy5-labeled d(GTCTTAGGGCGA) (1 μm), with the d(TTAGGG) unit at the center, and BD2 (or mutant BD2) (10 μm) were incubated in a solution comprising 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.05 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min. The complexes were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 55:1) containing 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25% glycerol. Fluorescence of the gel was recorded with a FLA 2000 (Fuji Film). Telomerase Assay—Human telomerase was reconstituted as described previously (22Collins K. Gandhi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was prepared with a T7-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Human telomerase RNA (hTR) was transcribed from template DNA. hTERT and hTR were mixed to yield the human telomerase. Primer extension reaction with the reconstituted telomerase was carried out as described previously (23Izbicka E. Wheelhouse R.T. Raymond E. Davidson K.K. Lawrence R.A. Sun D. Windle B.E. Hurley L.H.

The products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and detected with a FLA 2000. Resonance Assignments and Structure Determination of the Complex—Sequential assignments of the main chain and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of hnRNP D BD2 complexed with d(TTAGGG) were made in the same way as reported for BD1 (10Nagata T. Kurihara Y. Matsuda G. Saeki J. Kohno T. Yanagida Y. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and BD2 (11Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y.

The assignments of the main chain HN and N resonances, together with those of Hδ2 and Nδ2 of Asn residues, are presented in red in Fig. 1; the assignments in the free state are also shown in black for reference. The BD2 residues that exhibited large chemical shift perturbation on complex formation and intermolecular NOEs to d(TTAGGG) are labeled. Many of these residues are directly involved in the recognition of telomere DNA, as described below. Sequential assignments of the resonances of d(TTAGGG) in the complex were made with the standard method as reported for other DNA (26Matsugami A. Okuizumi T. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28147-28153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and RNA (27Matsugami A. Kobayashi S. Ouhashi K. Uesugi S. Yamamoto R. Taira K. Nishikawa S. Kumar P.K.R. Katahira M. Structure. 2003; 11: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because of the 10% excess of d(TTAGGG) over BD2 in the solution, exchange cross-peaks between resonances corresponding to the free and complex states were observed for d(TTAGGG) in NOESY and ROESY spectra (data not shown). The resonance assignments of d(TTAGGG) in the complex were confirmed by these exchange cross-peaks, the resonance assignments of free d(TTAGGG) being accomplished beforehand. On the basis of resonance assignments, many intermolecular NOEs were identified (Fig. 1, B–D). The structure of the complex was calculated on the basis of distance and dihedral angle constraints. The structural statistics are shown in Table I. The r.m.s.d. of the 20 final structures versus the mean structure as to the backbone atoms of BD2, excluding loop 3 (181–214, 225–259), and all heavy atoms of DNA (T2-G5) was 0.55 ± 0.21 Å.

Open table in a new tab Structure of the Complex—Fig. 2A shows a stereo view of superposition of the 20 final structures of the complex. Fig. 2B shows the restrained energy-minimized mean structure of the complex. The overall structure of BD2 in the complex is essentially the same as that in the free state. BD2 in the complex exhibits a typical RNP-type fold, i.e. a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1, Lys-183-Gly-188; β2, Val-208-Pro-214; β3, Phe-225-Phe-230; and β4, Ser-250-Lys-255) packed against two α-helices (α1, Glu-195-Phe-205; and α2, Glu-233-Glu-241), as observed for BD2 in the free state (10Nagata T. Kurihara Y. Matsuda G. Saeki J. Kohno T. Yanagida Y. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, a short β-strand (β4–, Tyr-244-Val-247) was identified in loop 5 located between α2 and β4. A β-bulge structure was found in the Val-208-Ser-210 region of β2. These features were found in the free state as well. The backbone r.m.s.d. between the structures in the free and complex states of BD2 for the Val-181-Ser-259 region was 2.4 Å. The complex structure reveals that the Thy-2-Gua-4 segment of single-stranded d(TTAGGG) is specifically recognized by BD2 (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the Thy-1, Gua-5, and Gua-6 residues are located away from the interactive β-sheet surface of BD2, with no interaction with BD2. In fact, no intermolecular NOE to BD2 was observed for these residues. Thy-2 is recognized by three hydrogen bonds with BD2, T2O2-K255Hζ3, T2H3-E253Oϵ1(Oϵ2), and T2O4-Y244Hη (Fig. 3A). Of the 2 Thy residues, an H3 resonance was observed only for the Thy-2 residue, which is consistent with the formation of the hydrogen bond. Ade-3 is recognized through the stacking interaction with Phe-185, and by the hydrophobic interaction of A3H2 with A257CβH3 and M258CγH2 (Fig. 3B). Gua-4 is recognized through the stacking interaction with Phe-227 and by two hydrogen bonds, G4H1-M258O′ and Gua-4O6-Lys-183 Hζ3 (Fig. 3C). Among the 3 Gua residues, an H1 resonance was observed only for the Gua-4 residue, which is consistent with the formation of the hydrogen bond. It is notable that to make the interactions possible, Gua-4 takes on the syn conformation, which was directly supported by the experimental observation of a very strong G4H8-G4H1′ NOE. The other DNA residues take on the anti conformation. Additionally, the electrostatic interaction between the 5′-phosphate group of Gua-4 and the guanidinium group of Arg-223 was found. Confirmation of the Interactions through Gel Retardation Experiments and Chemical Shift Perturbation—The interactions identified in the complex were biochemically confirmed through gel retardation experiments using mutant BD2s. First, we recorded either a CD or 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of each mutant BD2 and then confirmed that all mutant BD2s retain similar overall folding to that of the wild type BD2. A drastic decrease in the intensity of the band corresponding to the protein·DNA complex was observed for the F185A and F227A mutants (Fig. 4), which confirms the importance of the Ade-3-Phe-185 and Gua-4-Phe-227 stacking interactions. Similarly, the large decreases observed for the E253A, A257G, and R223A mutants are consistent with the importance of the hydrogen bonding interaction between Thy-2 and Glu-253, the hydrophobic interaction between Ade-3 and Ala-257, and the electrostatic interaction between Gua-4 and Arg-223. The involvement of Met-258, Lys-183, Tyr-244, and Lys-255 in the interactions was also supported by the decreases observed for their mutants. As a control, Asn-217, which is not involved in the interaction in the complex structure, was mutated to an Ala residue. As expected, no decrease in the intensity was observed for N217A (Fig. 4). Gel retardation experiments were also carried out with mutant DNAs and wild type BD2. It was expected that replacement of the third Ade residue in the d(TTAGGG) unit of the DNA with a Gua residue would abolish the hydrophobic interactions with A257CβH3 and M258CγH2 and that replacement of the fourth Gua residue of the unit with an Ade residue would abolish the hydrogen bonding interactions with M258O′ and Lys-183 H3ζ. In fact, a decrease of 40–50% in the intensity of the complex band was observed for these mutant DNAs. The results confirm that the Ade-3 and Gua-4 residues are recognized through base-specific interactions, in addition to a more general stacking interaction with a Phe residue. In summary, the interactions identified in the complex structure were all supported by the gel retardation experiments. The vital role of the interactions involving the Thy-2-Ade-3-Gua-4 segment in the complex formation was further supported by chemical shift perturbation data. Large chemical shift perturbations were induced for aromatic resonances of BD2 on complex formation with d(TTAGGG). The spectral pattern of the aromatic resonances in the complex state was distinct from that in the free state. Then, each residue of d(TTAGGG) was replaced with a Cyt residue, and the spectral pattern of BD2 complexed with the mutant DNA was analyzed. When d(TCAGGG), in which Thy-2 is replaced with a Cyt residue, was added to BD2, a spectral pattern corresponding to free BD2 was observed in addition to one corresponding to complex BD2, the molar ratio of free:complex being ∼1:2 (data not shown). This indicates that some fraction of BD2 exists in a free state, due to the decrease in the affinity caused by the replacement of Thy-2 with a Cyt residue. The same phenomenon was observed when either Ade-3 or Gua-4 was replaced with a Cyt residue. Thus, the importance of the interactions involving Thy-2, Ade-3, and Gua-4 residues was confirmed. When Thy-1, Gua-5, or Gua-6 was replaced with a Cyt residue, in contrast, the spectral pattern of BD2 complexed with a mutant DNA was the same as that of BD2 complexed with the wild type DNA, no trace of the spectral pattern of free BD2 being detected (data not shown). This indicates that the interactions involving Thy-1, Gua-5, and Gua-6 are dispensable for the complex formation, if any. Unfolding of the Telomeric DNA Quadruplex on Binding of hnRNP D—It is known that DNA with the telomeric sequence tends to form a quadruplex under physiological ionic conditions. We have reported that hnRNP D has the ability to inhibit the formation of an RNA quadruplex (10Nagata T. Kurihara Y. Matsuda G. Saeki J. Kohno T. Yanagida Y. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether hnRNP D unfolds a preformed DNA quadruplex with the telomeric sequence or not. Under physiological ionic conditions, three DNAs, d(TTAGGG) (6-mer), d(TTAGGGTTAGGG) (12-mer), and d(TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG) (24-mer), gave a positive CD peak at either 260–265 or 290 nm (Fig. 5, A–C), both of which are established marker peaks for a quadruplex (28Balagurumoorthy P.

Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It was supposed that 6-, 12-, and 24-mer form a tetrameric parallel quadruplex, a dimeric antiparallel quadruplex, and a monomeric antiparallel quadruplex, respectively. Recently, the formation of a dimeric parallel quadruplex (30Kettani A. Gorin A. Majumdar A. Hermann T. Skripkin E. Zhao H. Jones R. Patel D.J. J. Mol.

Soc. 2004; 126: 8710-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) has been reported for the related sequences. These findings imply the possibility that 12-mer may form a dimeric parallel quadruplex as well and that 24-mer may form a monomeric parallel quadruplex to some extent. Nonetheless, the possible structures are all quadruplexes, and a positive CD peak at either 260–265 or 290 nm can still be used as a marker peak for quadruplexes. When hnRNP D BD2 was added to the DNA solution (15–60 μm), the intensity of these peaks decreased (Fig. 5, A–C). These results reveal that hnRNP D unfolds the preformed quadruplex of telomeric DNA on binding. For the 6-mer, the intensity of the marker peak at 260–265 nm decreases to half when the molar ratio of BD2 to DNA is four (Fig. 5A). For the 12-mer, the intensity of the marker peak at 260–265 nm decreases to half when the molar ratio of BD2 to DNA is eight (Fig. 5B). The 12-mer comprises two d(TTAGGG) sequences, so when the quadruplex is unfolded, two d(TTAGGG) sequences/12-mer DNA are released for binding of BD2. If this is taken into account, the extent of unfolding of the quadruplex can be regarded as comparable for the 6- and the 12-mer. For the 24-mer, the intensity of the marker peak at 290 nm decreases to half when the molar ratio of BD2 to DNA is 16:32 (Fig. 5C). Because the 24-mer comprises 4 d(TTAGGG) sequences, the extent of unfolding of the 24-mer quadruplex can also be regarded as roughly comparable with that of the 6- and 12-mer quadruplexes. Thus, the unfolding of the quadruplex is observed to the same extent for longer DNA. Unfolding of a telomeric DNA quadruplex by hnRNP D was revealed in other experiments. The chemical shift perturbations of hnRNP D BD2 caused by the addition of d(TTAGGG) in a single-stranded form and a quadruplex form were compared. In the first experiment, the d(TTAGGG) to be added was kept in a solution containing neither Na+ nor K+ ions, both of which are known to stabilize a quadruplex. The absence of imino proton resonances of the 3 Gua residues confirmed that d(TTAGGG) takes on a single-stranded form (data not shown). BD2 was also kept in a solution lacking Na+ and K+. In the second experiment, d(TTAGGG) to be added was kept in a solution containing 150 mm K+. Formation of the quadruplex under the conditions was confirmed by the observation of imino proton resonances of the 3 Gua residues at 10.5–11.5 ppm (data not shown), which is characteristic of the qua"

Computer analysis revealed that the cysteine and histidine residues were conserved among the potential AgrB homologous proteins, suggesting that the Agr quorum sensing system homologues might also exist in other Gram-positive bacteria.

In this study, we demonstrated that AgrB had endopeptidase activity, and identified 2 amino acid residues in AgrB (cysteine 84 and histidine 77) that might form a putative cysteine endopeptidase catalytic center in the proteolytic cleavage of AgrD at its C-terminal processing site. Computer analysis revealed that the cysteine and histidine residues were conserved among the potential AgrB homologous proteins, suggesting that the Agr quorum sensing system homologues might also exist in other Gram-positive bacteria.

The agr locus consists of two major transcripts: RNAII and RNAIII, that are transcribed divergently from the two agr promoters, P2 and P3, respectively (3Novick R.P. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Ross H.F.

RNAII encodes four genes (agrA, -B, -C, and -D) whose products constitute a quorum sensing system: AgrC and AgrA are the sensor kinase and the response regulator of the Agr two-component signal transduction system, respectively (3Novick R.P.

Among the identified AgrCs so far from various species of staphylococci, the N-terminal halves are divergent and the C-terminal halves are highly conserved (9Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P.

This reflects the fact that the AgrCs are activated only by their cognate AIPs but are inhibited by heterologous AIPs (9Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P.

Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the phosphoryl group of the phosphorylated AgrC is transferred to AgrA, and the phosphorylated AgrA then interacts with the P2 and P3 promoters to activate the transcription of both RNAII and RNAIII (3Novick R.P.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). RNAIII is the actual regulator that activates the expression of genes encoding secreted virulence factors and represses those encoding cell surface-associated proteins (1Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 18Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). AgrD is a membrane protein anchored in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane via an amphipathic α-helix formed by its N-terminal region (19Zhang L. Lin J. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19448-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AgrD sequences from various staphylococcal species are remarkably divergent with only 4 identical amino acids (1Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The mature AIPs isolated so far from a number of staphylococcal species are 7 to 9 amino acids in length, and all are thiolactone molecules containing a 5-amino acid ring linked by a thioester bond formed between the sulfhydryl group of a conserved cysteine residue and the carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid, except the Staphylococcus intermedius AIP, a lactone molecule that contains a ester bond formed between the hydroxyl group of a serine residue (in place of the cysteine residue that is absolutely conserved among other AIPs) and the carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue (11Lyon G.J.

The AIP sequence is in the middle of the AgrD sequence that is preceded by the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix and followed by a highly hydrophilic C-terminal region. The processing of AgrD to generate mature AIP involves the proteolytic cleavages at two processing sites, the thioester (or ester) bond formation, and the secretion of the mature AIP. AgrB is a membrane protein with six transmembrane segments including four transmembrane α-helices and two highly hydrophilic regions (22Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Like AgrD, the AgrBs sequenced from various staphylococcal species are also divergent, except the N-terminal region located in the cytoplasm and the two highly hydrophilic regions that are proposed to be in the membrane according to the AgrB topological model (22Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Computer analyses show similar hydropathy profiles among the AgrB sequences (22Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is likely that all AgrBs are structurally and functionally similar and the mechanisms of processing AgrD and of secreting the mature AIP by AgrBs are the same or similar even though the AgrD propeptides are different and the interaction between AgrB and AgrD is specific (23Zhang L. Ji G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified two amino acid residues in both S. aureus and S. intermedius AgrBs that were involved in the proteolytic cleavages of AgrD, and proposed that the staphylococcal AgrB protein was a putative cysteine endopeptidase. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—S. aureus RN6390B is a derivative of NCTC8325 and is our standard laboratory group I strain. RN6911 is a derivative of RN6390B in which the agr locus is replaced by the tetM gene (18Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S.

Escherichia coli JM109 was used for cloning and BL21(DM3) was used for protein expression. The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. S. aureus cells were grown in CYGP broth (24Novick R.P.

E. coli cells were grown in LB medium (25Sambrook J. W. R.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Cell growth was monitored with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter with a green (540 nm) filter (Klett, Long Island City, NY). S. aureus cells expressing AgrB or AgrD or both under the control of the staphylococcal Pbla promoter were induced with 0.5 μg/ml methicillin.

Bacteriol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides WP12, 5′-CCATCACCAATGTGATGATG-3′ (P3 promoter region), and SINT11, 5′-CGGCTCTCCTCCTTGTTT-3′ (P2 promoter region), as primers and chromosomal DNA as template. The PCR product was cloned into an E. coli cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega). The resulting plasmid pGEM-T-P2P3 was digested with SpeI and PstI, and ligated to a XbaI/PstI DNA fragment prepared from pRN6441-gfp, which was made by cloning the green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene from pEBD166 (26Kane C.D. Schuch R. Day Jr., W.A. Maurelli A.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4409-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Kane at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences) plus the SD sequence from the sarA gene of S. aureus (27Cheung A.L. Projan S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4168-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An EcoRI/PstI DNA fragment of pGEM-T-P2P3-gfp was then cloned into the EcoRI/PstI sites of pRN5543. Plasmid pWP1003 was constructed by cloning the XbaI/PstI DNA fragment of pRN6441-gfp into the XbaI/PstI sites of pRN5543. To construct pWP1103, a PCR product was prepared using oligonucleotides SINT3, 5′-GCGAATTCACATGAGAATTTTAGAAG-3′ (5′ of S. intermedius agrD (agrD-Si, GenBank accession number AY557375), EcoRI site, underlined) and SINT4, 5′-GCGATTCATGATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTTTTCCTCTTCTAACAACTCAGC-3′ (3′ end of agrD-Si; 6 histidine codons and a stop codon, italic; BspHI site, underlined) as primers and S. intermedius chromosomal DNA as a template. The EcoRI/BspHI-digested PCR product was then cloned into the EcoRI/BspHI sites of pLZ4012 (19Zhang L. Lin J. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19448-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmid pWP1104 was made by cloning a PCR product amplified from S. intermedius chromosomal DNA using primers SINT1 and SINT5 into the XbaI site of pWP1103. Plasmid pWP1104 (switch) was prepared as follows. PCR product A was generated using oligonucleotide GJ number 14, 5′-GCTCTAGATCGTATAATGACAG-3′ (before the SD sequence of the S. aureus group I agrB, XbaI site, underlined) and SINT24 5′-GGTGTTAATCACGACAACCTGCATCCCTAATCGTAC-3′ (amino acid residues 35–40 codons of S. intermedius agrB (agrB-Si), italic; amino acid residues 29–34 codons of S. aureus group I agrB, underlined) as primers and pRN6397 (the S. aureus group I agr cloned into E. coli vector pUC19 (3Novick R.P.

PCR product B was made by using oligonucleotides SINT23 (complementary to SINT24) and SINT5 as primers, and S. intermedius chromosomal DNA as a template. The PCR product A and B mixture (1:1) was used as the template for a PCR with primers GJ number 14 and SINT5. The final PCR product was then cloned into the XbaI site of pWP1103. Plasmid pWP1201 was constructed by cloning an NheI DNA fragment of pLZ4012 into the NheI site of the E. coli expression vector, pET11a. To make plasmid pWP1202, an PCR product using oligonucleotides GJ number 14 5′-GCTCTAGATCGTATAATGACAG-3′ (before the SD sequence of agrB, XbaI site, underlined) and GJ number 15-1, 5′-GCGTCTAGATCATTTTAAGTCCTCC-3′ (3′ of agrB, italic; XbaI site, underlined) as primers, and pRN6852 (5Ji G. Beavis R.C. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) as a template. After digestion with XbaI, the PCR product was cloned into the XbaI site of pWP1201. Site-directed mutagenesis of agrB-Si was done using PCR primers containing the desired mutations and the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene), resulting in plasmids pWP1111 to pWP1120 (Table I). Plasmid pWP1105 was constructed by cloning an XbaI DNA fragment containing the H77A mutation in agrB-Si prepared from pWP1118 into the XbaI site of pWP1102. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned wild type and mutated genes in the constructed plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Membrane Vesicle Preparation—S. aureus cells were grown in CYGP broth to 70 Klett units, and induced with 0.5 μg/ml methicillin at 37 °C for 3–5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 1× sucrose-sodium maleate-MgCl2 (1 × SMM) (24Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and suspended in 1× SMM containing 10 μg/ml lysostaphin. After 60 min incubation at 37 °C, protoplasts were prepared and washed with 1× SMM plus 5 mm EDTA. The protoplasts were then lysed by the addition of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5% glucose, 5 mm EDTA) followed by brief sonication. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unlysed cells, the total cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to separate the cell membrane vesicles and the cytoplasmic fractions. The membrane vesicles were suspended in ice-cold buffer A for immediate use or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. In Vitro Processing of AgrD—Membrane fusion experiments were performed using the freeze-thaw method as described (28Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of membrane fractions prepared from S. aureus cells expressing AgrB or AgrD were mixed, and the mixtures were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing at room temperature or at 4 °C three times to fuse the membranes. After incubation at 37 °C, the mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for AIP activity assays, and the membrane pellets were suspended in 1× T7 bind/wash buffer (Novagen) plus 2% sodium cholate and protease inhibitor mixture set II (1:17 final dilution) (Calbiochem). The T7 epitope-tagged intact AgrD, processing intermediate(s), and final product(s) were purified by affinity chromatography using T7 monoclonal antibody agarose (Novagen) and suspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (25Sambrook J. W. R.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Western Blot Hybridization—Samples were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Proteins were separated on Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10468) Google Scholar), and the separated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After incubation at 4 °C overnight, or at room temperature for 1 h in TBS buffer (25Sambrook J. W. R.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) plus 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin,"
https://openalex.org/W2053346430,"The expression of the breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 is highly regulated in human breast, ovary, and pancreatic cells. BRCA2 is not expressed in the non-dividing cells, and expression is cell cycle stage-dependent and is elevated in the sporadic cancer cells. Mutational analysis of the upstream sequence of the human BRCA2 gene revealed an E2-box-containing silencer at the –701 to –921 position. The E2-box is essential for the cell-cycle stage-dependent activity of the silencer. We affinity-purified a 29-kDa silencer-binding protein (SBP) from the nuclear extracts of human breast cells BT-549 and MDA-MB-231. We explored whether the E2-box-binding repressor protein SLUG, which is of similar molecular size, is involved in the silencing process. Supershift assay with the purified SBP and anti-SLUG antibody revealed the identity of the SBP as SLUG. We found that silencer is inactive in the human breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 that do not express SLUG, further suggesting the involvement of SLUG in the BRCA2 gene silencing. Inducible expression of human SLUG in the dividing MDA-MB-468 cells reduced BRCA2 RNA levels with the activation of the silencer. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SLUG mRNA in the BT-549 cells caused inhibition of the silencer function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggested that SLUG mediates its action by recruiting C-terminal-binding protein-1 (CtBP-1) and histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) at the silencer E2-box. The general HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, inhibited the SLUG-mediated regulation of the silencer function. It thus appears that SLUG is a negative regulator for BRCA2 gene expression.

BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor protein with diverse functions (1Turner N. Tutt A. Ashworth A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 2Scully R. Xie A. J.

BRCA2 deficiency has been attributed as the cause for many cases of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinoma (1Turner N. Tutt A. Ashworth A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 2Scully R. Xie A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2004; 9: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Keen J.C. Davidson N.E. Cancer. 2003; 97: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). BRCA2 deficiency may be caused by the molecular defects in the BRCA2 gene or due to sporadic reasons. The BRCA2 gene is not expressed in non-dividing cells, and the rate of expression of this protein is increased with the rate of cell proliferation (4Chodosh L.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1998; 3: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 6Narod S.A.

Any number of environmental cues may influence the turn-on event and may initiate a molecular domino effect leading to DNA damage and oncogenesis. Although undue expression of BRCA2 protein in non-dividing cells may initiate apoptosis, the failure of the cell to produce the appropriate amount of BRCA2 corresponding to the growth rate of the cell may also be detrimental. Since the majority of the breast cancer cases are sporadic (1Turner N. Tutt A. Ashworth A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 2Scully R. Xie A. J.

As alluded to above, the BRCA2 gene is stringently regulated during the cell cycle (7Bertwistle D. Swift S. Marston N.J. Jackson L.E. Crossland S. Crompton M.R. Marshall C.J. Ashworth A.

To understand how BRCA2 gene expression is regulated in human mammary epithelial cells, the regulatory DNA sequence elements around the proximal upstream region of the gene are under extensive study (8Su L.K.

Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Examination of the minimal promoter sequence has revealed several canonical elements for the binding of transcription factors including an E-box, E2F, and Ets recognition motifs (9Davis P.L. Miron A. Andersen L.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antibodies to candidate transcription factors used in supershift experiments revealed specific interactions between the BRCA2 promoter and the basic region/helix-loop-helix containing USF-1 and -2 proteins and Elf-1, an Ets domain protein. Myc-Max or Max-Max dimers were reported not to bind this E-box sequence (9Davis P.L. Miron A. Andersen L.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis of the –144 to –59 region identified a putative NFκB binding site (10Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, NFκB and upstream stimulatory facter regulate BRCA2 expression through the BRCA2 promoter (10Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). P53 was found to repress the expression of BRCA2 promoter activity (11Wu K. Jiang S.W. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15652-15660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We previously reported a 221-bp silencer sequence located at 700 bp upstream of the BRCA2 gene transcription start site (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). We report here a mechanism for the negative regulation of the BRCA2 gene expression by this silencer. We show evidence that a unique E2-box sequence surrounded by Alu sequences is responsible for the function of the silencer. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggest that the E2-box may mediate the silencing by recruiting the zinc finger suppressor protein SLUG, which most likely then recruits CtBP-1 and HDAC-1 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC-1, histone deacetylase-1; CtBP-1, C-terminal-binding protein-1; ACR1, Alu-co-repressor 1; HMEC, human mammary epithelial cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Dox, doxycycline; RT, reverse transcriptase; SBP, silencer-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TSA, trichostatin A. to result in deacetylation of the acetylated histones at the BRCA2 gene promoter. Histone deacetylation then probably causes the inhibition of BRCA2 gene expression. Cell Culture—We used a series of commercially available lines of human breast cells including HMEC (Clonetics, purchased through Fisher), MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and BT-549. All cells, other than the HMEC cells, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). HMEC cells were grown in medium purchased from Clonetics under their recommended conditions. Other cells were maintained and grown in ATCC recommended media and conditions, as described before (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Resting or non-dividing cells are defined as the cells that are in a 100% confluent state of growth in a culture flask or the cells that are arrested mostly at the G0 phase by serum starvation. Serum starvation of the cells to arrest them at the G0 phase was done for 60–80 h following established protocols (9Davis P.L. Miron A. Andersen L.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The population of non-dividing cells was determined by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining methods (14Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). More than 88% of the cells used as non-dividing cells were at the G0/G1 phase. Dividing cells are the cells from S/G2 phase (>82%) of cell growth. Promoter/Silencer Constructs and Luciferase Assay—Human BRCA2 promoter (–187 to +301) was amplified with the primer set PF1, 5′-GCGAGAAGAGAACACACA-3′/PR1, 5′-GCAGAGAAAAGGCAA-3′. The 497-bp fragment was initially cloned into pCRII-Topo vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid with the insert having the forward orientation with respect to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter was selected. The insert was cut out of the plasmid with BamHI/XhoI and subcloned into the BglII/XhoI site at the multiple cloning site of pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega). This gave us the BRCA2 promoter vector, pGL3-P. The 221-bp silencer DNA (–701 to –921) was amplified using the primer set SF1, 5′-GCAAGATGGGCCGGGTGT-3′/SR1, 5′-CCA GGGTGTGGTTCTC-3′ and initially cloned into pCRII-Topo vector. The recombinant plasmid clone with insert in the reverse orientation with respect to T7 RNA polymerase promoter was selected. The silencer sequence was digested out of the recombinant plasmid with KpnI/XhoI and subcloned at the KpnI/XhoI sites of the pGL3-P vector. This gave us the promoter-silencer vector, pGL3-PS. Transient transfections were performed in six-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of pGL3-P or pGL3-PS and 0.1 μg of pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase control vector (Promega). Protein lysates were prepared from the cells, and luciferase activities were measured as described previously (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase activity and presented as a ratio (relative light units). Protein contents of the extract, when needed, were determined using RC-DC reagents and protocol from Bio-Rad. Site-directed Mutagenesis—PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) technique was used for the generation of reporter gene constructs with E2-box mutations following the manufacturer's instructions. The E2-box element was mutated from 5′-CACCTG-3′ to 5′-AACCTA-3′ (sense strand). Such mutations are known to ablate the function of the E2-box (15Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Affinity Pull-down of Silencer-binding Proteins—We purified the silencer-binding proteins by DNA affinity chromatography following the protocol provided by Dynal Biotech, using biotin-tagged 221-bp BRCA2 silencer fragment employing Dynabeads M-280-streptavidin beads (Dynal Biotech). The biotin-labeled silencer fragment was obtained by PCR using 5′-biotin-labeled primers. The proteins in BT-549 or MDA-MB-231 cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the nuclear extract was isolated following standard protocols (14Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). The biotin-tagged silencer DNA was bound to Dynabeads M280 following the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Biotech). The nuclear protein was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with biotinylated silencer DNA bound to Dynabeads M280 streptavidin in protein binding buffer (80 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 2.5 mm EDTA, 30 μm mutant double-strand oligonucleotide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The magnetic beads were washed three times with protein binding buffer in 80 mm NaCl containing excess poly(dI-dC) and mutant (at the E2-box) duplex oligonucleotide competitor DNA. The fractions were eluted with elution buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 4%(v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 2.5 mm EDTA, 30 μm mutant double-strand oligonucleotide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and were stored at –80 °C. Silencer-binding proteins (SBPs) were electrophoresed on a 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C with intensifying screen. Expression of Recombinant SLUG in MDA-MB-468 Cells—Human SLUG coding sequence was amplified from RNA isolated from BT-549 cells using N-terminal primer (5′-GACGGATCCATGCCGCGCTCCTTCCTG-3′) and the C-terminal primer (5′-CGTCGACTCACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGTGTGCTACACAGC-3′). The sequence-verified amplified cDNA (831 bp) was digested with BamHI/SalI and was cloned at the BamHI/SalI sites at the multiple cloning site of pRevTet-TRE plasmid (BD Biosciences). PT67 packaging cells were transfected with either the pRevTet-ON plasmid (BD Biosciences) or the pRevTet-TRE-SLUG plasmid to collect the recombinant retrovirus. PT67 cells were grown to ∼50% confluency in 100-mm culture dishes and then transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The culture medium was replaced at 24 h after transfection, and retrovirus-containing medium was collected at 48 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. For long term storage, the retrovirus-containing medium was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. MDA-MB-468 cells were grown to ∼40–50% confluency in 100-mm culture dishes and then transduced first by retrovirus containing pRevTet-ON plasmid by the addition of 1:1 retrovirus-containing medium and growth medium. The culture medium was replaced after 24 h with cell growth medium. Medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin was added to select stable cell population at 48 h. This Geneticin-resistant cell population was further transduced by pRe-vTRE-SLUG plasmid containing virus as described above, and the stable cell line was selected further with 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. For all the experiments, this double-resistant cell line was maintained in 100 μg/ml of Geneticin and hygromycin B. Expression of SLUG was induced by doxycycline (1 μg/ml). Knock-down of SLUG Gene Expression in BT-549 Cells—The anti-human SLUG siRNAs were designed using the Invitrogen site software and custom-synthesized from Invitrogen. The nucleotide sequences of the siRNA pair (SR) and its respective control (SRC) are as follows (the number indicates the location of the sequence in the SLUG coding region): SR661 5′-GCAUUUGC AGACAGGUCAA-3′/5′-UUGAACUGUCUGCA AAUGC-3′; SRC661: 5′-GCAACGUACAGUG GUUCAA-3′/5′-UUGAACCACUGUACGUUGC-3′. We used Trans-messenger reagent kit (Qiagen) and protocol for the transfection of the BT-549 cells with the siRNAs. RNA was prepared by TRIZOL reagent and DNase I treated before RT-PCR analysis. End Point RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells and analyzed for specific transcripts by RT-PCR analysis (13Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Total RNAs (5 μg) were treated with DNase I (Promega) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was used to carry out PCR amplification of BRCA2 (225 bp; 5′-GTACAGGAAACAAGCTTCTGA-3′ and 5′-GACTAACAGGTGGAGGTAAAG-3′); SLUG (807 bp; 5′-CCTGGTCAAGAAGCATTTCAACG-3′ and 5′-CCCCAAAGATGAGGAGTATCCG-3′); and β-actin (353 bp; 5′-GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCTC-3′ and 5′-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-3′). Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Quantitation of BRCA2 and SLUG transcripts were performed using a TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems) as described before (13Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 18 S rRNA was used as an endogenous control (product 4319413E). All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample and were repeated three times. All experimental data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance, a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance, and Student's t test were used to determine the significance of the difference (16Campbell M.J. Machin D. Medical Statistics: A Commonsense Approach. Second Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Western Blotting—SLUG and actin protein levels in cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. We amplified the coding sequence of human SLUG and cloned in pET100D/Topo vector (Invitrogen), expressed the His6-tagged SLUG in Escherichia coli (DE3), and purified the recombinant protein using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose following the supplier's instructions (Qiagen). Anti-SLUG antiserum was custom-developed (Antibody Solutions, Mountain View, CA) and purified. Proteins from cell lysate were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, as described before (13Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Membranes were blotted with anti-SLUG antibody or anti-actin antibody (Sigma) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Electerophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded DNA containing the 221-bp silencer fragment was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA probes were purified from the reaction mixture using a Bio-Gel P-100 column (Bio-Rad), incubated with whole cell extract from breast cells, and separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Supershift assay using anti-SLUG antibodies (made in our laboratory) was also performed (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Immuno-pull-down of SLUG to remove SLUG from the purified protein preparations was done using Dynabead-Protein A following supplier-provided protocol (Dynal Biotech, Brown Deer, WI). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—To test the in vivo binding of SLUG, CtBP-1, and HDAC-1 to the silencer or the deacetylation of histones at the BRCA2 promoter during the silencing process, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) using the standard protocol supplied by Upstate Biotechnology with their ChIP assay reagents (18Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Orlando V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, we used anti-SLUG antibody developed in our laboratory as described above. Following this, other antibodies were procured from Upstate Biotechnology: anti-CtBP-1 (rabbit polyclonal IgG, catalog number 07-306); anti-HDAC-1, clone 2E10 (mouse monoclonal IgG, catalog number 05-614); anti-acetyl histone H3 (rabbit polyclonal, catalog number 06-599); and anti-acetyl histone H4 (rabbit polyclonal, catalog number 06-866). PCR was performed with 10 μl of DNA, and Taq DNA polymerase, using 5′-32P-labeled primers SF1/SR1 to amplify the 221 bp of the silencer or PF1/PR1 to amplify the 497-bp BRCA2 gene promoter. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film to visualize the amplified band of expected size. Human BRCA2 Gene Silencer Is Differentially Active in Various Breast Cells and at Different Cell Growth Stages—The 221-bp silencer sequence at the upstream (–701 to –921) of the human BRCA2 gene has several interesting structural features. It has two Alu sequences (AluI and AluII) each of 55 bp separated by 81-bp inter-Alu sequences (Fig. 1, A and B). This inter-Alu sequence houses an E2-box sequence (5′-CACCTG-3′) as well as a 63-bp patch overlapping the E2-box that has >83% identity with the footprint of a RNA polymerase III transcriptional regulator ACR1 (20Kropotov A. Sedova V. Ivanov V. Sazeeva N. Tomilin A. Krutilina R. Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Buchlow G. Tomilin N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). The Alu sequences have ∼82% identity at the nucleotide level (Fig. 1C). We have shown previously that the entire 221-bp sequences are essential for the function of the silencer (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We further verified that this silencer is not only active with heterologous promoter, such as SV40 promoter (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but also active with its endogenous BRCA2 gene promoter (Fig. 1D). This functionality of the silencer is not only demonstrated in a transient transfection assay but also in stably transfected BT-549 cells (data not shown). One of the interesting features of this silencer is that it is active in certain breast cancer cells (Fig. 1D) and only in the non-dividing stages (G0/G1 phases) of the cell (Fig. 1E). Thus, the activity of the silencer is 8–10-fold higher in resting or predominantly G0-arrested BT-549 cells than in the dividing cells (Fig. 1E). The cell cycle stage-dependent activity of the silencer may be relevant because BRCA2 mRNA and protein are expressed significantly only in the dividing cells with optimum levels in the S/G2 phase cells (9Davis P.L. Miron A. Andersen L.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The silencer is also active in the non-dividing HMEC cells (data not shown), suggesting that the activity of the silencer may not be specific for certain cancer cells only. The E2-box in the Silencer Is Essential for Its Function— Since the E2-box is involved in many transcriptional repression processes, we checked whether the E2-box sequence in the BRCA2 silencer is necessary for its function. When the E2-box sequence was mutated from 5′-CACCTG-3′ to 5′-AACCTA-3′, the function of the silencer is abolished in the cells where it is functional (Fig. 1, D and E). The silencer is not active in the MCF-7 and the MDA-MB-468 cells. Thus, there are no significant differences in the activity of the promoter whether or not wild-type or mutated silencer is present (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, the silencer is significantly active in the BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1D). Mutation of the E2-box of the silencer ablated its activity (Fig. 1D) in these cells. The essentiality of the E2-box for the silencer function was context-dependent. Thus, replacement of any of the Alu elements from the silencer with unrelated sequence of similar size ablated the function of the silencer although the E2-box remained unaltered (data not shown). We previously reported that the silencer DNA forms protein-DNA complexes with the nuclear proteins from MDA-MB-231 cells (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These complexes were not formed with nuclear proteins from the breast cells where the silencer is inactive. Oligonucleotide sequence containing the wild-type E2-box could successfully compete the binding of the protein to the silencer DNA probe, but that containing the mutated E2-box could not (12Sharan C. Hamilton N. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All these data strongly suggest that the E2-box sequence within its context in the BRCA2 silencer is necessary for the binding of proteins to it and thus for its function. We also have verified the essentiality of the E2-box in BT-549 cells stably transfected with the wild type or the mutated silencer-containing luciferase constructs (data not shown). Silencer Binds with SLUG from Breast Cell Nuclear Extract—Since the E2-box of the silencer is essential for the binding of the nuclear proteins as well as for the function of the silencer, our hypothesis was that the E2-box-binding proteins regulate the function of the silencer. We had noted that the silencer failed to function in the human breast cancer cells where the E2-box binding repressor protein SLUG is not expressed. For example, it has been reported that SLUG mRNAs are below detection levels in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas the BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells express plenty of SLUG mRNA (15Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). Our RT-PCR data further verified these observations (Fig. 2A). We experimented with the nuclear extracts from different human breast cells to verify whether it indeed binds to SLUG. These pull-down experiments show the purification of a 29-kDa protein from the nuclear extracts of the cells where the silencer is functional, e.g. BT-549 and MDA-MB-231, whereas it did not purify any such protein from MDA-MB-468 cells where the silencer is not active (Fig. 2B). Immunoblot analysis with anti-SLUG antibodies revealed that the affinity-purified protein band contains SLUG (Fig. 2C). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the purified SBP showed that the protein specifically binds to the wild-type silencer DNA but not the E2-box-mutated silencer DNA (Fig. 2D). The formation of the protein-DNA complex was competed out with unlabeled wild-type si"

Skeletal muscle gene expression profiles of mdx mice, an animal model of DMD, treated with prednisolone were compared with control mice at 1 and 6 wk. Of the 89 early differentially regulated genes and ESTs, delta-sarcoglycan, myosin Va, FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), the potassium channel regulator potassium inwardly-rectifying channel Isk-like (IRK2) and ADAM 10 were overexpressed, whereas growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) and Homer-2 were underexpressed. The 58 late differentially overexpressed genes included kallikreins (13, 16, and 26), FKBP51, PI3K alpha regulatory subunit, and IGFBP6, while underexpressed genes included NeuroD and nicotinic cholinergic receptor gamma. At both time points, overexpression of a cohort of genes relating to metabolism and proteolysis was apparent, alongside the differential expression of genes relating to calcium metabolism. Treatment did not increase muscle regeneration, reduce the number of infiltrating macrophages, or alter utrophin expression or localization. However, in the treated mdx soleus muscle, the percentage of slow fibers was significantly lower compared with untreated controls after 6 wk of treatment. These results show that glucocorticoids confer their benefit to dystrophic muscle in a complex fashion, culminating in a switch to a more normal muscle fiber type."
https://openalex.org/W2037185271,"The Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK) pathway plays an integral role in the formation of human malignancies. Stimulation of this pathway results in phosphorylation of histone H3 at serines 10 and 28 and expression of immediate-early genes. Phosphorylated (serine 10) H3, which is also acetylated on lysine 14, is associated with immediate-early genes. In this report, we investigated the relationship between these two H3 phosphorylation events in parental and ras-transformed fibroblasts. Immunoblot analyses of two-dimensional gel patterns demonstrated that all three H3 variants were phosphorylated after stimulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway and during mitosis. Following stimulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway, H3 phosphorylated on serines 10 and 28 was excluded from regions of highly condensed chromatin and was present in increased levels in ras-transformed cells. Although H3 phosphorylated at serine 10 or 28 was dynamically acetylated, H3 phosphorylated at serine 28 had a higher steady state of acetylation than that of H3 phosphorylated at serine 10. When visualized with indirect immunofluorescence, most foci of phosphorylated serine 28 H3 did not co-localize with foci of H3 phosphorylated on serine 10 or phosphoacetylated on serine 10 and lysine 14, suggesting that these two phosphorylation events act separately to promote gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2015933167,"The transcription factor myocyte-enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) has been shown to be required for the survival of different types of neurons. However, the death- or survival-inducing second messenger pathways that regulate MEF2 activity remain to be fully elucidated. Membrane depolarization by KCl induces neuronal survival that is dependent upon MEF2-mediated gene transactivation. Here we report that membrane depolarizationinduced activation of MEF2 requires the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Inhibition of the activity of cAMP-PKA pathway attenuates membrane depolarization-induced activation of MEF2 activity and neuronal survival, whereas enhancing the activity of this pathway prevents KCl withdrawal-induced inhibition of MEF2 and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, PKA directly phosphorylates MEF2 at Thr-20 in vitro to increase MEF2 DNA binding activity. A mutation of Thr-20 to Ala renders MEF2 resistant to PKA phosphorylation in vitro and reduces its DNA binding activity. Transfection of this T20A mutant blocks survival and induces apoptosis in cultured cortical and cerebellar granule neurons.

Both growth factors and neuronal activity provide trophic support for neurons during their development; neurons that do not receive sufficient support will undergo apoptotic death (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is poorly understood, it has long been known that elevation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels will promote neuronal survival that is independent of neurotrophic factors (2Rydel R.E.

In this model, cerebellar granule neurons cultured in the presence of a high concentration of extracellular KCl (25–30 mm) survive in the absence of serum or other additional growth factors, whereas lowering the concentration of KCl (5 mm) induces rapid and relatively synchronized apoptosis. Several signaling pathways required to mediate the survival of cerebellar granule neurons have been identified. These include brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, and the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase/Akt pathway (5Borodinsky L.N. Coso O.A.

However, the dynamic changes in MEF2 phosphorylation status upon neuronal survival and apoptotic signaling strongly suggest that regulation of MEF2 is more complex, involving yet unidentified kinases and phosphatases (12Mao Z.

Our data demonstrate that in cerebellar granule neurons, where MEF2 activity is shown to be required for membrane depolarization-dependent survival, inhibition of the cAMP-PKA pathway correlates with a reduction of transactivation activity of MEF2. We have shown that depolarizing concentrations of KCl activate PKA, which phosphorylates MEF2 on a threonine residue (Thr-20) located within its DNA binding and dimerization domain near the N′-terminal region. Phosphorylation at this site by PKA leads to enhanced DNA binding by MEF2 in vitro, and blocking the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway reduces MEF2-dependent DNA binding and gene expression. A MEF2 construct in which the PKA phosphorylation site was mutated to an Ala fails to mediate gene expression in response to survival signals and, when overexpressed in neurons, induces neuronal apoptosis.

Culture of primary cortical neurons from embryo day 17 or 18 Long Evans rats (Harlan or Charles River) was carried out as described by Mao and Wiedmann (12Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were grown in basal growth medium in plates coated with laminin and poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Transfection of Cells—Primary neurons in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were transfected by the calcium phosphate method at day 4–6 in vitro as described by Mao and Wiedmann (12Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In general, neurons were returned to conditioned full medium after transfection and then treated as indicated when needed. A 3:1 DNA ratio of effector versus β-galactosidase or GFP vector was used for survival and luciferase assays, respectively. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Purified recombinant MEF2 proteins (0.5 μg) were incubated with purified catalytic subunit PKA (Promega) or PKA immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts from neurons by using an anti-PKA antibody in a kinase reaction buffer containing [γ-32P] and cold ATP. Whole cell extracts from cultured primary cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described previously (12Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of buffer (for 100-mm plate) containing 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of cell lysate were incubated with anti-PKA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with Protein A-agarose beads for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed with kinase buffer five times. The kinase reaction was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) and terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The stoichiometry was determined as described (32Hashiguchi M. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Hashiguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44525-44530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μg of MEF2C-(1–105) and 80 units of purified PKA were incubated in the kinase reaction buffer. The kinase reaction was terminated at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. 20 μl of the reaction were applied to P81 filter paper (Upstate). The filters were washed three times for 5 min each with 0.75% phosphoric acid and then washed once with ethanol for 5 min. 32Pi incorporation into MEF2C-(1–105) was quantified by Cerenkov counting using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). A control reaction was performed with the same assay mixture containing PKA but without substrate MEF2C-(1–105). Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Primary neurons were transiently transfected with various constructs using the calcium phosphate transfection procedure described by Mao and Wiedmann (12Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was used to determine the efficiency in each transfection. The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by using control vectors. Cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Bioscience). Detection of Caspase Activation—Cerebellar granule neurons were treated with 10 μm H89 or the same volume of its solvent Me2SO for 5 h. Sulforhodamine caspase detection reagent was used and incubated with the cells for 1 h according to the manufacturer's manual. Cells were observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (excitation 550 nm; emission 590–600 nm). Cell-counting Kit-8—Water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-8; Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.) was added directly to the cells and bioreduced by the cellular dehydrogenases to give a colored formazan product that is soluble in the tissue culture medium. The intensity of the color reaction was measured using a Packard Spectracount. The relative survival rates were represented with the O.D. value of the control group set as one. Survival Assays—The survival assays were carried out as described previously (31Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 33Blair L.A. Bence-Hanulec K.K. Mehta S. Franke T. Kaplan D. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were stained with propidium iodide without permeabilization. GFP-positive cells with or without propidium iodide staining were counted using a fluorescence microscope in a blind manner. Three hundred or more transfected cells were counted for each treatment. Apoptotic rates were represented as the percentage of GFP-positive apoptotic cells among the total number of GFP-positive cells counted. Statistics Method—The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance for samples where appropriate. PKA Activity Is Required for MEF2 Function and Membrane Depolarization-induced Survival of Cerebellar Granule Neurons—We first established that cAMP-PKA signaling is required for depolarization-mediated survival of cerebellar granule neurons. Cerebellar granule neurons from postnatal day 6 rat brain were cultured in the presence of either depolarizing concentrations of KCl (29 mm) or low concentration of KCl (5 mm) in the absence of serum. Membrane depolarization stimulated the survival of cerebellar granule neurons, indicated by the healthy nuclear morphology following Hoechst staining, while lowering the concentration of KCl-induced neuronal apoptosis as shown by chromatin condensation (Fig. 1A). Several studies have implicated cAMP in the survival of cerebellar granule neurons upon depolarization (20D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 34Mei Y.A. Vaudry D. Basille M. Castel H. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Gonzalez B.J. Eur. J.

However, the downstream effectors and mechanisms that mediate cAMP signaling in cerebellar granule neurons have not been fully investigated. Because cAMP may signal via different downstream effectors, including PKA and cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as GEF1/II or Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) (38de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 39de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), it was important to determine which downstream effector(s) mediates the trophic effect of cAMP. To distinguish the role of PKA in this process, two widely used potent inhibitors of protein kinase A, H89 and myristoylated PKI peptide, were applied to block PKA activity in cerebellar granule neurons under depolarizing concentrations of KCl. Inhibition of PKA by H89 induced a dose- and time-dependent loss of neuronal viability (Fig. 1B, left and middle panels). The more specific PKA inhibitor, myristoylated PKI peptide, also reduced neuronal viability in the presence of depolarizing concentrations of KCl (Fig. 1B, right panel). Conversely, increasing cAMP levels with forskolin or the cAMP analog CPT-cAMP protected neurons from low concentration KCl-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Together, these data confirm that the activity of cAMP-PKA pathway is required for depolarization-induced survival of cerebellar granule neurons. Our previous studies show that MEF2 is required for neuronal survival mediated by membrane depolarization (11Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the cAMP-PKA pathway may regulate the function of MEF2, we employed a sensitive MEF2-dependent reporter gene assay to correlate survival signal, cAMP-PKA activity, and MEF2 function (11Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule neurons were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene whose expression is under the control of two MEF2 DNA binding elements. MEF2 activity was measured by luciferase assay. Membrane depolarization-dependent survival correlated with high MEF2 activity, whereas 5 mm KCl-induced apoptosis was associated with a decrease in MEF2 function (Fig. 2A), consistent with a positive role of MEF2 in neuronal survival. Treating neurons with two PKA inhibitors, H89 and myristoylated PKI peptide, reduced MEF2-dependent reporter gene expression (Fig. 2B). In contrast, KCl withdrawal inhibited MEF2 transactivation activity, and this inhibition was attenuated by stimulation of cAMP-PKA pathway with either CPT-cAMP or forskolin (Fig. 2C). Together, these data indicate that MEF2 activity correlates with the activity of cAMP-PKA pathway, suggesting that cAMP-PKA may target MEF2. Membrane Depolarization Regulates PKA Kinase Activity and PKA Phosphorylates MEF2 Directly—Our preceding data indicate that cAMP-PKA is required for neuronal activity-dependent survival. Given that cAMP-PKA pathway affects MEF2 transactivation activity (Fig. 2), we investigated the possibility that PKA may directly target MEF2. To test this possibility, purified PKA and a highly purified N-terminal fragment of recombinant MEF2 protein (MEF2C-(1–105)) were incubated in a kinase reaction buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results were viewed after autoradiography. Incubation of MEF2C-(1–105) with PKA resulted in significant phosphorylation of the N-terminal MEF2 fragment (Fig. 3A, top panel). To determine the stoichiometry of MEF2 phosphorylation, the kinase reaction was stopped at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. 32Pi incorporation into MEF2C-(1–105) was measured by a scintillation counter in a filter binding assay. A representative result after subtraction of control is shown in Fig. 3A, bottom panel. Upon saturation of Pi incorporation, we found that 0.5 mol Pi was incorporated into 1 mol MEF2C-(1–105). This N′-terminal fragment contains the highly conserved MADS and MEF2 domains. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a consensus PKA phosphorylation site at position 20 (RQVT) that is conserved among all four isoforms of MEF2 (Fig. 3B, top panel). Mutation of Thr-20 to an Ala almost completely abolished PKA-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, bottom panel), suggesting that phosphorylation by PKA requires Thr-20. Interestingly, the RQVT sequence is also part of a consensus motif for protein kinase B (Akt), RN-RQVT, making Thr-20 a potential target for Akt (40Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, equal amounts of MEF2C-(1–105) were incubated with the same reactive units of PKA and PKB for the same length of time under the optimal conditions for each enzyme, respectively. Under this condition, PKA robustly phosphorylated MEF2C-(1–105), whereas Akt led to a much weaker incorporation of 32P into MEF2C-(1–105) (>100-fold less efficient than PKA adjusted for loading) (Fig. 3C), consistent with previous reports that fail to demonstrate efficient phosphorylation of MEF2 by Akt under different experimental conditions (41Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R. Simard A.R. Michel R.N. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To corroborate the role of PKA in regulation of MEF2, we tested directly whether membrane depolarization regulates PKA kinase activity. Cerebellar granule neurons were exposed to either high or low concentrations of KCl. Endogenous PKA was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates, and its activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay with MEF2C-(1–105) as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. PKA activity was high in neurons cultured in medium containing depolarizing concentrations of KCl, and this activity was significantly inhibited by H89 (Fig. 3D). Withdrawal of KCl led to a decrease in PKA kinase activity. Addition of forskolin re-stimulated PKA activity that was inhibited by KCl deprivation. The specificity of the in vitro assay was confirmed by near complete inhibition of the kinase activity present in the immunoprecipitates with the addition of the specific PKA inhibitor PKI. Together, these data indicate that membrane depolarization specifically enhances PKA function in cerebellar granule neurons. Phosphorylation by PKA at Thr-20 Regulates MEF2 DNA Binding Activity—Our experiments presented in Fig. 3 showed that PKA phosphorylates MEF2 at Thr-20. Because the N′-terminal region included in our phosphorylation assay contains conserved subdomains that are responsible for mediating interaction between MEF2 and specific DNA sequences, it raised the possibility that phosphorylation at Thr-20 may affect MEF2-dependent DNA binding activity. We tested the effect of phosphorylation by PKA on the DNA binding activity of MEF2 in electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which we have used previously to characterize the specific interaction between MEF2 and DNA (12Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31102-31107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Different amounts of recombinant MEF2C N′-terminal fragment-(1–105) were either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated with PKA in vitro with cold ATP and then incubated with a 32P-labeled DNA probe containing a single MEF2 binding site. Autoradiography showed that MEF2C-(1–105) binds to the MEF2 probe (Fig. 4A). This binding is sequence-specific because mutation of the MEF2 DNA binding site present in the probe completely abolished the formation of MEF2C-(1–105) and DNA probe complex. Importantly, phosphorylation by PKA significantly enhanced the signal of MEF2-(1–105) and DNA probe complex, suggesting that phosphorylation by PKA stimulates MEF2 DNA binding activity. On the other hand, mutation of Thr-20 to an Ala severely reduced the binding of MEF2 to DNA following phosphorylation by PKA compared with wild type MEF2 controls. This reduced binding of MEF2C T20A to DNA is due to a specific change of MEF2 DNA binding property as equal amounts of various MEF2s were used in each assay (data not shown). 2X. Tang, X. Wang, and Z. Mao, unpublished observations. Together, these data suggest that Thr-20 of MEF2 is critically involved in mediating the interaction between MEF2 and DNA. To extend this observation to neurons, cerebellar granule neurons cultured in medium containing 29 mm KCl were treated with PKA inhibitors H89 or PKI and tested for MEF2-dependent DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Membrane depolarization was associated with a robust DNA binding by MEF2. Inhibition of PKA by H89 resulted in a significant decline of MEF2 DNA complex formation, supporting the idea that inhibition of PKA reduces MEF2 DNA binding potential (Fig. 4B, left panel). Similarly, the more specific PKA inhibitor, myristoylated PKI peptide, induced a significant decrease of MEF2 DNA formation in cerebellar granule neurons cultured in 29 mm KCl (Fig. 4B, right panel). Consistent with these, brief exposure of cerebellar granule neurons to 5 mm KCl caused a clear decline of DNA binding activity by MEF2 that could be reversed by increasing cAMP level or stimulating PKA activity with either CPT-cAMP or forskolin. Further, this enhancing effect of CPT-cAMP or forskolin on MEF2 DNA binding in the presence of 5 mm KCl was reduced by either H89 or myristoylated PKI peptide (Fig. 4B). To corroborate these findings, we tested the effect of H89 or PKI on a constitutively active MEF2 fusion protein, MEF2C·VP16, using the MEF2 reporter assay in cerebellar granule neurons. MEF2C·VP16 is a fusion of the N′-portion of MEF2, which contains the DNA binding and dimerization domain of MEF2, with the viral protein VP16, which contains the transactivation domain and is not known to be regulated by cAMP-PKA. Overexpression of MEF2C·VP16 led to a 50- to 100-fold"
https://openalex.org/W2004266914,"Recently, evidence has been accumulating that inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate play important roles in a variety of signal transduction systems including membrane traffic, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell motility. In this paper, we show for the first time that the SH2-domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP)-2 binds directly to the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF) receptor, c-Met, via phosphotyrosine 1356. HGF induces the breakdown of cell junctions and the dispersion of colonies of epithelial cells including MDCK cells. Whereas only few lamellipodia are observed in MDCK cells 2 min after stimulation with HGF, both SHIP-2- and SHIP-1-overexpressing cells form large, broad lamellipodia. The number of lamellipodia is 2–4-fold greater than that of mock-transfected MDCK cells in the same time period and SHIP is found to colocalize with actin at the leading edge. Furthermore, overexpression of a catalytic inactive mutant of SHIP-2 suppresses HGF-potentiated cell scattering and cell spreading, although these mutant-expressing cells form enhanced number of lamellipodia 2 min after HGF stimulation. Interestingly, cells expressing a mutant lacking the proline-rich domain of SHIP-2 at the C-terminal form few lamellipodia, but still spread and scatter upon stimulation with HGF at a reduced rate. These data suggest that phosphatase activity is required for HGF-mediated cell spreading and scattering but not for alteration of lamellipodium formation, while the proline-rich region influences lamellipodium formation. Furthermore, treatment with 10 μ M of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase inhibitor, LY294002, abrogates HGF-induced cell scattering of SHIP-2-overexpressing cells but not parental HEK293 cells, suggesting that a balance between PI3 kinase and SHIP is important for cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W1974109755,"To investigate the mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) precursor Gag (PrGag) proteins assemble to form immature virus particles, we examined the in vitro assembly of MACANC proteins, composed of the PrGag matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid domains. In the absence of other components, MACANC proteins assembled efficiently at physiological temperature but inefficiently at lower temperatures. However, the addition of RNA reduced the temperature sensitivity of assembly reactions. Assembly of MACANC proteins also was affected by pH because the proteins preferentially formed tubes at pH 6.0, whereas spheres were obtained at pH 8.0. Because neither tubes nor spheres were amenable to analysis of protein-protein contacts, we also examined the membrane-bound assemblies of MACANC proteins. Interestingly, MACANC proteins organized on membranes in tightly packed hexameric rings. The observed hexamer spacing of 79.7 Å is consistent with the notion that more PrGag proteins assemble into virions than are needed to provide capsid proteins for mature virus cores. Our data are also consistent with a model for PrGag contacts in immature virions where capsid hexamers are tightly packed, where nucleocapsid domains align beneath capsid C-terminal domains, and where matrix domains form trimers at the nexus of three neighbor hexamers.

Normally, during or after budding, PrGag proteins are processed into the mature Gag proteins: matrix (MA), capsid, nucleocapsid (NC), and p6 (1Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar). PrGag processing is accompanied by a dramatic change in HIV-1 particle morphology. By conventional thin section electron microscopy, the electrondense protein shell of immature virions appears to reorganize into centrally located, conical, or cylindrical mature virus cores (1Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the major HIV-1 Gag protein capsid could assemble in vitro into two distinct arrangements (2Mayo K. Huseby D. McDermott J. Arvidson B. Finlay L. Barklis E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both of these arrangements showed hexameric rings of capsid N-terminal domains (NTDs) linked via C-terminal domain (CTD) contacts but differed in that one showed tight packing of hexamers with adjacent NTD rings in apparent contact, whereas the other featured clearly separated NTD rings (2Mayo K. Huseby D. McDermott J. Arvidson B. Finlay L. Barklis E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two in vitro arrangements appear to have in vivo counterparts. The tightly packed arrangement is similar to that observed in immature virions, where hexamer-to-hexamer spacing is in the range of 65 to 80 Å (2Mayo K. Huseby D. McDermott J. Arvidson B. Finlay L. Barklis E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D.

Biol. 2004; 11: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In contrast, the loosely packed arrangement appears to correspond to the organization of capsid proteins in mature cores assembled in vitro and in vivo with a hexamer ring-to-ring spacing of 95–110 Å (6Li S. Hill C. Sundquist W. Finch J. Nature. 2000; 407: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 7Briggs J. Wilk T. Welker R. Krausslich H-G. Fuller S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The similarity between our results and those observed in vivo prompted us to propose a model in which viral morphogenesis was accompanied by a shift from tightly packed hexamer rings to loosely packed rings, and we predicted that virions would have more capsid protein than was needed for mature core formation (2Mayo K. Huseby D. McDermott J. Arvidson B. Finlay L. Barklis E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This prediction was borne out by the observation of frequent virions with multiple cores and the determination that HIV-1 appears to contain on the order of 5000 Gag proteins/particle, higher than previously expected (5Briggs J. Simon M. Gross I. Krausslich H-G. Fuller S. Vogt V. Johnson M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent agreement between studies on particles and our investigations on HIV-1 capsid proteins in vitro, our capsid proteins lacked other PrGag domains that might have an effect on Gag protein oligomerization, particularly as the proteins are organized in immature assemblies. To address this issue, we have undertaken the in vitro analysis of multidomain Gag proteins, carrying matrix, capsid, spacer 1 (SP1), and nucleocapsid domains. Interestingly, these MACANC proteins assembled efficiently in the absence of other components at 37 °C but not at lower temperatures, suggesting a temperature-sensitive assembly switch. We also observed that the proteins preferentially assembled into tube forms at low pH but into spheres at high pH. Because these tube and sphere forms were not amenable to structural analysis, we additionally examined membrane-bound assemblies of the proteins. Image analysis of membrane-bound protein arrays indicated that the MACANC proteins organized into hexamer rings with a spacing of 79.7 Å. Our results indicate that the presence of MA and NC domains is compatible with a tightly packed arrangement of PrGag proteins and support a model where PrGag processing yields a loose capsid core from a more crowded precursor arrangement. Protein Purification—MACANC and MACANCexact proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) from the bacterial expression plasmids pET15B-HIVMACANC and pET15B-HIVMACANCexact. Both constructs encode an N-terminal His tag of MGSSH HHHHH SSGLV PRGSH MLEDPP fused to the second codon of HIV-1 HXB2 gag. The pET15B-HIVMACANCexact plasmid expresses protein, which terminates precisely at the HIV-1 NC C terminus; the pET15B-HIVMACANC plasmid encodes the vector-derived residues KIRAA NKARK EAELA AATAEQ at the C terminus of NC.

Pelleting Assays—Incubations of 10 μm MACANC proteins were performed in 20-μl reactions at 23, 30, or 37 °C for 16 h. Incubation buffers consisted of 375 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0 or 6.0) in the presence or absence of 0.2 mg/ml E. coli rRNA (Roche Applied Science). Following incubations, reactions were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 14,000 × g.

Briefly, 10-μl drops of protein (0.25–0.75 mg/ml) in buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium acetate, 20% glycerol) were incubated beneath 1 μl of 200 ng/μl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti) plus 50 ng/μl nickel-charged 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[N-((5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)-succinyl] (Avanti) in 1:1 chloroform: hexane. Incubations were performed for 16–24 h at 22–25 °C in sealed plastic dishes humidified with 6.25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.3) and 125 mm NaCl. Following the incubations, monolayers and associated proteins were lifted onto lacey carbon grids (Ted Pella 01883) for 30–60 s, washed on drops of distilled water for 15–30 s, wicked, stained with 1.33% uranyl acetate, wicked again, and allowed to dry for at least 15 min. Samples were viewed on a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope (EM) under low dose conditions. All images were taken at 100 kV and at defocus values between 200 and 1500 nm. Images were collected on either a Gatan 794 charge-coupled device multiscan camera or on Kodak SO163 negative films. For processing, charge-coupled device images were converted from the Gatan Digital Micrograph 3 (DM3) format to 8-bit gray scale TIFF format using Gatan software. Negatives were scanned and digitized using a Nikon Coolscan 8000 film and slide scanner in super fine scan (4000 dots per inch) mode with the multi-sampling mode at 8×. Images were saved in the TIFF format using the Nikon Scan 3.1 software. Sphere and Tube Incubations—Proteins were incubated at pH 6.0 (for tubes) or pH 8.0 (for spheres) beneath lipid monolayers and then lifted onto lacey EM grids prior to staining, EM viewing, and image collection as described above.

Three-dimensional Reconstructions—Tilt series images of membrane-bound protein arrays were collected on negatives at tilt angles of –55°, –45°, –30°, –15°, 0°, +15°, +30°, +45°, and +50° and scanned as described above to produce TIFF files. From these TIFF files, 30 separate crystalline patches were tracked through the entire range of tilt angles, and 512 × 512 pixel areas for each angle of each of the 30 crystalline patches were windowed using the Gatan Digital Micrograph software. The first steps in preparation of 0° reference images were performed using the digital micrograph software; the 512 × 512 pixel areas were Fourier-transformed, hand-indexed from power spectra, masked, low pass-filtered to include only the three lowest resolution reflections (1,0; 1,1; 2,0), back-transformed, and windowed to obtain 128 × 128 pixel (262.4 × 262.4 Å) raw reference images. Raw 0° reference images along with all 512 × 512 pixel areas from the 30 tilt series were converted from the TIFF format to the MRC format and then to the SPIDER SPI format (19Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar), and subsequent processing steps were performed using the SPIDER suite (19Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar) of programs. To generate final 0° reference images, raw 128 × 128 pixel images were thresholded with the SPIDER TH command so that pixels with gray scale values below the image average were raised to the image average. After this, images were padded to 512 × 512 pixels using the PD command and the original average gray scale value as background to create the final 0° tilt reference images. At this point, references were used in cross-correlations (CC command) versus their original 512 × 512-pixel 0° tilt images to generate cross-correlation maps. Peaks in cross-correlation maps were hand-picked using the WEB interface (19Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar) after rotating the maps by 180° using the SPIDER RT 90 command to account for the fact that SPIDER designates the origin as the lower right corner of the image, whereas the WEB origin is at the upper left. From 20 to100 hand-picked cross-correlation peak locations per 0° tilt image, corresponding 148 × 148 pixel windows in the original images were cut and averaged using the WV command. Final 128 × 128 pixel 0° averages centered on hexameric protein-free centers were cut using the WV command, and an image center location was hand-picked from the180° rotated image on WEB. After obtaining 30 0° averages, the steps described above were used to generate averages for each tilt angle in each tilt series. During this process, thresholded and padded 0° averages were used as references in –15 and +15° cross-correlation searches, and output averages were used recursively in obtaining higher tilt averages. Of the original 30 tilt series, 226 image averages from a total of 8455 windows were used for three-dimensional reconstructions using the SPIDER suite (19Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Average pixel intensity values for each image average were normalized and inverted (to account for negative staining) and rotated +223° to align the tilt axes with the image y axes. Each set of tilt series averages then was used to create a three-dimensional volume by back-projection using the BP three-dimensional command and input phi, theta, psi Eulerian angles of 0.0, tilt angle, 0.0. Determination of the relative rotations between tilt series was accomplished using the AP RA command on two-dimensional projections from 3-fold symmetrized and calculated tilt series volumes. The output of these operations included rotation angles, which corresponded to the reverse of the psi angles needed for final reconstructions. Thus, the 226 tilt series image averages were employed as input for final three-dimensional reconstructions using the SPIDER three-dimensional BP command. The quality of three-dimensional reconstructions was assessed by splitting data sets in half, calculating three-dimensional volumes for each half-data set, and comparing the two half-data sets using the RF 3 command. The resolution of the reconstruction was estimated to be at 27.5 Å, based on the resolution at which a phase residual value of 45° was reached (2Mayo K. Huseby D. McDermott J. Arvidson B. Finlay L.

Rotational Correlations—0° tilt average images from tilt series were compared with rotated versions by use of the SPIDER CC command. Maximum peak values (1.0 is defined as a perfect match) were recorded and plotted for comparisons made at 1° intervals. In Vitro Assembly of MACANC Proteins—To investigate the influences that the HIV-1 Gag MA and NC domains might have on the assembly of capsid proteins, His-tagged MACANC proteins were expressed in bacteria (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two proteins, MACANC and MACANCexact, were made. These differed by the presence of 21 vector-derived codons at the C terminus of MACANC, but because the additional encoded residues did not appear to have an effect in our studies, we will refer to them interchangeably as MACANC proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, both of the MACANC proteins carried N-terminal His tags in place of the PrGag myristate (20Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) group, and neither encoded the PrGag p6 domain, which does not appear to play a structural role but does hamper purification of bacterially expressed proteins (21Campbell S.

Nickel chelate chromatography column fractions of the bacterially expressed MACANC protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Column fractions consisted of starting bacterial lysate material (A), column-loading buffer washes (B and C), 10 mm imidazole buffer washes (D and E), and elutions (F–I). Final elutions yielded a protein with a mobility similar to the 52.2-kDa marker in the protein standards lane (J), which was detected by anti-HIV capsid antibodies in immunoblots performed in parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For monitoring the assembly properties of the MACANC proteins, we employed pelleting assays in which purified proteins were incubated under varying conditions. Following incubations, centrifugation was used to separate pelletable assembled products from monomers and small oligomers in the supernatant, and protein levels in each fraction were visualized by staining after electrophoresis. Results from these studies demonstrated a marked temperature dependence in the assembly process. As illustrated in Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2, during 23 °C incubations, very little MACANC protein assembled into a pelletable form at either pH 6.0 (A) or pH 8.0 (B). In contrast, incubations performed at 30 and 37 °C yielded increasing amounts of assembled protein (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6 and 9 and 10). Because NC domains on PrGag proteins have been postulated to facilitate assembly after binding to RNA (23Campbell S. Vogt V. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6487-6497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ma Y. Vogt V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5452-5462Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Ma Y. Vogt V. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we repeated the pelleting assays in the presence of RNA (Fig. 3). As illustrated in Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8, and 11 and 12, although assembly efficiency still appeared affected by temperature at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3A), RNA addition modulated this effect. The influence of RNA was even more pronounced at pH 8.0 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8, and 11 and 12). These results suggest that putative NC-RNA interactions decrease the temperature sensitivity of MACANC assembly reactions, an observation that is discussed below (see “Discussion”). What are the morphologies of the structures assembled by MACANC proteins? To examine this issue, assembly products were lifted onto EM grids, negatively stained, and viewed by transmission electron microscopy. Of note was the fact that pH 8.0 MACANC incubations yielded spherical particles with diameters on the order of 100 nm. In some cases, these spheres clustered into paracrystalline arrays (Fig. 4). In contrast, pH 6.0 incubation of MACANC proteins gave large tubes, which at low magnification appeared as dark rods of up to 750 nm in length against the grid substrate (Fig. 5, A and B). At higher magnification, the MACANC rods appeared to be 60–70-nm-wide cylinders with hollow centers of 20–25 nm (Fig. 5, C and D). Our observation of different particle morphologies at different pHs is in agreement with the observations of others (22Gross I. Hohenberg H. Wilk T. Wiegers K. Grattinger M. Muller B. Fuller S.

https://openalex.org/W1997769119,"The RING family zinc-finger protein topors (topoisomerase I-binding protein) binds not only topoisomerase I, but also p53 and the AAV-2 Rep78/68 proteins. topors maps to human chromosome 9p21, which contains candidate tumor suppressor genes implicated in small cell lung cancers. In this study, we isolated the murine counterpart of topors and investigated its impact on p53 function. The deduced amino-acid sequence of mouse topors exhibits extensive similarity to human topors. Overexpressed myc-tagged topors associates with and stabilizes p53, and enhances the p53-dependent transcriptional activities of p21Waf1, MDM2 and Bax promoters and elevates endogenous p21Waf1 mRNA levels. Overexpression of topors consequently results in the suppression of cell growth by cell cycle arrest and/or by the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these studies identify topors as a positive regulator of p53. The expression of topors is induced by exposure to the genotoxic reagents cisplatin and camptothecin, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. We therefore postulate that topors mediates p53-dependent cellular responses induced by DNA damage, suggesting its physiological role as a tumor suppressor."

Here, using a yeast two-hybrid system, we report the isolation of vinexin β as a new cofactor that interacts with the N-terminal A/B domain of the RARγ isotype.

We demonstrate that vinexin β colocalizes with RARγ in the nucleus and interacts with the non-phosphorylated form of the AF-1 domain of RARγ. We also show that this interaction is prevented upon phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain. Using F9 cells stably overexpressing vinexin β or vinexin knockdown by RNA interference, we demonstrate that vinexin β is an inhibitor of RARγ-mediated transcription.

Rochette-Egly C. Gene (Amst. 2004; 328: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 7Dilworth F.J. Chambon P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Other proteins are also recruited and serve as connections with the transcription machinery. In line with this, RARs interact with the general transcription factor TFIIH (8Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S.

Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This results in the phosphorylation of one residue located in their N-terminal AF-1 domain (Ser77 in RARα1, Ser79 in RARγ1, and Ser68 in RARγ2) (see Fig. 1A) by the Cdk7 subunit of TFIIH, which has cyclin H-dependent kinase activity. This phosphorylation process, which has been extensively studied especially in the case of RARα (10Keriel A. Stary A. Sarasin A. Rochette-Egly C. Egly J.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), plays a critical role in the response to RA.However, in the particular case of the RARγ isotype, phosphorylation by TFIIH, although necessary, is not sufficient. Indeed, to be transcriptionally active, RARγ needs to be also phosphorylated at an additional nearby residue (Ser77 in RARγ1 and Ser66 in RARγ2) (see Fig. 1A) by p38 MAPK subsequent to its activation by RA (11Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Gianni M. Kopf E. Bastien J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24859-24862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As phosphorylation by both TFIIH and p38 MAPK is required for the activation of RARγ-controlled genes (2Bastien J. Rochette-Egly C. Gene (Amst. 2004; 328: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylation of the N-terminal AF-1 domain might regulate the dissociation and/or association of proteins involved in blocking or stimulating RARγ activity. With this aim, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening experiments to characterize new cofactors interacting with the phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated forms of the AF-1 domain of RARγ and therefore regulating RARγ activity. By this approach, we isolated vinexin as a partner for the non-phosphorylated AF-1 domain of RARγ. Vinexin is a recently identified cytoskeletal protein that exists as two isoforms, vinexin α and vinexin β (13Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both proteins are devoid of any enzymatic activity, but regulate cell adhesion/cytoskeleton organization as well as signal transduction pathways (13Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T.

They share a common C-terminal sequence containing three SH3 domains that bind proline-rich sequences (16Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Vinexin α has an additional N-terminal sequence containing a sorbin homology (SoHo) domain that mediates the translocation of the protein to lipid rafts (17Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In this study, we report that vinexin β colocalizes with RARγ in the nucleus, interacts with the non-phosphorylated N-terminal AF-1 domain of RARγ, and represses RARγ-mediated transcription. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain prevents the interaction of vinexin β with RARγ. Based on these results, we propose that the underlying mechanism for the phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional activity of RARγ involves, at least in part, the dissociation of vinexin β.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Reagents—The pSG5-based expression vectors for human (h) RARγ1, hRARγ1(S77A/S79A), hRARγΔAB, mouse (m) RARα1, mRARα1(S77A), and mRXRα1 were described previously (8Bastien J.

It was introduced by lithium acetate transformation into the reporter strain expressing the LexA-RARγ1(A/B) fusion proteins from the pBTM116mod vector.

The N-terminal A/B domain of hRARγ1in which the two phosphorylatable serine residues had been substituted with alanines, RARγ(A/B)(S77A/S79A) (Fig. 1B), was used as bait in a screening of a mouse embryo cDNA library. We isolated a clone growing on selective medium and expressing β-galactosidase (Fig. 1C) that contained a 1.5-kb cDNA insert homologous to mouse vinexin (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF064806) (13Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This cDNA fragment (designated RARγ(A/B)-BP) contained the 3′-terminal half of the open reading frame encoding mouse vinexin α (amino acids 360–733) and 221 nucleotides corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of vinexin α (Fig. 2A). The encoded protein contained the three SH3 domains of vinexin α, which are also shared by the vinexin β isoform (Fig. 2, A and B) (13Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K.

This suggests that the cloned C-terminal half of vinexin would interact specifically with the non-phosphorylated A/B domain of RARγ. To corroborate this hypothesis, the cloned VP16-RARγ(A/B)-BP hybrid protein was expressed in the L40 yeast strain in combination with either LexA-RARγ(A/B)(S77A/S79A) or LexA-RARγ(A/B)(S77E/S79E). As expected, the cloned protein interacted with RARγ(A/B)(S77A/S79A), as evidenced by growth of colonies in medium lacking histidine and by expression of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1C). However, no interaction could be detected with RARγ(A/B)(S77E/S79E) (Fig. 1C), indicating that phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of RARγ impedes the interaction with the C-terminal half of vinexin.We also tested whether the cloned C-terminal half of vinexin was able to interact with the N-terminal domain of another RAR isotype, RARα. With this aim, the corresponding LexA-RARα(A/B) protein (either WT or S77A) (Fig. 1B) was expressed in the L40 yeast strain either alone or in combination with the cloned VP16-RARγ(A/B)-BP hybrid protein. In both cases, β-galactosidase was only slightly expressed (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the cloned protein interacts preferentially with RARγ.Nuclear Colocalization of Vinexin β with RARγ—Because our cloned RARγ(A/B)-binding protein contains the three SH3 domains of vinexin α, which are also shared by vinexin β, one can speculate that both vinexin isoforms might be candidates for interacting with RARγ. A number of previous studies (13Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J.

However, only vinexin β (not vinexin α) could be detected also in the nucleus (13Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Thus, we investigated whether vinexin β is able to colocalize with RARγ in the nucleus by performing epifluorescence and confocal imaging with COS-1 cells overexpressing RARγ together with FLAG-vinexin (α or β). WT RARγ (Fig. 3, panels 2, 6, 10, and 14) and RARγ(S77A/S79A) and RARγ(S77E/S79E) (data not shown) were found exclusively in the nucleus. However, the subcellular localization of vinexin was different depending on the isoform. Indeed, FLAG-vinexin α was found exclusively as dots in the cytosol of the transfected cells (Fig. 3, panels 1 and 9), whereas FLAG-vinexin β was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, panels 5 and 13). Finally, the distribution of vinexin β in the nucleus appeared to be similar to that of RARγ (Fig. 3, panels 8 and 16). In contrast, vinexin α and RARγ w"
https://openalex.org/W2143745033,"Stringent starvation protein A (SspA) of Escherichia coli is an RNA polymerase-associated transcriptional activator for the lytic development of phage P1 and is essential for stationary phase-induced acid tolerance of E. coli. We report the crystal structure of Yersinia pestis SspA, which is 83% identical to E. coli SspA in amino acid sequence and is functionally complementary in supporting the lytic growth of phage P1 and acid resistance of an E. coli sspA mutant. The structure reveals that SspA assumes the characteristic fold of glutathione S-transferase (GST). However, SspA lacks GST activity and does not bind glutathione. Three regions of SspA are flexible, the N and C termini and the α2-helix. The structure also reveals a conserved surface-exposed pocket composed of residues from a loop between helices α3 and α4. The functional roles of these structural features were investigated by assessing the ability of deletion and site-directed mutants to confer acid resistance of E. coli and to activate transcription from a phage P1 late promoter, thereby supporting the lytic growth of phage P1. The results indicate that the flexible regions are not critical for SspA function, whereas the surface pocket is important for both transcriptional activation of the phage P1 late promoter and acid resistance of E. coli. The size, shape, and property of the pocket suggest that it mediates protein-protein interactions. SspA orthologs from Y. pestis, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are all functional in acid resistance of E. coli, whereas only Y. pestis SspA supports phage P1 growth.

One of the major control points is transcription initiation, in which transcription factors modulate the activity of RNAP either positively or negatively at a particular promoter. The E. coli stringent starvation protein A (SspA) is an RNAP-associated protein (7Ishihama A. Saitoh T. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) required for the transcriptional activation of phage P1 late genes (8Hansen A.M. Lehnherr H. Wang X. Mobley V. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), of which the expression is important for the lytic development of phage P1 (9Williams M.D. Fuchs J.A. Flickinger M.C. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although at present its role in transcription is unknown, SspA is known to be implicated in survival during nutrient starvation and prolonged stationary phase (10Williams M.D. Ouyang T.X. Flickinger M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1029-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, SspA was shown to play an important role in the stationary phase-induced stress response including acid tolerance by down-regulating the level of the global regulator H-NS (68Hansen A. Qiu Y. Yeh N. Blattner F.R. Durfee T. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 713-734Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which negatively regulates multiple stress defense systems (11Atlung T. Ingmer H.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In addition, SspA is highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria. SspA orthologs in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Francisella novicida, Francisella tularensis, and Vibrio cholerae were shown to affect the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis (13De Reuse H.

To gain insight into the structural basis for the function of SspA in transcriptional activation of the phage P1 late promoter and in stationary phase induced acid tolerance of E. coli, we determined the three-dimensional structure of SspA. To this end, we cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized SspA from E. coli, Y. pestis, V. cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18Andrykovitch M. Routzahn K.M. Li M. Gu Y. Waugh D.S. Ji X. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). All four SspA proteins were subjected to crystallization trials. E. coli SspA crystallized but failed to diffract x-rays well enough for structure determination. P. aeruginosa SspA also did not form crystals that were suitable for data collection, and V. cholerae SspA failed to crystallize under any conditions tested. Only Y. pestis SspA crystallized readily, and the crystals diffracted to 2.0 Å. Here, we report the crystal structure of Y. pestis SspA, a homologous model of E. coli SspA, and the structural basis of E. coli SspA function in the development of phage P1 and in stationary phase-induced acid resistance of E. coli. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction experiments have been reported elsewhere (18Andrykovitch M. Routzahn K.M. Li M. Gu Y. Waugh D.S. Ji X. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The SspA crystals belong to space group P6522 (unit cell dimensions a = b = 100.4 Å, c = 181.9 Å). Native data, at the resolution of 2.0 Å, were collected at the beamline X9B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratories) using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector. The Pt-derivative crystal was obtained by soaking native crystals in a solution that was similar to the mother liquor and contained 1.0 mm K2PtCl4. The 2.4-Å Pt-derivative data set was collected with an in-house MAR-345 image plate system mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data collection for the Pt-derivative crystal was attempted at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Unfortunately, the crystal diffracted to only 2.8 Å. All crystals were flash frozen and maintained at –173 °C for experiments carried out both in-house and at the synchrotron facilities. The crystallization mother liquor plus 10% MPD was used as the cryoprotectant for data collection. The raw data were processed with Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar). Further data processing was performed with the CCP4 package (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19758) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure Determination—Several phasing options were explored, including MAD phasing at 2.8 Å, single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering at 2.4 Å, and multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) using both 2.4- and 2.8-Å Pt-derivative data sets. SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) was used in all phasing trials; the MIR approach resulted in the best electron density map. Four common Pt sites were identified in both Pt derivatives. Additionally, two minor sites were located in each derivative. The heavy atom sites were then refined with SHARP (22de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and the phases were improved with DM (23Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) and Solomon (24Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). ARP/WARP (25Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was used to refine and extend the phases to 2.0 Å and to build the initial model, which contained 389 out of 426 residues. Multiple rounds of refinement were performed using CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar) with 5.0% of the data reserved for cross-validation. As the refinement progressed, more residues were located and built into the model and water molecules were identified as peaks in the Fo – Fc electron density map equal to or higher than 3.0 σ. The refinement was coupled with bulk solvent correction. Model building was carried out with O (27Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The final model contains 410 amino acids, 441 water molecules, and 2 citrate ions. The average B factor for all atoms is 25.2 Å2. The quality of the structure was assessed using PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). A total of 93.4% of the main chain torsion angles are in most favored regions and none in disallowed regions. The refinement statistics can be found in Table I. Molecular Modeling—The crystal structure of Y. pestis SspA was used for the construction of an initial model of E. coli SspA. Water molecules in the Y. pestis structure were excluded. A monomer of E. coli SspA was built with the mutation facility embedded in O (27Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Then a dimer of E. coli SspA was generated by mimicking the dimeric Y. pestis protein. The dimer was subjected to geometry optimization using the conjugate gradient method of Powell (29Powell M.J.D. Math. Prog. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) embedded in CNS (30Brünger A.T. Rice L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The geometric parameters of Engh and Huber (31Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) were used as the basis of the force field. Glutathione Binding Test—The SspA crystals were soaked in a solution that was similar to the crystallization mother liquor and contained 1–5 mm glutathione (GSH) or S-hexyl-GSH for 6–24 h before they were frozen for data collection at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Details of data acquisition were as described above. For refinement, the final structure of Y. pestis SspA was used as the starting model. For each data set, one round of refinement using simulated annealing (30Brünger A.T. Rice L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was followed by Difference Fourier synthesis using CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of the resulting electron density maps was performed with O (27Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Neither GSH nor S-hexyl-GSH was identified in the structures; therefore, no further refinement was pursued. BLAST Searches and Multiple Amino Acid Sequence Alignment— BLAST searches were performed to identify orthologs of SspA in genomic sequences available on GenBank™ sites of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using the tBLASTn program with Blosum 62 matrix; Gap penalties were set at 11 (Existence) and 1 (Extension). In addition, genome data on Vibrio fischeri were obtained from the website www.integratedgenomics.com. The multiple sequence alignment was done using ClustalW (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55709) Google Scholar) with a Blosum 30 matrix (gap opening penalty 10 and gap extension penalty 0.05) and refined manually using the GeneDoc program (www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc, Ref. 33Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield D.W. EMBNEWS. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). Measurement of Glutathione S-Transferase Activity—The glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity of Y. pestis SspA, E. coli SspA, RpoS, and alpha-class GST subunit-type 1 (GST A1-1) (PanVera) was measured as their ability to catalyze the conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) to GSH using a GST Detection Module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific GST activity was calculated as μmol–1 min–1 mg protein–1. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Techniques—Bacterial strains used in this study were derivatives of E. coli K12 strain MG1655. Bacterial media, agar plates, and techniques were carried out as described (34Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Standard DNA techniques, agar plates and liquid media were used as described (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) used to amplify DNA by PCR, were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deletions and Site-directed Mutagenesis of E. coli sspA—Open reading frames encoding N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of SspA, SspAΔ1–9, and SspAΔ204–212, were cloned under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter in pBAD24 (36Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmids pDJ602 and pDJ603, respectively. pDJ602 (pBADsspAΔ1–9): A DNA fragment encoding a 27-bp 5′-end deletion of sspA was cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pBAD24. The DNA fragment was PCR-amplified from MG1655 chromosomal DNA using the oligos sspAΔ1–9 (5′-CAGGACGAATTCACCATGGTAATGACGCTGTTTTCCGGTCCT-3′) and sspABADDS (5′-CAGGACAAGCTTAACTCCGGCCCAGACGC-3′). pDJ603 (pBADsspAΔ204–212): A DNA fragment encoding a 27-bp 3′-end deletion of sspA was cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pBAD24.

Mutant pQEsspABP84A/H85A/P86A (pDJ612) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of sspA encoded by pDJ706. Mutagenesis of sspA resulting in substitution of P84A, H85A, and P86A was performed using oligos sspAP84A/H85A/P86AFW and sspAP84A/H85A/P86ABW. Cloning of Y. pestis sspA, V. cholerae sspA, and P. aeruginosa sspA— The constructs pBADsspAYp (pDJ613), pBADsspAVc (pDJ614), and pBADsspAPa (pDJ615) encode Y. pestis sspA, V. cholerae sspA, and P. aeruginosa sspA, respectively, under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter in pBAD24. pBADsspAYp (pDJ613): A DNA fragment encoding Y. pestis sspA was PCR-amplified from pRILSspAYp (18Andrykovitch M.

Acid Resistance Test—The acid resistance test was performed as described previously (68Hansen A. Qiu Y. Yeh N. Blattner F.R. Durfee T. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 713-734Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures (18 h) grown in LB at 37 °C were diluted 1:1000 in warm LB, adjusted to pH 2.5 with HCl (6n), and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The number of colony forming units per milliliter was determined by plating serial dilutions of cells in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) on LB agar plates before and after exposure to acid. The LB agar plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Acid survival was calculated as the percentage of cells remaining after acid treatment compared with the initial number of cells. Each experiment was repeated independently at least three times. The ability of E. coli wild-type and mutant SspA proteins, as well as the Y. pestis, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa SspA proteins to complement stationary phase acid intolerance of the sspA mutant strain DJ6000 (68Hansen A. Qiu Y. Yeh N. Blattner F.R. Durfee T. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 713-734Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was determined by expressing sspA in trans from plasmids. The E. coli wild-type (pQEsspA (pDJ600) (68Hansen A. Qiu Y. Yeh N. Blattner F.R. Durfee T. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 713-734Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar)) and the site-directed mutant sspA genes (pQEsspAR82A, pQEsspAH85A, pQEsspAP86A, pQEsspAY92A, and pQEsspAP84A/H85A/P86A) were expressed from a tac promoter in the absence of the inducer isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG). The E. coli sspA deletion mutants (pBADsspAΔ1–9 and pBADsspAΔ204–212), as well as the wild-type genes from E. coli (pBADsspABEc (pDJ608)), Y. pestis (pBADsspAYp), V. cholerae (pBADsspAVc), and P. aeruginosa (pBADsspAPa) were expressed in the presence of 0.02% arabinose (8Hansen A.M. Lehnherr H. Wang X. Mobley V. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The expression of plasmid-encoded sspA in the sspA mutant strain was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against E. coli SspA. Complementation of Phage P1 Growth on the sspA Mutant Strain— The assay was performed in two ways. In the first approach the growth of phage P1 was followed by looking at plaque formation on a solid plate, whereas in the second approach lytic growth was observed as cell lysis of a culture. The ability of the E. coli SspA mutants and the wild-type SspA from E. coli, Y. pestis, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa to complement phage P1 growth of the sspA mutant DJ6000 (68Hansen A. Qiu Y. Yeh N. Blattner F.R. Durfee T. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 713-734Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was determined by expressing sspA in trans as described above in cells grown to the mid-log phase LB medium containing 20 mm CaCl2, and when appropriate, 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Strains were then infected with different dilutions of P1-vir (laboratory collection) for 20 min at room temperature. After 5 ml of 0.7% molten top agar containing 20 mm CaCl2 were added, the cells were poured onto LB agar plates. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the number of plaques and the plaque size were determined. The complementation test was carried out in at least three independent experiments for each strain. The ability of the wild-type and mutant E. coli SspA to support lytic growth of the thermal-inducible prophage P1Cmclr.100 (37Rosner J.L. Virology. 1972; 48: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) in the sspA mutant DJ6000 (68Hansen A. Qiu Y. Yeh N. Blattner F.R. Durfee T. Jin D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 713-734Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was determined by growing cells in LB medium at 30 °C to an A600 value of 0.4 prior to induction of the prophage to lytic growth by a temperature shift to 42 °C. Lytic growth of phage P1 was determined by optically measuring the degree of cell lysis at 600 nm every 10 min after prophage induction. The wild-type and mutant E. coli SspA were expressed in trans in the absence of the inducer IPTG. In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription of the P1 late promoter Ps was performed as described (8Hansen A.M. Lehnherr H. Wang X. Mobley V. Jin D.J. Mol.

The transcription reaction was initiated by the addition of NTPs (0.2 mm of ATP, GTP, and CTP; 0.02 mm for UTP including ∼0.25 μCi of [α-32P]UTP with the specific activity 3000 Ci/mm). The reactions were stopped after 10 min by addition of 5 μl of stop solution (0.25 m EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The transcription products were denatured at 90 °C for 2 min and resolved on an 8% denaturing acrylamide gel.

A rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC6 became elongated, extended protrusions at cell periphery, and increased stress fibers and focal contacts upon the induction of β-catenin protein stabilized by deletion of the N-terminal glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSKβ) phosphorylation sites (β-catenin ΔN89). We used the GeneChip™ oligonucleotide microarray system to examine approximately 24 000 genes and identified 13 genes whose expression was altered during the course of this morphological transformation. Those genes included known negative regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway, Sfrp4 and Axin2; extracellular matrix and related molecule, Hxb and Crtl1; cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins, Podxl, Igaf4, and Itab6; and molecules involved in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways, Enpp1, Igfbp2, and Sgk. We report the finding that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) is a direct target gene of the β-catenin and TCF/LEF complexes. The IGFBP2 protein interacts with integrins. Disruption of the multigene network system regulating cell adhesion and cytoskeleton may be crucial in the initiation of colorectal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2087411031,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood malignancy originating from neural crest cells, which seldom occurs in association with other neurocristopathies. Owing to the rarity of familial NB cases, only a few linkage data are available and no mutations in candidate genes have been demonstrated up till now. Germline mutations in a small proportion of NB patients have been recently reported in the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene, suggesting its role in NB predisposition. On the basis of this indication, we screened three Italian families with recurrence of NB and one family with occurrence of ganglioneuroblastoma and isolated Hirschsprung disease for PHOX2B defects. Our analysis did not show any mutation, excluding PHOX2B as the NB susceptibility gene in the families we analysed. Our findings combined with those derived from other PHOX2B mutation screenings and from genome-wide linkage analysis support a remarkable genetic heterogeneity of NB and suggest an oligogenic model of disease transmission. Furthermore, as PHOX2B mutations were mainly observed in some NB families with multifocal and syndromic NB, features that are missing in the families we have studied, we suggest they represent second-site modifications responsible for a specific phenotype rather than causal mutations of a major locus."

https://openalex.org/W2126350253,"To date two classes of shikimate dehydrogenases have been identified and characterized, YdiB and AroE. YdiB is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reductions of dehydroquinate to quinate and dehydroshikimate to shikimate in the presence of either NADH or NADPH. In contrast, AroE catalyzes the reversible reduction of dehydroshikimate to shikimate in the presence of NADPH. Here we report the crystal structure and biochemical characterization of HI0607, a novel class of shikimate dehydrogenase annotated as shikimate dehydrogenase-like. The kinetic properties of HI0607 are remarkably different from those of AroE and YdiB. In comparison with YdiB, HI0607 catalyzes the oxidation of shikimate but not quinate. The turnover rate for the oxidation of shikimate is ∼1000-fold lower compared with that of AroE. Phylogenetic analysis reveals three independent clusters representing three classes of shikimate dehydrogenases, namely AroE, YdiB, and this newly characterized shikimate dehydrogenase-like protein. In addition, mutagenesis studies of two invariant residues, Asp-103 and Lys-67, indicate that they are important catalytic groups that may function as a catalytic pair in the shikimate dehydrogenase reaction. This is the first study that describes the crystal structure as well as mutagenesis and mechanistic analysis of this new class of shikimate dehydrogenase.

This is the first study that describes the crystal structure as well as mutagenesis and mechanistic analysis of this new class of shikimate dehydrogenase. The shikimate pathway occupies a central position for aromatic biosynthesis in microbes and plants but is not present in humans and other higher animals. The absence of the shikimate pathway in animals makes it an ideal target for herbicide and anti-microbial drug design. Recently the shikimate pathway was identified in apicomplexan parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, which has renewed interest in better understanding the enzymes in the pathway (1McConkey G.A. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 94: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.A. Richards T.A. Mui E.J. Samuel B.U. Coggins J.R. McLeod R. Roberts C.W. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The importance of the shikimate pathway is exemplified by the common herbicide glyphosate, which inhibits the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase. Recent studies have also shown that glyphosate blocks the shikimate pathway in apicomplexan parasites and is effective in controlling their growth (3Roberts C.W. Roberts F. Lyons R.E. Kirisits M.J. Mui E.J. Finnerty J. Johnson J.J. Ferguson D.J. Coggins J.R. Krell T. Coombs G.H. Milhous W.K. Kyle D.E. Tzipori S. Barnwell J. Dame J.B. Carlton J. McLeod R. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: S25-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The shikimate pathway consists of seven enzymatic steps initiated by the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate by 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptolosonate 7-phosphate synthase. The last enzymatic step produces the branch point intermediate, chorismate, which serves in turn as the precursor for a number of pathways including those involved in aromatic amino acid, phytoalexin, flavanoid, and lignin biosynthesis. The fourth enzyme in the pathway, shikimate dehydrogenase (shikimate:NADP+ oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.25), is involved in the NADPH-dependent reduction of dehydroshikimate to shikimate. This enzymatic reaction proceeds in both the forward and reverse direction with similar rates and similar Michaelis constants for substrates in either direction. Kinetic studies with substrate analogues and isotope exchange demonstrated that the shikimate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction is consistent with an ordered sequential mechanism (4Balinsky D. Dennis A.W. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Two types of shikimate dehydrogenases from bacteria have been characterized to date, AroE and YdiB (quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.282). Although AroE has been established as the enzyme responsible for flux through the main trunk of the shikimate pathway, YdiB has been implicated in a branch point involving the metabolism of quinate (5Herrmann K.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 6Herrmann K.M. Weaver L.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 473-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). YdiB was first characterized in fungi and was shown to play a significant role in the quinate utilization pathway rather than in the shikimate pathway itself (7Giles N.H. Case M.E. Baum J. Geever R. Huiet L. Patel V. Tyler B. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 338-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wheeler K.A. Lamb H.K. Hawkins A.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This pathway consists of three enzymes (quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase, 3-dehydroquinase, and dehydroshikimate dehydratase) that catabolize quinate into protocatechuic acid. In addition, quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase can also catalyze the reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate. The structures of both the AroE and YdiB proteins have been determined (9Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J. Matte A. Coggins J.R. Cygler M. Lapthorn A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19463-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study we identified a novel class of shikimate dehydrogenases termed shikimate dehydrogenase-like (SDH-L). 1The abbreviations used are: SDH-L, shikimate dehydrogenase-like; HI, Haemophilus influenzae. Phylogenetic and kinetic analyses show that SDH-L is distinct from both AroE and YdiB, yet, all three classes have similar three-dimensional structures. This class of shikimate dehydrogenase was annotated by sequencing projects as shikimate dehydrogenase-like because of the lack of supporting biological and biochemical data. Because the shikimate pathway enzymes are ideal targets for the development of antimicrobial and herbicidal compounds, identification and characterization of novel enzyme(s) will enhance our understanding of the pathway and may reveal other avenues for drug and herbicide design. In this study we present the crystal structure and kinetic analysis of the shikimate dehydrogenase-like enzyme (HI0607) from Haemophilus influenzae. Chemicals—Shikimic acid was a generous gift from Professor John Frost at Michigan State University. All other reagents are of molecular biology grade and were purchased from Sigma, Bioshop, or BDH. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The gene (gene identifier 38233601) encoding the hypothetical shikimate 3-dehydrogenase-like protein HI0607 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from H. influenzae genomic DNA and cloned into the MCSG7 vector as described elsewhere (10Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of HI0607 were conducted according to the published protocol by Christendat et al. (11Christendat D. Saridakis V. Dharamsi A. Bochkarev A. Pai E.F. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24608-24612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, HI0607 recombinants were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 Gold in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until the culture reached an A of 0.7 at 600 nm. The culture was then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and allowed to grow overnight with shaking at 24 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then disrupted by sonication, and the insoluble cellular material was removed by centrifugation. HI0607 was purified from other contaminating proteins using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Purified HI0607 was concentrated and quantified at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 16640 m–1 cm–1 from a contribution of its aromatic amino acids. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared by supplementing a methionine auxotroph BL21 Escherichia coli strain (B834 DE3 from Novagen) with selenomethionine in its growth media. The protein was purified and quantified as described above for native HI0607 with the addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in all buffers during the purification process. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene) in which the following complimentary oligonucleotides containing the required mutation (indicated by boldfaced codons) for the HI0607 active site were used: K67H, 5′-GCTGTTTCAATGCCATTCCACGAAACTTGTATGCC-3′; K67N, 5′-GCTGTTTCAATGCCATTCAACGAAACTTGTATGCC-3′; K67A, 5′-GCTGTTTCAATGCCATTCGCAGAAACTTGTATGCC-3′; D130N, 5′-GCGTGCATATAACACTAACTACATTGCCATCG-3′; and D103A, 5′-GCGTGCATATAACACTGCATACATTGCCATCG-3′. DNA encoding wild-type HI0607 was used as a template for the polymerase chain mutagenesis reaction. Briefly, 25 ng of template DNA were incubated with the appropriate mutagenic primers, dNTPs, and Pfu DNA polymerase using the cycling parameters recommended in the supplier's technical manual. Following completion of the amplification reaction, 10 units of DpnI were added to each reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, and 1 μl of the resulting mix was then transformed into XL2-Blue cells as recommended by the supplier. Plasmid DNA was purified from the resulting colonies using the Mini Prep Kit (Qiagen), and all mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified using the identical protocol as that used for the wild-type protein described above. Enzyme Kinetics—The enzymatic activity of HI0607 was assayed by monitoring the reduction of NADP+ at 340 nm and 30 °C in the presence of either shikimate or quinate. The Km and Vmax values were determined by varying the concentrations of either shikimate or NADP+ while keeping the other substrate at saturation; 4 mm shikimate and 2 mm NADP+ were considered saturating. These substrate concentrations were at least 10 times higher than their respective Km values. The ability of HI0607 to utilize NAD+ was determined by assaying the enzyme at NAD+ concentrations up to 10 mm with shikimate at saturation or with varying the concentration of quinate up to 100 mm. The effect of divalent metals on the enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate was determined with either 5 mm MgCl2, ZnCl2, Zn(OAc)2, MnCl2, or CaCl2 in the reaction cuvette and saturating amounts of NADP+ and shikimate. The pH rate profile was prepared by conducting Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics at each pH value, and both kcat and Km values were determined. To determine the effect of extreme pH on enzyme stability, the enzyme was preincubated at pH 7.5 and 9.5 and assayed for loss of activity after a specific time at pH 8.5. In addition, enzyme activity was also monitored at the two pH extremes over a 30-min period to determine whether a time-dependent inactivation was occurring. Data Analysis—The kinetic data were fitted to the following rate equations using the computer programs of Cleland or GraFit®. Initial velocity data were obtained by varying the concentration of either shikimate or NADP+ (A) and fitted to Equation 1, shown here, v=VAK+A (Eq. 1) to yield maximal velocity values (V) and the Michaelis constant (K). The variation of the values for V and V/K as a function of pH were fitted to the log form of Equation 2 or Equation 3, shown here, y=C1+(H/KA)+(KB/H) (Eq. 2) y=C1+(H/KA) (Eq. 3) where Y represents the value of V or V/K at a particular pH value, C represents the pH-independent value of the parameters, KA and KB are acid dissociation constants, and H is the hydrogen ion concentration. Crystallization, Data Collection, Processing, and Refinement—Crystals of HI0607 were grown using the vapor diffusion hanging drop approach (12Jankarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). The crystallization condition contained 1 μl of protein (20 mg/ml) and 1 μl of crystallization solution containing 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 2.0 m NaCl, and 10% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400. The crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell parameters of a = 90.6 Å, b = 66.6 Å, c = 96.9 Å, and β = 109.6°, and four protein molecules per asymmetric unit. The resulting protein crystal diffracted to 1.75-Å resolution, and the diffraction data were collected from a single crystal of native protein at a temperature of 100 K in a nitrogen stream. Crystals of selenomethionine protein diffracted to 2.6-Å resolution. Structure Determination—A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was conducted, and two wavelength data sets were collected at the inflection point and the peak of the selenium absorption edge (Table I). The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 software package (13Minor W. Tomchick D. Otwinowski Z. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: R105-R110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Selenium positions and phase information were obtained with the software package SOLVE, followed by density modification with the program RESOLVE. The initial protein model was built with RESOLVE and refined with REFMAC as implemented in the software package RESOLVE version 2.03 (14Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Statistics for the data collection and structure refinement are shown in Table I. A Ramachandran plot of all the amino acids in the final model revealed that 92% of these residues have excellent stereochemistry, and no residues were found with generally allowed or disallowed geometry as determined with the program PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). All x-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline 19ID of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Sequence Analysis—Amino acid sequence analyses of HI0607-identified proteins belonging to the three functional classes of shikimate dehydrogenases; the first was functionally annotated as a SDH-L enzyme, the second as shikimate dehydrogenase (encoded by the aroE gene), and the third as quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (encoded by the ydiB gene). Subsequently, phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct groups, YdiB, AroE, and SDH-L, thus indicating a distinct evolutionary relationship (Fig. 1). The SDH-L protein was identified only in a small group of organisms, including species of Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Haemophilus. In contrast, AroE was identified in most microbial species, and YdiB was represented in a lower percentage of organisms. Sequence analysis identified a number of conserved residues in SDH-L as well as residues that are common to both AroE and YdiB; two of these latter residues, Lys-67 and Asp-103, were studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Structure Description—HI0607 consists of two domains, both of which belong to the structural class of α/β proteins. These two domains are linked by α-helices α4 and α9 and are important in keeping the N- and C-terminal domains together (Fig. 2A). The first 100 residues constitute the N-terminal domain of HI0607 with a secondary structure arrangement consisting of a central, mainly parallel six-stranded β-sheet with the strand order β2, β1, β3, β5, β6, and β4 flanked by four α-helices, α1, α2, α3, and α10. The C-terminal domain consists of a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet with the strand order β9, β8, β7, β10, β11, and β12 surrounded by five α-helices (helices α4, α5, α6, α7, and α8) (Fig. 2A). A deep central cavity is found in the middle of the N-terminal domain, which is formed partly by the β-sheet (strands β3, β5, and β6) and an α-helix (α2) forming the back wall of the cavity (Fig. 2A). The root mean square deviation between the N-terminal domains of the four molecules ranges from 0.17 to 0.19 Å, and between the C-terminal α/β domains it ranges from 0.19 to 0.39 Å. The overall root mean square deviation between the N- and C-terminal domains ranges from 0.42 to 0.59 Å, which indicates that flexibility exists between N-and C-terminal domains at the two hinge regions around residues Thr-102 and Gly-235. Further evidence of this behavior came from the Cα atom of Ala-173, which moves ∼3.5 Å upon superposition of the N-terminal domains of the A and C monomers. Oligomeric Structure—Gel filtration studies performed on HI0607 indicate that the protein is a dimer in solution, which may also correspond to its biological state. This hypothesis is further supported by the crystal structure; intersubunit contacts are observed predominantly in a pairwise manner, which is consistent with the protein being a dimer (Fig. 2B). Subunit contacts between molecules A and D involve 2153 Å2, and between molecules B and C these contacts involve 2145 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface area. The N-terminal domains of these molecules form a network with extensive hydrophobic interactions within the dimer. Dali (Distance Matrix Alignment) Analysis—Comparative structure analysis of HI0607 was conducted by searching the Protein Data Bank with the Dali algorithm to identify structural neighbors of HI0607. In addition to other shikimate dehydrogenases, we have identified a number of proteins with high structural similarity, having a Z score of 6 or higher, to that of HI0607. Other proteins with highly conserved structural features to that of HI0607 include tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (1A4I), NAD-dependent 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (1EE9), alcohol dehydrogenase (2OHX), and NADP(H)-dependent ketose reductase (1E3J). In each case, structural conservation is localized mainly in the cofactor-binding domain as expected for nucleotide-binding proteins. The substrate-binding domain, however, adopts a fold specific to the shikimate dehydrogenase family (20Vogan E. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 902-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Identification of the Nucleotide and Substrate-binding Domains—The crystal structures of five shikimate dehydrogenases were recently determined and are now available in the Protein Data Bank. These include the structures of the AroE enzymes from E. coli (1NYT), H. influenzae (1P74 and 1P77), and Methanococcus jannaschii (1NVT), the YdiB enzyme from E. coli (1O9B and 1NPD), and HI0607, the shikimate-dehydrogenase-like enzyme from H. influenzae (1NPY) that is discussed here. Superposition of the dehydrogenase structures with that of HI0607 indicated that their substrate and nucleotide-binding sites are highly conserved (Fig. 3, A and B). The nucleotide-binding sites of E. coli and H. influenzae AroE have been identified by co-crystallization with either NADP+ (E. coli AroE) or a nucleotide analog, 2′-monophosphoadenosine-5′-diphosphate (H. influenzae AroE). Arg-151 of HI0607 is conserved among AroE and some SDH-L proteins from different organisms. The crystal structure of the E. coli AroE-NADP+ complex revealed that this conserved Arg is interacting with the 2′-phosphate of NADP+. Such an interaction is important for discriminating between NAD+ and NADP+ (21Lesk A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10340-10349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, its alkyl side chain stacks with the adenine ring, and such interactions have been shown to improve the binding affinity for the nucleotide (23Ahvazi B. Coulombe R. Delarge M. Vedadi M. Zhang L. Meighen E. Vrielink A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This observation, i.e. the interaction of Arg-151 with the 2′phosphate of NADP+, is in line with the enzymatic reaction, which indicated that HI SDH-L requires NADP+ for activity, but not NAD+. Although several crystal structures of shikimate dehydrogenases are now available, analysis of the substrate-binding site is still lacking, and important mechanistic information that can be obtained from these structures has not been attempted. Architecture of the Substrate-binding Site—The substrate-binding site of HI0607 is ∼14 × 10-Å wide and 12-Å deep. The bottom of this pocket is lined by a number of polar groups including Tyr-37, Tyr-250, His-24, and Gln-246. Down into this cleft at the right are a number of hydrophobic groups including Ala-243, Phe-19, Phe-23, and Phe-247. On the immediate left of this cleft are mainly polar groups, including a cluster of serines (Ser-11, Ser-13, Ser-17, and Ser63). Closer to the domain interface, on the wall of this substrate-binding pocket, are a number of polar groups including Thr-89, Thr-102, Asn-88, Asn-101, and Gln-242 (Fig. 2C). Most of these residues are conserved among the different shikimate dehydrogenases, suggesting that they are functionally important (Fig. 3B). Asp-103 and Lys-67 are invariant across the three classes of shikimate dehydrogenases and are found in the substrate-binding pocket (Figs. 2C and 3B). Asp-103 and Lys-67 are most likely involved in the catalytic mechanism of shikimate dehydrogenase, because they are the only two ionizable groups in the substrate-binding site close to the C4 position of nicotinamide. We superposed the structures of shikimate dehydrogenases with that of HI0607 and searched a 6.5-Å radius around the C4 position of the superposed nicotinamide. We would expect the reaction center of shikimate to be positioned ∼2.8 Å away from this catalytic pair (Asp-103 and Lys-67), which is involved in acid base chemistry, and another 2.8 Å away from the C4 of nicotinamide, via which hydride transfer would occur. HI0607 Catalyzes the Oxidation of Shikimate—Because sequence analysis revealed that HI0607 may belong to a completely new class of shikimate dehydrogenases (Fig. 1), we set out to determine the kinetic properties of HI0607 for comparative analysis. Aside from HI0607, the AroE (HI0655) enzyme was also identified in H. influenzae; however a YdiB homologue has not been identified. We compared the substrate requirement and kinetic properties of HI0607 with those of the E. coli AroE and YdiB enzymes. We observed that HI0607 catalyzes only the oxidation of shikimate in the presence of NADP+ with a kcat of 0.2 s–1 and Michaelis constants of 234 μm ± 14 μm for shikimate and 37 μm ± 6 μm for NADP+ (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the catalytic rate for shikimate was 1000-fold lower than that of the published rate for E. coli AroE (236.7 s–1), but it was comparable with the published rate for E. coli YdiB (0.117 s–1) (9Michel G. Roszak A.W. Sauve V. Maclean J. Matte A. Coggins J.R. Cygler M. Lapthorn A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19463-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This low turnover rate can be attributed to substrate specificity, indicating that shikimate may not be the biological substrate for the SDH-L enzyme. We also determined that the cofactor specificities of HI0607 were comparable with those of AroE, because HI0607 was very specific for NADP+ and did not utilize NAD+ as a cofactor. In addition, HI0607 did not accept quinate as a substrate in the presence of either cofactor NADP+ or NAD+, unlike YdiB. These observations are consistent with our sequence analysis showing that this shikimate dehydrogenase-like enzyme clusters separately from the AroE and YdiB shikimate dehydrogenases. Furthermore, the ability of HI0607 to catalyze the oxidation of shikimate to dehydroshikimate in the presence of NADP+, the reverse reaction, is further evidence that this enzyme belongs to the shikimate dehydrogenase class of enzymes. Comparison of the structures of shikimate dehydrogenase reveals small amino acid variations among the active sites of the three classes of shikimate dehydrogenases. As such, it is likely that a number of subtle variations of active site residues may contribute to the inherent kinetic properties of these enzymes. These observations indicate that the SDH-L protein shares kinetic and structural properties with both AroE and YdiB shikimate dehydrogenases but may have an unrelated biological function. Divalent Metal Ion Requirement—The 1000-fold lower kcat for HI0607 as compared with that of the E. coli AroE protein can also indicate a metal cofactor requirement for activity. To address this question, we looked at the dependence of a number of divalent cations (Zn2+,Ca2+,Mg2+, and Mn2+) to determine whether they would affect the kinetic parameters of HI0607; however, at concentrations up to 5 mm no significant rate enhancement was observed. We also monitored the effect of removing any endogenous metal(s) from the protein by the addition of up to 10 mm EDTA in the reaction mixture. EDTA did not affect the reaction rate, indicating that there is no divalent metal dependence on the reaction mechanism. pH Dependence Studies—The pH rate profile of HI0607 was determined by measuring the maximal enzyme rate within the pH range of 7.5–9.8. The rate data from this analysis was fitted with the pH rate-dependence equation (3Roberts C.W. Roberts F. Lyons R.E. Kirisits M.J. Mui E.J. Finnerty J. Johnson J.J. Ferguson D.J. Coggins J.R. Krell T. Coombs G.H. Milhous W.K. Kyle D.E. Tzipori S. Barnwell J. Dame J.B. Carlton J. McLeod R. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: S25-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) described under “Materials and Methods.” The enzyme displayed a half-bell pH rate profile, with the lower activity limb residing at the acidic pH range and maximal activity at pH 8.8 (Fig. 4C). The rate profile indicated that a group, with a pK of ∼8.1, is involved in the catalytic reaction and needs to be deprotonated for activity. Detailed kinetic and pH rate analysis for AroE shikimate dehydrogenase from the pea also displayed a similar pH rate profile (24Dennis A.W. Balinsky D. Int. J. Biochem. 1972; 3: 93-102Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Active site lysine and histidine residues are known to titrate in this region (range pH 6.5 to 8.5); however, other active site groups, such as aspartate, can also titrate in this pH range depending on their environment (25Christendat D. Saridakis V.C. Turnbull J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15703-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This observation is in agreement with the crystal structure of HI0607, which showed that Lys-67 and Asp-103 are located at the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket, the expected position for a catalytic group in this protein (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the positioning of the Asp-103 and Lys-67 with respect to each other suggests that they may function as a catalytic dyad in the reaction mechanism. Consequently, the role of these two active site groups was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Although Asp-103 and Lys-67 are the only two ionic groups in the active site, other polar groups in the active site can easily be ionized at this pH range, depending on their microenvironment. Therefore, detailed mechanistic analysis in terms of pH dependence and mutagenesis studies is being undertaken on the Arabidopsis thaliana AroE protein. Site-directed Mutagenesis—If Asp-103 and Lys-67 function as a catalytic pair, then the mutation of either group will produce an inactive enzyme. However, if these two groups function independently, we should observe different kinetic properties, perhaps varying levels of inactivation of HI0607 with each mutation, and a varying effect on the pH rate profile. We mutated these residues to alanine and asparagine independently; we also mutated Lys-67 to a histidine. This mutation, however, is not conservative in terms of the van der Waals volume of its side chain; therefore, an asparagine mutation was also introduced as a conservative replacement. This mutation should help to compensate for the size of the side chain and its ability to hydrogen bond. Characterization and Kinetic Properties of Mutant Proteins— The expression and purification properties of the mutant enzymes were similar to those of the wild-type, which indirectly indicated that there were no global conformational changes due to these mutations. In addition, the circular dichroism profile (from 204 to 360 nm) of each mutant protein was similar to that of the wild-type protein. Further biophysical analysis showed that these proteins denature with similar melting temperatures (Tm) compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 5). However, these studies are only true indicators for major structural effects. We observed that all of the mutations independently inactivated HI0607. We worked at very high protein concentrations in our reaction vessel, from 10 to 200 μg of mutant protein in a 1-ml reaction mixture, but did not observe a reaction rate with any of the mutants. It is possible that these mutations may have a localized effect on the active site architecture and, therefore, may affect substrate binding. To compensate for this possibility we increased the concentration of substrates; shikimic acid was increased to 10 mm and NADP+ to 10 mm, which is at least 40 times their respective Km values, and we monitored the reaction rate but were still unable to restore enzyme activity. If these mutations affected substrate binding, we should have been able to partially restore enzyme activity at such high substrate concentrations. We analyzed the corresponding mutants of the Arabidopsis thaliana AroE homologue (NP_187286); the K385N and D423N mutants independently resulted in a 1000-fold reduction in shikimate dehydrogenase activity. 2S. Singh and D. Christendat, unpublished data. As such, we should expect a similar magnitude reduction of HI0607 enzymatic activity for the corresponding mutants. Assuming a reduced activity of 1000-fold for a given HI0607 mutant, the expected observable rate would be only 5.8 × 10–4 absorbance units per minute (with 200 μg mutant protein), which is below the detectable limit of a UV-visible spectrometer using the extinction coefficient value of 6220 m–1 cm–1 for NADPH. In general, the reduced enzyme activity observed for these active site mutants, for both Arabidopsis AroE and HI0607, is consistent with our expectation for catalytic residues. Taking together the location of these two ionizable groups in the enzyme active site, the pH profile indicating an ionizable group of pK 8.0, and the mutagenesis studies that inactivated HI0607 and the Arabidopsis thaliana AroE homologue, we conclude that Lys-67 and Asp-103 are key catalytic groups and may function as a catalytic pair for HI0607 activity. We are currently investigating this notion further, in addition to the roles of a number of other conserved active site residues. Biological Role of HI0607—The experimental evidence presented here supports the current sequence annotation of HI0607 as being a shikimate dehydrogenase-like protein. Its crystal structure is similar to those of AroE and YdiB, it catalyzes the oxidation of shikimate with NADP+, and functionally important active site residues are conserved among this protein and the two other classes of shikimate dehydrogenases. However, AroE and YdiB have distinct biological roles. AroE functions primarily in shuttling metabolites thorough the main trunk of the shikimate pathway in both plants and microbes. On the other hand, YdiB is a branch point enzyme for quinate biosynthesis from the shikimate pathway. Because SDH-L catalyzes the oxidation of shikimate and is only present in distinct classes of pathogenic organisms, it is likely that this enzyme is involved in a novel branch from the shikimate pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2057242229,"ShcC is a family member of the Shc docking proteins that possess two different phosphotyrosine-binding motifs and conduct signals as Grb2-binding substrates of various receptor tyrosine kinases. We have recently shown that some neuroblastoma cell lines, such as NB-39-nu cells, express a protein complex of hyperphosphorylated ShcC and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is self-activated by gene amplification. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of a mutant ShcC lacking Grb2-binding sites, 3YF-ShcC, significantly impaired the survival, differentiation and motility of NB-39-nu cells by blocking the ERK and Akt pathways. On the other hand, cells overexpressing ShcC or 3YF-ShcC, but not a mutant ShcC that lacks SH2, showed decreased anchorage independency and in vivo tumorigenicity, suggesting a novel ShcC-specific suppressive effect through its SH2 domain on cell transformation. Notably, overexpression of ShcC suppressed the sustained phosphorylation of Src family kinase after cell detachment, which might be independent of phosphorylation of Grb2-binding site. It was indicated that the Src/Fyn-Cas pathway is modulated as a target of these suppressive effects by ShcC. Reciprocal change of ShcC expression and phosphorylation observed in malignant neuroblastoma cell lines might be explained by these phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent functions of ShcC."
https://openalex.org/W2004180313,"The three-dimensional structures of NAD-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-LDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), which resemble each other, imply that the two enzymes commonly employ certain main chain atoms, which are located on corresponding loop structures in the active sites of the two enzymes, for their respective catalytic functions.

Furthermore, these mutant FDHs, particularly the Glu141 → Asn enzyme, exhibited markedly enhanced catalytic activity for glyoxylate reduction, indicating that FDH is converted to a 2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase on the replacement of Glu141.

Compared with their d-LDH counterparts, these residues play different roles in catalysis, interacting with the carboxyl group of the acid substrate that adopts a different orientation in the active site (22Lamzin V.S.

The three-dimensional structure of Pseudomonas FDH (22Lamzin V.S. Dauter Z. Popov V.O. Harutyunyan E.H. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 759-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) shows that the active site also contains a contribution from the main chain of Ile122, the residue that corresponds to Val78 of d-LDH. In the case of FDH, however, Ile122 orientates its carbonyl oxygen toward the bound substrate molecule (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the loop is involved in the promotion of hydride transfer through polarization of the bound substrate, rather than substrate binding (23Popov V.O. Lamzin V.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 625-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is notable that the amide and carboxyl side chains of Asn97 and Glu141, which are also located at corresponding positions in d-LDH and FDH, form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl and amide groups of the Val78 and Gly123 main chains on the active site loops, respectively (13Stoll V.S. Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Lamzin V.S. Dauter Z. Popov V.O. Harutyunyan E.H. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 759-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). This observation implies that the nature of the hydrogen bonding interaction offered by the residue at position 97/141 may be crucial in determining the conformation of the active site loop in general and the nature of the backbone group presented to the substrate by residue 78/123 in particular. In this study, we characterized a mutant L. pentosus d-LDH (N97D) (27Shinoda T. Satoh T. Mineki S. Iida M. Taguchi H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in which Asn97 was replaced with Asp, and also two mutant Paracoccus sp. 12-A FDHs (E141N and E141Q), in which Glu141 was replaced with Asn and Gln, in order to evaluate the roles of Asn97 and Glu141 and also, more indirectly, to study the roles of the active site loops in the functioning of the two enzymes. Amino Acid Replacement—Table I lists the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis in this study. The replacement of Asn97 with Asp in L. pentosus JCM1558 (ATCC 8041) d-LDH was performed with a Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad), according to Kunkel (28Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar), using an oligodeoxynucleotide purchased from Takara Shuzo. Paracoccus sp. 12-A FDH mutants (E141N and E141Q) were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with oligodeoxynucleotides from GENSET OLIGOS. The DNA fragments were sequenced by the dideoxy chain terminator procedure (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The purity of the enzyme preparations was examined by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay and Protein Determination—The enzyme assay for d-LDHs was performed at 30 °C in 100 mm sodium MES buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.1 mm NADH and various concentrations of 2-ketoacids (sodium salts). The activity of FDHs toward formate was assayed at 30 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1.0 mm NAD+ and various concentrations of sodium formate. The activity of FDHs toward glyoxylate was assayed at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium MES buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.1 mm NADH and various concentrations of glyoxylate. One unit was defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate per 1 min. Kinetic parameters were calculated from plots of ν/[S] versus [S]. The deuterium derivative of NADH (NADD (nicotinamide-4-2H)NADH) was prepared according to Colowick and Kaplan (32Colowick S.P. Kaplan N.O. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 840-855Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that of formic acid was purchased from Sigma, to be used for the determination of primary isotope effects on the pyruvate reduction and formate oxidation by the mutant d-LDH and the wild-type and mutant FDHs, respectively. Protein concentrations were calculated using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 27,045 and 47,330 m–1 cm–1 for d-LDHs and FDHs, respectively, as determined from the amino acid compositions and molecular weights of L. pentosusd-LDH (2Bernard N.

Crystallographic Analysis of N97D d-LDH—The protein solution for crystallization was prepared by concentration of the purified N97D d-LDH sample with a Centriplus YM-10 and Centricon (Millipore). Crystallization of the enzyme was performed at 25 °C by a slight modification of the procedure used for the wild-type enzyme (13Stoll V.S. Kimber M.S. Pai E.F.

A 4-μl drop was made by mixing a reservoir solution, which consisted of 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 0.21 m ammonium sulfate, and 28% (w/v) PEG4000 as precipitants, and a protein solution (8 mg/ml), which was then equilibrated against 1 ml of the reservoir solution. Crystals were transferred a solution containing 25% glycerol prior to flash-cooling for data collection. X-ray data were collected at 100 K with a CCD camera at the BL6A station of the Photon Factory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the DPS/MOSFILM program suite (33Steller I. Bolotovsky R. Rossmann M.G. J. Appl.

The protein crystals proved to be of space group P1 with unit cell parameters of a = 55.7 Å, b = 58.9 Å, c = 62.3 Å, α = 74.5°, β = 93.0°, γ = 82.5°, with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by taking the original protein atom coordinates for the L. pentosus d-LDH (13Stoll V.S. Kimber M.S. Pai E.F.

All subsequent refinements were performed using Refmac5, with 5% of the reflections being randomly excluded from the refinement, and used to monitor Rfree. A maximum likelihood target was used in the refinement protocol, with TLS parameters being used to describe each domain. Following rigid body refinement, the model was subjected to restrained refinement and then rebuilt. Model rebuilding was performed in XtalView (37McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). To minimize bias, residues 78–82 of each monomer were built into omit Fo – Fc density (Fig. 2). Val259 from the original model was modified to an aspartate to correct an error in the original published sequence (1Taguchi H. Ohta T. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab NADH Binding to d-LDHs—The dissociation constants (KD) of N97D d-LDH and NADH were determined essentially according to a previous report (38Tokuda C. Ishikura Y. Shigematsu M.

The binding of NADH to the d-LDHs was followed as the change in NADH fluorescence intensity (ΔF) essentially according to the method used for l-LDHs (39Stinson R.A. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively, using a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorophotometer. ΔF was determined by comparing the fluorescence intensities of NADH in the presence and absence of the enzymes (15 μm) at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium MES buffer (pH 6.0). The KD values for the enzymes with NADH were calculated according to the procedure for l-LDHs (38Tokuda C. Ishikura Y. Shigematsu M. Mutoh H. Tsuzuki S. Nakahira Y. Tamura Y. Shinoda T. Taguchi H. J.

Effects of Asn97 Replacement on the Conformation of L. pentosus d-LDH—L. pentosusd-LDH is a homodimeric protein, with each monomer comprising two domains, a catalytic domain (amino acid positions 1–100 and 300–332) and a coenzyme binding domain (positions 101–299) (13Stoll V.S. Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Asn97 is located on the β5-αA loop (positions 97–102), which joins the two domains, and Val78 and Gly79 are located on the β4-α4 loop (residues 76–84, called the active site loop in this paper), within the catalytic cleft of the enzyme. The hydrogen bond between Asn97 and Val78 and the conformation of the active site loop are highly conserved in known d-LDH-related d-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenases (Fig. 2B). In the Lactobacillus caseid-HicDH structure, probably the closest approximation of a true ternary complex determined among these dehydrogenases to date (14Dengler U. Niefind K. Kiess M. Schomburg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 640-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), Val78 and Gly79 (Val77 and Gly78 in this enzyme, respectively) form hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of 2-ketoacid substrate (Fig. 2C). The statistics for the N97D protein structure solution and refinement are shown in Table II. The backbone structure of the N97D enzyme exhibited good agreement in general with that of the wild-type enzyme, but the catalytic domains of the enzyme were slightly moved around the hinges as compared with those of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2A). This difference is probably attributable to the differing conditions under which data were collected (at room temperature in the original mother liquor for the wild-type versus at 100 K in 25% glycerol for the N97D enzyme) rather than the point mutation per se. Fig. 2D shows the differences in the dihedral peptide angles (Δϕ and Δψ) of the wild-type and N97D enzymes for both monomers, indicating minor and asymmetric conformational changes for the N97D enzyme in the crystal. It is notable that the positions 54, 55, 78–81, 101, and 102, which are either located on or in contact with the active site loop, exhibit particularly large Δϕ and Δψ values. Despite the lack of the hydrogen bond between Asp97 and Val78, the β4-α4 and β5-αA loops of the N97D enzyme were clearly visible in the 2Fo – Fc electron density maps (Fig. 3, A and B). The side chain of Tyr101 in subunit A, which was markedly disordered, displays asymmetric conformations between the two subunits. It is notable that the active site loops of the two N97D monomers differ greatly in their conformations not only from what was seen in the wild-type protein structure but also from each other, particularly in the middle part of the loop (positions 78–82), whereas the dihedral peptide angles for its two subunits of the wild-type enzyme dimer are virtually identical (Fig. 3C). These observations indicate that the Asn97 to Asp replacement destabilizes interactions mediated by the active site loop to the point where there is no longer a well defined, uniquely preferred conformation. It is likely that intermolecular crystal packing interactions help stabilize the two active site loops of the N97D enzyme dimer in the different conformations in the crystal. In the case of subunit A, there are particularly marked Δϕ and Δψ values at the peptide bond between Val78 and Gly79 (Fig. 2D), and consequently the wild-type and N97D proteins differ greatly in the orientations of the Val78 and Gly79 main chains (Fig. 3C). The hydrogen bond between Val78 and Tyr101 is missing, and the side chain of Tyr101 is disordered in the electron density map in the N97D enzyme (Fig. 3A). This conformation of the active site loop in the N97D enzyme appears to be dependent on the flexible nature of Gly79, which can employ its dihedral angles (ϕ = 124°, ψ = 135°) without steric hindrance. In the case of subunit B, on the other hand, there are marked Δϕ and Δψ values at the peptide bond between Val80 and Asp81, instead of Val78 and Gly79, and the N97D enzyme preserves the hydrogen bond between the Val78 main chain and the Tyr101 side chain, which is clearly visible in the electron density map (Fig. 3B). The structures of Lactobacillus bulgaricus d-LDH (40Razeto A. Kochhar S. Hottinger H. Dauter M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and L. casei d-HicDH (14Dengler U. Niefind K. Kiess M. Schomburg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 640-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have been determined as a binary complex (with NADH) and an abortive ternary complex (with NAD+ and 2-ketoisocaproate), respectively. In the binary complex structure of the L. bulgaricus enzyme, it is notable that the hydroxyl group of Tyr101 (Tyr102 in this enzyme) is shifted from the Val78 (Val79) main chain amide to the nicotinamide ring of NADH. Furthermore, in the ternary complex of L. casei d-HicDH (Fig. 2C), Val78 (Val77 in this enzyme) actually forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate carboxyl group, whereas Gly79 (Gly78) does so with the precipitant sulfate ion. In monomer B of the N97D enzyme, Tyr101 appears to fix the Val78 main chain in a similar orientation of that the wild-type enzyme through the hydrogen bond (Fig. 3). The reorientation of Tyr101 upon ligand binding would result in a loss of the hydrogen bond to the Val78 amide, so substrate binding potentially precipitates changes in the conformation of the active site loop. The two subunits of the N97D enzyme also differ both from each other and the wild-type protein in the hydrogen bond network mediated by the active site loop. In the wild-type enzyme, the side chain of Asn82 forms hydrogen bonds with the amide and carbonyl groups of the Asp81 and Lys55 main chains, respectively. In contrast, these two hydrogen bonds are consistently missing in both the two subunits of the N97D enzyme in which the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn82 instead forms a hydrogen bond with the Tyr57 main chain amide. These changes may affect the backbone conformation at positions 54 and 55, which also exhibited significant Δϕ and Δψ values (Fig. 2D). In the case of the N97D enzyme, the carbonyl oxygen of Val80 in addition forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amides of Leu83 and Asn82 in subunits A and B, respectively, whereas these hydrogen bonds are missing in the wild-type enzyme. These new hydrogen bond networks appear to stabilize the two active site loops of the N97D enzyme dimer in their own conformations in the crystal. The Asn97 → Asp mutation appears to result in disruption of the structure of the active site loop conformation that is an otherwise conserved feature of all known d-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase structures. The elevated temperature factors displayed in this region, as well as the adoption of significantly different conformations between the two monomers, indicate that the loop conformation has become sensitive to small perturbations in its environment, implying significant destabilization of the conformation seen in the wild-type structure. This disruption would be anticipated to perturb the bidentate interaction made by the backbone amides of residues Gly79 and Val80 in the ternary complex, leading to adverse effects on catalysis. However, as the network of additional interactions afforded by the ternary complex will likely affect the conformation of this loop, it is difficult to predict on the basis of the structure alone exactly what the effects on the kinetics will be. Effects of Asn97 to Asp Replacement on the NADH Binding of L. pentosus d-LDH—The Asn97 to Asp replacement potentially affects the NADH binding by d-LDH, as it perturbs Val78, which in the L. caseid-HicDH ternary complex is in van der Waals contact with the nicotinamide moiety of NADH, but also because it appears to weaken the hydrogen bond between Val78 and Tyr101, an interaction that competes with the alternative hydrogen bond between Tyr101 and NADH formed in the ternary complex. As in the case of the wild-type enzyme (38Tokuda C. Ishikura Y. Shigematsu M. Mutoh H. Tsuz"
https://openalex.org/W2022013480,"Reactivation of telomerase is a feature in many cancer cells. Telomerase activation inhibits telomere shortening, thereby preventing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis activated by shortened telomeres or chromosomal rearrangements. The tumor-suppressor gene product, p53, was previously shown to transcriptionally suppress the activation of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT). Here we have evaluated the role of p73 in hTERT regulation. We found that ectoptic expression of p73β, in contrast to p73α or p53, in p53 null H1299 cells does not lead to suppression of <i>hTERT</i> transcription. However co-expression of p73α or p73β together with p53 abolished p53-mediated <i>hTERT</i> suppression. This phenomenon was found to be dependent on the DNA binding ability of p73. We also show that p53-mediated suppression of <i>hTERT</i> transcription requires a minimum threshold level of p53, and p73 abrogates p53-mediated suppression by reducing p53 levels through the activation of HDM2. Moreover, p53-mediated <i>hTERT</i> suppression was not relieved by p73β in cells depleted of HDM2 through small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing. In addition, knockdown of HDM2 in MCF7 cells, which express moderately high levels of p73 and p53, resulted in the reduction of endogenous <i>hTERT</i> levels. Finally, knockdown of p73 in MCF7 cells resulted in increased p53 protein levels and a concomitant decrease in <i>hTERT</i> levels. Together, our data indicate a plausible way by which p73, through HDM2, can oppose p53 tumor suppressor function, thereby possibly contributing to tumorigenesis."

It codes for the toxin MazF and the antitoxin MazE, which interferes with the lethal action of the toxin. To better understand the role of various conformations of MazE in bacterial life, its order-disorder transitions were monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, spectropolarimetry, and fluorimetry. The changes in spectral and thermodynamic properties accompanying MazE dimer denaturation can be described in terms of a compensating reversible process of the partial folding of the unstructured C-terminal half (high mean net charge, low mean hydrophobicity) and monomerization coupled with the partial unfolding of the structured N-terminal half (low mean net charge, high mean hydrophobicity). At pH ≤ 4.5 and T < 50 °C, the unstructured polypeptide chains of the MazE dimer fold into (pre)molten globule-like conformations that thermally stabilize the dimeric form of the protein. The simulation based on the thermodynamic and structural information on various addiction modules suggests that both the conformational adaptability of the dimeric antitoxin form (binding to the toxins and DNA) and the reversible transformation to the more flexible monomeric form are essential for the regulation of bacterial cell life and death.

Until recently, such genetic systems for programmed bacterial cell death have been found mainly in Escherichia coli on low copy number plasmids. When bacteria lose the plasmid(s) (or other extrachromosomal elements), the cured cells are selectively killed because the unstable antitoxin is degraded faster than the more stable toxin (4Yarmolinsky M.B. Science. 1995; 267: 836-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 5Jensen R.B. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Couturier M. Bahassi E.M.

Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The cellular target of the toxin is known only in the ccdAB and kid-kis systems. In ccdAB, CcdB on plasmid F attacks the A subunit of gyrase, whereas in the kid-kis system, Kid on plasmid R1 targets DnaB (20Bernard P. Coutrier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Miki T. Park J.A. Nagao K. Murayama N. Horiuchi T. J. Mol.

Science. 1995; 267: 836-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Toxin-antitoxin systems, some of which are homologous to these extrachromosomal addiction modules, have been found on the chromosomes of several bacteria. For example, in E. coli, there are several such pairs of genes, including mazEF (23Metzger S. Ben-Dror I. Aizenman E. Schreiber G. Toone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15699-15704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Masuda J. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J.

The first toxin-antitoxin system contained in a bacterial chromosome that was described as regulatable and responsible for programmed cell death was the E. coli mazEF module (25Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), located in the relA operon (23Metzger S. Ben-Dror I. Aizenman E. Schreiber G. Toone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15699-15704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of mazF (MazF) is a stable toxin, and the product of mazE (MazE) is a labile protein, degraded by the protease ClpAP (25Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Therefore, preventing MazF-mediated death requires a continuous cellular production of MazE. In contrast to the addiction modules that are triggered by the loss of the element, death mediated by chromosomal mazEF is achieved by several stressful conditions that prevent mazEF expression. Initially, the mazEF module was found to be under the control of ppGpp (25Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), the amino acid starvation signal molecule produced by the RelA protein (33Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernadez V.S. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. II I Ingram J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B.M. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Raily M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coliSalmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Overproduction of ppGpp leads to inhibition of the expression of mazEF and thereby to cell death (25Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 34Engelberg-Kulka H. Reches M. Narasimhan S. Schoulaker-Schwarz R. Klemes Y. Aizenman E. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15481-15486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, as reported recently, inhibiting the expression of mazEF and thus inducing cell death can be also achieved by several additional stressful conditions. These include the inhibition of transcription and/or translation (35Sat B. Hazan R. Fisher T. Khaner H. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 36Engelberg-Kulka H. Sat B. Hazan R. ASM News. 2001; 67: 617-624Google Scholar, 37Hazan R. Sat B. Reches M.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3663-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the last few years, the chromosomal mazEF toxin-antitoxin systems have attracted additional attention, in particular in the following four directions. (a) The first is studies on the mechanism of MazF action. MazF has been shown to inhibit translation by cleaving mRNAs at specific sites (40Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hensen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 41Zhang Y.L. Zhang J.J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G.L. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, two laboratories have reported contradictory results for the mechanism of cleavage. According to one group, MazF inhibits translation by a ribosome-dependent mechanism (40Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hensen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and according to a second group, MazF is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNAs at ACA sequences in a codon- and ribosome-independent manner (41Zhang Y.L. Zhang J.J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G.L. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This second version was further confirmed by a more recent report from the same laboratory showing that, at least in vitro, MazF functions enzymatically in a similar manner to RNase A, although with different sequence specificity (42Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). (b) The second direction is studies on the mazEF-mediated cell death network. There is a “point of no return” in MazF-mediated cell death; overexpression of MazE can only reverse MazF lethality over a short window of time (43Amitai S. Yassin Y. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8295-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that MazF is a mediator rather than an executioner of cell lethality (44Engelberg-Kulka H. Sat B. Reches M. Amitai S. Hazan R. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 66-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). (c) The third direction is studies on the function of mazEF showing that it can prevent spreading of phage infection (45Hazan R. Engelberg-Kulka H. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). (d) The fourth is molecular studies characterizing the forces that drive the unfolding (folding) of proteins (MazE, MazF) and the interactions that drive MazE-MazF, MazE-DNA, and MazE-MazF-DNA complex formation. The first step toward this goal was achieved by crystallization of the antitoxin MazE and by determination of part of its three-dimensional structure (46Loris R. Marianovsky I. Lah J. Laermans T. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The resulting structure is the first of any addiction antitoxin, the crystallization of which has been hampered because of its susceptibility to proteases and its high content of unstructured polypeptide. We circumvented this problem by crystallizing MazE in complex with the specific dromedary antibody fragment VHH. Furthermore, the energetics of MazE interactions with VHH was investigated in detail. It has been suggested that, under physiological conditions in solution, a significant part of the MazE polypeptide chain may be unstructured, as in the crystal of the MazE-VHH complex (47Lah J. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. Kinne J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14101-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Almost simultaneously, Kamada et al. (48Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) determined the crystal structure of the MazE-MazF complex, in which MazE chains appear to be less unstructured than in the complex with VHH. It is known that proteins that lack intrinsic globular structure (intrinsically flexible, intrinsically unstructured, natively unfolded, pliable) are frequently involved in some of the most important regulatory functions in the cell (30Cherny I. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8252-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 49Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol.

Numerous examples of domains that are unstructured in solution but become structured upon binding to the target have been identified. Thus, the intrinsic lack of structure can offer functional advantages to a protein, including its ability to bind several different targets (30Cherny I. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8252-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 49Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated to what extent MazE belongs to this category of proteins by studying its conformational changes induced by variation in temperature, pH, protein concentration, and urea concentration. The energetics of MazE order-disorder transitions was studied by various techniques (differential scanning calorimetry, spectropolarimetry, and fluorometry) and is discussed in terms of its three-dimensional structures (46Loris R. Marianovsky I. Lah J. Laermans T. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 48Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). An attempt was made to predict some functional features of the addiction modules from the equilibrium thermodynamic model, which involves antitoxin and toxin molecules and DNA. To the best of our knowledge, the research described here represents for the first time a complete thermodynamic study of structural transitions of a protein with an intrinsically flexible nature. The expression and purification of MazE have been described previously (46Loris R. Marianovsky I. Lah J. Laermans T. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MazE solutions for calorimetric and spectroscopic measurements were prepared by diluting the stock solution of MazE in water to the appropriate concentrations in the appropriate buffer solutions. Depending on the pH, the buffer solutions used in our experiments were as follows: 50 mm HCl (pH 1.5), 50 mm citrate (pH 3.1), 50 mm acetate (pH 4.5), 50 mm cacodylate (pH 6.1), 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.1), 50 mm HEPPS 1The abbreviations used are: HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt. (pH 8.1), and 20 mm borate (pH 9.4). Unless stated otherwise, all buffer solutions contained 150 mm NaCl. For urea denaturation, 21 solutions with the same MazE concentration and varying urea concentrations (0–8 m) were prepared from stock 10 m urea and stock MazE solutions in the same buffer. The pH of all solutions was checked and adjusted to the appropriate value by NaOH or HCl. Before each experiment (except those involving urea), the protein buffer solution was extensively dialyzed against the corresponding buffer solution and degassed for 15 min. The concentrations of the 98-residue-long His tagfused MazE protein (molecular mass of 11211.5 g mol–1) were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The corresponding extinction coefficient of MazE in 6 m guanidinium chloride and 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) was obtained from the amino acid composition by the method introduced by Gill and von Hippel (58Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) (available at www.expasy.ch). Finally, an extinction coefficient of 1.27 ± 0.05 mg–1 ml cm–1 was calculated by combination of the measured absorbance of the guanidinium chloride-free MazE solution of the same concentration at the same wavelength (280 nm) as the one measured in guanidinium chloride. The thermally induced transitions of MazE were measured between pH 1.5 and 9.4 using a Nano-II DSC differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.). The heating rate was 1 °C/min–1, and the concentration of proteins in the measuring cell was ∼1.2 mg ml–1. To obtain the presented thermograms ((Cp – Cp,N) versus temperature curves) (see Fig. 2), the heat capacity of the protein in the initial (native) state was subtracted from the raw signal corrected for buffer contribution. The transition enthalpies (ΔHcal) were obtained by integration of the (Cp – Cp,N) versus temperature curves. CD spectra were recorded using a Model 62A DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) equipped with a programmable thermoelectrically controlled cell holder. The presented mean residue ellipticities ([θ], degrees cm2 dmol–1) were obtained from raw data (ellipticities) by subtracting the corresponding spectra of the buffer solution and taking into account the mass concentration (c), molecular mass (Mw), number of MazE amino acid residues (N), and optical path length (l) through the relation [θ] = θ·Mw/(N·c·l). Thermal Denaturation—Changes in MazE secondary (far-UV, 205–255 nm; 1-mm cuvette) and tertiary (near-UV, 255–310 nm; 1-cm cuvette) structure were followed by recording CD spectra at a MazE concentration of 0.5 mg ml–1 (see Fig. 3, a and b) at different temperatures with a temperature step of 3 °C. At a lower concentration (0.05 mg ml–1), temperature scans in the far-UV region were performed also at λ = 230 nm in a 1-cm cuvette. Urea Denaturation—The changes in MazE secondary structure upon increasing urea concentrations (0–8 m) were followed by measuring the ellipticity at 225 nm in a 1-cm cuvette at a MazE concentration of 0.05 mg ml–1 (see Fig. 5, b and c). The measurements were performed at a number of different temperatures. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 luminescence spectrometer equipped with a thermally controlled cell holder and a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Thermal denaturation of MazE was followed by the emission fluorescence of the external fluorescent probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt (ANS; Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). The emission spectra (415–615 nm) were recorded at different temperatures the range 8–90 °C using λex = 400 nm (see Fig. 4). The concentrations of MazE and ANS in the buffer solutions were 0.05 and 0.126 mg ml–1, respectively. Urea-induced denaturation of MazE was followed by measuring the changes in MazE intrinsic (Trp) emission fluorescence between 310 and 410 nm (λex = 280 nm) at urea concentrations of 0–8 m. The concentration of MazE was 0.05 mg ml–1 (see Fig. 5b), and the measurements were performed at a number of different temperatures. Our results reveal that the majority of the monitored structural transitions can be adequately described in terms of a reversible two-state process in which the protein molecule can exist either in macro state N or in macro state D. Such process can be presented as shown in Equation 1, (1/n)Nn↔KD,ΔG0=−RTlnK=(RT/n)ln(nαnCn−1/(1−α))(Eq. 1) where Nn represents the MazE dimer (n = 2) in the initial (native) state, whereas D corresponds to MazE in the final monomeric (denatured) state; K is the equilibrium constant of denaturation; ΔG0 is the corresponding standard Gibbs free energy change per mol of monomer; n is the number of subunits to which each protein dissociates upon denaturation; α is the fraction of protein in the denatured state; and CT is the total protein concentration given in moles of monomer liter–1. It should be noted that, under some specific conditions, two successive transitions that do not overlap significantly were observed (see “Results”). In such cases, the two transitions can be treated separately: the first one that corresponds to the transition of the native dimer N2 into the intermediate dimer I2 (1/2N2 ↔ 1/2I2) is a special case of Equation 1 with n = 1, and the second one that describes the transition of the intermediate dimer I2 into the denatured monomer D (1/2I2 ↔ D) is a common example of Equation 2 with n = 2. The thermodynamic parameters of denaturation obtained for the two successive transitions are practically the same as those obtained from the model that takes into account all three states simultaneously (1/2N2 ↔ 1/2I2 ↔ D) (see the supplemental material). ΔG0 can always be expressed by the integrated Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (Equation 2), ΔG0=T(ΔG0(T1/2)/T1/2+ΔH0(T1/2)(1/T−1/T1/2)+ΔCp0(1−T1/2/T−ln(T/T1/2))) (Eq. 2) where ΔH0(T½) is the standard enthalpy of denaturation at the reference temperature T½ (transition temperature at α = 0.5) and ΔCp0 is the corresponding standard heat capacity change assumed to be independent of temperature. According to the model (Equation 1), one can express an average of a physical property, F (in our case, F is the partial molar enthalpy of the protein, the mean residue ellipticity ([θ]), or the fluorescence intensity (FL)), in terms of the corresponding contributions FN and FD, which characterize states N and D (47Lah J.

Zegers I. Wyns L. Messens J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24673-24679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively (Equation 3). F=(1−α)FN+αFD=FN+α(FD−FN) (Eq. 3) In the case of transitions followed by spectroscopic methods (CD and fluorescence), FN and FD are assumed to be linear functions of temperature (thermal denaturation) or urea concentration (urea denaturation). The model function (Cp – Cp,N) for the DSC signal is the partial molar heat capacity of the protein relative to state N. It can be derived from the first partial derivative of Equation 3 on temperature at constant pressure (60Freire E. Biltonen R.L. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 463-479Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 61Privalov P.L. Pothekin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 62Freire E.

Cp−Cp,N=αΔCp0+(nα(1−α)/(n−α(n−1)))·((ΔH0(T1/2)+ΔCp0(T−T1/2))2/RT2) (Eq. 4) Taking into account Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, the observed temperature profiles (melting curves) can be described in terms of the parameters ΔH0(T½), ΔCp0, and T½. Their values were obtained from fitting the model function (CD = Equation 3 and DSC = Equation 4) to the experimental temperature profiles using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear χ2 regression procedure (63Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Oxford1992: 650-694Google Scholar). In the case of urea-induced denaturation at a given temperature, the denaturation profiles were described by Equations 1 and 3 combined with the well known empirical relation ΔG0 = ΔGo0 – m[urea], where ΔGo0 is the standard Gibbs free energy in the absence of urea and m is the proportionality coefficient. At each temperature, the parameters ΔGo0 and m were adjusted according to the χ2 regression procedure mentioned above.

https://openalex.org/W2112605361,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces both cell death and survival signals. NF-κB, a transcription factor activated by TNF, is critical for controlling survival signals through trans-activation of downstream target genes. However, few NF-κB target survival genes have been identified with direct roles in oncogenesis. We report that platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), an oncogene and growth factor, is highly induced by TNF in fibroblasts in an NF-κB-dependent manner. PDGF-B can rescue NF-κB-deficient fibroblasts from TNF-mediated killing, and inhibition of PDGF-B signaling sensitizes wild-type cells to TNF-induced death. Interestingly, PDGF-B-transformed NIH-3T3 cells are even more highly sensitized to TNF-induced cell death with PDGF-B inhibition. Our results suggest that while normal cells contain multiple TNF-induced survival signals, tumor cells may favor a specific survival gene that is abnormally upregulated in order to evade death signals."
https://openalex.org/W2027622283,"Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage is important for the maintenance of genomic integrity in higher eukaryotes. We have previously reported the novel p53-dependent S-phase checkpoint operating in mouse zygotes fertilized with irradiated sperm. In the present study, we analysed the detail of the p53 function required for this S-phase checkpoint in mouse zygotes. The results indicate that ATM kinase is likely to be indispensable for the p53-dependent S-phase checkpoint since the suppression was abrogated by inhibitors such as caffeine and wortmannin. However, ATM phosphorylation site mutant proteins were still capable of suppressing DNA synthesis when microinjected into sperm-irradiated zygotes lacking the functional p53, suggesting that the target of the phosphorylation is not p53. In addition, the suppression was not affected by alpha-amanitin, and p53 protein mutated at the transcriptional activation domain was also functional in the suppression of DNA synthesis. However, p53 proteins mutated at the DNA-binding domain were devoid of the suppressing activity. Taken together, the transcription-independent function of p53 associated with the DNA-binding domain is involved in the S-phase checkpoint in collaboration with yet another unidentified target protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2124046311,"The dioxin/aryl hydrocarbon receptor functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor regulating transcription of a battery of genes encoding primarily drug-metabolizing enzymes. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (CA-AhR) in transgenic mice results in development of stomach tumours, correlating with increased mortality. We have used suppression subtractive hybridization techniques followed by macroarray analysis to elucidate which genes are differentially expressed during this process. In the glandular stomach of CA-AhR mice, we observed decreased mRNA expression of osteopontin (OPN), a noncollagenous protein of bone matrix that is also involved in several important functions including regulation of cytokine production, macrophage accumulation, cell motility and adhesion. Downregulated expression of OPN during tumour development was confirmed by RT–PCR and RNA blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that this decrease was confined to the corpus region, correlating with the restricted localization of the tumours. Decreased OPN mRNA expression was also observed in other organs of CA-AhR mice. Taken together, these results show that OPN is negatively regulated by the dioxin receptor, and that downregulation of its expression correlates with development of stomach tumours in mice expressing a constitutively active mutant of dioxin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2145631417,"The gene encoding the human BRCA2 tumour suppressor is mutated in a number of different tumour types, most notably inherited breast cancers. The primary role of BRCA2 is thought to lie in the maintenance of genomic stability via its role in the homologous recombination pathway. We generated mice in which Brca2 was deleted from virtually all cells within the adult small intestine, using a CYP1A1-driven Cre-Lox approach. We noted a significant p53-dependent increase in the levels of spontaneous apoptosis which persisted for several months after removal of the gene and ultimately we observed the spontaneous deletion of Brca2-deficient stem cells. Brca2 deficiency did not lead to gross changes in intestinal physiology but did enhance sensitivity to a variety of DNA crosslinking agents. Taken together, our results indicate that Brca2 plays an important role in the response to DNA damage in the small intestine. Furthermore, we show that Brca2 deficiency results in the spontaneous deletion of stem cells, thereby protecting the small intestine against tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2072830471,"Ca2+-ATPase belongs to the family of P-type ATPases and maintains low concentrations of intracellular Ca2+. Its reaction cycle consists of four main intermediates that alternate ion binding in the transmembrane domain with phosphorylation of an aspartate residue in a cytoplasmic domain. Previous work characterized an ultrastable phosphoenzyme produced first by labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate, then by allowing this labeled enzyme to establish a maximal Ca2+ gradient, and finally by removing Ca2+ from the solution. This phosphoenzyme is characterized by very low fluorescence and has specific enzymatic properties suggesting the existence of a high energy phosphoryl bond. To study the structural properties of this phosphoenzyme, we used cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals formed in the presence of decavanadate and determined the structure at 8-Å resolution. To our surprise we found that at this resolution the low fluorescence phosphoenzyme had a structure similar to that of the native enzyme crystallized under equivalent conditions. We went on to use glutaraldehyde cross-linking and proteolysis for independent structural assessment and concluded that, like the unphosphorylated native enzyme, Ca2+ and vanadate exert a strong influence over the global structure of this low fluorescence phosphoenzyme. Based on a structural model with fluorescein isothiocyanate bound at the ATP site, we suggest that the stability as well as the low fluorescence of this phosphoenzyme is due to a fluorescein-mediated cross-link between two cytoplasmic domains that prevents hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphate. Finally, we consider the alternative possibility that phosphate transfer to fluorescein itself could explain the properties of this low fluorescence species.

Finally, we consider the alternative possibility that phosphate transfer to fluorescein itself could explain the properties of this low fluorescence species. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are maintained at low levels by a group of ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps that belong to the family of P-type ATPases (1Fagan M.J. Saier M.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 57-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These pumps maintain low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations as a baseline for signal transduction pathways initiated by opening a variety of Ca2+ channels. There are distinct groups of Ca2+ pumps, or Ca2+-ATPases, in the plasma membrane and in membranes of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum. The particular isoform from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; EM, electron microscopy; TG, thapsigargin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; AcP, acetyl phosphate; PK, proteinase K; EPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; EM, electron microscopy; TG, thapsigargin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; AcP, acetyl phosphate; PK, proteinase K; EPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; of skeletal muscle is the most extensively studied and represents an archetype for the entire family. Biochemical studies have defined a series of reaction intermediates that couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis within the cytoplasmic domain to alternations in the affinity and accessibility of Ca2+ binding sites within the membrane domain (3Mintz E. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 52-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the key step of the reaction cycle, this energy is stored by the pump as an aspartyl phosphate and is used to drive a global conformational change that simultaneously lowers the affinity of the Ca2+ sites and exposes them to the luminal side of the membrane, where the Ca2+ ions are exchanged with protons. In fact, the reaction cycle appears to be driven by a series of such conformational changes, which have been deduced by biochemical and spectroscopic means and, in some cases, directly visualized by electron microscopy (EM) and x-ray crystallography (4Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 445-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In its simplest form, this reaction cycle consists of four intermediates that alternate steps of ion binding/release with those of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of an aspartate residue. This aspartate resides at the heart of the catalytic site, and its phosphorylation by ATP is a critical step in transducing chemical energy into conformational energy for Ca2+ transport. As outlined in Scheme 1, binding of cytoplasmic Ca2+ is followed by formation of a “high energy” phosphoenzyme, commonly denoted either E∼P[Ca2] or E1∼P[Ca2], in which two Ca2+ ions become “occluded” within the transmembrane domain, as denoted by brackets: [Ca2]. A global conformational change to a low energy phosphoenzyme (E-P or E2-P) exposes the Ca2+ sites to the luminal side of the membrane and lowers their affinity to the millimolar range; after Ca2+ release and proton binding, the phosphoenzyme is hydrolyzed to complete the cycle. E1 and E2 are frequently used to distinguish two hypothetical conformational states of the enzyme. E1 exists in the first half of the cycle with high affinity Ca2+ sites either cytoplasmically oriented or occluded and the catalytic aspartate reactive toward nucleotides. E2 exists in the second half of the cycle with the aspartate reactive toward inorganic phosphate and low affinity Ca2+ sites either exposed to the lumen or occluded with bound protons. Although the E1/E2 dichotomy has been shown by Jencks and others to be an oversimplification (6Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18855-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it offers a framework for discussing the observed structural changes of the enzyme. E1+2Cacyt→E1(Ca2)+ATP→E1~P[Ca2]+ADP→E2-P(Ca2)→E2-P+2Calum→E2+PiSCHEME 1(Eq. 1) In recent years, the structures of four main intermediates have been defined by x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (4Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 445-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 7Kuhlbrandt W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These structures have taught us a great deal about the conformational changes that drive the reaction cycle and about how binding of particular substrates dictates the domain interactions responsible for these conformational changes. Specifically, binding of Ca2+ to transport sites induces substantial changes to the backbone of several transmembrane helices; these changes are relayed by M4 and M5 to the cytoplasmic domain containing the catalytic aspartate (P-domain), causing its inclination and thus altering its association with the other cytoplasmic domains (denoted N- and A-domains). As a result, the aspartate is accessible to ATP bound in the N-domain, and phosphate transfer produces a chemical bridge between these two domains that indirectly induces Ca2+ occlusion. Loss of ADP disrupts this bridge and allows conserved residues on the A-domain to interact with the covalently bound phosphate group in the P-domain, thus indirectly disrupting the Ca2+ sites and opening the luminal gate for Ca2+ release. These same residues also orient a water molecule for hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphate, which loosens the interaction between cytoplasmic domains and leads to proton occlusion at the transport site. Despite these tremendous insights into the mechanisms of energy coupling, questions remain about the transitions between these intermediates and about the precise physiological context of each individual structure. In particular, the crystals used for structure determination generally require surrogate substrates to lock Ca2+-ATPase into a defined conformation, and crystal contacts have the potential to influence the juxta-position of loosely bound domains. For instance, although crystallization of the Ca2+-bound state (E1(Ca2)) simply requires high concentrations of Ca2+ (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), the crystal contacts are likely to be responsible in part for the wide spread between the N-domain and the A-domain observed in the corresponding structure. Also, the Ca2+-free state (E2) was stabilized with thapsigargin (TG) (9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), which is documented to have significant effects on binding of physiological ligands like ATP (10DeJesus F. Girardet J.L. Dupont Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and phospholamban (11Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the high energy phosphoenzyme (E1∼P) was trapped with the transition state analogue AlF4− in the presence of ADP (12Sorensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), thus representing an analog of the phosphoenzyme prior to nucleotide release (E1∼P[Ca2]·ADP). Finally, an analog of the low energy phosphoenzyme (E2∼P) was crystallized with the MgF42− or the AlF4− ligand bound to the catalytic aspartate, again including TG (13Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 14Olesen C. Sorensen T.L. Nielsen R.C. Moller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which may again be expected to exert a non-physiological influence over the conformation. Similarly, lower resolution studies of the low energy phosphoenzyme employed decavanadate as a crystallization agent, which bound at the interface of the three cytoplasmic domains (15Xu C. Rice W.J. He W. Stokes D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An alternative procedure has been described for stabilizing a phosphoenzyme derived from the high energy intermediate, and structural characterization of this phosphoenzyme therefore holds the potential to shed light on the occlusion of calcium and on other conformational changes of the phosphoenzyme (16Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Formation of this stabilized phosphoenzyme requires covalent labeling of Ca2+-ATPase with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), which has long been known to be specific for Lys515 within the ATP binding site. Indeed, fluorescent changes of FITC have often been used to monitor conformational changes during the reaction cycle (17Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although FITC labeling prevents phosphorylation by ATP, acetyl phosphate (AcP) can be used to pump Ca2+ and to produce high levels of the phosphoenzyme once the membrane-bound enzyme becomes inhibited by high luminal Ca2+ concentration. Upon sudden chelation of Ca2+ from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, the FITC-labeled Ca2+-ATPase can then be markedly stabilized in a low fluorescence, phosphorylated form. Characterization of the resulting species showed that, although it lacked bound Ca2+ ions, it could rapidly re-bind cytoplasmic Ca2+ with high affinity and transport this Ca2+ directly across the membrane. This FITC-labeled, low fluorescence species can thus be safely assumed to derive from E1∼P[Ca2], or rather from the transient species formed immediately prior to Ca2+ occlusion (E1∼P(Ca2)). The ability of decavanadate to produce two-dimensional crystals within these vesicles (18Henao F. Delavoie F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24284-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) offers an opportunity to study the structural properties of this phosphoenzyme and to relate it to the other structures mentioned above. For the current study, we optimized conditions for generating long, tubular crystals of the FITC-labeled, low fluorescence phosphoenzyme, which included addition of TG and decavanadate (19Delavoie F. McIntosh D. Henao F. Peranzi G. Champeil P. Stokes D. Lacapere J.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 20Delavoie F. Peranzi G. Maccario J. Lacapere J.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 363-366Crossref Google Scholar), and solved its structure at 8-Å resolution by cryoelectron microscopy and helical image analysis. Unexpectedly, the resulting structure appeared to be very similar at this resolution to that previously determined for the unlabeled, unphosphorylated enzyme under analogous conditions. We then used proteolytic cleavage and glutaraldehyde cross-linking to bring other approaches to bear on the structural analysis and to study the influence of the crystallizing conditions (namely decavanadate) on the conformation adopted by this phosphoenzyme. In the absence of decavanadate, we obtained conflicting results from proteolytic cleavage with trypsin and proteinase K (PK), suggestive of a hybrid conformation, whereas in the presence of decavanadate the results were consistent with an E2-like conformation, as borne out by our cryoelectron microscopic structure. We conclude that, like in the unphosphorylated native enzyme, Ca2+ and vanadate exert a strong influence over the global structure of the low fluorescence phosphoenzyme. Also, although FITC is likely to mediate a cross-link between N- and P-domains that serves to protect the aspartyl phosphate, this cross-link is different than that formed by ATP during phosphate transfer. Finally, we consider the alternative possibility that FITC itself could have become phosphorylated. SR was prepared from the white muscle of rabbit as described by Inesi and Eletr (21Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) or by Champeil et al. (22Champeil P. Guillain F. Venien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For most labeling experiments, the preparation was diluted to 2 mg/ml protein in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Tricine, pH 8, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm CaCl2, and 16 μm FITC, and incubated at 20 °C. The loss in ATPase activity, measured using a coupled enzyme assay (23Warren G.B. Toon P.A. Birdsall N.J.M. Lee A.G. Metcalfe J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), was used to follow the time course of labeling, which was generally complete after 15 min. The stabilized, high energy phosphoenzyme was generated as previously described (18Henao F. Delavoie F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24284-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 0.1–0.5 mg/ml SR, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm MOPS at pH 7 and 20 °C. During this process, FITC fluorescence was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 517 nm, respectively. 32P incorporation into Ca2+-ATPase after reaction with [32P]-acetylphosphate (synthesized according to Bodley et al. (24Bodley A.L. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13997-14004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was determined by acid precipitation and filtration on Whatman filters followed by washing with cold buffer and scintillation counting. Alternatively, for monitoring the long term stability of this phosphoenzyme, samples were applied to a PD10 column pre-equilibrated with cold buffer to remove excess of radioactivity; collected fractions were centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman rotor TLA 100.3, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in crystallization buffer prior to incubation for various periods and determination of the residual phosphorylation by filtration and scintillation counting. Tryptic cleavage was carried out at 0.75 or 2 mg/ml SR and at a trypsin:SR weight ratio of 1:50 and was stopped by acid precipitation using 4% perchloric acid. Samples were then loaded onto 12% Laemmli gels for SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteinase K cleavage was carried out at 2 mg/ml SR and with a PK/SR weight ratio of 1:67. SDS-PAGE after proteolysis arrest was performed as previously described (25Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments, SR vesicles (4 mg/ml) were labeled with FITC in 50 mm EPPS/tetramethylammonium hydroxide, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 8 nmol/mg FITC for 20 min at room temperature. The suspension was then adjusted to pH 7.5 with a small aliquot of concentrated maleic acid and placed on ice. Formation of the low fluorescence species was performed at room temperature in 50 mm MOPS/tetramethylammonium hydroxide, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm AcP, and 0.4 mg/ml SR protein labeled with FITC; unlabeled vesicles were also incubated as a control. Ca2+ loading was continued for 2 min, followed by addition of 5 mm EGTA to induce the low fluorescence species. Cross-linking was performed with 1 mm glutaraldehyde over 4 min in the same basic medium of 50 mm MOPS/tetramethylammonium hydroxide, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl with various additions as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1/10 dilution of 20% SDS, 5.4 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and a trace of bromphenol blue. The solubilized samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE with 7.5% acrylamide, and the proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. For preparing tubular crystals, FITC-labeled SR vesicles at 0.5 mg/ml protein were treated with 10 mm AcP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 at room temperature, and the phosphoenzyme formed was then stabilized by adding 5 mm EGTA followed by 10 μm TG. The fluorescence signal from FITC was used to monitor the formation of the low fluorescence species. Aliquots of 1 ml were then centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min as above. After removing the supernatant, crystallization buffer (typically 100 μl) containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm decavanadate was gently added to the pellet without resuspension, followed by three cycles of freezing and thawing to induce fusion of individual SR vesicles, thus producing larger tubular crystals (20Delavoie F. Peranzi G. Maccario J. Lacapere J.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 363-366Crossref Google Scholar). Protein concentrations above 10 mg/ml were required for significant fusion, with optimal results coming from the much higher concentration within a gelatinous pellet. Also, sucrose proved to be a strong inhibitor of fusion, and samples were therefore washed thoroughly prior to crystallization. After freeze-thaw, the pellet was resuspended at 1 mg/ml and incubated on ice overnight. For imaging, 5 μl of this sample was pipetted onto a perforated carbon film, blotted with filter paper, and quick frozen with liquid ethane. Low dose images were recorded at a magnification of ×50,000 and defocus of 0.8–1.8 μm with a CM200FEG electron microscope (FEI Corp., Eindhoven, Netherlands), screened by optical diffraction, and digitized at 14-μm intervals with a SCAI densitometer (Intergraph Corp., Madison, AL). After selecting well ordered tubes by optical diffraction, a group with a common helical symmetry (characterized by Bessel orders of -23 and 7 for the 1,0 and 0,1 layer lines, respectively) was selected for further processing. Defocus values were determined directly from the images (26Tani K. Sasabe H. Toyoshima C. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 65: 31-44Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and, after applying 2-fold symmetry averaging, an initial three-dimensional structure was created using standard methods of helical reconstruction. This structure was used as a reference for a suite of programs designed to account for distortions along the tubes (27Beroukhim R. Unwin N. Ultramicroscopy. 1997; 70: 57-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thereafter, a new reference was generated and the distortions were refined by a single iteration of these programs (15Xu C. Rice W.J. He W. Stokes D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Defocus values were used to correct phases and to weight amplitudes along the layer lines. These weighted data were then averaged and fully compensated for defocus effects. The final data set was filtered, by removing data points with phase deviations >65° from those expected for crystallographic 2-fold symmetry and was truncated at 7-Å resolution. This final structure was aligned with that of the unlabeled, unphosphorylated enzyme by selecting a single molecule from the crystal lattice with a Gaussian mask and then using the program suite Spider (28Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Formation and Characterization of the FITC-labeled, Low Fluorescence Phosphoenzyme—Early work revealed the formation under specific conditions of a species of FITC-labeled Ca2+-ATPase with very low fluorescence (29Pick U. Bassilian S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and, more recently, this species was shown by kinetic analysis to derive from the high energy phosphoenzyme after dissociation of the Ca2+ ions toward the cytosol (16Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a typical preparation in which the fluorescence initially falls slowly as phosphoenzyme is formed during active loading of SR vesicles with AcP. Upon addition of EGTA, there is a further, precipitous reduction in fluorescence by ∼60% to a state that is stabilized by TG. Fig. 1B shows that, if TG is added prior to EGTA, this low fluorescence species is not formed; similarly, collapse of the Ca2+ gradient with Ca2+ ionophore (A23187) reverses the initial fluorescence decrease induced by AcP or prevents it from forming if added prior to AcP (not shown). Fig. 1A also shows that the low fluorescence state is maintained after subsequent addition of decavanadate (18Henao F. Delavoie F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24284-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The fact that decavanadate actually binds to this species is documented by the slight decrease in fluorescence caused by decavanadate addition. This decrease is comparable, in relative terms, to that seen when decavanadate is added to the high fluorescence species (not shown, but see Ref. 30Highsmith S. Barker D. Scales D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and is not simply due to absorption of the excitation wavelength by decavanadate. We used [32P]AcP to quantify the amount of covalent phosphoenzyme formed under various conditions. During active loading of SR vesicles with [32P]AcP, phosphoenzyme formation was complete after 4 min, reaching a maximal value of >7 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein (black circles, Fig. 1C). In the presence of Ca2+ ionophore A23187, the maximal level of phosphoenzyme was only 2 nmol/mg of protein (gray triangles), and measurements in the absence of Ca2+ (gray squares) demonstrated the baseline for these measurements. Thus, the presence of a Ca2+ gradient is a prerequisite for maximal phosphorylation of FITC-labeled ATPase by AcP. Furthermore, the levels reached by active loading with AcP are close to stoichiometric with the expected amount of FITC-labeled Ca2+-ATPase, and somewhat higher than those obtained with vesicles preloaded with Ca2+ and phosphorylated from [32P]Pi (16Champeil P.

Fig. 1C also shows that when EGTA was followed by TG, phosphoenzyme levels were completely stable over a 10-min period (open circles), similar to previous results with Ca2+-preloaded vesicles phosphorylated from [32P]Pi (18Henao F. Delavoie F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24284-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when TG was added to the phosphoenzyme prior to EGTA, thus preventing formation of the low fluorescence state (Fig. 1B), the phosphoenzyme decayed with a half-life of 1–2 min (Fig. 1C, open triangles). A similar decay was observed when Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was added after phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, open squares). A comparison of fluorescence levels (Fig. 1, A and B) with phosphoenzyme levels (Fig. 1C) reveals that the intermediate fluorescence species induced by AcP loading, and the low fluorescence species induced by subsequent addition of EGTA, both correspond to maximal levels of phosphoenzyme. Based on the fact that bound Ca2+ could dissociate from it, the intermediate fluorescence species has been hypothesized to correspond to the normally transient enzymatic state occurring immediately prior to occlusion of Ca2+ (E1∼P(Ca2)), perhaps in rapid equilibrium with the generally more stable occluded state (E1∼P[Ca2]). The EGTA-induced decrease in fluorescence reflects the removal of Ca2+ from the former species (16Champeil P. Henao F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5795-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To test the stability of this phosphoenzyme under conditions and time scales suitable for crystallization, we monitored 32P retention by the FITC-labeled Ca2+-ATPase upon incubation for days at 0 °C in a crystallization buffer containing EGTA, TG, and decavanadate. Fig. 1D shows that the level of phosphoenzyme, initially formed by active loading with AcP followed by 5 mm EGTA and 10 μm TG, remained completely stable over a week in the presence of decavanadate (solid circles). The long term stability of this species, however, appeared very sensitive to the residual concentration of free Ca2+, showing slightly lower stability at 0.5 and 1.0 mm EGTA (Fig. 1D, triangles and open circles, respectively) than at 5 mm EGTA. This result is similar to the one previously found for phosphoenzyme formed from Pi, which is also stable in the presence of TG and decavanadate (18Henao F. Delavoie F. Lacapere J.J. McIntosh D.B. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24284-24285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For optimal crystallization, we nevertheless observed that the EGTA concentration had to be lowered from 5 mm (used for producing the phosphoenzyme) to 0.5–1.0 mm. It is not clear why an elevated EGTA concentration inhibited crystallization; possibly, it was some direct effect of the polyanion on the crystallization process. In any case, crystallization appeared to be complete after overnight incubation on ice, at which time the preparations were fast frozen for electron microscopy. As indicated by our studies of phosphoenzyme stability under equivalent conditions, virtually no hydrolysis occurred over this time period (Fig. 1D), implying that essentially all ATPase molecules remained phosphorylated under the conditions of crystallization.

Residues βAsp76 and βAsp32 are located in close proximity to the quinone oxygens of TTQ in the enzyme active site. These residues are structurally conserved in quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase, which possesses a cysteine tryptophylquinone cofactor. Relatively conservative βD76N and βD32N mutations resulted in very low levels of MADH expression. Analysis of the isolated proteins by mass spectrometry revealed that each mutation affected TTQ biogenesis. βD76N MADH possessed the six disulfides but had no oxygen incorporated into βTrp57 and was completely inactive. The βD32N MADH preparation contained a major species with six disulfides but no oxygen incorporated into βTrp57 and a minor species with both oxygens incorporated, which was active. The steady-state kinetic parameters for the βD32N mutant were significantly altered by the mutation and exhibited a 1000-fold increase in the Km value for methylamine. These results have allowed us to more clearly define the sequence of events that lead to TTQ biogenesis and to define novel roles for aspartate residues in the biogenesis of a protein-derived cofactor.

These results have allowed us to more clearly define the sequence of events that lead to TTQ biogenesis and to define novel roles for aspartate residues in the biogenesis of a protein-derived cofactor. Protein-derived cofactors are catalytic and redox-active prosthetic groups that are derived from posttranslational modification of peptide amino acid residues (1Klinman J.P. Dove J.E. Adv.

These include covalently cross-linked amino acid residues, stable free radicals derived from amino acid residues, and quinones derived from tyrosine and tryptophan residues. The protein-derived cofactor tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) 1The abbreviations used are: TTQ, tryptophan tryptophylquinone; MADH, methylamine dehydrogenase; AADH, aromatic amine dehydrogenase; QHNDH, quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase; CTQ, cysteine tryptophylquinone; PES, phenazine ethosulfate; DCIP, 2,6-dichloroindophenol. 1The abbreviations used are: TTQ, tryptophan tryptophylquinone; MADH, methylamine dehydrogenase; AADH, aromatic amine dehydrogenase; QHNDH, quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase; CTQ, cysteine tryptophylquinone; PES, phenazine ethosulfate; DCIP, 2,6-dichloroindophenol. (4McIntire W.S. Wemmer D.E. Chistoserdov A. Lidstrom M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) is the prosthetic group of methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) (Fig. 1) (5Davidson V.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 95-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). MADH is a periplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of methylamine to formaldehyde plus ammonia and the subsequent electron transfer to a type I copper protein, amicyanin (6Husain M. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14626-14629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MADH from Paracoccus denitrificans is composed of four subunits that are arranged in a symmetrical α2β2 structure (7Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A TTQ is located in each β subunit and is formed by posttranslational modifications of βTrp57 and βTrp108. As can be seen from its structure (Fig. 1), TTQ biosynthesis requires insertion of oxygens at the C-6 and C-7 positions of the indole ring of βTrp57 and formation of a covalent bond between the indole rings of βTrp57 and βTrp108. TTQ has also been identified as the prosthetic group of aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) from Alcaligenes faecalis (8Govindaraj S. Eisenstein E. Jones L.H. Sanders-Loehr J. Chistoserdov A.Y. Davidson V.L. Edwards S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in MADH, the TTQ is located in the smaller β subunit of AADH, which is 60% identical to the MADH β subunit (9Chistoserdov A.Y. Microbiology (Read.). 2001; 147: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to TTQ, the MADH β subunit exhibits another unusual structural feature. Of the 131 amino acid residues of the β subunit, there are 12 cysteines, all of which are conserved in MADH from other organisms and in AADH and which form six intrasubunit disulfide bonds (7Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TTQ participates in both the catalytic and electron transfer reactions of MADH. Recently, the enzyme quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase (QHNDH) was shown to possess another tryptophan-derived quinone cofactor, cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ), with the tryptophylquinone cross-linked to a cysteine residue (10Satoh A. Kim J.K. Miyahara I. Devreese B. Vandenberghe I. Hacisalihoglu A. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Duine J.A. Van Beeumen J. Tanizawa K. Hirotsu K. J. Biol.

Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In contrast to the TTQ-bearing enzymes, QHNDH is an αβγ heterotrimeric protein, which is overall sequentially and structurally unrelated to MADH. The smallest 82-residue γ subunit contains CTQ. The largest α subunit is a 489-residue polypeptide chain that contains two c-type hemes. The α and γ subunits sit on the surface of the β subunit, with the enzyme active site being located at the βγ interface. In contrast to the TTQ-bearing β subunit of MADH, the CTQ-bearing γ subunit of QHNDH contains no disulfides. However, in addition to CTQ, the γ subunit contains three novel thioether cross-links, which are formed between cysteine sulfurs and either the β-or γ-methylene carbon of an aspartic or glutamic acid residue (11Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T. Kano K. Tanizawa K. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Despite the significant differences in the overall structures of MADH and QHNDH, the active sites of these enzymes possess one remarkable conserved feature. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the active site structures of MADH and QHNDH from P. denitrificans are overlaid. Each contains two Asp residues within the active site in a nearly identical orientation to the quinone cofactor. γAsp33 of QHNDH and βAsp76 of MADH have their side chains oriented toward the C-6 of the respective tryptophylquinone moiety of TTQ and CTQ. γAsp12 of QHNDH and βAsp32 of MADH each has its side chain pointing away from the quinone, but each has its main chain carbonyl oxygen having the closest interaction with the C-6 of the tryptophylquinone cofactor. Both aspartates are also conserved in the sequence of AADH (8Govindaraj S. Eisenstein E. Jones L.H. Sanders-Loehr J. Chistoserdov A.Y. Davidson V.L. Edwards S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To probe their roles in catalysis, site-directed mutagenesis was used previously to alter βAsp76 and βAsp32 of MADH. Relatively conservative mutations in which each aspartate was converted to asparagine each resulted in greatly reduced or undetectable levels of MADH production (12Sun D. Jones L.H. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reduction of MADH levels was determined by assays of activity and Western blots of crude extracts with antiserum specific for the MADH β subunit. No activity and, at the time, undetectable levels of cross-reactive protein were found in extracts of cells expressing βD76N MADH. Very low levels of MADH activity and cross-reactive protein were produced by cells expressing βD32N MADH. From the results of that study, it was unclear whether these mutations affected protein stability, protein folding during biosynthesis, or TTQ biosynthesis and whether these processes were linked. We have recently developed methods to isolate and characterize biosynthetic intermediates of MADH with incompletely formed TTQ. Analysis by mass spectrometry demonstrated that βW108H and βW108C mutants of MADH possessed an incompletely synthesized cofactor in which a single oxygen (in the form of a hydroxyl group) had been inserted into βTrp57 and no cross-link with residue 108 was present (13Pearson A.R. Jones L.H. Higgins L. Ashcroft A.E. Wilmot C.M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3224-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similarly, inactivation of mauG, which encodes a di-heme protein that is required for MADH biosynthesis (14Wang Y. Graichen M.E. Liu A. Pearson A.R. Wilmot C.M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), also yielded a biosynthetic intermediate with a single oxygen incorporated into βTrp57 and no cross-link with βTrp108 (15Pearson A.R. de la Mora-Rey T. Graichen M.E. Wang Y. Jones L.H. Marimanikkupam S. Aggar S.A. Grimsrud P.A. Davidson V.L. Wilmot C.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5494-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study we have applied these methods to determine the extent of TTQ biosynthesis in the βD76N and βD32N MADH mutants. This has allowed the characterization of a previously unobserved biosynthetic intermediate of MADH that provides new insight into the mechanism of TTQ biogenesis and suggests unanticipated roles for these aspartate residues in TTQ biosynthesis. Native MADH was purified from P. denitrificans as described previously (16Davidson V.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recombinant MADH was heterologously expressed in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (17Graichen M.E. Jones L.H. Sharma B.V. van Spanning R.J. Hosler J.P. Davidson V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4216-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MADH with a His6 tag at the C terminus was constructed and purified as described previously (18Zhu Z. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11184-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The methods for generating the βD76N and βD32N mutations were also described previously (12Sun D. Jones L.H. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic assays of MADH were performed either with artificial electron acceptors (16Davidson V.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or with amicyanin as a terminal electron acceptor (19Brooks H.B. Jones L.H. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as described previously. The first assay mixture contained 16 nm MADH, varied concentrations of methylamine, 4.8 mm phenazine ethosulfate (PES), and 170 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP). The reaction was monitored at 600 nm to determine the rate of reduction of DCIP. Assays were performed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate at 30 °C at the desired pH. The second assay was performed in 0.01 m potassium phosphate and contained 30 μm amicyanin rather than PES and DCIP. The activity was monitored by the change of absorbance at 595 nm caused by the reduction of amicyanin. MADH samples for electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis were desalted using 20-μm Porus R2 resin (polystyrene divinylbenzene, Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI), Foster City, CA) in a glass purification capillary. Briefly, whole protein samples (5 μl of D76N 1 mg/ml, 6 μl of D32N 0.7 mg/ml) were loaded onto the R2 resin, washed three times with 5 μl of 5% methanol, 3% formic acid, and eluted with 4 μl of 70% methanol and 3% formic acid into a coated nanoelectrospray capillary (Protana Engineering). Electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired using a QSTAR Pulsar i (ABI) quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source (Protana Engineering). The ion spray voltage was 1000 V, the time-of-flight region acceleration voltage was 4 kV, and the injection pulse repetition rate was 7.0 kHz. External calibration was performed using renin (monoisotopic mass [MH3+] 586.9830 and [MH2+] 879.9705, Sigma). Mass spectra were the average of ∼300 scans collected in positive mode over a 5-min acquisition period. Deconvolution was performed with the following parameters: mass range to search for deconvoluted peaks was 12,000–45,000 Da; other parameters were left at the software default values (Bayesian Protein Reconstruct tool in the ABI Bio-Analyst software package). Errors in observed mass were calculated using Equation 1, ∑(zEz)2Iz∑Iz=12Eoverall (Eq. 1) where z is the charge species, Ez is the error in measurement of charge species z, and Iz is the intensity of the charge species. Ez, z, and Iz are output by the deconvolution software for each peak used in protein zero mass determination. Although βD76N MADH was not detected in Western blots of cell extracts in a previous study (12Sun D. Jones L.H. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), in the present study it was possible to produce and isolate enough protein for the mass spectrometry analysis from 20 liters of culture (100 g, wet weight of cells). The results of the analysis of the β subunits of βD76N and βD32N MADH are shown in Table I and Fig. 3. The β subunit of βD76N MADH yields a single species with a mass of 14,980.3 ± 0.4 Da. This mass corresponds to the mass of the His6-tagged β subunit in which all disulfides have been formed but with no oxygens incorporated. This result is consistent with our previous observation that this mutant possesses no MADH activity. This is also the first time that we have observed any significant accumulation of a biosynthetic intermediate of MADH that has no oxygen incorporated into βTrp57. Previously characterized biosynthetic intermediates were monohydroxylated at βTrp57 (13Pearson A.R. Jones L.H. Higgins L. Ashcroft A.E. Wilmot C.M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3224-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Pearson A.R. de la Mora-Rey T. Graichen M.E. Wang Y. Jones L.H. Marimanikkupam S. Aggar S.A. Grimsrud P.A. Davidson V.L. Wilmot C.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5494-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The β subunit of βD32N MADH yields two peaks. The major species again exhibits a mass of 14,980.3 ± 0.5 Da, which corresponds to an intermediate in which all disulfides have been formed but with no oxygens incorporated. The minor species has a mass of 15,010.0 ± 0.8 Da, which corresponds to a mature subunit with all disulfides and complete formation of TTQ. This result is consistent with our previous observation that preparations of this mutant possess some MADH activity. This also means that the observed low activity in the βD32N preparations is in part due to the fact that only a small fraction of the isolated βD32N MADH possessed correctly synthesized TTQ. This is the first time that we have observed a preparation containing a minor fraction of fully synthesized TTQ that did not also possess the intermediate with one oxygen inserted into βTrp57 (13Pearson A.R.

Open table in a new tab These data and previously obtained results allow us to more clearly define the sequence of events during MADH and TTQ biogenesis. Formation of the six disulfide bonds in the β subunit occurs first and is independent of TTQ formation. The subsequent incorporation of the first oxygen into βTrp57 does not require MauG (15Pearson A.R. de la Mora-Rey T. Graichen M.E. Wang Y. Jones L.H. Marimanikkupam S. Aggar S.A. Grimsrud P.A. Davidson V.L. Wilmot C.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5494-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but it absolutely does require the carboxylate function of βAsp76 because mutation to asparagine completely abolishes this first hydroxylation (Fig. 3B). This suggests that βAsp76 is acting either as a catalytic acid/base or in the stabilization of a cationic intermediate during the initial hydroxylation of βTrp57. There is precedent for such a role in the mechanisms of cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases. Asp251 has been proposed to play a crucial role in O–O bond scission during the reaction cycle of P-450cam, and a D251N mutation significantly slows the reaction rate and affects the pH dependence of the reaction cycle (20Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide bonds before this first hydroxylation is likely important for establishing the correct orientation of βAsp76 and βTrp57. The two C-terminal residues to βAsp76, βCys77 and βCys78, are each involved in disulfide linkages (βCys77–βCys46 and βCys78–βCys109) (Fig. 4A). These disulfide bonds as well as the interactions made by the carboxylate group of βAsp76 with βThr122 and βTrp108 appear to lock βAsp76 into position. In addition, the orientation of βTrp57 is also fixed by a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) with the backbone carbonyl of βSer30 (Fig. 4A). This results in a provocative relative positioning of βTrp57 and βAsp76 that, combined with the observation that βAsp76 is absolutely required for the monooxygenation reaction, suggests that the first oxygen will be inserted at the C-6 position of βTrp57. Once this first hydroxylation occurs, MauG is able to catalyze the remaining steps in TTQ biosynthesis (15Pearson A.R. de la Mora-Rey T. Graichen M.E. Wang Y. Jones L.H. Marimanikkupam S. Aggar S.A. Grimsrud P.A. Davidson V.L. Wilmot C.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5494-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although QHNDH has no homolog to mauG in the gene cluster that encodes the structural subunits (11Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T. Kano K. Tanizawa K. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the conservation of this aspartate residue in the active site structure of QHNDH (Fig. 2), and potentially in AADH as inferred from its sequence (9Chistoserdov A.Y. Microbiology (Read.). 2001; 147: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), strongly suggests a common MauG-independent mechanism for the first hydroxylation of tryptophan during TTQ and CTQ biogenesis. It is also interesting that although the γ subunit of QHNDH possesses no intrasubunit disulfide bonds, it does possess three intrasubunit covalent thioether cross-links, one of which links γAsp33 (the structural analog to βAsp76 in MADH) to γCys27 (11Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T. Kano K. Tanizawa K. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This thioether bond could serve the same purpose in QHNDH that the disulfides βCys77–βCys46 and βCys78–βCys109 do in MADH to correctly orient the γAsp33 residue to participate in the hydroxylation reaction. Precise orientations of amino acid residue side chains have been shown to be critical for the self-processing reactions that occur during oxygen incorporation into tyrosine during topaquinone biogenesis in amine oxidases (21Hevel J.M. Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and cross-linking of amino acids during the biogenesis of the galactose oxidase cofactor (22Firbank S.J. Rogers M.S.

Although not absolutely required for the initial hydroxylation of βTrp57, βAsp32 does have a significant effect on the efficiency of oxygen incorporation as demonstrated by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3C). The backbone amide nitrogen of βAsp32 does make a hydrogen bond with the C-7 carbonyl that shields it from solvent and prevents its protonation in the quinol and semiquinone states during catalysis (23Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14254-14260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The pronounced effect of the conservative mutation to asparagine, however, suggests that the role of βAsp32 in the reaction is not simply to act as a hydrogen bond partner, but that its ability to ionize is an important aspect of its role in the first oxygenation of βTrp57. The only protein interaction made by the βAsp32 side chain is a strong hydrogen bond (2.61 Å) to the backbone carbonyl of βAsn104, which has led to the suggestion that βAsp32 is protonated in the mature enzyme (15Pearson A.R. de la Mora-Rey T. Graichen M.E. Wang Y. Jones L.H. Marimanikkupam S. Aggar S.A. Grimsrud P.A. Davidson V.L. Wilmot C.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5494-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It may be significant that the side chain nitrogen of βAsn104 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl of βSer30, which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to βTrp57 (Fig. 4B). Thus, this set of interactions may be important in fixing the orientation of βTrp57 for the initial hydroxylation reaction. It is also intriguing that in QHNDH there is a hydrogen bond between the main chain carbonyl of γSer10 and γTrp43 of CTQ (11Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T. Kano K. Tanizawa K. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that is structurally analogous to that observed between βSer30 and βTrp57 in MADH. It is possible that the role of βAsp32 during TTQ biogenesis involves directly or indirectly facilitating the proper orientations of βTrp57, βAsp76, and/or the substrate oxygen during this first oxygenation. βAsp32 of MADH seems unlikely to be involved directly in catalysis, because in the mature enzyme its carboxyl side chain points away from the reactive carbonyl. However, the kinetic parameters of MADH are altered by the βD32N mutation (Table II). The kinetic data obtained for βD32N MADH suggest a role in positioning active site residues or reactants during catalysis that is similar to its proposed role in positioning active site residues or reactants during TTQ biogenesis. As discussed earlier, the low activity in the βD32N preparations can be partially explained by the fact that only a minor fraction of the isolated βD32N MADH possesses correctly synthesized TTQ. However, the steady-state kinetic analysis indicates that the kcat value for this mutant is only about 1–5% of that of wild type. Because the mass spectrometry data indicate that the correctly synthesized fraction is a more significant percentage of the total, the βD32N MADH with correctly synthesized TTQ must have lower activity than wild-type MADH. More interesting is the observation that the Km value for the methylamine of the βD32N mutant is ∼1000-fold greater than that of wild-type MADH (Table II). The Km will not be influenced by the presence of inactive MADH with incompletely synthesized TTQ. We have shown previously that mutations of other residues in the active site can cause subtle perturbations of structure that significantly influence the Km value for methylamine (18Zhu Z. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11184-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Wang Y. Sun D. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4119-4122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, this alteration of Km is particularly significant because we have characterized other mutations of MADH that affect TTQ biogenesis but do not significantly alter Km (18Zhu Z. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11184-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of MADH requires that an active site residue deprotonate the substrate, which will be present in solution as methylammonium at physiologic pH, to generate methylamine for nucleophilic attack of the TTQ carbonyl (5Davidson V.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 58: 95-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the large increase in Km for methylamine as a consequence of the βD32N mutation is that βAsp32 is either directly or indirectly involved in this deprotonation. To test this hypothesis, the kinetic parameters for catalysis by βD32N MADH were also measured at pH 8.5 and compared with the parameters of native MADH. The pKa value of methylamine is 10.6. Thus at pH 7.5 the amount of unprotonated methylamine should be about 1000-fold less than the protonated methylammonium. If inability to deprotonate methylammonium were the cause of the 1000-greater Km of the mutant, then at pH 8.5 where the amount of unprotonated methylamine is 100-fold less than protonated methylammonium, one would expect that the Km value would be 100-fold greater instead of 1000-fold greater. However, no significant change in Km with pH relative to that seen with native amicyanin was observed, effectively ruling out a role for βAsp32 in the deprotonation step. Furthermore, the significantly lower kcat value for βD32N MADH relative to native MADH was observed with both the artificial electron acceptor PES and the natural electron acceptor amicyanin. This indicates that the decreased kcat is related to the reductive half-reaction of MADH and not electron transfer during the oxidative half-reaction. These findings provide strong evidence that the structure of the active site has been perturbed in the population of the active βD32N mutant with mature TTQ such that efficient binding of substrate is compromised.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of native and βD32N MADHMADH formElectron acceptorpHkcatKms-1μmWild typeaThis is the recombinant MADH with a His6 tag at the C terminus of the β subunit, which is used for comparison with the tagged mutant MADH.PES/DCIP7.535 ± 315 ± 5βD32NPES/DCIP7.50.14 ± 0.0116,700 ± 6400Wild typePES/DCIP8.518 ± 121 ± 2βD32NPES/DCIP8.50.19 ± 0.0222,400 ± 5400Wild typeamicyanin7.523 ± 15 ± 1βD32Namicyanin7.50.47 ± 0.0419,600 ± 3400Wild typeamicyanin8.526 ± 14 ± 1βD32Namicyanin8.51.2 ± 0.112,200 ± 3700a This is the recombinant MADH with a His6 tag at the C terminus of the β subunit, which is used for comparison with the tagged mutant MADH. Open table in a new tab These results allow further definition of the sequence of events and factors that are required for the biogenesis of the protein-derived cofactor TTQ. These data also indicate that in MADH multiple roles of specific, conserved amino acids link catalytic function, stability, and cofactor biosynthesis. Although such a linkage may not be a common feature in the evolution of all enzymes, it may be common to certain classes, such as complex redox enzymes, which require posttranslational modifications to generate protein-derived cofactors. These results further reveal unanticipated roles for active site aspartate residues in oxygenation reactions that occur during cofactor biogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2072415693,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins play a critical role in a wide variety of important physiological processes. It has been demonstrated that both an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-4 exist and accumulate in the circulatory system, these fragments accounting for virtually the whole amino acid sequence of the protein. The circulating C-terminal fragment establishes three disulfide bridges, and the binding pattern of these has recently been defined. Here we show that the monodimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the C-terminal fragment is typical of a protein with a relatively close packed tertiary structure. This fragment can be produced in its native conformation in Escherichia coli, without the requirement of further refolding procedures, when synthesis is coupled to its secretion from the cell. The recombinant protein crystallizes with the unit cell parameters of a hexagonal system. Furthermore, it binds strongly to heparin, acquiring a well defined oligomeric structure that interacts with insulin-like growth factors, and promotes bone formation in cultures of murine calvariae.

The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; CBP4, C-terminal fragment of IGFBP-4; rCBP4, recombinant CBP4; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; bMw, whole-cell weight-average buoyant molar mass; MIHS, myo-inositol hexasulfate.1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; CBP4, C-terminal fragment of IGFBP-4; rCBP4, recombinant CBP4; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; bMw, whole-cell weight-average buoyant molar mass; MIHS, myo-inositol hexasulfate. are mitogens produced by many tissues and involved in numerous physiological processes. Their activity is strongly influenced by the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), a family of proteins to which the IGFs bind with high affinity. IGFBPs may directly transport IGFs to different tissues and can either inhibit or enhance IGF activity, depending upon the conditions and form of IGFBP. To date, there are six members of the IGFBP family that share a high degree of sequence similarity in the first and last 100 residues of the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. A highly variable region of ∼30 amino acids separates these two conserved stretches. There are 12–14 conserved cysteines in the N-terminal domain and six in the C-terminal region, each forming internal disulfide bonds (1Ooi G.T. Boisclair Y.R. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C. Contemporary Endocrinology: The IGF System. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 111-139Google Scholar).The IGFs are generally found throughout the body at concentrations far higher than those required for maximal stimulation of their quite ubiquitous cell receptors. However, despite their abundance, the effective concentrations of the IGFs are considerably lower in circulation due to their binding to the IGFBPs, with which they associate with a much higher affinity than to the cell receptors that mediate most of their cellular activity. The release of adequate amounts of IGFs, as required at the appropriate sites, is at least in part a consequence of the selective and highly regulated hydrolysis of the IGFBPs associated with them (2Lassarre C. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Blat C. Villaudy J. Binoux M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Cohen P. Peehl D.M. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This hydrolysis occurs at single or multiple sites in a quite precise fashion through specific and highly regulated protease(s). The sites at which each IGFBP is hydrolyzed are located toward the end of the variable domain, an area rich in basic amino acids. As a consequence, the molecular masses of the fragments produced by these specific proteases are characteristic of each IGFBP, irrespective of the tissue of origin or the species concerned. Indeed, in the case of IGFBP-3 and -4, cleavage sites have also been identified at the beginning of the variable domains (5Maile L.A. Crown A.L. Holly J.M.P. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C.

Furthermore, nerve growth factor seems to display potent protease activity toward IGFBP-4, and IGF-dependent proteolytic activity specific to IGFBP-4 has also been demonstrated in conditioned media from a wide variety of cells such as fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and smooth muscle and neuronal cells.Recombinant DNA techniques constitute, in general, a more than adequate approach to obtain proteins for a wide variety of studies. However, the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins with a high content of disulfide bonds, such as IGFBPs, is normally extremely difficult. These proteins must be folded correctly, and often, microheterogeneous material is produced in this process. Whereas these preparations are often suitable for physiological studies, they are usually not apt to establish the structural basis of their biological properties at high resolution. Thus, of the two N-terminal fragments of IFGBP-5 that have been synthesized by recombinant techniques (containing 45 and 104 residues, respectively), only the first was suitable for three-dimensional NMR structural determination, this containing only four Cys residues (8Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Recently, we isolated a C-terminal fragment of IGFBP-4 (CBP4) that extends from Lys136 to Glu237 from human hemofiltrates (9Ständker L.

Furthermore, we defined the pattern of disulfide bonds in this fragment (residues 153–183, 194–205, and 207–228). The stability of this fragment suggests that it is a well structured domain of the whole protein, since poorly structured proteins are easily hydrolyzed by proteases (10Fontana A. Fassina G. Vita C.

Here we show that high yields of CBP4 in its native conformation can be obtained from Escherichia coli, specifically when its synthesis is coupled to secretion of CBP4 into the periplasm, where protein refolding systems are coupled to thiol oxidation and disulfide isomerase (13Bardwell J.C.

In addition, we show that this fragment binds to heparin, acquiring a well defined oligomeric structure, and, in the presence of heparin, to IGF-I in solution. We also show that CBP4 crystallizes with unit cell parameters of a hexagonal system and that it can promote bone formation in cultures of murine calvariae.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGene Construction, Cloning, and Protein Purification—The general procedures for DNA manipulation and cloning were carried out as described previously (18Sambrook J.

Fractions showing in SDS-PAGE polypeptides with an Mr value comparable with that of the hemofiltrate-purified CBP4 were subsequently diluted 4 times with 10 mm trifluoroacetic acid, reloaded on the same column equilibrated in 10 mm trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a 40-min linear gradient (0–100%) of a acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol/water mixture (6:3:1). PAGE analysis under reducing conditions of the major peak of the second round of chromatography appears in the Supplemental Data. This peak shows an electrophoretic mobility equivalent to that of the hemofiltrate-purified CBP4.For large scale protein expression, BL21 cells harboring the pIN-III-ompA-2(CBP4) vector were grown at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. Protein synthesis was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were collected by centrifugation 60 h later. The supernatant from 2 liters of culture was reduced to 50 ml by ultrafiltration using a 3-kDa Ultrasette (PALL-FILTRON). This was then loaded onto a 16 × 200-mm heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and eluted using a 50-min linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The fractions containing rCBP4 were pooled together and subsequently loaded onto a 16 × 200-mm SP-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mm sodium formiate (pH 4.0) and eluted using a 40-min linear gradient of 0–0.42 m NaCl, followed by a 10-min isocratic step at 1.4 m NaCl. The fractions containing rCBP4, which require a further purification step, were pooled together, loaded onto an 8 × 100-mm heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), and finally eluted with a 50-min linear gradient of 1 m NaCl.Biochemical and Physicochemical Protein Characterization—N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out in an Applied Biosystems 494 microsequencer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (under reducing conditions) and staining of the gels was carried out as described (19Zazo M. Lozano R.M. Ortega S. Varela J. Díaz-Orejas R. Ramírez J.M. Giménez-Gallego G. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The mass spectra were acquired in a MALDI-TOF Biflex™ (Bruker) mass spectrometer in the linear mode, previously calibrated with cytochrome c (12361 Da) and myoglobin (16946 Da). Protein samples were prepared in volatile buffers, lyophilized, and dissolved in TA buffer (30% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) saturated with synapinic acid. The samples were applied to the probe and dried in a stream of air at room temperature.The free SH content of rCBP4 was determined by mass spectrometry in a MALDI-TOF Biflex™ (Bruker). For this purpose, 40-μl samples (protein content 100 μg/ml) were incubated in the presence of 6 m guanidinium HCl at room temperature for 180 min in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.4, either in the presence or in the absence of 20 mm dithiothreitol in the dark under argon. After 90 min, 2 μl of 4-vinylpyridine was added to the samples. Immediately following the incubation, the samples were desalted using ZipTipC18 (Millipore Corp.) and loaded into the mass spectrometer.NMR Spectroscopy—For 1H NMR studies, the protein obtained from a large scale purification was concentrated to 0.2 mm in a 3-kDa Microsep™ filter (Filtron). The sample buffer was switched to 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl during the centrifugation by successive dilution and concentration in the filter with this solution. D2O was added prior to taking measurements at a ratio of 1:9 of the final sample volume. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer, at 25 °C, using sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propionate as an internal reference. Water suppression was carried out by selective presaturation, placing the carrier on the solvent resonance. Conditions for the hemofiltrate-purified protein were the same, except that the concentration of protein was 0.1 mm.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Short column (70-μl) sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 293 K and 25,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. An An-60Ti rotor and standard (12-mm optical path) six-channel centerpieces of Epon-charcoal were used. Absorbance scans were carried out at 277 nm until equilibrium was reached. High speed sedimentation was carried out afterward for base-line determination. The rCBP4 solutions analyzed were prepared in 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl. The protein and ligand concentrations in the mixtures are described throughout and in Table I. Whole-cell weight-average buoyant molar masses (bMw) were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the equation describing the radial concentration distribution of an ideal solute at sedimentation equilibrium using the program EQAS-SOC (20Minton A.P. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). The buoyant mass values allowed first hand analysis to be performed of the sedimentation data of the different mixtures. The analyses to determine whole-cell apparent weight-average molecular weights (M̄w,a) are not straightforward in this case, because the proteins and ligands have different partial specific volumes. The partial specific volume for rCBP4 and IGF-I were calculated with the program SEDNTERP (21Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Horton H.C. Rowe A.J.

Open table in a new tab Histological Studies—Four-day-old Swiss White mice were used in these experiments, and all animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Calvarial bones were dissected in sterile conditions, and small fragments were put in a single well of 12-well Netwell plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). These bone fragments were cultured in 1 ml of Fitton-Jackson modified BGJ medium (Invitrogen) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). Calvarial bone cultures were maintained in humidified air (5%, CO2) at 37 °C for 3 days in the presence of increasing concentrations of rCBP4. Calvariae were fixed overnight in 10% formalin, decalcified in 14% EDTA for 2 days, and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections were obtained (7 μm) and placed on gelatin-coated glass slides for Masson's trichrome staining. The amount of osteogenesis was calculated by light microscopy using an image analysis system, as described previously (24Traianedes K. Dallas M.R. Garrett Y.R. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The total area of new bone (expressed in mm2) and the number of osteoblast cells (counted in 0.3 mm2 of bone) were determined in the central region of three different sections, each at a 70-μm distance from the other. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. after analyzing the data using one-way analysis of variance. p values of <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSSynthesis of CBP4 in E. coli Cultures—A DNA fragment for the expression of CBP4 in E. coli was initially assembled using the procedure described by Didonato et al. (25Didonato A. Denigris M. Russo N. Dibiase S. Dalessio G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was optimized to establish an even distribution of unique restriction enzyme target sequences along the gene, avoiding the formation of very stable secondary structures. It was also optimized to produce efficient termination of translation and, whenever possible, incorporate the amino acid codons most frequently used in E. coli. To facilitate the purification of the synthetic polypeptide by affinity chromatography, the DNA fragment was designed to be cloned into a pair of vectors that add tags to the N terminus of the recombinant polypeptide (26Ortega S. García J.L. Zazo M. Varela J. Muñoz-Willery I. Cuevas P. Giménez-Gallego G. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 795-798PubMed Google Scholar, 27Peranen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvonen M. Kaariainen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DNA fragment was also designed so that these affinity tags could be removed from the recombinant polypeptide by the human rhinovirus 3C protease. The overall structure of this DNA fragment is laid out in Fig. 1.The construct was cloned into four common expression vectors: pCE17, which produces a fusion protein with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the major autolysin from S. pneumoniae (26Ortega S. García J.L. Zazo M. Varela J. Muñoz-Willery I. Cuevas P. Giménez-Gallego G. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 795-798PubMed Google Scholar); pHAT2, a T7 promoter controlled system that adds a His tail to the N terminus of the cloned protein (27Peranen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvonen M. Kaariainen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); pINIII-A3 (28Masui Y. Coleman J. Inouye M. Inouye M. Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression. Academic Press, New York, NY1983: 15-32Crossref Google Scholar); and pINIII-ompA-2 (29Ghrayeb J. Kimura H. Takahara M. Hsiung H. Masui Y. Inouye M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the pHAT2 and pINIII-A3 vectors, the induction of protein expression only resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies, independent of the temperature used (between 28 and 37 °C). In the case of the pCE17 vector, part of the material produced was soluble when expression was carried out at 28 °C, but cleavage with the rhinovirus 3C protease only yielded the moiety corresponding to the pneumoccocal hydrolase. Although this phenomenon was not further investigated, it strongly suggests that the CBP4 moiety failed to adopt an adequate higher order structure and thus was an easy target for nonspecific proteolysis frequently associated with even the most narrow spectrum proteases.It is generally accepted that the -SH groups of Cys residues are mostly maintained in a reduced state in the cytoplasm of E. coli due to the existence of two efficient thiol reducing systems: the thioredoxin and the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathways. Indeed, when one of these systems is eliminated, disulfide bonds begin to form. Hence, E. coli strains that are deficient in the thioredoxin reductase enzyme (trxB mutants) can be successfully used to synthesize some eukaryotic proteins with a correct pattern of disulfide bonding (30Stewart E.J. Aslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 31Proba K. Ge L. Pluckthun A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this strategy did not prove to be successful with any of the aforementioned CBP4 plasmid constructs. Therefore, the synthesis of rCBP4 was attempted using a system in which the newly synthesized polypeptide secreted into the periplasm where disulfide bonds can actively form and isomerization can occur (13Bardwell J.C.

A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the DNA construct (see Fig. 1) was cloned into the pIN-III-ompA-2 vector (29Ghrayeb J. Kimura H. Takahara M. Hsiung H. Masui Y. Inouye M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), where it was fused in frame, immediately after the ompA signal peptide coding sequence. This signal peptide targets the OmpA protein for secretion, and it is selectively removed after translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane.SDS-PAGE analysis under -SH reducing conditions of the periplasmal polypeptide content of cells transfected with the pIN-III-ompA-2 and pIN-III-ompA-2(CBP4) vectors, respectively, showed that a protein accumulated in this compartment in the later case with an Mr that corresponded to that of the CBP4 polypeptide purified from hemofiltrates (Supplemental Data) (9Ständker L. Braulke T. Mark S. Mostafavi H. Meyer M. Höning S. Gimenez-Gallego G. Forssmann W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5082-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Maximal expression of this polypeptide was obtained 24–48 h after the induction of protein expression with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. This polypeptide could be purified from the periplasm preparation by reverse-phase chromatography as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” (see Supplemental Data). N-terminal Edman degradation of this polypeptide yielded two equimolar sequences that corresponded to CBP4, one beginning at Asn138 of IGFBP-4 and the other at the second Leu residue of the rhinovirus 3C protease recognition sequence (Fig. 1). This analysis also showed that removal of the ompA signal peptide had proceeded beyond its normal processing site (Val-Ala-Gln-Ala; not shown). This is in accordance with a relaxation of the specificity in removing the ompA signal peptide previously reported (15Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Nonreducing SDS-PAGE showed that the purified polypeptide is a monomer (not shown), and two peaks, with an Mr of 12105 and 11176, were obtained by mass spectrometry of the final preparation purified by reverse-phase chromatography (not shown). Considering these data in conjunction with data from the Edman degradation, the C-terminal residue of the two rCBP4 forms detected in the periplasm by mass spectroscopy most probably correspond to the Glu of CBP4 (Fig. 1; theoretical Mr 12019 and 11119, respectively). In order to avoid disturbance from the N-terminal tag, a second gene construct was generated in which the triplet coding for Asn138 was placed at the end of the ompA signal peptide. In this case, a double N-terminal sequence was again identified by Edman sequential degradation of the protein obtained, one beginning at Asn138 and a second one at Ala140 (not shown). Unless specifically indicated, the products of the first construct were used in the subsequent experiments reported here.Analysis of the protein content in the supernatant and in the periplasmatic fraction of cultures induced for 48 h shows that, unlike other proteins, rCBP4 preferentially accumulated in the supernatant (Supplemental Data). Protein accumulation reached a maximum in both the periplasm and the supernatant fractions at 48 h after the induction (not shown). In the case of cultures grown in LB medium, we detected many biochemical products derived from the yeast extract that stick nonspecifically and fairly strongly to the chromatography columns, making large scale purification of rCBP4 unfeasible from the supernatant of this culture medium. However, despite the poor secretion of proteins fused to the OmpA secretion signal in minimal medium (32Denefle P. Kovarik S. Ciora T. Gosselet N. Benichou J.C. Latta M. Guinet F. Ryter A. Mayaux J.F. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), approximately equivalent amounts of rCBP4 were recovered from cells cultured in minimal medium supplemented with an acid hydrolysate of casein (casamino acids) as were obtained from cells in LB medium (data not shown). In agreement with the results reported by Dènefle et al. (32Denefle P. Kovarik S. Ciora T. Gosselet N. Benichou J.C. Latta M. Guinet F. Ryter A. Mayaux J.F. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the secretion of rCBP4 into the medium was extremely low when E. coli was cultured in minimal medium alone (not shown).Preparative Purification of rCBP4—Reverse-phase chromatography is not the best method to apply as the first step for large scale protein purification from culture media, even when minimal medium plus casamino acids are used. Many of the biochemical ingredients that irreversibly poison the columns accumulate in the media during fermentation. In addition, the harsh conditions of reverse-phase chromatography may introduce modifications in the protein, making it unsuitable for many biochemical and biophysical studies. The efficiency of other alternative chromatography methods for preparative purification of rCBP4 was therefore explored. The isoelectric point estimated for rCBP4 from its amino acid composition was ∼6.5. Consequently, we did not observe significant retention of rCBP4 in ion exchange chromatography columns unless the pH was established at values either <4 or >8.5. Furthermore, retention of a considerable number of nucleic acids other than rCBP4 was observed with anionic exchangers.S"

As p53 was implicated in the eventual involution of the STAT3 null gland, we examined the effect of STAT3 loss in the mammary gland in a p53 null background. Combined loss of STAT3 and p53 severely perturbed involution, with hyperdelayed loss of epithelium and reappearance of adipocytes. The early apoptotic response was almost completely abrogated, although elevated levels of delayed apoptosis persisted at days 6, 17 and 4 weeks of involution in STAT3-p53 doubly null mammary glands. A 5.7-fold upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1 at 3 days of involution in STAT3 null glands was abolished in STAT3-p53 doubly null glands -- suggesting that the critical factor triggering delayed involution in the STAT3 null gland is a p53-dependent rise in p21Waf1 levels around day 3 of involution. Further, STAT3-p53 doubly null glands showed significantly higher levels of proliferation compared to STAT3 or p53 singly null (or wild-type) glands at days 6, 17 and 4 weeks of involution. Combined loss of STAT3 and p53 therefore results in hyperdelayed involution, demonstrating their synergistic physiological roles in normal involution. This inappropriate retention of p53-deficient cells may represent a novel mechanism of tumour predisposition."
