https://openalex.org/W2000550532,"The Drosophila Notch (N) gene encodes a conserved single-pass transmembrane receptor that transduces extracellular signals controlling cell fate. Here, we present evidence that the intracellular domain of Notch gains access to the nucleus in response to ligand, possibly through a mechanism involving proteolytic cleavage and release from the remainder of the protein. In addition, our results suggest that signal transduction by Notch depends on the ability of the intracellular domain, particularly the portion containing the CDC10 repeats, to reach the nucleus and to participate in the transcriptional activation of downstream target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2038447145,"The MAP kinase ERK2 is widely involved in eukaryotic signal transduction. Upon activation it translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cell, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. We find that nuclear accumulation of microinjected ERK2 depends on its phosphorylation state rather than on its activity or on upstream components of its signaling pathway. Phosphorylated ERK2 forms dimers with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ERK2 partners. Disruption of dimerization by mutagenesis of ERK2 reduces its ability to accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that dimerization is essential for its normal ligand-dependent relocalization. The crystal structure of phosphorylated ERK2 reveals the basis for dimerization. Other MAP kinase family members also form dimers. The generality of this behavior suggests that dimerization is part of the mechanism of action of the MAP kinase family."

Water was long believed to move through lipid bilayers by simple diffusion; however, membranes from different tissues vary in their permeability to water. The variability is particularly evident in mammalian kidney where proximal tubules and descending thin limbs of Henle's loop have constitutively high water permeability and are responsible for reabsorption of more than 150 liters per day in adult humans. In contrast, ascending thin limbs have very low water permeability. Renal distal tubules empty into collecting ducts where stimulation with vasopressin causes an increase in water permeability (see Ref. 1Knepper M.A. Wade J.B. Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Marples D. Mandon B. Chou C.L. Kishore B.K. Nielsen S. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar for review). These observations led to the suggestion that specialized water transport molecules must exist in membranes with intrinsically high water permeability. Nevertheless, despite extensive studies, the molecular identity of water transport proteins remained elusive until recently. The well defined features of membrane water permeability permitted serendipitous identification of the first known water channel. While purifying the 32-kDa subunit of the red cell Rh blood group antigen, a new 28-kDa polypeptide was discovered (2Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed biochemical studies of this newly identified tetrameric membrane protein were made easy by its low solubility in N-lauroylsarcosine, which permitted simple purification (3Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abundance of the protein in rat renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs (2Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15634-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sparked the idea that the 28-kDa polypeptide may be the long sought water channel, and its unique N-terminal amino acid sequence permitted cloning from an erythroid cDNA library (4Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11110-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The Xenopus oocyte expression system has been extremely useful for study of water transport. Oocytes injected with cRNA for the 28-kDa polypeptide exhibit remarkably high osmotic water permeability (Pf ∼200 × 10−4 cm s−1) and rapidly explode in hypotonic buffer (Fig.1), whereas control oocytes exhibit minimal permeability (5Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). First referred to as “CHIP28,” this protein is now designated aquaporin-1 (AQP1) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; TIP, tonoplast intrinsic protein. by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee (see http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature). Despite its large water permeability, AQP1 failed to confer a measurable increase in membrane currents (5Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, highly purified AQP1 protein reconstituted into proteoliposomes exhibits high unit water permeability (Pf ∼3 × 109 water molecules subunit−1 s−1), whereas permeation by other small solutes or even protons was undetectable (6Zeidel M.L. Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Ambudkar S.V. Maunsbach A.B. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The prevailing view is that AQP1 is a constitutively active, water-selective pore that permits osmotically driven movement of water. A report that forskolin induces a cation current in AQP1-expressing oocytes (7Yool A.J. Stamer W.D. Regan J.W. Science. 1996; 273: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was not reproduced by multiple other scientific groups. Permeation by CO2 has recently been proposed, because rates of pH change are about 40% higher in oocytes expressing AQP1 (8Nakhoul N.L. Davis B.A. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C543-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Permeation by O2, nitric oxide, and other gases is also likely; however, the high background permeability raises questions about the physiological relevance. Thus, although the evidence that AQP1 functions as a water channel is incontrovertible, existence of still undiscovered transport functions cannot be excluded. Sequence analysis suggested that AQP1 is a six-transmembrane domain integral protein (4Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11110-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal halves of the protein are related sequences comprised of three bilayer spanning domains and connecting loops B and E, which each contain the signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (Fig. 2,top ). Cys-189 in loop E was shown to be the site of mercurial inhibition, and Loop C was localized at an extracellular location demonstrating the obverse symmetry of the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule (9Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the proposed “hourglass” model (10Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), loops B and E correspond to two hemipores, which overlap midway between the leaflets of the bilayer, creating a constitutively open, narrow aqueous pathway (Fig. 2, bottom ). The availability of highly purified red cell AQP1 permitted physical studies of the protein (see Ref. 11Heymann J.B. Agre P. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 116 (in press)Google Scholar for review). Freeze fracture electron microscopy of reconstituted red cell AQP1 confirmed the proposed tetrameric assembly of AQP1. Reconstitution of purified AQP1 at high concentrations produced highly uniform lattices (membrane crystals) with full retention of the water permeability. Fourier transform infrared analyses of AQP1 membrane crystals demonstrated the lack of β structure and the existence of α-helices oriented at 21–27° from the perpendicular. Electron diffraction analysis of cryopreserved specimens at tilts of up to 60° revealed AQP1 tetramers at a resolution of 3–6 Å with individual subunits containing six bilayer-spanning α helices (12Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heymann J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (Fig.3, left ). These physical studies revealed that the intrasubunit structure strongly resembles the proposed hourglass (Fig. 3, right ). The current challenge is to extend this information to the atomic level of resolution. Distribution of AQP1 protein in proximal convoluted tubules and descending thin limbs have been defined in rat and human kidney (13Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar,14Maunsbach A.B. Marples D. Chin E. Ning G. Bondy C. Agre P. Nielsen S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AQP1 is constitutively present in the apical plasma membranes (brush borders) and in basolateral membranes in quantities sufficient to account for the huge volumes of water reabsorbed in the proximal nephron. AQP1 is also present in many capillary endothelia and in multiple water-permeable epithelia including cerebrospinal fluid secretory epithelia of choroid plexus, aqueous humor secretory, absorptive epithelia in eye, and bile secretory epithelia (15Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7275-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). A fortuitous observation led to the identification of humans who totally lack AQP1. The Co blood group antigen is a structural polymorphism at the extracellular surface of red cell AQP1. The exceedingly rare Co null individuals were found to have mutations in the AQP1 gene but surprisingly exhibited no obvious clinical phenotype (16Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, targeted gene disruption has revealed that Aqp1 null mice become hyperosmolar after fluid restriction (17Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Vasopressin was long known to regulate water permeability of the apical membrane in renal collecting duct epithelium, but lack of AQP1 at this site predicted the existence of additional aquaporins (5Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Homology cloning by polymerase chain amplification using degenerate oligonucleotide primers has been employed by multiple investigators to clone aquaporin homologs. Efforts have rapidly led to the recognition of at least 10 mammalian aquaporins (Fig.4). All members of the family contain structural motifs similar to AQP1, but each probably has special features needed for function or regulation. Correlation of sequences and functional properties showed that this protein family is comprised of two subgroups (18Park J.H. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar): water-selective homologs (aquaporins) and other homologs that are permeated by water, glycerol, and other small molecules (aquaglyceroporins) (Fig. 4). Multiple groups are investigating AQP2, a homolog that is only expressed in the principal cells of the renal collecting duct (see Refs. 1Knepper M.A. Wade J.B. Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Marples D. Mandon B. Chou C.L. Kishore B.K. Nielsen S. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Knepper M.A. Inoue T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, and 20Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar for reviews). Vasopressin has long been known to cause the redistribution of intracellular vesicles to the apical surface of principal cells. In a classic study of short-term vasopressin regulation of isolated collecting ducts, trafficking of AQP2 in intracellular vesicles was visualized by immunogold electron microscopy and correlated with measurements of transcellular water permeability (21Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Thus, multiple studies together indicate that vasopressin binds to a basolateral V2 receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase; protein kinase A then leads to phosphorylation of sites in the C terminus of the AQP2 protein; AQP2 vesicles are then targeted to the cell surface via the vesicle-targeting proteins causing increased water permeability of the apical membrane. The long term vasopressin regulation of biosynthesis and degradation of AQP2 are also recognized but are not well understood. AQP2 may be involved in all imbalances of water metabolism (see Refs.1Knepper M.A. Wade J.B. Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Marples D. Mandon B. Chou C.L. Kishore B.K. Nielsen S. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Knepper M.A. Inoue T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, and 20Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar for reviews). Impaired renal water reabsorption is associated with quantitatively reduced AQP2 in diabetes insipidus, a disorder resulting from inadequate levels of vasopressin leading to secretion of large volumes of dilute urine. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney fails to respond to vasopressin, and mutations have been identified in the gene encoding AQP2 (22Deen P.M. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. van Os C.H. Van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Lithium is widely prescribed for treatment of manic depressive disorder. Polyuria is a problematic side effect of lithium therapy, and marked reduction in AQP2 expression occurs in lithium-treated rats (23Marples D. Christensen S. Christensen E.I. Ottosen P.D. Nielsen S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1838-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Reduced AQP2 expression has also been documented in several other settings including after reversal of urinary obstruction, in hypokalemia-induced polyuria, and in nocturnal enuresis. In contrast, clinical problems with excessive renal water reabsorption are associated with increased AQP2. Congestive heart failure is a life-threatening complication of coronary vascular disease caused by excessive retention of water. Increased expression of AQP2 has been found in rat models of congestive heart failure and is also believed to explain fluid retention in pregnancy (24Nielsen S. Terris J. Andersen D. Ecelbarger C. Frokiaer J. Jonassen T. Marples D. Knepper M.A. Petersen J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5450-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25Ohara M. Martin P.Y. Xu D.L. St. John J. Pattison T.A. Kim J.K. Schrier R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). AQP4 is the predominant aquaporin in brain and resides at the perivascular membrane of astroglial cells where it may function as an exit port for excess brain water. AQP4 is also present in glial lamellae surrounding vasopressin secretory neurons where it has been suggested to function as an osmoreceptor (26Nielsen S. Nagelhus E.A. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Bourque C. Agre P. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 171-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in ependymal cells lining the cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavities (27Frigeri A. Gropper M.A. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in retina where the protein is particularly abundant in Müller cell end-feet adjacent to the vitreous body and vascular endothelium (28Nagelhus E.A. Veruki M.L. Torp R. Haug F.M. Laake J.H. Nielsen S. Agre P. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2506-2519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that AQP4 is the molecular basis of square arrays within astroglial membranes (29Verbavatz J.M. Ma T. Gobin R. Verkman A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2855-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was previously reported that protein kinase A and C do not modulate the water permeability of aquaporins, this is now questioned because phorbol diesters produced ∼90% reduction in water permeability by oocytes expressing AQP4 (30Han Z. Wax M.B. Patil R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Disruption of the mouse Aqp4 gene resulted in a minor defect in renal concentration but no detectable neurological abnormality (31Chou C.L. Ma T. Yang B. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C549-C554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fifth aquaporin was cloned from a salivary gland cDNA library, and AQP5 resides in apical membranes of type I alveolar pneumocytes as well as in a subset of salivary and lacrimal glands where it may participate in airway humidification and generation of saliva and tears (32Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding rat AQP5 is being evaluated as a potential gene transfer to damaged secretory glands (33Delporte C. O'Connell B.C. He X. Ambudkar I.S. Agre P. Baum B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22070-22075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Other water-selective homologs have been identified and partially characterized. The major intrinsic protein of lens (AQP0) has a low water permeability, but mice with naturally occurring mutations in the gene encoding AQP0 suffer congenital cataracts (34Shiels A. Bassnett S. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). AQP6 is expressed in kidney but exhibits extremely low water permeability, and its distribution has not been defined (35Ma T. Yang B. Kuo W.L. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1996; 35: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding AQP8 was recently isolated from testis, pancreas, liver, and other tissues (36Koyama Y. Yamamoto T. Kondo D. Funaki H. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Sato N. Hatakeyama K. Kihara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30329-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Whereas previously cloned aquaporins are only permeable to water, some homologs are permeated by water, glycerol, and other small solutes. AQP3 was noted to be genetically closer to the Escherichia coli glycerol transport protein GlpF (see Ref. 20Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar for review). The structural explanation for how AQP3 may permit transport of water and glycerol is not agreed upon. The existence of independent water and glycerol transporting domains was suggested by one group of scientists; the existence of a single pore was suggested by a second group; a third group incorrectly reported that the molecule was impermeable to water. The abundant expression of AQP3 at the basolateral membranes of principal cells in the collecting duct suggests a role in renal water reabsorption (37Ecelbarger C.A. Terris J. Frindt G. Echevarria M. Marples D. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F663-F672PubMed Google Scholar). AQP3 is also expressed in multiple other tissues including airways and is particularly abundant in nasopharyngeal epithelium, where roles in mucosal secretions and allergic rhinitis are suspected (32Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple other aquaglyceroporins are now being identified by cDNA cloning and computer search of expressed sequence tagged (EST) cDNA libraries (Fig. 4). A cDNA encoding AQP7 was isolated from rat testis (38Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Gu Y. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Suzuki F. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20782-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). AQP7 may provide a port for water and glycerol as a carbon source and may permit replacement of water by glycerol during cryopreservation of sperm. At the same time, AQP7L, a highly related cDNA, was isolated from human adipose tissue (39Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which may facilitate glycerol export during lipolysis. Preliminary evidence supports the existence of another homolog designated AQP9 (Fig. 4). Kidney, airways, and eye have been found to contain multiple different aquaporins at specific cellular locations. Several aquaporins have been documented in mammalian kidney (see Refs. 1Knepper M.A. Wade J.B. Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Marples D. Mandon B. Chou C.L. Kishore B.K. Nielsen S. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1712-1717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Knepper M.A. Inoue T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, and 20Sasaki S. Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar for reviews). These aquaporins presumably function together to provide transcellular water flow. In principal cells of the collecting duct, AQP2 is shuttled to the apical membrane permitting water entry from the lumen, whereas AQP3 and AQP4 reside at the basolateral membranes providing exit ports to the interstitium (37Ecelbarger C.A. Terris J. Frindt G. Echevarria M. Marples D. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F663-F672PubMed Google Scholar, 40Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Marples D. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F775-F785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pulmonary tissues develop a large capacity for fluid absorption in the perinatal state and provide humidification of the airways and airway secretions (see Ref. 41Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L487-L503PubMed Google Scholar for review). To accomplish this, complex developmental expression patterns have evolved (42Yasui M. Serlachius E. Lofgren M. Belusa R. Nielsen S. Aperia A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 3-11Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with highly specific distribution patterns (32Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): AQP1 in peribronchiolar capillary endothelium; AQP3 in basal cells of airway epithelium; AQP4 in tall columnar cells; AQP5 in the apical membrane of type I alveolar pneumocytes and salivary acini. The distribution of aquaporins in eye is also complex (43Hamann S. Zeuthen T. la Cour M. Nagelhus E.A. Ottersen O.P. Agre P. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar): AQP0 in lens; AQP1 in anterior chamber; AQP3 in bulbar conjunctivae; AQP5 in lacrimal gland and cornea; AQP4 in retina and optic nerve. Regional aquaporin expressions are also found in brain, suggesting integrated functions; AQP1 may mediate cerebrospinal fluid secretion by the choroid plexus, and AQP4 may facilitate reabsorption by ependyma (15Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7275-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar,26Nielsen S. Nagelhus E.A. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Bourque C. Agre P. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 171-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Frigeri A. Gropper M.A. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because entry and release of water from cells and tissues is a fundamental process of life, it is not surprising that aquaporins have been found throughout nature including diverse vertebrate and invertebrate species. Early studies of toad bladder provided some of the first insights that water channels may exist, and homology cloning identified a constitutively active aquaporin in toad bladder and another in frog skin, which is believed to alter skin water permeability during adaptation to salt environments (44Abrami L. Capurro C. Ibarra C. Parisi M. Buhler J.M. Ripoche P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TheDrosophila mutation big brain interferes with development of neurogenic or epidermogenic cells, and AQPcic has been identified in the filter chamber of the sap-sucking insect Cicadella viridis (45Beuron F. Le Cahérec F. Guillam M.-T. Cavalier A. Garret A. Tassan J.-P. Delamarche C. Schultz P. Mallouh V. Rolland J.-P. Hubert J.-F. Gouranton J. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17414-17422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because plants are rooted, they are entirely dependent upon their local environments for water, and numerous plant aquaporins are being identified. The Arabidopsis thaliana EST library was recently found to contain at least 23 different aquaporin homologs (46Weig A. Deswarte C. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Plant homologs appear to be water-selective aquaporins and are comprised of two basic subgroups, which are tightly regulated during development. Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins reside in the plasma membrane and mediate cellular water uptake and release; TIPs reside in the intracellular vacuole (tonoplast) and mediate cellular turgor. A fascinating array of physiological processes is now being ascribed to plant aquaporins (see Ref. 47Maurel C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 399-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar for review). γ-TIP has been functionally defined and is expressed in the stem. Another aquaporin homolog is involved in the inhibition of self-pollination. Rehydration alters vacuole integrity through α-TIP during seed germination. Aquaporins are involved in other plant processes such as closure of leaf guard cells and root water uptake. Expression of certain plant aquaporins is regulated by light, gibberellic acid, water deprivation, or nematodal infestation. The homolog Nod26 is encoded by a legume gene and is expressed in the symbiosome surrounding nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The genomes of multiple unicellular organisms are being entirely sequenced at The Institute for Genome Research and elsewhere. Not surprisingly, genes distributed among plant and animal species are present in bacteria. The two major branches of the aquaporin family are each represented by a single homolog in E. coli . GlpF, like the mammalian aquaglyceroporins, has been shown to transport glycerol by a porelike mechanism. AqpZ, like mammalian and plant aquaporins, is a selective water channel, and AqpZ is operative during rapid growth (48Calamita G. Kempf B. Bonhivers M. Bishai W.R. Bremer E. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3627-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The importance of the aquaporin-aquaglyceroporin dualism is being explored in E. coli and may provide insight into their presence in higher organisms (Fig. 4). As microbial genomes become sequenced, multiple aquaporin homologs are becoming recognized. TheSaccharomyces genome contains two open reading frames related to aquaglyceroporins and two others related to aquaporins (49Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274: 546-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (3282) Google Scholar). The slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum expresses an aquaporin-like protein in prespore cells (50Flick K.M. Shaulsky G. Loomis W.F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The functions of these microbial proteins are currently being evaluated in wild-type organisms and null mutants. The molecular studies into the membrane transport of water point to several new challenges. The biophysical roles of aquaporins are also not fully defined, and the possibility of other functions or molecular regulatory mechanisms awaits further study. Likewise, it cannot be assumed that all water transport molecules will be members of the aquaporin family, because some cotransporter proteins carry water along with their major substrate (51Loo D.D. Zeuthen T. Chandy G. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13367-13370Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of AQP1 is becoming well understood but is still not at the atomic level of resolution, and development of heterologous expression systems will be needed. Numerous animal and plant homologs remain to be identified, and completion of the human genome project will provide sequences of additional aquaporins but will not identify the sites of expression or physiological functions. It is likely that involvement of aquaporins in clinical disorders will continue to be interesting (52Lee M.D. King L.S. Agre P. Medicine. 1997; 76: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it seems certain that the aquaporin story is far from complete."

They are investigated here via (i) labeling of cisplatin with 15N and use of two-dimensional1H,15N NMR spectroscopy, (ii) comparison of natural human serum albumin with recombinant human albumin (higher homogeneity and SH content), (iii) chemical modification of Cys, Met, and His residues, (iv) reactions of bound platinum with thiourea, and (v) gel filtration chromatography. In contrast to previous reports, it is shown that the major sulfur-containing binding site involves Met and not Cys-34, and also a N ligand, in the form of an S,N macrochelate. Additional monofunctional adducts involving other Met residues and Cys-34 are also observed. During the later stages of reactions of cisplatin with albumin, release of NH3 occurs due to the strong trans influence of Met sulfur, which weakens the Pt-NH3 bonds, and protein cross-linking is observed. The consequences of these findings for the biological activity of cisplatin-albumin complexes are discussed.

Cisplatin,cis -[PtCl2(NH3)2], is extensively used for the treatment of testicular and ovarian cancers and increasingly against other types of solid tumors (head/neck, lung, cervical, and bladder) (1Kelland L.R.

The cytotoxic effect of cisplatin is thought to be due to attack on DNA bases and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells (5Reedijk J. Berton G.

Platinum and Other Metal Coordination Compounds in Cancer Chemotherapy: Part 2. Plenum Press, New York1996: 283-291Google Scholar). It is also able to bind to a number of extra- and intracellular proteins (7Pizzo S.V. Swaim M.W. Roche P.A. Gonias S.L. J. Inorg.

Inactivation of certain enzymes due to cisplatin binding is likely to be responsible for its appreciable side effects, mainly nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity (12Borch R.F. Pleasants M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6611-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Aull J.L. Daron H.H. Friedman M.E. Melius P. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 11.

In body fluids, cisplatin is readily attacked by nucleophiles with exchange of one or both chloride ligands to form high and low molecular mass complexes (15Repta A.J. Long D.F.

Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One day after rapid intravenous infusion of cisplatin, 65–98% of platinum in blood plasma is protein-bound (17DeConti R.C.

Maguire P.J. Sikis B.J. Holth D.F. Woodley P.V. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1980; 5: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Protein binding results in significantly lower urinary excretion and an increased tissue deposition of platinum (18Gullo J.J. Litterst C.L. Maguire P.J. Sikis B.J. Holth D.F. Woodley P.V. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1980; 5: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Reaction between cisplatin and serum albumin is thought to be the main route for platinum binding in human blood plasma (16Nagai N. Okuda R. Kinochita M. Ogata H. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cisplatin binding to albumin is essentially irreversible with less than 5% loss of protein-bound platinum after extensive dialysis (15Repta A.J. Long D.F. Prestayko A.W Crooke S.T. Carter S.K. Cisplatin: Current Status and Developments. Academic Press, New York1980: 285-304Crossref Google Scholar, 20Cole W.C. Wolf W. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1980; 30: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Human serum albumin (HSA) 1The abbreviations used are: HSA, human serum albumin; rHA, recombinant human albumin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; DTNB, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. is a single-chain 66-kDa protein, which is largely α-helical and consists of three structurally homologous domains, organized into a heart shape (21Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar). HSA contains 17 disulfide bridges and one free thiol at Cys-34. Albumin is known to bind to various endogenous metabolites, metal ions, and drugs (21Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar, 22Peters Jr., T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). Binding of drugs to serum albumin affects their metabolism, efficacy, and body distribution (23Herve F. Urien S. Albengres E. Duche J.C. Tillement J.P. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1994; 26: 44-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although it is widely thought that albumin-bound platinum is therapeutically inactive (19Kratz F. Keppler B.K. Metal Complexes in Cancer Chemotherapy. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1993: 391-429Google Scholar, 24Ma J. Verweij J. Kolker H.J. van Ingen H.E. Stoter G. Schellens J.H.M. Br. J.

Plenum Press, New York1995: 53-66Google Scholar), several clinical and experimental observations are in conflict with this opinion. (i) Hypoalbuminemic patients respond poorly to cisplatin treatment (26Holding J.D. Lindup W.E. Bowdler D.A. Siodlak M.Z. Stell P.M. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1991; 32: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Fountzilas G. Kosmidis P. Beer M. Sridhar K.S. Banis K. Vritsios A. Daniilidis J. Ann.

Lung Cancer. 1995; 12: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), (ii) the infusion of preformed cisplatin-albumin complexes significantly increases patient survival times (29DeSimone P.A. Brennan L. Cattaneo M.L. Zukka E. Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 1987; 6: 33Google Scholar, 30Holding J.D. Lindup W.E. Van Laer C. Vreeburg G.C.M. Schiling V. Wilson J.A. Stell P.M. Br. J. Clin.

Sci. 1995; 84: 216-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the antitumor activity of infused cisplatin may be determined by both free and albumin-bound drug. Additionally, albumin binding may prevent some of the side effects of cisplatin treatment, especially its nephrotoxicity (30Holding J.D. Lindup W.E. Van Laer C. Vreeburg G.C.M. Schiling V. Wilson J.A. Stell P.M. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1992; 33: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Nanji A.A. Stewart D.J. Mikhael N.Z. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1986; 17: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of albumin-cisplatin interactions may have an impact on the optimization of strategies for cisplatin treatment. Despite numerous studies of cisplatin-albumin binding during the last few decades (7Pizzo S.V. Swaim M.W. Roche P.A. Gonias S.L. J. Inorg.

Bull. 1993; 16: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of interaction is still poorly understood. Gonias and Pizzo reported that carboxyamidomethylation of the SH group in bovine and human serum albumin resulted in a 4–5-fold decrease in platinum binding and suggested formation of a single monodentate complex of cisplatin with the free sulfhydryl group (Cys-34) (7Pizzo S.V. Swaim M.W. Roche P.A. Gonias S.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1988; 33: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Gonias S.L. Pizzo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5764-5769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine non-mercaptalbumin, obtained via reaction with cystine, also had a low affinity for cisplatin, compared with mercaptalbumin (38Sugii A. Nishimura K. Harada K. Nakayama M. Masuda K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1991; 39: 408-410Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the disulfide-type dimers of BSA with no free SH groups still bound substantial amounts of cisplatin (38Sugii A. Nishimura K. Harada K. Nakayama M. Masuda K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1991; 39: 408-410Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, blocking the free SH group has been reported to have no effect on the binding of 2 mol eq of transplatin to HSA (7Pizzo S.V. Swaim M.W. Roche P.A. Gonias S.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1988; 33: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data suggest the existence of additional platinum binding sites on albumin. Momburg et al . (34Momburg R. Bourdeaux M. Sarrazin M. Chauvet M. Briand C. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1987; 39: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) also suggested the existence of two albumin binding sites for cisplatin, but apart from Cys-34, the nature of the other cisplatin binding site was not elucidated. The aim of the present work was to study the reaction of cisplatin with intact and chemically modified recombinant human albumin (rHA), and with HSA using one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional1H,15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy to characterize platination sites under different experimental conditions. Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy has proved to be extremely powerful in elucidating the chemistry and biochemistry of 15N-labeled platinum ammine complexes. The15N chemical shift of the ammine is diagnostic of the ligand coordinated to platinum in the trans -position (39Berners-Price S.J. Sadler P.J. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1996; 151: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Recent studies have included those on the interaction of platinum drugs with nucleic acids, amino acids, and peptides (39Berners-Price S.J. Sadler P.J. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1996; 151: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar, 40Reeder F. Guo J. Murdoch S. Corazza A. Hambley T.W. Berners-Price S.J. Chottard J.C. Sadler P.J. Eur. J.

The experiments reported here reveal for the first time that strong binding sites other than Cys-34 play a major role in albumin-cisplatin interactions in solution. cis -[PtCl2(15NH3)2] andcis -[Pt(15NH3)2(H2O)2]2+were prepared according to literature procedures (42Kerrison J.S. Sadler P.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1977; : 861-863Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Iodoacetamide,N -ethylmaleimide, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), Norit-A (Sigma), iodomethane (Merck), diethylpyrocarbonate (Acros-Organic), DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and polyethylene glycol 4000 (Fluka) were used as received. All other chemicals were of the highest quality available from Sigma and Aldrich. rHA was prepared by Delta Biotechnology Ltd (batches GA950202 and R970103). Samples of rHA were extensively dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9, and freeze-dried. HSA was obtained from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (batches HA(20)60440 and SPPS (P-3-671)). Crude HSA was precipitated with 25% polyethylene glycol, purified by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (43Curling J.M. Lindquist L.O. Eriksson S. Process Biochem. 1977; 12: 22-28Google Scholar), and defatted by activated charcoal (44Chen R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 173-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified samples were dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and freeze-dried. Cys-34-blocked rHA was prepared by incubation of albumin solution (40–60 mg ml−1) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9, with 2 mol eq of iodoacetamide (45Gurd F.R.N. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 424-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or N -ethylmaleimide (46Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 424-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) for 12–16 h at ambient temperature in the absence of light. Excess of the blocking agent was removed by dialysis against the same buffer. Methionine residues were methylated by reaction with iodomethane (47Jones Jr, W.C. Rothgeb T.M. Gurd F.R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7452-7460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iodomethane in 500-fold molar excess was added to an rHA solution (30 mg ml−1) in 0.1 m citric acid-phosphate buffer, pH 4.0. The two-phase solution was stirred at ambient temperature for 20 h in the dark. At the end of this period, iodomethane was removed by dialysis against 0.2% w/v NaN3and then water. Histidine residues were modified by diethylpyrocarbonate (48Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). This reagent was added to a concentration of 10 mm to rHA solutions (40 mg ml−1 or 600 μm) in 0.1m phosphate, pH 6.0. Solutions were stirred at ambient temperature for 18 h, followed by dialysis against water. The number of modified histidine residues was calculated according to the molar absorption for N -carbethoxyimidazole at 240 nm: Δε240 = 3200 m−1cm−1 (48Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In most experiments,cis -[PtCl2(15NH3)2] was freshly dissolved in 10 mm phosphate, 100 mm KCl, to a concentration of 1 mm. Freeze-dried albumin was added to an equivalent concentration, followed by the addition of deuterium oxide to 10% to provide an NMR lock signal. The final pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.4 using small aliquots of 2.0 m NaOH. In several experiments, rHA was dissolved to a final concentration of 1 mm in buffer solutions containing 0.5–2 mm cisplatin. The free SH content of albumin was determined after 24 h of incubation with cisplatin. Free cisplatin was removed by ultrafiltration with a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The thiol contents of rHA and HSA were estimated using Ellman's reagent, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (49Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 50Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The amount of generated p -nitrothiolate anion was calculated using the extinction coefficient 13,600m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm (49Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The concentration of albumin was measured using the absorption at 279 nm assuming A 279 (1 mg ml−1, 1 cm) = 0.556 (51Sadler P.J. Tucker A. Viles J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Gel filtration of cisplatin-albumin complexes was carried out on a Superdex 200 HR column (internal diameter 1 cm; length 30 cm) with an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at ambient temperature. Albumin samples were diluted to a concentration of 5 mg ml−1 and 200 μl of the protein solution was loaded onto the column. Elution conditions were 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, with flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 and detection at 280 nm. One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra were acquired at 500.13 MHz using a Bruker DMX500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a tunable triple resonance (TBI) probehead [1H,13C,X ] incorporating an actively shielded z -field gradient coil. One-dimensional1H NMR spectra were acquired using a double-pulsed-field-gradient spin-echo pulse scheme (52Hwang T. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), based on the WATERGATE sequence, namely 90°x-Gza-sel90°−x-180°x-sel90°−x-Gza-Gzb-sel90°−x-180°x-sel90°−x-Gzb-ACQ. Typically 32 transients were acquired into 20,000 complex data points using digital quadrature detection over a frequency width of 10 kHz with a recycle delay of 1.4 s. Solvent-selective 90° pulses (sel90°) were of a rectangular profile with a pulse duration of 2.3 ms. Sine-shaped z -gradient pulses of 2 ms duration were followed by field-gradient-recovery delays of 100 μs. Gradient strengths of 5.5% and 3.0% were used for gradients “a” and “b,” respectively. Data were zero-filled to 32,000 data points and apodized using an optimal combination of an exponential line-broadening function of 2 Hz and an unshifted sine-bell function (53Sadler P.J. Tucker A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) prior to Fourier transformation. All spectra were recorded at 310 K. Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR data were acquired using a gradient-enhanced sequence in which coherence selection is achieved via gradient pulses (54Stonehouse J. Shaw G.L. Keeler J. Laue E.D. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1994; 107: 178-184Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Typically, 48 transients were acquired over an F2 (1H) frequency width of 6.6 kHz into 2048 complex data points for each of 128t 1 increments in TPPI mode with an F1 (15N) frequency width of 3.3 kHz. The sequence was optimized with a delay 1/(4JNH) of 3.47 ms. Decoupling during the acquisition time was achieved using a GARP decoupling scheme. Data were zero-filled once in F1 followed by apodization using a Gaussian window function in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation and phase correction. A recycle delay of 1.5 s led to typical experiment times of ∼3 h per two-dimensional data set (6 h for thiourea experiments). The reaction times stated in the text refer to the time from mixing to the mid-point of data accumulation. NMR spectra were referenced in the 1H dimension to internal dioxan at 3.764 ppm and in the 15N indirect dimension to15NH4Cl in D2O at 0 ppm (external). One set of experiments (Fig. 6) was carried out on a Varian Unity 600 spectrometer (1H, 600 MHz) under conditions similar to those described above. All two-dimensional HSQC data acquired at 500 MHz were processed using the software XWINNMR version 1.3 (Bruker Spectrospin Ltd.). Prior to volume integration, flat baseplanes were established for all data sets by applying a baseplane correction. Two types of region were chosen for integration. (i) The overall intensity of each spectrum of protein-bound cisplatin was measured by integrating the entire two-dimensional region where signals were observed, and (ii) the volume integral of the1H-15N signal from the starting material was measured excluding the areas in which 195Pt satellites occur. Reactions of cisplatin with both recombinant human albumin and human albumin isolated from blood serum were studied. Although rHA and HSA are similar in amino acid composition, secondary structure and globular packing, they differ in two respects, namely in free thiol content (approximately 0.9 mol SH mol−1 rHA and 0.4–0.5 mol SH mol−1 HSA) and in the greater structural heterogeneity of HSA compared with rHA (55Dodsworth N. Harris R. Denton K. Woodrow J. Wood P.C. Quirk A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996; 24: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar). Cisplatin-albumin interactions were studied mainly at pH 6.4, where albumin exists predominantly as one structural isomer, namely the N-form (22Peters Jr., T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). Several experiments were also carried out at pH 7.4 and 5.0. In most experiments, KCl was added to suppress cisplatin hydrolysis (as would be the case under extracellular conditions). One mol eq of cisplatin added to an albumin solution (1 mm rHA in 10 mmphosphate and 100 mm chloride, pH 6.4) induced changes in the protein one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum. Specifically, peaks at 2.19 ppm and 2.05 ppm significantly decreased in intensity relative to other peaks in the aliphatic region over a 17 h period at 310 K (data not shown). No other significant changes were observed. There was also a decrease in the overall signal-to-noise ratio, which was significant after 17 h of reaction. Fig.1 shows two-dimensional1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra of solutions of 1 mm [15N]cisplatin with rHA (A ) and fatty-acid-free HSA (B ) in a 1:1 molar ratio recorded after a 13-h incubation in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, with 100 mm KCl present at 310 K. The spectrum of [15N]cisplatin-rHA complex contains a cross-peak due tocis -[PtCl2(15NH3)2] (labeled as Pt) and eight cross-peaks attributable to cisplatin-albumin adducts (labeled as a, a′,b, c, d, d′, e, and f). The spectrum for the [15N]cisplatin-HSA reaction is very similar to that for rHA, and differs only in the higher intensity of the cross-peak from unreacted cisplatin, and in the negligible intensity of cross-peakd′ (Fig. 1 B ). 15N and 1H chemical shifts of observed cross-peaks are listed in TableI.Table I1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts of cross-peaks observed during reaction of cisplatin with human albuminPeak labelδ(15N)/δ(1H) for Pt-NH3Pt-NH3 trans toa−46.2 /4.50Sb−64.2 /4.24N/Clc−45.3 /4.21Sd−64.0 /4.40N/Cle−64.8 /4.33N/Clf−63.4 /4.33N/Cla′−44.5 /4.68Sd′−63.5 /4.71N/ClPt−69.1 /4.06ClSee Fig. 1 for peak labels. Open table in a new tab See Fig. 1 for peak labels. Fig. 2 A shows two-dimensional1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra at various times during the reaction of rHA with [15N]cisplatin (1 mm, 1:1), whereas Fig. 2 (B and C ) shows the time dependence over a 17 h period of volume integrals of the main cross-peaks in spectra of [15N]cisplatin-rHA complexes. Cross-peaks a, b, c,d, and e/f appeared in the first few hours of reaction, grew in intensity up to 6–9 h, and either reached a plateau (peak b) or slightly decreased in intensity (a,c, d, and e/f) at later times (Fig. 2,A and B ). In contrast, cross-peaks a′and d′, which are close to the H2O peak, were intense in the early stages, but had negligible intensities after 17 h of reaction (Fig. 2 A ). The increase in the intensities of the cross-peaks for bound cisplatin was accompanied by a large decrease in the signal intensity of unbound drug, which had all reacted after 17 h (Fig. 2 C ). However, the loss of intensity of signal for free cisplatin was not accompanied by a similar increase in total intensity of cross-peaks of protein-bound cisplatin, and there was an approximate 9-fold reduction in the general area intensity in the two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectrum of [15N]cisplatin-rHA complexes between 2 and 17 h of reaction (data not shown). The most intense cross-peaks for albumin-bound cisplatin are in the ammine trans to sulfur region at −46.2/4.5 ppm (peaka) and in the ammine trans to nitrogen/chloride region at −64.2/4.2 ppm (peak b) of the two-dimensional1H,15N HSQC NMR spectrum (Fig. 1). These peaks (a and b) seem to be a pair and therefore are likely to represent two NH3 ligands bound to the same platinum in one type of cisplatin-albumin adduct. They have similar relative intensities throughout the reaction (Fig. 2 B ) and exhibit the same behavior under the different experimental conditions described below. The pair of cross-peaks a′ at −44.5/4.68 ppm andd′ at −63.5/4.71 ppm, which quickly decreased in intensity after 9 h, probably represent {Pt(15NH3)2}2+bound to another site on albumin. In contrast, it is difficult to pair unambiguously other signals observed in the ammine trans to nitrogen/chloride region at −64.2/4.3 ppm (poorly resolved peaks e and f) and −64.0/4.4 ppm (d), and in the ammine trans to sulfur region at −45.3/4.2 ppm (c) (Figs. 1 and 2). During the first two hours of reaction of rHA with [15N]cisplatin (1 mm, 1:1), cross-peaksd and c were more intense than peakse/f, but, with time, peaks c and e/fbecame more intense than d (Fig. 2). After long term reaction (25–30 h) of 1 mm rHA with 0.5 or 1 mm [15N]cisplatin, only intense cross-peaksa, b, c, and e/f were observed in two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra, while the intensity of signal d was negligible (Fig. 3 A ). At these reaction times, cross-peak d was as intense as signals cand e/f only when reactions involved a molar excess of [15N]cisplatin:rHA, e.g. 1.5:1 (data not shown) and 2:1 (Fig. 3 B ). No signal from free cisplatin was observed in the two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectrum after 28 h of reaction of rHA (1 mm) with 2 mol eq of [15N]cisplatin (Fig. 3 B ). To aid pairing and assignment of the above cross-peaks, we studied the reaction of albumin-bound cisplatin with thiourea, at pH 7.4. Interaction of [15N]cisplatin with rHA (1 mm, 1:1) for 17 h at pH 7.4 resulted in the same signals in the two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectrum as were described for pH 6.4 (Fig.4 A ). Addition of thiourea (1 mm, 1 mol eq) to the above cisplatin-rHA solution significantly changed the two-dimensional1H,15N HSQC NMR spectrum recorded after a further 10 h incubation at 310 K (Fig. 4 B ). Thiourea induced the disappearance of cross-peaks c, d, and e/f and led to the appearance of three new signals in the ammine trans to nitrogen/chloride region at −66.3/4.33 ppm (labeled as th 1), −66.3/4.42 ppm (th 2) and −66.0/4.52 ppm (th 3). Incubation of thiourea with [15N]cisplatin alone for 5 h in 10 mmphosphate buffer, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4, gave rise to cross-peaks with 195Pt satellites in the amminetrans to nitrogen/chloride region (th 4 at −67.6/4.18 ppm) and in the amminetrans to sulfur region (th 5 at −45.0/4.10 ppm, th 6 at −43.5/4.01 ppm, andth 7 at −44.5/3.95 ppm) (Fig.4 C ). The reaction of rHA with [15N]cisplatin (1 mm, 1:1) was also studied in 10 mm phosphate buffer pH 6.4 without added chloride. In the early stages of this reaction, the two-dimensional 1H,15N"

The indeterminate1 gene (id1) controls the transition to flowering in maize. We show by cloning the id1 gene that it encodes a protein with zinc finger motifs, suggesting that the id1 gene product functions as a transcriptional regulator of the floral transition. id1 mRNA expression studies and analyses of transposon-induced chimeric plants indicate that id1 acts non-cell-autonomously to regulate the production of a transmissible signal in the leaf that elicits the transformation of the shoot apex to reproductive development. These results provide molecular and genetic data consistent with the florigen hypothesis derived from classical plant physiology studies."

The 2.3 A structure of the human Cdc25A catalytic domain reveals a small alpha/beta domain with a fold unlike previously described phosphatase structures but identical to rhodanese, a sulfur-transfer protein. Only the active-site loop, containing the Cys-(X)5-Arg motif, shows similarity to the tyrosine phosphatases. In some crystals, the catalytic Cys-430 forms a disulfide bond with the invariant Cys-384, suggesting that Cdc25 may be self-inhibited during oxidative stress. Asp-383, previously proposed to be the general acid, instead serves a structural role, forming a conserved buried salt-bridge. We propose that Glu-431 may act as a general acid. Structure-based alignments suggest that the noncatalytic domain of the MAP kinase phosphatases will share this topology, as will ACR2, a eukaryotic arsenical resistance protein."

Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 603-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSH is a predominant cellular antioxidant and as such serves critical functions in the maintenance of cellular redox balance, provides protection against reactive oxygen species, and is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics either through direct conjugation with reactive species or through enzymatic reactions catalyzed by glutathione S -transferases (3Hayes J.D.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In vivo the functional GCS holoenzyme exists as a heterodimer consisting of catalytic (heavy, M r = 73,000) and regulatory (light, M r = 27,700) subunits which can be dissociated under nondenaturing conditions (15Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies by Meister (14Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that all the catalytic activity and the site of GSH feedback inhibition reside with the heavy subunit. However, the kinetic properties of the heavy subunit under physiological conditions are greatly influenced by association with the light subunit, presumably mediated by a redox-sensitive disulfide bond between the two subunits (16Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of the regulatory subunit on the kinetic properties of the catalytic subunit is so profound that Huang et al. (16Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that the monomeric catalytic subunit would be nonfunctional at the substrate (glutamate) and inhibitor (GSH) concentrations typically existing in cells.

Holtzclaw W.D. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Regulation of several Phase II enzymes in response to a wide variety of inducing agents, including several of those which induce GCS expression, is mediated, at least in part, by the presence of electrophile responsive elements (EpRE) 2In this report we use the designation EpRE to indicate elements matching the consensus sequence 5′-(A/G)TGACNNNGCA-3′.

Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that basal and β-NF-inducible expression of the GCSh gene is mediated by a consensus EpRE sequence located in the distal portion of the promoter of the GCS heavy subunit gene (19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We have also identified numerous potential regulatory elements, including a putative EpRE in the 5′-flanking sequence of the GCSl gene, suggesting the possibility that the expression of the regulatory subunit gene may similarly be mediated by one or more EpRE or EpRE-like sequences. We have also demonstrated that exposure of HepG2 cells to β-NF, a planar aromatic compound capable of inducing gene expression via EpREs, results in increased expression of the GCSl gene, as well as the GCSh subunit gene (19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Although this observation is consistent with the hypothesis, the involvement of any specific cis- acting elements in constitutive and/or induced expression of the GCSl gene has not been established. Therefore, in this study we utilized a deletion mutagenesis strategy to identify the regulatory elements required for β-NF inducible expression of the GCSl gene. Using a series of progressive promoter deletion/reporter transgenes transfected into HepG2 cells, we have been able to discern that the EpRE sequence identified in the GCSl promoter is required for maximal induction in response to β-NF and that a neighboring AP-1 site located 33 bp upstream of the EpRE mediates constitutive expression of the gene and is also capable of directing increased expression following β-NF exposure should the core EpRE sequence be mutated. Two clones containing genomic sequence corresponding to the light subunit of human GCS and its 5′-flanking region were isolated from a human foreskin fibroblast P1 library by Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) as described previously (29Mulcahy R.T. Gipp J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A Pst I fragment containing 63 nucleotides of GCSl coding sequence and approximately 6-kb of 5′-flanking sequence was subcloned into pSKII-Bluescript (CLONTECH) and subsequently sequenced. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and synthetic oligonucleotide (20-mers) primers corresponding to internal sequences. The nucleotide sequence was verified by multiple bidirectional sequencing reactions. Expression vector constructs were created by cloning restriction fragments isolated from the 5′-flanking sequence of the GCSl gene into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) for determination of the promoter activity or by introducing GCSl DNA fragments or synthetic oligonucleotides into pT81 (ATCC 37584) for determination of enhancer activity. A 6.0-kb genomic DNA fragment was isolated from 5′-flanking region of GCSlby Xho I restriction digestion and cloned into theXho I site of pGL3-Basic creating the recombinant plasmid −6000/GCSl5′-luc . This plasmid was subjected to digestion with additional restriction enzymes to generate a series of deletion mutants as detailed in Fig. 2. A series of promoter/reporter transgenes containing mutations in regions of interest within the GCSl promoter (Fig. 4 A ) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. The sequence of the final constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.Figure 4Effect of mono- and bi-elemental mutations in −1927/GCSl on constitutive and β-NF induced expression.

In order to rule out any confounding influences of this potential enhancer element several of the deletion mutants (−1927, −1633, −712, −344, and −208) were cloned into a pGL3-Basic backbone in which the AP-1 site had been deleted. 3K.

For short DNA fragments of interest complementary synthetic oligonucleotides of the proper sequence were annealed, phosphorylated, and cloned into the pT81 vector. Oligonucleotides dissolved in 1 × Sequenase reaction buffer were annealed by heating to 95 °C, cooled slowly to 35 °C, and desalted by using Bio-Spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). These double-stranded fragments were then phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in water for ligation into the pT81 vector. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (complete medium). Cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids using a standard calcium phosphate-glycerol shock procedure. HepG2 cells were plated at 4 × 105/35-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. Two to four hours later the cells were transfected by the addition of appropriate DNA expression vectors. Equimolar amounts of plasmid DNA were used to compensate for variations in plasmid size. To correct for transfection efficiency, 1.5 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMVβ (30MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 172365Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) containing the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter/enhancer was co-transfected with each recombinant plasmid. Four hours after addition of DNA, cells were shocked by the addition of media containing 10% glycerol for 3 min at room temperature and then maintained at 37 °C for an additional 24 h in complete medium. At the conclusion of this incubation period, the medium was once again replaced with the complete medium containing Me2SO (0.1%) or 10 μmβ-NF (Sigma) dissolved at 1000 × in Me2SO. Sixteen hours later cells were harvested and prepared for determination of luciferase, β-galactosidase activity, and protein content. For cell harvest, plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Mg2+- and Ca2+-free) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in 250 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cells were then scraped from the plates and the resulting lysates spun at the top speed in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and stored on ice pending assay. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified as described by Rosenthal (31Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Briefly, this assay monitors cleavage ofo -nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and yields β-galactosidase units as (OD420 × 380)/t , where t = time in minutes at 37 °C and 380 converts OD420 to micromoles ofo -nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. To assay for luciferase activity, 5 μl of cell lysate was added to the reaction buffer (14 mm MgCl, 14 mmglycylglycine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 18 mg/ml ATP, pH 7.8), vortexed, and placed in an Analytical Luminescence Laboratory luminometer (400 μl total volume). Following injection of 100 μl of luciferin (4 mg/ml in 10 mm Na2CO3, pH 6.0) luminescence was recorded as relative light units. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency on the basis of β-galactosidase activity and protein content of the lysate yielding a final value of (relative light units/β-galactosidase units)/μg of protein. Protein content was determined using the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Differences between experimental groups were compared by analysis of variance using Fisher's protected least significant difference. Two genomic clones containing the full-length human GCSl gene were obtained by polymerase chain reaction screening of a human foreskin fibroblast P1 genomic library (Genesystem, Inc.) using a pair of polymerase chain reaction primers spanning a 300-bp region of the 3′-end of the GCSlcDNA. A 6-kb Pst I fragment from one clone was identified by in-gel hybridization using three oligonucleotide probes complimentary to sequences in the 5′-region of the GCSlcDNA, isolated from agarose gels, and subcloned into pSKII-Bluescript. Sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contained 316 bp corresponding to the 5′-end of the GCSlcDNA and ∼5.7-kb of 5′-flanking sequence. 3.3-kb of the 3′-half of the fragment was sequenced (Fig. 1). The 5′-flanking region of the GCS light subunit gene shares several characteristics typical of many “housekeeping” genes, including a large proportion of GC residues and several putative Sp-1 binding sites. Multiple consensus AP-1, as well as several AP-1-like, sites were also identified. No nuclear factor-κB-binding sites and no core sequence corresponding to the AhRE were identified. Sequence analysis did, however, identify a core EpRE motif at −290 to −301. The 5′-flanking sequence of the GCS light subunit gene also contains a consensus metal responsive element, which directs induction of some genes, such as metallothionein-1, in response to exposure to heavy metals and H2O2. Since the gene utilizes multiple start sites which vary among cell lines examined and which are not associated with consensus TATA sequences, we have adopted a numbering convention which assigns the number +1 to the first base of the translation start codon. In previous experiments, we have demonstrated that the steady-state mRNA levels for both the GCSh and GCSl genes are increased in HepG2 cells after treatment with as little as 10 μm β-NF (19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), reaching peak levels at approximately 12 h (about 3-fold increase compared with the untreated cells) after the addition of β-NF. To localize regions of the GCSl 5′-flanking region controlling basal and β-NF inducible expression of the GCSl gene, a series of deletion mutant/luciferase reporter fusion genes were generated by cloning various length restriction fragments derived from the GCSl clone into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Fig. 2). These constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells and luciferase activity was determined in the presence and absence of 10 μm β-NF. In terms of basal activity, luciferase expression in cells transfected with the −208/GCSl5′-luc construct was extremely low; not significantly (p > 0.1) greater than that detected in HepG2 cells transfected with the pGL3-Basic vector (Fig. 2). Cells transfected with the next larger construct, −344/GCSl5′-luc , expressed a 12-fold higher basal luciferase expression than the −208/GCSl5′-luc transfectants, suggesting the presence of cis- regulatory element(s) between −208 and −344 that positively influence constitutive expression of the GCSl gene. Basal luciferase expression was maximal in cells transfected with the −712/GCSl5′-luc vector. Inclusion of an additional 5′ sequence from −712 to −6000 did not significantly increase constitutive luciferase expression further (data from −1927 to −6000 not shown). These data suggest that the major sequences regulating constitutive expression of the GCSlgene are localized within the first 712 bp upstream of the translation start codon. They further suggest that there are at least two elements, or a set of elements, influencing basal expression, one contained in the −344:−208 fragment and another in the −712:−344 fragment. Exposure to β-NF did not result in increased luciferase expression in HepG2 cells transfected with the −208/GCSl5′-luc fusion gene. However, luciferase expression was induced approximately 3-fold over the basal level when −344/GCSl5′-luc transfectants were incubated with 10 μm β-NF. The magnitude of β-NF induction was not further increased by the inclusion of sequences upstream of the −344 position (Fig. 2, data for fragments >−1927 not shown). Thus, regulatory element(s) controlling β-NF-induced expression are located between nucleotides −208 and −344. Analysis of the sequence between −208 and −344 of the GCSl promoter revealed the presence of a consensus (5′-(A/G)TGACNNGCA-3′) EpRE core sequence between −290 and −301. Since EpREs have been demonstrated to enhance constitutive and β-NF-induced expression of Phase II enzymes and we previously demonstrated that a distal EpRE was responsible for these activities in the case of the human GCSh subunit gene (19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we considered this element a candidate enhancer of GCSl gene expression. In order to determine whether this potential responsive element contributed to basal and β-NF induced expression of the GCSl gene, an oligonucleotide (GCSl EpRE) spanning nucleotides −308 to −281 of the GCSl promoter was synthesized and subcloned into the Sac I site of pT81, a luciferase reporter vector in which luciferase expression is under control of the herpes simplex I thymidine kinase (tk ) minimal promoter. A second oligonucleotide containing the functional EpRE sequence (31Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) from the human NQO1 gene (NQO1hARE) was subcloned into the same vector and used as a positive control. When transfected into HepG2 cells, vectors containing the GCSl EpRE sequence in either orientation directed a significant increase in basal luciferase activity relative to that detected in cells transfected with pT81. The magnitude of the increase was comparable to that observed in HepG2 cells transfected with the NQO1hARE-luc transgene (12–15-fold higher than pT81 alone). β-NF treatment of HepG2 cells transfected with these constructs resulted in a 2.5-fold induction of luciferase activity. The pT81 vector alone did not respond to β-NF (Fig. 3). Thus, the GCSl EpRE oligo functioned like other EpREs, directing both increased basal and inducible expression of the reporter gene in response to β-NF treatment. To confirm that this EpRE motif influences response to β-NF, as well as basal expression of the gene, an oligonucleotide (GCSlmEpRE) containing a single mutation in the EpRE core sequence (5′-ATGACNNNGCA-3′ to 5′-AGGACNNNGCA-3′) was synthesized and cloned into the pT81 vector. As established by other investigators, preservation of the T in this position is essential for both EpRE-regulated basal and β-NF-induced expression (25Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, this point mutation completely eliminated both the increased basal expression and inducibility by β-NF in cells transfected with vectors harboring the mutated sequence. The results of these enhancer studies were therefore consistent with the hypothesized involvement of the EpRE core motif in the basal and β-NF induced expression of the GCSl gene. In an attempt to confirm that the GCSl EpRE mediates GCSl gene expression in vivo , the same GCSl EpRE point mutation described above was introduced into −1927/GCSl5′-luc by site-directed mutagenesis, generating the mutant m1 (Fig.4 A ). The transgenes containing the wild-type (wt) and mutated genomic 5′-flanking sequences were then transfected into HepG2 cells and their effects on basal and β-NF-induced expression of the reporter gene were compared. The introduction of the EpRE core-disrupting mutation into the genomic sequence failed to significantly (p < 0.05) alter constitutive expression in comparison to that observed in HepG2 cells transfected with the transgene containing the wild-type sequence (Fig.4 B ). More importantly, luciferase expression in cells transfected with the mutant transgene was still significantly (p = 0.04) induced following incubation with 10 μm β-NF, although the level of expression was only ∼60% of that detected in β-NF-treated cells transfected with the wild-type −1927/GCSl 5′ sequence. Hence,cis -acting elements within the −344:−208 region of the gene, other than the core EpRE, apparently contribute to β-NF inducibility. The GCSl EpRE sequence includes an embedded core AP-1 sequence (Fig. 4 A ) which was also mutated by the T to G mutation introduced to generate the m1 mutant"

It is evident that sterol 27-hydroxylase is more important for bile acid synthesis in mice than in humans. The results do not support the contention that 27-hydroxylated steroids are critical for maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis or levels of vitamin D metabolites in the circulation. Sterol 27-hydroxylase is a mitochondrial species of cytochrome P-450 with a broad tissue and organ distribution and with a broad substrate specificity (for a review, see Ref. 1Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is important for bile acid biosynthesis but has also been ascribed a role in connection with cholesterol removal from extrahepatic tissues, in regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, and in metabolism of vitamin D. Sterol 27-hydroxylase is responsible for the first step in the degradation of the steroid side chain in connection with bile acid biosynthesis in the liver. In the major pathway to bile acids in mammalian liver, 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol is the first and rate-limiting step, and 27-hydroxylation occurs at a later stage with a 7α-hydroxylated intermediate as substrate. In an alternative pathway, 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is the first step in the sequence, followed by a 7α-hydroxylation catalyzed by a specific oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (1Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a recently discovered minor pathway, extrahepatic sterol 27-hydroxylase converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol or 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (2Björkhem I. Andersson O. Diczflusy U.

Einarsson K. Sjövall J. Björkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The latter compounds are transported to the liver and converted into bile acids. Sterol 27-hydroxylase has also 25-hydroxylase activity toward vitamin D (4Ohyama Y. Masumoto O. Usui E. Okuda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and 1α-hydroxylase activity toward 25-hydroxyvitamin D (5Axén E. Postlind H. Sjöberg H. Wikvall K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10014-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since there is also a microsomal cytochrome P-450 that catalyzes 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D (6Björkhem I. Hansson R. Holmberg I. Wikvall K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the relative importance of the sterol 27-hydroxylase is not known. 27-Hydroxycholesterol, formed from cholesterol by the sterol 27-hydroxylase, is a potent down-regulator of cholesterol synthesis in cultured cells (for reviews see Refs. 7Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 8Lund E. Björkhem I. Acc. Chem. Res. 1995; 28: 241-249Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the basis of this, and on the basis of studies with sterol 27-hydroxylase inhibitors, sterol 27-hydroxylase has been suggested to have a regulatory role in cholesterol homeostasis. The relative importance of this mechanism is controversial, however. Based on studies with cholesterol specifically deuterium-labeled in the 27-position, which retards the rate of 27-hydroxylation, we showed that sterol 27-hydroxylase activity is of little or no direct importance for cholesterol-induced suppression of cholesterol synthesis in mouse liver (9Lund E. Breuer O. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25092-25097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well documented that patients with the rare disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) 1The abbreviations used are: CTX, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA. have a deficiency of sterol 27-hydroxylase (for a review, see Ref. 10Björkhem I.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 663-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of the enzymatic defect, patients with CTX have a reduced synthesis of bile acids, in particular chenodeoxycholic acid (10Björkhem I. Muri-Boberg K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valee D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 2073-2100Google Scholar). Cholic acid is formed in these patients by a pathway involving 25-hydroxylated bile alcohols as intermediates. Under normal conditions this alternative pathway is of little or no importance, both in rats and man (21Duane W.E. Björkhem I. Hamilton J.N. Mueller S.M. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Duane W.E. Pooler P.A. Hamilton J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Due to the reduced formation of bile acids, the negative feedback of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is reduced, resulting in an up-regulation of this enzyme. As a consequence, gram amounts of bile alcohols are formed and excreted in bile and feces. Another consequence of the disease is excess formation and accumulation of cholestanol (10Björkhem I. Muri-Boberg K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valee D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 2073-2100Google Scholar). Most of this formation seems to be secondary to the accumulation of an intermediate in bile acid biosynthesis, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. This steroid can be converted into cholestanol by hepatic enzymes. Patients with CTX have normal cholesterol levels in the circulation (17Leitersdorf E. Safadi R. Meiner V. Reshef A. Bjorkhem I. Friedlander Y. Morkos S. Berginer V.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 907-915PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this they develop xanthomas and premature atherosclerosis. The possibility has been discussed that this may be due to the reduced elimination of cholesterol from macrophages by the sterol 27-hydroxylase (1Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Björkhem I. Andersson O. Diczflusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Disturbances in vitamin D metabolism have been described in a few cases of CTX (23Berginer V.M. Salen G. Shefer S. Neurol. Clin. 1989; 7: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this does not seem to be a general finding. Studies on patients with CTX have provided important information about the role of the sterol 27-hydroxylase in man. The importance of this enzyme for bile acid formation, cholesterol homeostasis, and vitamin D metabolism may, however, be different in different species. A lack of an enzyme may activate compensatory mechanisms that may be different in different species. In order to evaluate further the role of the sterol 27-hydroxylase in mammals, we have produced and characterized mice deficient of the enzyme. Oligonucleotides complementary to the putative exon 3 of the rat cyp27 were prepared (24Usui E. Noshiro M. Okuda K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Su P. Rennert H. Shayiq R.M. Yamamoto R. Zheng Y.M. Addya S. Strauss III, J.F. Avadhani N.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides e (5′-AGGACAGCAGTGGTACCATCTGCG-3′) and f (5′-CTTCCAAGGCAAGGTGGTAAAGAAGA-3′) were used to amplify 197 bp containing the putative mouse exon 3 (Fig. 1). The PCR product was used to probe a mouse 129SV Genomic Library (Lambda Fix2, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A positive clone designated 24(1), which includes 13.1-kb mouse cyp27 gene sequences, was isolated. A targeting construct was made to replace a 71-bp Bam HI fragment in exon 8 with a neo sequence (see Ref. 27Beck E. Ludwig G. Auerswald E.A. Riess B. Schaller H. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, Fig. 1). To do so, a 7-kbBam HI fragment, which includes sequences homologous to the human CYP27 exons 2–8, was subcloned into a uniqueBam HI site of the pPNT plasmid and designated pPNT-7. A 1.1-kb Bam HI/Not I fragment, which includes the 3′ end of the putative exon 8, exon 9, and the 3′-untranslated sequences, was purified from clone 24(1), subcloned into pSC301 plasmid, and designated pSC301-S. The Bam HI/Sal I 1.1-kb band of pSC301-S was then subcloned into the pPNT-7 plasmid that was previously digested by Xho I/Not I to make pCYP27T1. In the targeting construct the deletion of a 71-bp fragment from the putative mouse cyp27 exon 8 is located upstream to the putative heme-binding site, highly conserved in human (28Cali J.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7774-7778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit (29Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and crucial for the activity of P-450 enzymes (30Gonzales F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 243-288Google Scholar). For verification, the junctions between the neo and thecyp27 sequences were sequenced and compared with the published cyp27 rat cDNA (24Usui E. Noshiro M. Okuda K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The targeting plasmid was linearized by cleavage with Not I. ES cell cultures and electroporations were performed as described (31Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Ten to twelve days after electroporation, colonies resistant to 200 μg/ml G418 and to 2 μmganciclovir (Syntex, Palo Alto, CA) were picked and passaged in clonal fashion. To screen the cells with correct targeting, a probe that identifies the 1.1-kb short arm was prepared by PCR using oligonucleotide a (5′-TGGTTCCCACAAACTCCCGGATCAT-3′), which is complementary to the putative rat 5′ exon 7 sequences, and oligonucleotide T3, which is complementary to the vector short arm sequence. Southern blot analysis resulted in identification of a 9- and a 12-kb Xba I fragment for the targeted and for the non-targeted alleles, respectively. To verify the planned disruption of the gene, a probe from the putative mouse exon 3 was prepared and used in Southern blotting to identify a 5- and a 16-kb Xba I fragment from the targeted and non-targeted alleles, respectively (Fig.2 a ). Approximately 10 ES cells were injected into the blastocyte cavity of C57BL/6J embryos. Surviving blastocytes were transferred to the uteri of pseudo-pregnant CD-1 females. An average of two to three transfers were made per cell line. Chimeric animals were further bred to C57BL/6J animals to determine their germ line competency. F1 animals heterozygote for the cyp27 disruption were crossed to produce mice homozygote to the knock-outcyp27 . To genotype the F2 siblings, a double PCR reaction was performed. PCR was carried out using oligonucleotide a (5′-TGGTTCCCACAAACTCCCGGATCAT-3′) mapped to the 5′ end of the putative exon 7, oligonucleotide b (5′-CCATAGCCAAAGGGCACAGAGCCAA-3′) mapped to the 3′ end of the putative exon 8, and oligonucleotide c (5′- ATCGCATCGAGCGAGCACGTACT-3′) complementary to neo sequences (Fig. 1). The PCR products of the targeted allele and the normal gene were 1- and 0.3-kb, respectively. To avoid the out competition of the 1-kb by the 0.3-kb PCR product, a triple amount of oligonucleotide a was used. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 75 °C for 1 min. To avoid PCR artifacts in genotyping, two additional, independent, reactions were carried out to identify the targeted allele and the normal allele. The oligonucleotides used for these reactions were c and d (5′-CCACCATGATATTCGGCAAGCAGG-3′, and a and b, respectively) (Fig. 3). For visualization of cyp27 mRNA the following protocol was used. RNA was extracted from mice livers using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), quantified by spectrophotometry and visualized following electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel stained by ethidium bromide. Twenty μg of total RNA were loaded on a 1.6% agarose gel, electrophoresed, and blotted as described (32McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized using a mousecyp27 exon 3 or a Syrian Hamster HMG-CoA reductase cDNA probe labeled by nick translation (Life Technologies, Inc.). For visualization and quantification of cyp7 mRNA the following protocol was used. Total cellular RNA was isolated with the UltraspecTM RNA Isolation System (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Electrophoresis of total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA in agarose gels containing formaldehyde and blotting of the separated RNA onto nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) was carried out by standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the hybridization, cDNA probes for the rat cyp7 and human actin were used, labeled with 32P with the use of Pharmacia Oligolabeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Hybridization was according to Gehring et al. (34Gehring M. Shiels B.R. Northemann W. de Bruijn M.H.L. Kan C.C. Chain A.C. Noonan D.J. Fey C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 446-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were exposed to Fuji New x-ray films at −70 °C. Semi-quantitative analysis of the relative amount of mRNA was estimated by densitometry. Livers were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 20 mmol of Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mmol of EDTA, and 0.25m sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was precipitated at 5000 × g for 10 min and the mitochondrial fraction resuspended in the lysis buffer. The proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Munchen, Germany). A total of 75 μg of protein was loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 12 h at 15 mA. Electroblotting to cellulose nitrate (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) was carried out overnight at 20 V. Blocking of the membrane was carried out in a buffer containing 1.34 mNaCl, 0.03 m KCl, and 0.25 m Tris (TBS buffer) for 5 h at 4 °C. Incubation with primary polyclonal antibody directed against the mouse sterol 27-hydroxylase, extracted from rabbit serum (a gift from Dr. David W. Russell), was diluted 1/1000 in the blocking buffer (TBS) that also contained 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. The filter was washed four times for 15 min each in a TBS buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, GmbH). Incubation with 1/2000 secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody from donkey (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) was carried-out for 2 h at room temperature. Development was carried out using the Amersham ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). The film was exposed for 3 s and developed. Animals were maintained at the Hadassah-Hebrew University animal facility in a specific pathogen-free unit. Breeding pairs were set up to provide normal heterozygote and homozygote siblings of the targeted cyp27 −/−mice. Weaning was carried out at the age of 3 weeks. The animals were genotyped and grouped. Each group consisted of four to six male littermates. At the end of the experiment the animals were sacrificed, and their plasma and bile were collected and gross pathology and histology were performed. For histological processing the tissue specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated, and paraffin-embedded. Sections 2- to 3-μm thick were cut with a microtome (Leica RM2155, Germany). The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated before hematoxylin/eosin and van Gieson's elastica stainings and periodic acid-Schiff reaction for examination in a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Van Gieson's elastica was used for combined staining of elastic substrates and connective tissue. After rehydration, the sections were stained for 15 min in 0.5% resorcine/fuchsin solution in 70% ethanol. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed in distilled water, differentiated in 96% ethanol, and transferred to Weigert's iron-hematoxylin (nuclear staining) for 10 min. The sections were rinsed in distilled water, differentiated in HCl/ethanol, and rinsed in tap water for 30 min. In a third step the sections were stained in a picric acid/thiazine red mixture (10:0.2) for 10 min, rinsed in distilled water containing picric acid, and dehydrated and coverslipped by an automated coverslipper (Sakura). Periodic acid-Schiff reaction was used to demonstrate poly- and mucopolysaccharides and muco- and glycoproteins. After rehydration the sections were put into 0.5% periodic acid for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed in distilled water, and transferred to fuchsin/sulfurous acid (15 min at room temperature). The sections were washed three times in 2− water, tap water (5 min), counterstained with hemalaun, rinsed in tap water, dehydrated, and coverslipped as described above. Heart and aorta were processed separately for lipid staining with Sudan III. The heart was taken out, fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h, incubated at 37 °C in 5% gelatin for 2.5 h, in 10% gelatin for 2.5 h and in 20% gelatin overnight. The hearts were put into a gelatin block and frozen in isopentane (−35 °C) for further processing in a cryostat (Leica, Frigocut). In brief, the hearts were cut in 10-μm thickness until the 3-valve cusps at the junction of the aorta to the heart and an aorta that was round in shape was seen. Several sections were taken at this level, stained with Sudan III, and counterstained with hemalaun. The sections were examined under a light microscope. The whole aorta was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, rinsed in tap water, cut open, blocked with needles, and stained with Sudan III. The aortas were examined for atherosclerotic plaques. A total of six animals were examined by Pathology Associates Int. (Frederick, MD, project no. 3116-101 and 97-111-09), and 18 mice were analyzed at the Max-Delbrück-Center (Berlin, Germany). Vitamin A and vitamin E levels were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (35Catagnani G.L. Bieri J.G. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was analyzed by a radioimmunoassay (36Belsey R. Clark M.B. Bernat M. Glowacki J. Holick M. DeLuca H.F. Potts J.T. Am. J. Med. 1974; 57: 50-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using a kit from Nichols Institute Diagnostics. The accuracy of this method has been ascertained by a method based on isotope dilution-mass spectrometry (37Lindbäck B. Berlin T. Björkhem I. Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 1226-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D was analyzed with a radioreceptor method (38Hollis B.W. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 2060-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) using a kit from Incstar (Incstar Corp., Stillwater, MN). Cholesterol and triglycerides in serum were analyzed with standard enzymatic photometric methods with use of commercial kits (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Cholesterol in feces was analyzed by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry with2H6-labeled cholesterol as internal standard (39Björkhem I. Blomstrand R. Svensson L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1974; 54: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cholesterol levels in tissue extract were analyzed by the same method. The tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized mechanically, and extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). In both cases, a hydrolysis step was included, and thus the method detects both free and esterified cholesterol. Oxysterols (7α-hydroxycholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol in serum and in various organs) were analyzed by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry with use of deuterium-labeled internal standards as described previously (40Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The procedure includes a saponification step and thus the method includes both free and esterified steroid. The interassay variation in this assay is below 5% (40Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Hydrolyzed bile acids in bile and in feces were analyzed by combined gas chromatography under the conditions described previously (41Björkhem I. Falk O. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1983; 43: 163-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Hewlett-Packard 5970 mass specific detection instrument equipped with a 0.33-μm phase HP-ultra 1 column. All samples were hydrolyzed prior to extraction, methylated with diazomethane, and trimethylsialylated prior to analysis (41Björkhem I. Falk O. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1983; 43: 163-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by the repetitive scanning method for identification of all bile acids present in the samples (cf . Fig. 5). In addition cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid were quantitated by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry with use of deuterium-labeled internal standards and selected ion monitoring as described previously (41Björkhem I. Falk O. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1983; 43: 163-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other bile acids were quantitated from the chromatogram (total ion current) obtained in the analysis of material to which no internal deuterated standards had been added (Fig. 5). The peak area of the trihydroxy bile acids was compared with the peak area of cholic acid. The amount of cholic acid had been quantitated by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry in a separate analysis as described above. The peak area of the dihydroxy bile acids was compared with the peak area of deoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid had been quantitated by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry in a separate experiment. In a few cases the gas chromatographic peak was found to contain contaminating interfering compounds (this was the case in the assay of the small amounts of some muricholic acid isomers in the material from thecyp27 −/− mice). In these cases a specific ion at m/z 195, specific for 6-hydroxylated bile acids, was used for assay. Unhydrolyzed bile acids in bile and urine were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry using a Quattro triple quadropol mass spectrometer (Fig. 4). The general conditions used for pretreatment and analysis were similar to those used for analysis of bile acids by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (42Egestad B. Pettersson P. Skrede S. Sjövall J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1985; 45: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) The samples (a few μl of bile and 40–300 μl of urine) were diluted with water to a 1-ml volume and applied to Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters, Milford, MA). The columns were washed with water (5–10 ml) and eluted with methanol (2 ml). After evaporation of the solvent, the samples were dissolved in acetonitrile/distilled water (1:1, v:v). Of this solution 10 μl was introduced into the mass spectrometer via loop injection with acetonitrile/water as mobile phase. This assay was performed with isotope dilution-mass spectrometry and utilization of deuterium labeled lathosterol as internal standard as described previously (43Lund E. Sisfontes L. Reihner E. Björkhem I. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1989; 49: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 7β-3H-labeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol with a specific radioactivity of 70 × 106 cpm/mg was synthesized as described previously (44Danielsson H. Einarsson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steroid, about 9 × 106 cpm, was dissolved in 0.2 ml of ethanol, and this solution was added to 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl (w/v) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v). The solution was injected intraperitoneally in one cyp27 +/+ and onecyp27 −/− mouse. Feces was collected during three 24-h periods after this injection. The different fecal portions were refluxed with ethanol for 24 h. The ethanol was evaporated, and the material was hydrolyzed with KOH in aqueous ethanol (41Björkhem I. Falk O. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1983; 43: 163-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolyzed alkaline material was diluted with water and extracted three times with hexane. After acidification with diluted HCl, the water phase was extracted three times with diethyl ether. Radioactivity was measured in aliquots of the hexane phase containing neutral steroids and of the ether phase containing bile acids. Southern blot analysis on genomic DNA extracted from SV129 female mice resulted in a partial restriction map of the mousecyp27 and revealed the presence of a single copy gene (data not shown). We disrupted the cyp27 gene by inserting theneo gene and deleting 71-bp Bam HI fragment from"
https://openalex.org/W1978679812,"Although it is now clearly established that a number of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism are up-regulated by high glucose concentrations in both liver and adipose tissue, the signaling pathway arising from glucose to the transcriptional machinery is still poorly understood. We have analyzed the regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression by glucose in cultured rat hepatocytes. Glucose (25 mm) induces an activation of the transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene, and this effect is markedly reduced by incubation of the cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. A similar reduction in glucose-activated fatty acid synthase gene expression is obtained by incubation with 5-amino-imidazolecarboxamide riboside, a cell-permeable activator of the AMP-activated protein kinase. Taken together, these results indicate that the glucose-induced expression of the fatty acid synthase gene involves a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism and suggest that the AMP-activated protein kinase plays an important role in this process.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In previous papers, we have proposed that glucose-6-phosphate could be the signal metabolite for the glucose-induced FAS transcription (3Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.P. Perdereau D. Girard J.

Chen R. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5321-5324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) who proposed that the signal metabolite was xylulose-5-phosphate. However, whatever the metabolite, the link between the glucose signal and the activation of gene transcription remains unknown. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes are one of the major mechanisms involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism both at the cellular and molecular levels in eukaryotic cells. It is now well established that many transcription factors have their activity regulated by phosphorylation through a modification of their DNA binding activity, their transactivating capacity, or their subcellular localization (8Jackson S.P. Trends Cell. Biol. 1992; 2: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In cultured hepatocytes, it has been shown that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A led to the inhibition of glucose stimulation of S14 gene transcription (9Sudo Y. Mariash C.N. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further experiments with calyculin, a much more potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 than okadaic acid, suggest that protein phosphatase 2A may play the major role in the glucose effect. Finally, since the calcium ionophore A23187, an activator of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) inhibited the glucose effect, it was concluded that CaM kinase and protein phosphatase 2A were implicated in the glucose regulation of S14 gene transcription (9Sudo Y. Mariash C.N. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is involved in the regulation by glucose of FAS gene expression in cultured hepatocytes. It must be pointed out that AMPK is the mammalian equivalent of SNF1, a protein kinase complex essential for glucose-regulated gene expression in yeast through the modulation of the transcriptional activity of nuclear factors. Animal studies were conducted according to the French Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Female Wistar rats (200–300 g body weight) from Iffa-Credo, (L'Arbresle, France) were used. They were housed in plastic cages at a constant temperature (22 °C) with light from 0700 h to 1900 h for at least one week before the experiments. Hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase method (10Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell. Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed by the Trypan Blue exclusion test and was always higher than 85%. Hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 8 × 106cells/dish in 100-mm Petri dishes in medium M199 with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2% (v/v) Ultroser G (IBF, Villeneuve la Garenne, France), 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), 1 nm insulin (Actrapid, Novo-Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), 100 nmtriiodothyronine (T3) (Sigma). After cell attachment (4 h), the hepatocytes were cultured for 16–18 h in the presence of 5 mm glucose in a medium similar to the seeding medium but free of Ultroser and albumin and containing 100 nm insulin. The presence of dexamethasone, T3, and insulin in the culture medium ensures a maximal activity of glucokinase, necessary for a full glucose effect on FAS gene expression (11Spence J.T. Pitot H.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 103: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Narkewicz M.R. Ferré P. Iynedjian P.B. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After 16–18 h, the culture medium was removed and hepatocytes were then cultured for 1, 3, or 6 h in the presence of either 5 or 25 mmglucose, hormones, and various compounds including 10–100 nm okadaic acid (Sigma), 50 μm H7 (protein kinase A and C inhibitor) (Sigma), 1 μm A23187 (activator of CaM kinases) (Sigma), 1 μm KN62 (inhibitor of CaM kinase II) (Sigma), 50–500 μm5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl (AICAR) (Sigma) (activator of AMPK). Cells were scrapped into 0.5 ml of 6% (v/v) ice-cold HClO4 in less than 5 s after removing the culture medium. The concentrations of metabolites including glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, AMP, ADP, and ATP were assayed enzymatically as described previously (13Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Williamson D.H. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were directly lyzed in the culture medium by adding 1.5 ml of buffer A (final concentrations of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) + 1% Triton X-100. The cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was removed, adjusted to 10% with PEG 6000 (Appligene, Illkirch, France), and kept on ice for 20 min. Following further centrifugation (7000 × g , 15 min), the pellet of proteins was resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A. Aliquots (5 μl) were used to assay the AMPK activity by the SAMS peptide phosphorylation assay in the presence of saturating concentrations of 5′-AMP (200 μm) as described previously (14Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). AMPK was partially purified from rat liver up to and including the DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange step as described previously (15Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). AMPK was further purified by immunoprecipitation using antibodies raised against the AMPKβ1 subunit bound to protein A-Sepharose. The immune complex was washed thoroughly with buffer A, and the resin was suspended in buffer A as a 50% (v/v) slurry and used for phosphorylation reactions. Total cellular RNAs were extracted from hepatocytes using the guanidine thiocyanate method (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) and prepared for Northern blot hybridization as described previously (17Coupé C. Perdereau D. Ferré P. Hitier Y. Narkewicz M. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E126-E133PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of each probe was performed by random priming (Rediprime labeling kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiograms of Northern blots were scanned and quantified using an image processor program. FAS and PEPCK cDNAs were as described previously (17Coupé C. Perdereau D. Ferré P. Hitier Y. Narkewicz M. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E126-E133PubMed Google Scholar). Albumin, β-actin, and glucokinase cDNA were gifts of kindness, respectively, from Drs. J. L. Danan (Meudon, France), B. Spiegelman (Boston, MA), and P. Ineydjian (Geneva, Switzerland). Each Northern blot was hybridized with a ribosomal 18 S cDNA to verify that equivalent amounts of total RNA were loaded in each lane. Nuclei isolation and nuclear run-on transcription experiments were performed as described by Dugail et al. (18Dugail I. Quignard-Boulangé A. Le Liepvre X. Ardouin B. Lavau M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test for unpaired data. When quantified, FAS mRNA concentrations were normalized with respect to the 18 S hybridization signal. To investigate whether a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism is involved in the glucose signaling pathway, we have used okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (19Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), the most abundant phosphatases present in the liver (20Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid has been shown to increase the phosphorylation state of a number of proteins including ACC orl-PK in rat hepatocytes, leading to increased glucose output and reduced glycolysis and lipogenesis (20Haystead T.A.J. Sim A.T.R. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). A major problem faced by studies using okadaic acid in whole cells is that, due to the widespread role of protein phosphorylation, long-term incubations could lead to secondary effects not related to glucose signaling. To minimize this problem in the present study, okadaic acid was added at the same time as 25 mm glucose in cultured hepatocytes, and FAS mRNA concentration measurements were performed after only 3 h. Okadaic acid at a dose of 10 nm decreases glucose-induced FAS expression by 50%, with a maximal effect obtained at 50 nm (Fig. 1). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid is not due to a general impairment of transcription mechanisms since (i) the expression of a control gene, β-actin, is not affected in the same experiments (Fig. 1), and (ii) the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid on PEPCK mRNA abundance in hepatocytes, a phenomenon previously described (21O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), can still be counteracted by glucagon (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that glucose metabolism is a prerequisite for glucose action on FAS gene expression (3Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20543-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Prip-Buus C. Perdereau D. Foufelle F. Maury J. Ferré P. Girard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was important, therefore, to ensure that in these experiments, okadaic acid did not directly affect glucose metabolism. In fact, glucose-6-phosphate concentrations measured 1 h after 10 nm okadaic acid addition, a dose which markedly inhibits FAS gene expression, were rather slightly increased (control, 2.20 ± 0.14 nmol/106 hepatocytes (n = 3); okadaic acid-treated, 2.76 ± 0.13 nmol/106 hepatocytes (n = 3)). Furthermore, lactate produced from glucose in the culture medium 3 h after 10 nm okadaic acid addition was unchanged (control, 1.50 ± 0.02 μmol/106 hepatocytes (n = 3); okadaic acid-treated, 1.48 ± 0.1 μmol/106 hepatocytes (n = 3)). These data rule out an indirect effect of okadaic acid through an impairment of glucose metabolism. Our results are reminiscent of experiments showing that S14 gene transcription in cultured hepatocytes is inhibited by incubation with 5 nm okadaic acid with a maximal effect at 50 nm(9Sudo Y. Mariash C.N. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Due to the fact that okadaic acid is not selective between phosphatases 1 and 2A, we cannot conclude whether phosphatase 2A alone is involved as shown for glucose induction of S14 gene transcription (9Sudo Y. Mariash C.N. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these experiments demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of glucose on FAS gene expression does involve a dephosphorylation mechanism. Having established that protein phosphatases are involved in the glucose signaling pathway, we next investigated which protein kinases were involved. Cultured hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of a number of different compounds to modulate the activity of various protein kinases (see “Experimental Procedures”). In all cases, except when Bt2cAMP was used, hepatocytes were incubated with a sub-maximal concentration of glucose (15 mm) to be able to detect both an increase or decrease in FAS gene expression by the various drugs. We have analyzed the effects of H7, an inhibitor of both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (22Hardie D.G. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Protein Phosphorylation, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 87-107Google Scholar), A23187, a calcium ionophore that activates CaM kinases (23Garrison J.C. Johnsen D.E. Campanile C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3283-3292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and KN62, a specific inhibitor of CaM kinase II (24Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of these various compounds (Fig. 2,top and middle panels ), there was no significant change in the glucose-induced FAS gene expression. In contrast, AICAR, a compound which has been shown to activate AMPK in a number of cell types, including primary rat adipocytes and hepatocytes (14Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) and Bt2cAMP (an activator of PKA), strongly reduces the stimulating effect of glucose on FAS gene expression (Fig. 2,middle and bottom panels ). The inhibitory effect of AICAR is not a general effect on gene transcription as shown by the fact that glucokinase gene expression is not modified by the compound (Fig. 2, middle panel ). Similarly, the inhibitory effect of cAMP on FAS gene expression was specific since PEPCK gene expression was strongly stimulated by Bt2cAMP (Fig. 2, bottom panel ). These results suggest a potential involvement of AMPK and PKA in the glucose signaling pathway. We have already shown that activation of PKA in adipose tissue counteracted the glucose effect on FAS gene expression (26Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of PKA inhibited glucose-induced expression of the S14 (27Kinlaw W.B. Schwartz H.L. Towle H.C. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and l-PK (28Decaux J.F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11584-11590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genes, although for the former, it has been attributed to an effect on glucose metabolism (9Sudo Y. Mariash C.N. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and for the latter to an effect on glucokinase activity. Indeed, the cAMP inhibitory effect on l-PK gene expression was lost in a hepatoma cell line expressing hexokinase II rather than glucokinase (29Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, Bt2cAMP strongly increases glucose-6-phosphate concentration in hepatocytes (result not shown), ruling out an indirect metabolic effect of PKA activation. If PKA was the kinase partner of the glucose signaling system, it would be anticipated that its inactivation should stimulate the FAS gene expression in the presence of 15 mm glucose. Since an inhibitor of PKA (H7) has no stimulatory effect on FAS gene expression (Fig. 2), this may indicate that PKA inhibits FAS gene expression by a mechanism that is unrelated to the glucose activating system. Moreover, in hepatocytes cultured in the presence of 5 mm glucose which express FAS at a low level, cAMP concentration should be already low due to the presence of insulin. This is backed up by the observation that PEPCK gene expression, which is dependent upon the activation of PKA, is barely detectable in these culture conditions (results not shown). This strongly suggests that PKA is not involved in the inhibition of FAS gene expression at low glucose concentrations. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding that a cAMP DNA response element has been localized at –99 to –92 in the FAS promoter (30Rangan V.S. Oskouian B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2307-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a region which bears no relationship with known glucose-response elements (for review, see Ref. 1Girard J. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Following uptake into the cell, AICAR is metabolized into ZMP, a relatively potent activator of AMPK (14Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 31Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Progressive inhibition of glucose-induced FAS gene expression by increasing concentrations of AICAR was indeed paralleled by an increased activity of AMPK (Fig. 3). In the same culture experiments, glucokinase gene expression that is not controlled by glucose but by insulin (32Iynedjian P.B. Jotterand D. Nouspikel T. Asfari M. Pilot P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21824-21829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not affected (Fig. 3). Activation of AMPK in the presence of 15 mm glucose and 500 μm AICAR did not affect glucose-6-phosphate concentrations measured 1 h after the addition of the drug (control, 1.40 ± 0.22 nmol/106 hepatocytes (n = 6); AICAR-treated, 1.18 ± 0.14 nmol/106 hepatocytes (n = 6) (difference not significant)). Finally, in the presence of a submaximally effective dose of AICAR, glucose could still stimulate FAS gene expression although with a much lower efficiency (Fig.4).Figure 4Effect of glucose on FAS gene expression in the presence of a submaximal dose of AICAR in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were cultured for 16–18 h in the presence of 5 mm glucose and hormones (100 nminsulin, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 nmT3). Cells were then treated for 6 h with increasing concentrations of glucose (15–35 mm) in the absence or in the presence of 200 μm AICAR. The results are presented as a representative Northern blot (top panel ) or in arbitrary densitometric units as the mean of two experiments with duplicates in each experiments (bottom panel ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether the decreased expression of FAS gene by the activation of AMPK was due to a transcriptional and/or a post-transcriptional mechanism, run-on experiments were performed. Nuclei were isolated from hepatocytes cultured for 1 h in the presence of 5 or 25 mm glucose and in the absence or presence of AICAR (250 μm). Glucose at the high concentration clearly increases FAS gene transcription (Fig. 5). This increase was strongly (but not totally) repressed in the presence of AICAR, whereas glucokinase transcription was neither affected by glucose nor by AICAR (Fig. 5). It is therefore clear that the decreased FAS gene expression when AMPK is activated involves a transcriptional mechanism. Nevertheless, since the inhibitory effect of AICAR on FAS gene transcription is not total whereas the effect on FAS mRNA concentration is drastic, this might indicate an effect of AMPK activation on FAS mRNA half-life. On the other hand, the partial inhibitory effect of AICAR on FAS gene transcription might suggest that other kinases are also involved in the glucose-signaling system. The bulk of these studies strongly suggests that AMPK interferes with the glucose-signaling system for the FAS gene transcription. In addition to our findings, there are a number of features that provide clues for a role of AMPK in gene regulation in response to glucose. First, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates ACC and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, resulting in the inhibition of both lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis (33Carling D. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). These two pathways utilize acetyl-CoA as a substrate that, for a large part, originates from glucose. The action of AMPK on FAS gene expression would thus allow the potential for the coordinate regulation of lipid synthesis from glucose in both the short and long term. Second, and perhaps most interesting, is the finding that AMPK is structurally and functionally related to the yeast SNF1 protein kinase complex (34Carling D. Aguan K. Woods A. Verhoeven A.J.M. Beri R.K. Brennan C.H. Sidebottom C. Davison M.D. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11442-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AMPK consists of three subunits, a catalytic subunit, α (63 kDa), and two noncatalytic subunits, β (30 kDa) and γ (36 kDa). AMPK α subunit is 46% identical to yeast Snf1p, and this similarity increases to 60% within the kinase catalytic domains (35Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Carling D. Aguan K. Woods A. Verhoeven A.J.M. Beri R.K. Brennan C.H. Sidebottom C. Davison M.D. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11442-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ subunit is 35% identical to yeast Snf4p (37Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which is required for the protein kinase activity of Snf1p, just as the mammalian γ subunit is essential for the maximal kinase activity of the catalytic α subunit (38Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The AMPK β subunit is related to the yeast Sip family which interacts with Snf1p (37Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Studies using synthetic peptides as substrates have revealed that both AMPK and SNF1 share very similar recognition motifs for phosphorylation, and moreover, they both phosphorylate and inactivate acetyl-CoA carboxylase in vivo (35Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, the activity of SNF1 is essential for the transcriptional activation of glucose-repressed genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (39Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This is achieved through the phosphorylation of a transcription factor, depending upon the medium glucose concentration (40DeVit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Finally, it can be underlined that, as described for the glucose control of gene expression in mammals, the phosphorylation of glucose by a hexokinase is an essential step for the transcriptional effect of glucose in yeast (41Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It is then tempting to speculate that the general mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression by glucose in mammals bear similarity with those described in yeast. It has been suggested that SNF1 activity varies in response to glucose in yeast (35Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One obvious possibility was that a high glucose concentration decreases the activity of AMPK. AMP activates AMPK through several independent mechanisms: allosteric activation of AMPK, stimulation of an AMPK kinase (AMPK is activated by phosphorylation), and inhibition of the deactivation of AMPK by PP-2C (42Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). A decreased AMPK activity in the presence of a high glucose concentration could be achieved (i) by decreasing the concentration of AMP, (ii) by altering the phosphorylation state of the enzyme, or (iii) by a direct allosteric interaction between the glucose signal metabolite and AMPK. To test the first hypothesis, we have measured the concentration of AMP in the presence of 5 or 25 mm glucose. As can be seen from Table I, a high glucose concentration does not modify AMP, ADP, or ATP concentrations.Table IAMPK activity and ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations in cultured hepatocytes in the presence of 5 and 25 mm glucose and AICAR5 mm Glucose25 mm Glucose25 mm Glucose + 500 AICAR μmAMPK activity34 ± 344 ± 9145* ± 5ATP (nmol/106 hepatocytes)17.8 ± 1.5920.4 ± 2.14—ADP (nmol/106hepatocytes)3.13 ± 0.083.22 ± 0.09—AMP (nmol/106 hepatocytes)1.40 ± 0.251.48 ± 0.17—Hepatocytes were cultured for 16–18 h in the presence of 5 mm glucose and hormones (100 nm insulin, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 nm T3).

Results are presented as mean ± S.E. for three experiments. *, Difference significant for p < 0.001 when compared with hepatocytes cultured in the presence of 25 mm glucose alone. We have then assessed whether AMPK activity, and hence its phosphorylation state, was modified in the presence of a stimulating glucose concentration in cultured hepatocytes. This measurement relies on the fact that a change in the phosphorylation state of AMPK in the hepatocyte would be preserved in our assay conditions because of the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. As summarized in Table I, a high glucose concentration had no inhibitory effect on AMPK activity, whereas AICAR clearly increases its activity. A last possibility was that the glucose signal metabolite could modify AMPK activity. An antagonism between glucose-6-P and AMP on AMPK activity was not unlikely since it has already been described for mammalian glycogen phosphorylase (43Lin K. Rath V.L. Dai S.C. Fletterick R.J. Hwang P.K. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We measured the activity of purified AMPK in the presence and absence of AMP and in the presence of increasing concentrations (from 0 to 500 μm) of glucose-6-phosphate. AMPK activity was not modified by this sugar phosphate (results not shown). These experiments suggest that the glucose signal does not modify AMPK activity directly, at least in our assay system. It must be pointed out, however, that in contrast with yeasts, the switch from a high to a low glucose medium concentration in hepatocytes is not concomitant with a large decrease in the energy charge (AMP to ATP ratio). It is possible that the effect of glucose on AMPK is indirect and is mediated by decreasing the phosphorylation state of specific downstream targets of AMPK. This could occur either through the direct stimulation of a protein phosphatase or by rendering the target protein a better substrate for dephosphorylation. A similar mechanism involving glucose-6-phosphate has been described already for the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase in hepatocytes (44Cadefau J. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The main stimulator of FAS gene expression in adipose tissue and in the liver is glucose with insulin having an indirect effect (3Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20543-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Prip-Buus C. Perdereau D. Foufelle F. Maury J. Ferré P. Girard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have shown presently that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms are involved in the control of FAS gene expression by glucose. AMPK could be among the kinases involved in this regulation. The mechanisms by which glucose and its signal metabolite modulate the system do not involve a change in AMPK activity itself but more probably the phosphorylation state of a downstream target of the kinase. Although it is well established that PKA directly modulates the transcriptional activity of nuclear factors (45Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not possible to conclude from the present study whether that is also the case for AMPK, and this must await the clear identification of the transcription factors involved in the glucose response."

In the presence of SII, a protein that stimulates the nuclease activity, pol II quantitatively removed misincorporated nucleotides from the nascent transcript during rapid chain extension. The basis of discrimination between the correct and incorrect base was the slow addition of the next nucleotide to the mismatched terminus. Incorporation of inosine monophosphate inhibited next nucleotide addition by a similar magnitude as a mismatched base. We used this finding to demonstrate that addition of SII to a transcription reaction dramatically altered the RNA base content, reflecting the stable incorporation of more ""correct"" (GMP) and fewer ""incorrect"" (IMP) nucleotides."

Recent data of the effects of gene mutations linked to familial AD suggests that the deposition of amyloid plaque in brain may play a causal role in the cascades leading to dementia and the pathologic abnormalities seen in AD brain: the amyloid hypothesis of AD (1Hardy J.

The major components of amyloid plaque are Aβ peptides, including Aβ40 and Aβ42, derived by constitutive proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) encoded on human chromosome 21. APP is a type I cell surface protein with an extracellular region, a transmembrane region, and short intracellular carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic region. The Aβ sequence encompasses half of the transmembrane domain and a short part of the extracellular domain of APP. Aβ40 and Aβ42 are released by β- and γ-secretase activities that cleave APP at the amino and carboxyl termini of Aβ, respectively. By this pathway, Aβ and soluble APP (APPsβ) are released into the extracellular space. Alternate cleavage of APP within the Aβ sequence by an α-secretase activity releases APPsα and precludes full-length Aβ formation. In nonneuronal cell lines such as HEK 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells, secreted APP fragments are generated primarily via the α-secretase pathway, although some Aβ is generated and secreted by β-/γ-secretases, primarily in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. In these cells, endocytosis of cell surface APP requires the Tyr-Glu-Asn-Pro-Thr-Tyr (YENPTY) motif found in its intracellular carboxyl terminus and is thus necessary for Aβ generation (4Haass C.

X11 and Fe65 are highly expressed in neurons and contain a PTB domain originally described in Shc (11Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The Shc PTB domain interacts with ΨX NPX pY motifs (where Ψ is hydrophobic,X is any amino acid, N is Asn, P is Pro, and pY is phosphotyrosine) found in tyrosine kinase receptors and other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The PTB domain of Shc is likely involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades. However, the PTB domain is a more general protein-protein interaction domain found in several otherwise unrelated proteins such as X11, Fe65, Numb, and Disabled. Although the PTB domains of these proteins are homologous to Shc, they differ by binding to nonphosphorylated partners (13Borg J.-P. Margolis B. Curr. Top. Microbiol Immunol. 1998; 228: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chien C.-T. Wang S. Rothenberg M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The function of the newly described PTB domains is now being examined. For example, the PTB domain of Numb is crucial for the differentiation of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila (15Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 16Yaich L. Ooi J. Park M. Borg J.-P. Landry C. Bodmer R. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10381-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the PTB domain of X11α binds specifically to the YENPTY-containing region of APP, the functional significance of this interaction is unknown. Deletion of the last 18 amino acids of APP encompassing the YENPTY motif or mutation of the amino-terminal tyrosine of the YENPTY motif of APP to glycine (Y682G) impairs binding to APP. Likewise, mutation of X11 at position 608 (F608V), previously referred to as the F479V mutation in the nonfull-length protein, impairs X11α-APP interaction (6Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The importance of these specific amino acid residues was confirmed by analysis of the crystal structure of the X11α PTB domain complexed to a peptide encompassing the YENPTY motif of APP (17Zhang Z. Lee C.-H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have identified a second X11 gene in humans. We refer to the newly isolated gene as X11β (Fig.1). The goal of this study was to functionally characterize the interaction between X11α or X11β with APP. Coexpression of X11α with APP in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells results in comparatively greater levels of cellular APP (APPc), and less APPs, Aβ40, and Aβ42 recovered in conditioned medium of transiently transfected cells. These effects are 1) correlated with a prolonged half-life of APPc, 2) impaired by a single missense mutation of either APP (Y682G) or X11α (F608V), and 3) amplified by coexpression with the Swedish mutation of APP (APPswe; K595N/M596L) found in a pedigree of early onset familial AD. Thus, structural and functional data implicate a normal role for X11α in APP trafficking and metabolism via a specific protein-protein interaction. Human embryonic kidney 293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units of penicillin/ml and 100 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were split one day before transfection (1 × 106 cells/6-cm plate) and transfected with 10 μg of DNA by the calcium phosphate procedure. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All constructs were cloned in pRK5 vector as described previously (6Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The APP695 isoform was used exclusively in this study. For [35S]methionine labeling, cells were incubated with methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μCi/ml for 15 min followed by a chase in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, proteins were extracted with lysis buffer. Conditioned media of transfected cells were collected before lysis, and proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight with Karen or 6E10 antibodies at 4 °C. Bound proteins were recovered on protein A-agarose beads. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblot or by PhosphorImager and autoradiography. Radiolabeled proteins detected by PhosphorImager were quantitated with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The anti-myc antibody 9E10 (Oncogene Science) at 1 μg/ml was used for immunoblotting. The 22C11 monoclonal antibody (Boeringer Mannheim) was directed against an epitope of the extracellular region of APP. The polyclonal antisera 369 was directed to the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of APP. Karen is a goat polyclonal antisera directed to the secreted amino-terminal domain of APP (18Chyung A.S.C. Greenberg B.D. Cook D.G. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 138: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Senetek) was raised to Aβ1–17. The Aβ sandwich ELISA was performed as described previously (19Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar) using BAN50 as the capture antibody and either horseradish peroxidase-coupled BA-27 or BC-05 as the detection antibody for Aβ40 or Aβ42, respectively. BAN-50 is a monoclonal antibody specific for Aβ1–10. The YENPTY motif in the intracellular carboxyl terminus of APP is involved in its cellular processing. For example, deletion of this motif results in greater recovery of APPsα in conditioned medium (4Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Either deletion of the YENPTY sequence or mutation of the amino-terminal tyrosine of the motif (APP Y682G) abrogates binding to the X11α PTB domain (6Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the APP Y682G mutation would recapitulate the effects of YENPTY deletion on APPsα recovery. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with APP, APP Y682G, or APPswe constructs. The APPswe double mutation resulted in comparatively greater Aβ and less APPsα recovery in conditioned medium. Comparable levels of APP expression were verified by immunoblot of cell lysates with the anti-APP antibody 369 (Fig.2 A , upper panel ). APPsα in conditioned media was immunoprecipitated and detected by immunoblot with 6E10 (Fig. 2 A , lower panel ). The APP Y682G mutation resulted in greater release of APPsα in conditioned medium, similar to deletion of the YENPTY motif (Fig.2 A , lower panel ). As expected, APPswe resulted in a decrease in APPsα in conditioned medium. Transfected HEK 293 cells were also labeled with [35S]methionine, and APPsα was recovered by immunoprecipitation with 6E10, separated by SDS-PAGE, and revealed by autoradiography (Fig. 2 B ). Similar to the results of Fig. 2 A , APPsα release was markedly increased by the Y682G mutation, although comparable expression of APP was found in cell lysates (data not shown). Thus, the X11α PTB domain binding site in APP is functionally important for APPsα release. Interference with this interaction either by deletion of the carboxyl terminus or mutation of the YENPTY domain of APP resulted in greater APPsα release into conditioned medium. In HEK 293 cells APP is metabolized primarily by an α-secretase activity at the cell surface, resulting in APPsα secretion. Because a fraction of X11α protein is localized at the cell membrane, we hypothesized that X11α would influence APPsα release. HEK 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with APP and myc-tagged X11α constructs or control vector (Fig. 3 A ). APP and X11α in cell lysates were detected by immunoblot. APPsα in conditioned medium was immunoprecipitated with Karen and detected by immunoblot with 6E10. Coexpression of APP with X11α resulted in decreased recovery of APPsα in an X11α dose-dependent manner. X11α also resulted in a large increase of APP in cell lysates. Although APPsα in medium was barely detectable when transfected with 5 μg of the X11α construct, no further increase of APP in the cell lysate was detected compared with 1 μg of X11α. This might suggest that APP is being processed by a β-secretase pathway. Conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with Karen, and bound proteins were detected by immunoblot with 22C11, an anti-APP antibody directed against all APPs species. The same decrease in APPs was documented with this antibody, ruling out this possibility (Fig.3 A ). We speculate that the generation of APP may be decreased by high expression of X11α or that the APP level reaches a plateau in the cell. Cells were also cotransfected with APP mutations (Fig. 3 B ). Coexpression of 5 μg of X11α construct with either APP or APPswe resulted in far less APPsα in conditioned medium. This result was expected because APPswe does not influence X11α binding (data not shown). Coexpression of APP Y682G with X11α led only to a small decrease of APPsα compared with APP Y682G transfection only (Fig. 3 B ). Accordingly, APP Y682G retained only 5–10% of binding activity with X11α in vivo andin vitro (6Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Collectively, this data suggested that the interaction of the PTB domain of X11α with the intracellular region of APP containing the YENPTY motif impaired release of APPsα. Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ40 and Aβ42, are also produced by constitutive APP metabolism. In contrast to α-secretase cleavage of APP, which precludes generation of full-length Aβ peptides, Aβ40 and Aβ42 are generated by β- and γ-secretase activities. In HEK 293 cells, Aβ peptides are generated almost exclusively by an endosomal pathway, which required a functional YENPTY motif (4Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the effect of X11α coexpression with APP on Aβ40 and Aβ42 recovery in conditioned medium (Fig.4), as measured by a sensitive and specific ELISA (19Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Compared with cells transfected with X11α, transfection with APP resulted in measurable Aβ concentrations in medium. As expected, transfection with APPswe resulted in much greater levels of Aβ in conditioned medium (Fig. 4), in parallel with diminished APPs levels (Fig. 2). Conversely, the APP Y682G mutation resulted in a slight decrease in Aβ40 and Aβ42 release (Fig.4 A ), in parallel with a slight increase in APPsα (Fig. 2). Coexpression of X11α with APP reduced the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in medium. This inhibitory effect of X11α was amplified by coexpression with the APPswe mutation. As predicted by the binding data, APP Y682G metabolism was resistant to X11α effects. Thus, mutation of APP within the YENPTY motif impaired the inhibitory effects of X11α on Aβ secretion. We also determined the effect of coexpression of APP or APPswe with the mutation X11α F608V. This mutation lies within the carboxyl-terminal α-helix of X11α PTB domain and is a critical residue for PTB domain interaction (6Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with APPswe and X11α constructs. As predicted from the binding data, the inhibitory effect of X11α on Aβ secretion was attenuated by X11α F608V coexpression (Fig.4 B ). Thus the specific interaction of X11α with APP appears to inhibit release of Aβ40 and Aβ42 into conditioned medium. The ELISA data was not corrected for level of APPc, because apparent effects on Aβ secretion would be artifactually magnified. Our data suggests that X11α coexpression blocks the production of soluble APP metabolites and results in apparent greater levels of cellular APP, thus appearing to stabilize APP in the cell (Fig. 3). To test this hypothesis, we performed a pulse-chase analysis of HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with APP alone or with X11α. Cells were labeled for 15 min with [35 S]methionine before chase for up to 8 h. APP in cell lysates was immunoprecipitated by Karen antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by PhosphorImager analysis and autoradiography. Radiolabeled APP was quantitated by ImageQuant software. Similar to previous reports, APP had a half-life of ∼2 h in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5). Coexpression of X11α prolonged APP half-life to ∼4 h. To further evaluate the stabilization of cellular APP by X11α, we transiently expressed X11α in HEK 293 cells stably expressing APP and measured APP levels in cell lysates. In these experiments, X11α expression resulted in an apparent increase in the amount of APP in cell lysates. As predicted, the X11α F608V mutation had less effect (Fig.6 A , lower panel ). Comparable amounts of X11α and X11α F608V were expressed in the cells (Fig. 6 A , upper panel ).Figure 6Stabilization of cellular APP by X11α or X11β coexpression. A and B , HEK 293 cells stably transfected with APP were transiently transfected with pRK5 (vector) only, pRK5-myc-X11α, pRK5-X11α F608V, pRK5-myc-X11β, or pRK5-myc-X11β F519V. In Fig. 5 B , 5 μg of DNA was transfected. Equal amounts of proteins from cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subject to immunoblot. The X11 proteins were detected by anti-myc antibody (upper panels ), and cellular APP was revealed by antibody 369.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During the course of these studies with X11α, we cloned a second human X11 gene we named X11 β. This gene is located on chromosome 15 (human genome project) and encodes a 120-kDa protein with a predicted topology as X11α. Both X11 α and X11 β are highly expressed in brain. 2J.-P. Borg and B. Margolis, unpublished data. The PTB and PDZ domains of X11β were 80–90% identical to X11α domains and were thus predicted to bind similar targets. However, their amino termini were quite divergent. Accordingly, the X11β PTB domain bound efficiently to APP in vitro and in cells in culture (data not shown) and had similar results on APP processing, i.e. diminished soluble metabolites and stabilization of APP in cells. Hence, expression of X11β in HEK cells stably transfected with APP notably increased the amount of APPc (Fig. 6 B ). This effect is almost completely abolished by a mutation of X11β analogous to X11α F608V. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both X11α and X11β inhibit APP metabolism when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Nonneuronal cell lines are instructive model systems of APP trafficking and metabolism. HEK 293 cells produce Aβ, primarily Aβ40, via β-/γ-secretase activities in an endosomal pathway, although the primary metabolic products of APP in this cell line result from α-secretase activity (4Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain of APP, in particular the YENPTY consensus sequence required for endocytosis by clathrin-coated pits, plays an important role in APP processing and Aβ generation by the endosomal pathway (4Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X11α, a protein highly expressed in neurons, specifically interacts with a peptide encompassing the YENPTY motif of APP (6Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the interaction of X11α or X11β with APP has significant effects on its metabolism in HEK 293 cells and has implied effects on cellular trafficking of APP. Coexpression of X11α with APP decreased the recovery of its soluble fragments APPsα, Aβ40, and Aβ42 in conditioned medium of HEK 293 cells. These effects are specific, as demonstrated by the use of a single point mutation within either the cytoplasmic YENPTY motif of APP or the PTB domain of X11α, which impairs their interaction and thus, X11α effects. The decreased recovery of soluble APP fragments in conditioned medium was observed in parallel with an apparent increase in APP in cell lysates. This suggested prolongation of the half-life of APPc, which was confirmed by pulse-chase analysis. Expression of a second member of the X11 gene family, i.e. X11 β, in HEK 293 cells had similar effects on APP processing. X11β bound as efficiently as X11α to APP in vivo and in vitro (data not shown). Thus, the specific interaction of the X11 PTB domain with the YENPTY motif-containing region of APP appeared to retard its processing and prolong its half-life, resulting in decreased recovery of soluble proteolytic fragments. When coexpressed with APP, X11α slowed both the α-secretase pathway and the endosomal/lysosomal pathway leading to Aβ generation. The mechanisms and intracellular site(s) of X11α effects on APP metabolism are unknown, but one may hypothesize that X11α slows endosomal trafficking of APP. Alternatively, X11α may prevent the secretion of APPs, leading to an accumulation of APP in the cell. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests increased neuronal endocytosis and thus increased Aβ secretion in neurons of sporadic AD brain compared with age-matched control brain (20Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Pieroni C. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed effects of X11α on inhibition of Aβ secretion with APP coexpression are qualitatively similar but amplified by coexpression with APPswe. In effect, coexpression of X11α with APPswe decreased Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion to that seen with APP expression only. Similar to APP, when coexpressed with APPswe, X11α retarded both the α-secretase pathway and Aβ generation. The Swedish mutation of APP promoted its metabolism by β-/γ-protease activities, resulting in a 5–10-fold increase in Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion, with a concomitant decrease in the α-secretase pathway (21Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 22Cai X.-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). There are other important differences between APP and APPswe metabolism. For example, in contrast to APP, transfection of an APPswe construct lacking a cytoplasmic tail, which precludes reinternalization, did not reduce the secretion of Aβ peptides. Thus, an additional β-/γ-protease pathway in Golgi-derived vesicles or the Golgi itself is present in APPswe metabolism to Aβ in nonneuronal cells (23Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron P.

A. 1997; 94: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). X11α may affect metabolism of APPswe by this cellular pathway as well as the endosomal pathway of Aβ generation. X11α and X11β are neuronal proteins that contain two PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains in addition to the PTB domain. The PDZ domains found in other neuronal membrane proteins such as the PSD-95 family and nitric oxide synthase are implicated in their membrane clustering and localization. Clustering and localization of proteins may serve to stabilize proteins and prolong their half-life (27Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This is similar to the effects of X11 on APP that we observed in this study. Although the binding partners of the PDZ domain of X11α are unknown, a heterotrimeric complex of PDZ partner/X11α/APP may be implicated in X11α effects and APP localization. The Fe65 gene family is also expressed primarily in neurons, and the encoded protein contains a PTB domain that binds to APP (8Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and thus may influence its metabolism. In addition to two PTB domains, Fe65 contains in its sequence a WW protein interaction domain that binds to proline-rich sequences (28Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, Fe65 and X11α may have differential effects on APP trafficking and metabolism based on the formation of alternate and potentially competing heterotrimeric complexes of APP with either a PDZ binding partner of X11α or a WW binding partner of Fe65. Neuronal processing of APP is in some ways distinct from its metabolism in nonneuronal cells and results in greater Aβ generation compared with nonneuronal cells (29Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H.

In addition to having the more ubiquitous α-secretase pathway at or near the cell surface and endosomal/lysosomal processing of APP to Aβ, neuronal cells have additional β/γ processing of APP within the endoplasmic reticulum/early Golgi. This neuronal exocytic pathway favors the generation of a higher ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 compared with the β-/γ- proteases of the endocytic pathway (31Turner R.S. Suzuki N. Chyung A.S.C. Younkin S.G.

We show that this low-affinity Rb+ uptake is mediated by several independent transporters, and that trk1Δ cells and especially trk1Δ trk2Δ cells are highly hyperpolarized. Differences in the membrane potentials were assessed for sensitivity to hygromycin B and by flow cytometric analyses of cellular DiOC6(3) fluorescence. On the basis of the latter analyses, it is proposed that Trk1p and Trk2p are involved in the control of the membrane potential, preventing excessive hyperpolarizations.

Potassium is an indispensable element, which is accumulated against large transmembrane concentration gradients in cells living in diluted environments. Probably because of the central role of this element in all forms of life, different mechanisms mediating K+ uptake have evolved in different types of cells. In plants and fungi, the cellular uptake of K+ is probably always an electrophoretic process, which takes place in response to the membrane potential created by the H+-pump ATPase (1Serrano R.

Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) have been extensively studied. The TRK1 gene ofS. cerevisiae encodes a notable K+ transporter, which is adapted to provide the required amount of K+ in many different nutritional conditions. To perform this function, this transporter changes its K m, which shows values in the millimolar range in cells growing at millimolar concentrations of K+, and as low as 20–30 μm in K+-starved cells (5Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ramos J. Contreras P. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 143: 88-93Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Ramos J. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TheV max is also variable, depending on the cellular pH and K+ content of the cells (5Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ramos J. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A second gene,TRK2 (10Ko C.H. Buckley A.M. Gaber R.G. Genetics. 1990; 125: 305-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), encodes a second K+ transporter structurally related to Trk1p (11Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, unlike Trk1p, Trk2p shows a very low Rb+ influx V max intrk1Δ cells with a low K+ content, and the influx is undetectable in TRK1 cells or intrk1Δ cells with a normal K+ content (7Ramos J. Alijo R. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1176: 249-252Crossref Google Scholar). Using a trk1Δ strain overexpressing Trk2p, it has been found that the affinity of the TRK2 transporter for K+ and Rb+ is also regulated by the K+ content of the cell, and that the K m in K+-starved cells is only slightly higher than that of TRK1 (7Ramos J. Alijo R. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1176: 249-252Crossref Google Scholar). Because theV max of TRK2 is very low in comparison to that of TRK1 and the K m is higher than theK m of TRK1, the function of Trk2p seems to be superfluous as an independent K+ transporter. Deletion of the TRK1 and TRK2 genes results in cells that grow normally at high concentrations of K+, and slowly at relatively low concentrations, exhibiting a Rb+influx kinetics with a K m of 60 mm and aV max of 9 and 16 nmol mg−1min−1, in the two strains studied so far (7Ramos J. Alijo R. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1176: 249-252Crossref Google Scholar). This low-affinity Rb+ uptake of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells also constitutes the major pathway for Rb+ uptake intrk1Δ TRK2 cells, in which Trk2p mediates a minor pathway, as already mentioned. However, in contrast with the relevance of the low-affinity K+ uptake in trk1Δ TRK2 andtrk1Δ trk2Δ cells, this uptake has never been detected in wild strains (4Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 88-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the K m of the low-affinity Rb+ influx is much higher than theK m of TRK1 and the V max not insignificant in comparison to the V max of TRK1, it can be concluded that the low-affinity Rb+ uptake has not been detected in TRK1 cells because it does not exist in these cells. Therefore, two important questions remain unanswered about K+ transport in S. cerevisiae , the function of Trk2p and the identity, and consequently the function, of the transporter mediating the low-affinity uptake of K+ and Rb+ observed in trk1Δ cells. For the latter question two hypotheses have been put forward, that this transport takes place mediated by several non-K+ transporters, which harbor intrinsic K+ transport capabilities (14Gaber R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 299-353Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Ko C.H. Liang H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Wright M.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13647-13652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and that it is mediated by a part of the normal K+ uptake system, which is multimeric and loses its normal properties in the absence of Trk1p (7Ramos J. Alijo R. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1176: 249-252Crossref Google Scholar). The former hypothesis is supported by well documented studies with strains carrying mutations in sugar and amino acid transporters, and with strains overexpressing amino acid permeases (14Gaber R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 299-353Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Ko C.H. Liang H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Wright M.B.

The latter has been advanced to explain why the low-affinity Rb+ uptake does not exist in wild strains, and to explain why glucose activates the low-affinity Rb+ influx oftrk1Δ mutants in the same fashion as it does in wild strains (7Ramos J. Alijo R. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 1176: 249-252Crossref Google Scholar, 17Alijo R. Ramos J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the characteristics of Rb+ uptake, tolerance to hygromycin B, and cellular DiOC6(3) fluorescence, as determined by flow cytometry, in strains carrying different combinations of wild and null alleles of the TRK1 and TRK2 genes. The results suggest that Trk1p and Trk2p are involved in the regulation of the electrical membrane potential. Deletion of these proteins brings the cells to a very high membrane potential, negative inside, which could drive an ectopic uptake of alkali cations.

Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mineral media contained 5 μm K+ and 200 μm Na+, and KCl and NaCl were added in each case to obtain the required amounts of K+ and Na+. Cells with a normal K+ content were routinely grown in the arginine medium supplemented with 0.5 mm K+ for the TRK1 TRK2 andTRK1trk2Δ strains, 2.5 mm K+ for the trk1Δ TRK2 strain, and 10 mmK+ for the trk1Δ trk2Δ strain. K+-starved cells were obtained by suspending cells with a normal K+ content in K+-free arginine medium for 3 h (5Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mineral media for nitrogen or phosphate starvation were prepared substituting K+ for arginine or sulfuric acid for phosphoric acid, respectively; for nitrogen starvation, amino acid supplementation, if required, was reduced 10-fold. Starvation was achieved by incubating the cells for 5 h in these media. trk1Δ trk2Δ -pGALHAK1 cells were grown in YPG and transferred to YPD as indicated in each case. Hygromycin B resistance was tested in YPD. N. crassa was grown as described elsewhere (23Ramos J. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 97-101Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells with a normal K+ content were grown at 3 mmK+. To obtain low-K+ cells, the conidia were grown at 50 μm K+ for 6 h and then transferred to 10 μm K+ for 1 h. All procedures for manipulating DNA were standard ones (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were separated from the culture medium by centrifugation, washed, and suspended in testing buffer composed of 10 mmMES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-(N -morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide p -chlorophenylhydrazone. buffer brought to pH 6.0 with Ca(OH)2, containing 0.1 mmMgCl2 and 2% glucose. In some experiments withtrk1Δ trk2Δ -pRSHAK1 strain carrying thepGAL1-HAK1 gene, galactose-substituted glucose, and in the experiments designed to test the effect of divalent cations on Rb+ influx, the pH of the testing buffer was adjusted with NaOH, and MgCl2 was withdrawn. To start the experiments, Rb+ was added to the cell suspension and, at short intervals, samples of cells were removed by filtration from the testing buffer. To determine the Rb+ content, the cells were treated with HCl and the extracts analyzed by atomic emission spectrophotometry, as described previously (5Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, we determined the initial rate of Rb+ uptake from the time course of the net accumulation. S. cerevisiae and N. crassa cells were grown as described in each case. S. cerevisiae was always grown at low cell density (<0.3 mg dry weight ml−1), and as a consequence the concentration of glucose was very similar in all experiments (close to 2%). Cells were harvested from the culture medium, suspended in testing buffer (2 × 106 cells ml−1), and exposed to DiOC6(3) cyanine dye (3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocynine iodide, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1 nm for 30 min at 28 °C, in the dark. To test yeast cell viability, propidium iodide was added at the moment of the analysis. Flow cytometric analyses were performed in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) and EPICS XL (Coulter Electronics) flow cytometers, equipped with argon lasers. For the determination of the DiOC6(3) fluorescence, excitation at 488 nm and a 525-nm dichroic LP filter were used. For propidium iodide, a 590-nm dichroic filter and a 610-nm LP absorbance filter were added. Because the cellular fluorescence was size dependent, we normalized all the results measuring the fluorescence of single small cells (25Petit P.X. Glab G.N. Marie D. Kieffer H. Métézeau P. Cytometry. 1996; 23: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In all experiments, a control sample of wild-type cells (W303.1A strain) grown in the arginine medium at 0.5 mm K+ was analyzed in parallel with the other samples, and the fluorescence values given by the flow cytometer were always referred to the fluorescence of the control cells and expressed as a percentage. All measurements were repeated at least in three different days. The kinetic study of the influx of the alkali cations in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells with different K+ contents and the competitive inhibitions exerted between them indicated that these cells took up alkali cations with little differences in affinities (we determined K m values of 60 mm K+, 60 mm Rb+, 110 mm Na+, and 100 mmLi+ in the WΔ3 strain), and without regulation by the K+ content. Although this uptake shows homogeneous kinetics, experiments with different inhibitors showed that it involves different pathways. Ammonium inhibited 45% of the low-affinity Rb+ uptake of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells, but showed no effect over the remaining 55%; low concentrations of Mn2+, and to a lesser extent other divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+), inhibited 30%, but showed no effect on the remaining 70% (Fig.1); and ammonium plus Mn2+(20 mm each) inhibited 60% of the uptake. These results suggest the existence of at least three pathways for Rb+uptake in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells, one inhibited by Mn2+, another inhibited by ammonium and insensitive to Mn2+, and a pathway insensitive to both ions. It is worth mentioning that the described inhibition of Rb+ uptake by ammonium or Mn2+ in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells was different from that found in wild-type cells. In the latter, ammonium was a competitive inhibitor of Rb+ uptake, and Mn2+ and other divalent cations did not show any significant effect (not shown). Rb+ uptake in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells was also found to be very sensitive to uncouplers, much more than in TRK1 TRK2 or TRK1 trk2Δ cells. These experiments were carried out in K+-starved cells, in order to test cells in identical physiological conditions, finding that at 20 μmCCCP, Rb+ influx (initial rate of uptake at 100 mm Rb+) in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells was inhibited by 80–100%, whereas this concentration showed no effect onTRK1 TRK2 cells (Fig. 2). In a different part of the study of the low-affinity K+ uptake of S. cerevisiae , we had isolated mutants suppressing the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotype, and found that many of them mapped on theHXT3 gene, as is consistent with previous reports (14Gaber R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 299-353Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Ko C.H. Liang H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,26Liang H.L. Ko C.H. Herman T. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sequence of the HXT3 mutated genes revealed that some of these mutations were located in the 5′ non-coding region. This suggested that these mutations produced overexpression of the encoded protein, and hence that the wild HXT3 transporter was able to transport K+. To test this possibility, we inserted theHXT3 gene in a multicopy plasmid and transformed it into thetrk1Δ trk2Δ strain, finding that the growth at low K+ was improved significantly (not shown). Considering this result, we searched for other genes which, when overexpressed, suppress the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotype. For this purpose, we transformed a trk1Δ trk2Δ strain with a library of genomic DNA in a multicopy plasmid and screened for clones suppressing the high K+ requirement of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells. Using the ammonium medium with 2 mmK+, we isolated a clone with a 9-kilobase insert containing the YGL077c open reading frame, which encodes the HNM1 choline transporter (27Nikawa J. Hosaka K. Tsukagoshi Y. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By subcloning this gene alone in a multicopy plasmid, we found that HNM1 partially suppressed the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotype (not shown). Although the overexpression of Hxt3p or Hnm1p improved the growth rate of the mutant, it increased less than 10% the rate of Rb+ uptake, suggesting that these proteins made a small contribution to the total K+uptake of trk1Δ trk2Δ cells. The finding that the overexpression of the HXT3 and HNM1 transporters partially suppressed the trk1Δ trk2Δ phenotype, as it is the case of some amino acids and the inositol transporters (16Wright M.B. Ramos J. Gómez M.J. Moulder K. Scherrer M. Munson G. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13647-13652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), gave clear support to the notion that multiple K+ pathways, possibly making small individual contributions, composed the low-affinity K+ uptake in trk1Δ andtrk1Δ trk2Δ mutants. Because the low-affinity K+ uptake does not exist in wild strains, the question was how the lack of one protein, Trk1p, could open all these pathways. Two different reasons could trigger the general response that furnished several different transporters with the capacity of transporting K+, the loss of Trk1p by itself or the K+ deficiency generated by its loss. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used the trk1Δ trk2Δ strain transformed with the HAK1 gene ofSchwanniomyces occidentalis (28Bañuelos M.A. Klein R.D. Alexander S.J.

This gene encodes a K+ transporter not related to Trk1p and Trk2p, that restores K+ uptake, and consequently a normal growth at low K+, in trk1Δ trk2Δ cells (28Bañuelos M.A. Klein R.D. Alexander S.J. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, iftrk1Δ trk2Δ cells expressing Hak1p still kept the low-affinity K+ and Rb+ uptake, the mediation of the K+ deficiency in this uptake could be ruled out. For a high expression of Hak1p in S. cerevisiae , we used two different constructs, placing the coding region of the HAK1 gene under the control of the PGK1 or GAL1 gene promoters. Both constructs transformed into the trk1Δ trk2Δ strain allowed the transformants to grow at K+concentrations even lower than those needed for TRK1 strains. In contrast, in these experiments the low-affinity uptake was present or absent depending on the testing conditions. In thepPGK1-HAK1 transformant, Rb+ influx in K+-starved cells showed only one kinetic component, corresponding to HAK1, whereas in normal K+ cells, Rb+ influx showed both the HAK1 and the low-affinity kinetic components. In the pGAL1-HAK1 transformant, cells grown on galactose (YPG) and tested on galactose showed only the Rb+-influx kinetics of HAK1, but shortly after the transfer to glucose (YPD) they showed both the HAK1 and the low-affinity kinetic components. A longer incubation in glucose progressively decreased the former without affecting the latter (not shown). The results obtained with the HAK1 transporter indicated that Hak1p performed the K+ transport functions of Trk1p, but that only in very special conditions did it prevent the low-affinity Rb+ uptake. Among all the possible causes for this behavior, changes in the membrane potential were the most likely. The working hypothesis was that trk1Δ trk2Δ cells could be hyperpolarized, and that the low-affinity Rb+ uptake required such hyperpolarization. This hypothesis gave a satisfactory explanation to the high sensitivity of the low-affinity Rb+uptake to uncouplers (Fig. 2), and was testable by determining the resistance of the different strains to hygromycin B, an amino glycoside antibiotic for which, as in the case of Dio-9 (29Ulaszewski S. Grenson M. Goffeau A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Ulaszewski S. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 207: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the resistance of the cells depends on their membrane potential (31McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Habber J.E. Mol. Cell.

The tests were performed in YPD, which contains sufficient K+ (15 mm) for normal growth of the trk1Δ trk2Δ strain, using the different mutants in the TRK1 andTRK2 genes, and the trk1Δ trk2Δ strain transformed with the pPGK1-HAK1 gene or the HKT1 cDNA under the control of the PMA1 promoter (TableII). HKT1 encodes a K+-Na+ symporter in wheat (33Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.I. Nature. 1994; 370: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 34Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I.

Biol. 1996; 152: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transformation withHKT1 suppressed the K+ uptake deficiency of ourtrk1Δ trk2Δ strain, consistent with previous results (33Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.I.

The tests of hygromycin B resistance (Table II) showed that the trk1Δ strains, either TRK2 ortrk2Δ , were inhibited by one-fifth of the concentration tolerated by the TRK1 strains, and that HKT1 but not HAK1 suppressed the hypersensitivity of thetrk1Δ trk2Δ strain. In pma1 mutants the sensitivity to hygromycin B depends on the K+ content of the medium (31McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Habber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and we found the same effect in trk mutants. However, even after the addition of 50 mmK+ to the YPD testing medium, the differences were still appreciable (Table II).Table IISensitivity to hygromycin B in S. cerevisiae cells expressing different K+ transportersStrains (genotypes)YPDYPD + 50 mmKClμg ml−1TRK1 TRK250100TRK1 trk250100trk1 TRK21550trk1 trk2 −pYPG151050trk1 trk2 PPGK1HAK12050trk1 trk2 PPMA1HKT175100 Open table in a new tab The different sensitivity to hygromycin B of the trk1Δ andTRK1 cells in a medium which does not impose a K+ limitation on trk1Δ strains indicated that hypersensitivity to hygromycin B could not be a direct consequence of K+ deficiency. The same conclusion could be reached considering that trk1Δ trk2Δ cells expressing Hak1p were also sensitive. Although these cells can grow at K+concentrations one thousand times lower than those existing in YPD (28Bañuelos M.A. Klein R.D. Alexander S.J. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) they were sensitive to hygromycin B. Taken together, these results suggested that the trk1Δ mutation was associated with a hyperpolarized plasma membrane, and that this defect could be suppressed by the expression of some K+ transporters but not by all of those able to complement the K+ uptake deficiency. The electrical membrane potential of yeast cells is not known, but comparative assessments of membrane potentials in different conditions may be obtained with fluorescent cyanine dyes (37Peña A.

To use this dye as a probe for the membrane potential, avoiding the interference of the fluorescence of the internal membranes, we reduced the concentration of the dye in the staining medium (testing buffer) to 1 nm and tested only fermenting cells in which the function of the mitochondria is highly reduced (41Criddel R.S.

https://openalex.org/W2040466763,"Insulin and muscle contraction potently stimulate glucose uptake in mammalian skeletal muscle. Studies in muscle and adipose tissue have shown that insulin induces its receptor-dependent phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2, which leads to activation of polyphosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase. In contrast, muscle contraction stimulates glucose transport via a mechanism that is independent of insulin, but the two pathways may converge downstream at the level of stimulation of GLUT4 translocation. In the present study, we have examined the role of Akt, an insulin-activated serine threonine kinase that has previously been shown to increase glucose transport in adipocytes. Either insulin or in vitro muscle contraction significantly elevated glucose transport in isolated rat epitrochlearis and soleus muscles. However, Akt kinase activity was significantly stimulated by insulin and not contraction. Moreover, wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3′-kinase, completely blocked the insulin-stimulated increase in Akt activity and glucose transport but did not alter either of these parameters in contracting muscles. The increases in Akt activity were paralleled by a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of Akt, indicative of phosphorylation of Akt by an upstream kinase. These changes in Akt mobility appeared to be at least partially because of phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473. A putative downstream target of Akt, p70 S6 kinase, showed similar changes in mobility in response to insulin but not contraction. These data support the view that Akt is a downstream target of PI 3′-kinase and is involved in the signaling pathways involved in insulin but not contraction stimulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle.

These data provide further evidence that two distinct pathways exist for the stimulation of glucose transport in mammalian skeletal muscle. Insulin and muscle contraction are two powerful stimulators of skeletal muscle glucose transport (1Ploug T. Galbo H. Richter E.A. Am. J.

Although it is known that both of these stimuli activate glucose transport by causing the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, the exact nature of the signaling pathways that are involved remains unknown (3Douen A.G.

Presently, insulin has been shown to initiate its signal through tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins and subsequent docking of proteins that contain Src homology 2 sites (6White M.F.

However, this pathway does not appear to be involved in stimulation of glucose transport by muscle contraction (7Yeh J.I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2107-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Although activation of PI 3′-kinase appears necessary for activation of glucose transport by insulin, the identity of the downstream mediators remains largely unknown (6White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Holloszy J.O. Hansen P.A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol;. 1996; 128: 99-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A potential candidate for such a regulator of insulin action is Akt (also known as protein kinase B), a serine threonine/kinase that is activated by insulin and other growth factors (i.e. PDGF) (10Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3′-kinase, also inhibits insulin-stimulated Akt activity (11Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of a dominant negative p85 subunit in 3T3 L1 adipocytes inhibits PDGF-stimulated Akt activity (12Burgering M. Coffer P. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). Although the exact biological function of Akt is unknown, it has been hypothesized to play a role in glycogen metabolism because it phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3, which controls glycogen synthesis (10Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 13Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant in 3T3 L1 adipocytes or in isolated rat adipocytes increased glucose transport by inducing the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (10Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 14Cong L.-N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M. Taylor S. Quon M. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Akt may represent a major PI 3′-kinase effector in insulin stimulation of glucose transport. Although muscle contraction does not stimulate glucose transport by a PI 3′-kinase-dependent mechanism, there is some evidence that there may be a common pathway downstream of PI 3′-kinase. For example, polymyxin B, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, inhibits both insulin- and contraction-stimulated glucose transport (16Henriksen E.J. Sleeper M.D. Zierath J.R. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E662-E667PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that insulin and contraction may share some common signaling step. Because of previous evidence that constitutively active Akt induces GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes (11Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 14Cong L.-N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M. Taylor S. Quon M. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Akt could be activated independently of PI 3′-kinase, we hypothesized that Akt may represent this common step. The role of Akt in contraction-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle has not yet been examined. In the present study, we explored the possible role of Akt in mediating contraction- and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats weighing 100–125 g were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Boston, MA). Upon arrival, rats were housed four to a cage in a temperature-controlled animal room maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. The rats were fed ad libitum National Institutes of Health standard chow and water. Rats in the post-prandial state were anesthetized with 5 mg of sodium pentobarbital/100 g of body weight. Epitrochlearis or soleus muscles were dissected out, blotted on gauze, and transferred to 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 ml of KHB containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 32 mmmannitol, and 8 mm glucose. The flasks were incubated in a shaking water bath maintained at 29 °C for 1 h and were continuously gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2. Soleus muscles were split prior to incubation to allow for proper diffusion of substrate in these muscles (17Henriksen E.J. Holloszy J.O. Acta. Physiol. Scand. 1991; 143: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Prior to incubation under basal conditions (no additions) or stimulation with insulin or contraction, all muscles were allowed to recover (preincubation) for 1 h in the absence of insulin (17Henriksen E.J. Holloszy J.O. Acta. Physiol. Scand. 1991; 143: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following the preincubation, muscles were incubated under basal (no additions) or insulin-stimulated (13.3 nm) conditions for 30 min or electrically stimulated to contract as described below. Wortmannin was dissolved in Me2SO, and when present in the incubations, a similar quantity of Me2SO was added to the control muscles. The concentration of Me2SO added to the incubation medium never exceeded 0.5%. When wortmannin was present during incubation with insulin or contraction, it was also included in the preincubation medium. Following the 30-min incubation, the muscles were frozen between tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen and used for measurement of Akt kinase activity and Western blotting. Alternatively, the muscles were transferred to flasks containing 2 ml of KHB containing 0.1% BSA, 40 mm mannitol, 2 mmpyruvate, and the same additions as in the previous incubation and used for measurement of glucose transport. The flasks were incubated for 10 min at 29 °C to wash out glucose; the gas phase in the flasks was 95% O2/5% CO2. Following the wash step the muscles were used for measurement of 2DG transport as described below. The effect of contraction on glucose transport activity and signaling molecules was investigated using a specially designed apparatus that has been described previously (18Etgen Jr., G.J. Wilson C.M. Jensen J. Cushman S.W. Ivy J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E294-E301PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each muscle was pinned at approximately resting length in a contraction apparatus that is designed such that two platinum electrodes lie on either side of the muscle (Biomedical Instrumentation Group, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). The contraction periods consisted of 200-ms trains of 100 Hz using a model S48 square wave stimulator (Grass Instruments, Warwick, RI) attached to a Stimusplitter (MedLab Instruments, Loveland, CO). The trains were delivered at 2/s at 10–15 V. Glucose transport activity was measured using 2DG as described in detail previously (19Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Pessin J.E. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated muscles were incubated under the experimental conditions described above. Following incubation, the muscles were trimmed of their tendons, blotted, and frozen between tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Muscles were kept stored at −80 °C until processed. Lysates were prepared from the incubated muscles essentially as described previously (20Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Sherman L.A. Carey J. Smith R.J. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen muscles were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaPP, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaVO3, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm 4-(aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride (Pefabloc, Boehringer Mannheim), and 10 μg/ml antipain) and mixed end over end for 45 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then spun at 18,000 ×g for 15 min, and protein was determined on the supernatant via the bicinchoninic method (Pierce) using crystalline BSA as a standard. Aliquots of the supernatant corresponding to 2 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated for 2 h with 5 μl of affinity purified anti-Akt antibody (raised against 16 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of rat Akt 2). Akt activity was measured as described previously (11Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Akt-immunoprecipitated samples or 200 μg of crude lysate protein were prepared for SDS-PAGE by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and were boiled for 2 min. The samples, along with molecular weight markers (Sigma) were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Resolved samples were transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were rinsed in water and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tween Tris-buffered saline (TTBS), pH 7.5, for 1 h. The membranes were rinsed in TTBS and incubated overnight in anti-Akt, anti-p70 S6 kinase (courtesy of Dr. Margaret Chou, University of Pennsylvania), or anti-phospho-Akt antibodies (Ser-473 Antibody kit, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The membranes were rinsed in TTBS and incubated in horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel, Durham, NC) for 2 h. The membranes were then rinsed in TTBS, and the resolved bands were detected via ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Insulin stimulation increased the rate of glucose transport 4- and 5-fold over basal for epitrochlearis and soleus muscles, respectively (Fig.1). Wortmannin (1 μm) completely inhibited the insulin-stimulated increase in transport. Electrically stimulated contraction increased the rate of glucose transport 3-fold in epitrochlearis and 2-fold in soleus muscles. In contrast to insulin stimulation, 1 μm wortmannin did not significantly decrease the rate of contraction-stimulated transport in either muscle. These results are in agreement with previously published data (7Yeh J.I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2107-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Stimulation of muscles by insulin resulted in a significant increase in Akt kinase activity in both epitrochlearis (3-fold over basal) and soleus (2-fold over basal) muscles (Fig. 2). Wortmannin completely inhibited the insulin-stimulated increase in both muscles. Muscle contraction did not significantly alter Akt kinase activity in either muscle type. In response to insulin stimulation, Akt becomes phosphorylated, resulting in a change in its mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (15Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shepherd P. Nave B. Rincon J. Haigh R. Foulstone E. Proud C. Zeirath J. Siddle K. Wallberg-Henriksson H.

Insulin stimulation resulted in a shift in mobility of the Akt band to a higher molecular weight in both epitrochlearis and soleus muscles (Fig.3). In muscles that were stimulated by insulin in the presence of 1 μm wortmannin, this band is absent. Contraction had no effect on the mobility of Akt on a SDS-PAGE gel. Additionally, Western blotting of soleus muscles showed that the shifted Akt band was recognized by an anti-phospho Akt antibody (Fig.4). Blotting of muscles for p70 S6 kinase, a putative downstream effector of Akt that is also activated by phosphorylation, showed a pattern of mobility shift in response to insulin similar to that observed for Akt (Fig.5).Figure 4Detection of phosphorylated Akt in isolated rat soleus muscles.

It remains largely unknown, however, what downstream effector is responsible for the activation of glucose transport by insulin. Several targets have been proposed to mediate this effect of insulin, and most recently attention has focused on the serine-threonine kinase Akt (11Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J.

Activity of this kinase has been shown to be regulated by PI 3′-kinase through binding of Akt to lipid products of PI 3′-kinase and/or increased phosphorylation of Akt on serine residue 473 or threonine residue 308 or through a combination of these events (10Kohn A.D.

Muscle contraction, a second potent stimulator of muscle glucose transport, activates transport through a PI 3′-kinase-independent mechanism (7Yeh J.I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Indeed, much previous evidence has shown that the combined effects of contraction and insulin on glucose transport are additive to one another, which suggests that the two stimuli utilize separate pathways (2Nesher R.

Although muscle contraction and insulin apparently act through different proximal signaling pathways, both affect transport by promoting the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane, and the combined effects of the two stimuli also produce additive effects on plasma membrane GLUT4 content (3Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Rastogi S. Bilan P.J. Cartee G.D. Vranic M. Holloszy J.O. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13427-13430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Goodyear L.J. King P.A. Hirshman M.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27584-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is some evidence that the two pathways may converge. Henriksen et al. (16Henriksen E.J. Sleeper M.D. Zierath J.R. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E662-E667PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that polymyxin B inhibits stimulation of glucose transport by both insulin and muscle contraction. Additionally, Cartee et al. (32Cartee G.D. Briggs-Tung C. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: R70-R75PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, inhibited both insulin- and hypoxia-(which mimics the effects of contraction) stimulated skeletal muscle glucose transport. Because previous studies have shown that activation of Akt elevates glucose transport concomitant with an elevation in surface GLUT4, we hypothesized that Akt may be at this convergence point (11Kohn A.D.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model was particularly appealing, because it has been reported that Akt can be stimulated by both PI 3′-kinase-dependent and independent pathways in the same cell type (33Moule S.K. Welsh G.I.

Interestingly, hyperosmolarity stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes, although it is unlikely that this is mediated by Akt (35Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp S. Pessin J.E.

Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Agents that raise cyclic AMP also stimulate Akt independently of PI 3′-kinase (33Moule S.K. Welsh G.I.

Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast to this hypothesis, however, in vitro contractions did not significantly alter Akt kinase activity or phosphorylation state (as ascertained by electrophoretic mobility and reactivity with a phospho-specific antibody) in either soleus or epitrochlearis muscles (Figs. 3 and 4). This occurred despite the fact that contraction significantly elevated the rate of glucose transport in both muscle types (Fig. 1). Further, contraction did not alter phosphorylation of the putative Akt downstream effector, p70 S6 kinase, again measured by electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5). Thus, these data suggest that activation of Akt is not necessary for stimulation of glucose transport by muscle contraction. Furthermore, they also indicate that if the pathways for stimulation of glucose transport by contraction and insulin converge, they must do so at some step downstream of Akt. Similar to previous results, insulin increased Akt kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation (21Shepherd P. Nave B. Rincon J. Haigh R. Foulstone E. Proud C. Zeirath J. Siddle K. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Krook A. Kawano Y. Song X.M. Efendic S. Roth R.A. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These increases in Akt activity and phosphorylation state correlated with significant increases in glucose transport in both epitrochlearis and soleus muscles. The fact that wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3′-kinase, blocked both the elevations in glucose transport and Akt activity suggests that Akt is a downstream of PI 3′-kinase and may play a role in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Although the present data do not conclusively prove this point, Krook et al. (22Krook A. Kawano Y. Song X.M. Efendic S. Roth R.A. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Akt activity is depressed in muscle from diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats and that this activity is restored by normalizing the blood glucose of the rat with phlorizin. Taken together, these data suggest that Akt may play a major role in insulin- but not contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. In summary the present study has shown that Akt is activated by insulin but not muscle contraction in isolated skeletal muscle. Further, the increase in Akt activity because of insulin requires activation of PI 3′-kinase and appears to be correlated with phosphorylation at serine 473. Finally, these data together with previous studies support the notion that Akt is involved in the stimulation of skeletal muscle glucose transport by insulin. However, the glucose-stimulatory pathways originating at the insulin receptor and at muscle contraction must converge downstream of the Akt protein kinase. The assistance of Cass Lutz and Scott Summers is greatly appreciated."

Cellular phosphorylation products of PI 3-kinases interact with a subset of pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a module that has been shown to recruit proteins to cellular membranes. We have recently identified cytohesin-1, a cytoplasmic regulator of β2 integrin adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1. We describe here that expression of a constitutively active PI 3-kinase is sufficient for the activation of Jurkat cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and for enhanced membrane association of cytohesin-1. Up-regulation of cell adhesion by PI 3-kinase and membrane association of endogenous cytohesin-1 is abrogated by overexpression of the isolated cytohesin-1 PH domain, but not by a mutant of the PH domain which fails to associate with the plasma membrane. The PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), although strongly associated with the plasma membrane, had no effect on either membrane recruitment of cytohesin-1 or on induction of adhesion by PI 3-kinase. Having delineated the critical steps of the β2 integrin activation pathway by biochemical and functional analyses, we conclude that PI 3-kinase activates inside-out signaling of β2 integrins at least partially through cytohesin-1.

Integrins are a diverse family of heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that are present on most vertebrate cell types. They are known to play important roles either in development, or in somatic functions such as wound healing, and the regulation of complex cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions within the immune system (1Hynes R.O.

Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). The avidity of integrins for their ligands is dependent on the activation state of the cell on which they are expressed (4Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This type of regulation of cell adhesion has been termed inside-out signaling, because intracellular signaling pathways, triggered by,e.g. , protein-tyrosine kinase or G-protein-coupled receptors, have been shown to contribute to integrin-mediated adhesiveness (5Ginsberg M.H.

All of these receptors are capable of inducing integrin activation, and PI 3-kinase has therefore been implicated in the up-regulation of cell adhesiveness (19Chan A.S. Mobley J.L. Fields G.B.

PI 3-kinase has also been strongly implicated in the activation of the aIIbβ3 integrin in platelets and megakaryocytic cells, respectively (24Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C.

However, the precise nature of the underlying mechanisms remained unknown because, first, the proximal regulatory elements of integrin affinity modulation were not characterized, and, second, the cellular mode of action of PI 3-kinase was not well understood. Recently, candidate cytoplasmic regulatory factors of integrin activation have been identified, either by biochemical methods or with the help of the two-hybrid system (26Coppolino M.

Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). One of them, cytohesin-1, is a 47-kDa intracellular protein that interacts specifically in several systems with the cytoplasmic domain of the leukocyte integrin αLβ2 (CD11a/18, LFA-1) (29Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Cytohesin-1 bears a short amino-terminal domain that may aid in oligomerization, an extended central homology region that is similar to the yeast Sec7 protein, and a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Overexpression of cytohesin-1 or subdomain constructs in the Jurkat T cell line was shown to have pronounced in vitro effects on the binding of αLβ2 to its ligand, the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Whereas the overexpression of full-length cytohesin-1 resulted in a constitutive adhesion of αLβ2, expression of the PH domain construct specifically inhibited the activation of LFA-1 in a dominant negative fashion. Since the PH domain was not found to be mediating the interaction with the integrin cytoplasmic domain, it has been postulated that its unidentified cellular ligand may be an upstream component of the inside-out signaling pathway of αLβ2. The finding that the overexpressed, isolated Sec7 domain acted only as a partial agonist pointed in the same direction (29Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). PH domains are structural modules present in more than 100 proteins that play known or postulated roles in signal transduction. It is a commonly found thread that PH domains may aid in membrane recruitment of proteins through their interactions with phosphorylated ligands present at the inner leaflet of cellular membranes (30Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

The PH domains of Akt, Btk, and of GRP-1, a close homolog of cytohesin-1, have been demonstrated to belong to the latter group because they bind either phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (Akt), or phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) with high affinity (38Franke T.F.

One of the important topics that remain to be addressed is the characterization of the lymphocyte inside-out signaling pathway proximal to the integrin cytoplasmic domains. In this study, we show for the first time that a constitutively active version of PI 3-kinase suffices to activate the αLβ2 adhesion pathway in a T cell line. Functional, biochemical, and cell biological evidence is provided, which suggests that cytohesin-1 is located downstream of PI 3-kinase and that it is regulated by the recruitment of its PH domain to the plasma membrane. Cytoplasmic immunoglobulin fusion proteins have been described previously (29Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment for the PH domain of murine Btk (corresponding to amino acids 8–170) has been subcloned into pcIgTkg vaccinia expression vector (29Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L.

The cDNAs for Myc-P110* and Myc-P110*Δ(917–950) were subcloned into the pTkg vaccinia expression vector (70Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Jurkat E6 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses as described (29Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). 6 h after infection, cells were labeled with 12 μg/ml bisbenzimide H33342 fluorochrome trihydrochloride (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS), and delivered to 96-well plates (Nunc, Maxisorp) at 1.5 × 105/well. Prior to adhesion, plates were coated with goat anti-human IgG (Fcγ-specific) antibody at 0.85 μg/well for 90 min at 25 °C, blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, incubated with culture supernatants from COS cells expressing ICAM-1-Rg fusion protein, and subsequently used in the assay. Where indicated in the figures, cells were incubated with 100 nmwortmannin (Sigma) 0.5 h prior to the adhesion assay. Cells were then allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C, and unbound cells were carefully washed off with 3 × 300 μl of HBSS. Bound cells were assayed in 100 μl of 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS using a fluorescence plate reader (Cytofluor II, PerSeptive). The signal of 1.5 × 105 cells/well at 490 nmcorresponds to 100% adhesion. Each value is the mean of two determinations carried out in triplicate. Displacement assay for [3H]IP4 binding activity was carried out according to Ref. 71Yagisawa H. Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Sakuma K. Tanaka H. Yabuta N. Kamata H. Hirata H. Nojima H.

After incubation with 10 nm [3H]IP4 for 10 min on ice, increasing amounts of unlabeled inositol phosphate were added for 15 min. Then samples were transferred to ultraspin microfilters (M r cut-off: 105) and washed with 50 μl of MBSD by centrifugation at 1500 × g . Protein-bound radioactivity was eluted by MBSD, containing 200 mm imidazole. Samples were collected by centrifugation and counted by solid phase scintillation. Values were corrected for nonspecific binding of 10 nm[3H]IP4 to nickel-agarose. Each value represents the mean of two determinations carried out in duplicate. Purified polyhistidine-tagged full-length cytohesin-1 derived from expression in E. coli BL21 at 10 μm was mixed with 10 nm[3H]IP4 and [3H]d-Ins(1,4,5)P3, respectively, and with 20 μm of the appropriate unlabeled isomer in MBSD. The mixture was applied to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Fast Desalting Column HR. The elution position of the protein was monitored at 215 nm with the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Scintillation counting was used to detect the elution position of the radioactively labeled inositol phosphates. Binding specificity was assessed with a mixture of 10 nm[3H]IP4 and purified GST. Cells which had been infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses or uninfected cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended on ice in 0.5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic solution (HS: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then cells were sheared, the nuclei were removed, and the supernatant cytosol was collected as described (72Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoyberard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A.R.A. Mol.

The cytosolic fraction was brought to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 and 150 mm NaCl and used directly for immunoprecipitation. The pellet was resuspended, washed with HS, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in HS containing 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 and 150 mm NaCl, centrifuged, and the supernatant representing the particulate fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation at Protein A-Sepharose employing an antigen-purified antibody directed against cytohesin-1 (29Kolanus W.

Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by standard Western blot techniques. To assess that cytoplasmic contents were not trapped in the particulate fraction, lactate dehydrogenase activities were monitored as described (59Ma A.D. Brass L.F. Abrams C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Six hours after infection of Jurkat E6 cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses, cells were placed on poly-l-lysine-covered microscope slides for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were then washed off with HBSS, and adherent cells were fixed and immobilized with freshly prepared 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with 2% (w/v) glycine in PBS, and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Fcγ-specific) antibody (Dianova) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. In double labeling experiments, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-coupled phalloidin (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml was included. After the final wash with PBS, slides were mounted on a 9:1 mixture of glycerol and 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, containingn -propyl-gallate at 20 mg/ml as antifading reagent. Then samples were either examined on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using a Zeiss Neofluar 40 × 1.3 oil immersion objective, or on a confocal laser scanning apparatus (Leica TCS-NT system, Leica) attached to a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope with a PLAPO 63 × 1.32 oil immersion objective. Conventional immunofluorescence images were recorded on Kodak T-MAX 400ASA film. Confocal images were collected as 512 × 512 pixel files and processed with the help of the Photoshop program (Adobe). Six hours after infection of Jurkat E6 cells with recombinant Myc-P110* and Ig control, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, containing 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin at 10 μg/ml, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After collection of the supernatant by centrifugation at 15,000 × g , the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (monoclonal antibody 9E10) for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by Protein A-Sepharose 6 MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. For detection of p110* -expression, precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis, using monoclonal antibody 9E10 as first antibody. The assay for immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase activity was essentially carried out according to Ref. 73Auger K.R. Songyang Z. Lo S.H. Roberts T.M. Chen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23452-23457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar with modifications. Following washing of the precipitates with lysis buffer, subsequent washes were performed with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA three times and with kinase buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA twice. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μg of sonicated phosphatidylinositol (PI). The reaction was started by adding 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm ATP. After incubation of the sample for 20 min at 25 °C with agitation, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 6 n HCl and the radiolabeled lipid was extracted with 160 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) by brief mixing. Thin layer chromatography was run with the chloroform extracts on a Silica Gel 60 plate (Merck) using a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:concentrated NH3:water (60:47:2:11). Radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol was visualized by autoradiography. Large unilamellar liposomes were generated by dialysis according to (74Philippot J.R. Mutaftschiev S. Liautard J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 734: 137-143Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Liposomes contained 60% (w/w) β-palmitoyl-γ-oleoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 30% (w/w) dioleoyl-l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol, obtained from Sigma and 10% (w/w) PI(3,4,5)P3 (Mantreya, Inc.). Lipids were dried and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.7 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, containing 50 mm n -octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. After removal of detergent by dialysis, liposomes were deposited onto an IAsys surface (FCS-0301, not derivatized) at 0.1 mg of lipid/ml of PBS. Subsequently, remaining unspecific binding sites were blocked by GST and binding of either GST-cytohesin-1 or its mutant GST-cytohesin-1 (R281C) was analyzed at 2.5 μg/ml. Cuvette was regenerated by subsequent washing with 1 n NaOH/1% (w/v) SDS, water, 1 n HCl, water, and methanol. Previous reports implicated a role of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of integrin-mediated adhesiveness (see Introduction and references therein). We therefore investigated whether a constitutively active PI 3-kinase can up-regulate lymphocyte adhesion directly. Overexpression of the catalytic subunit of mammalian PI 3-kinase is usually not sufficient for a constitutively active phenotype, but three groups have recently generated chimeric, mutant, or membrane-associated versions of PI 3-kinase, which were shown to result in an activation of cellular signaling pathways of fibroblast-like cells (42Hu Q.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A chimera (p110*) that comprises the catalytic subunit (p110) of murine PI 3-kinase, fused at the amino terminus to a regulatory domain derived from the p85 subunit (42Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), was used in this study (Fig.1 A ). A kinase deficient variant of p110*, bearing a short in-frame deletion (33 amino acids; Δ917–950) within the kinase domain, served as control (Fig.1 A ). Using recombinant vaccinia viruses, p110* or the kinase defective derivative thereof were expressed in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 E ), and detected with a monoclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal Myc tag. Lipid kinase activity of the chimeric protein was assayed by its ability to specifically phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol in vitro (Fig. 1 E ). Subsequently the effect of p110* expression on αLβ2-mediated adhesion of Jurkat cells was analyzed. A 5-fold increase of adhesion to ICAM-1 was observed for cells that had been infected with vaccinia viruses expressing p110*, as compared with cells infected with control viruses (Fig. 1 B ). Stimulation of these cells with an anti-T cell receptor antibody, or overexpression of cytohesin-1 by recombinant vaccinia viruses, which had previously been shown to be sufficient for the activation of the αLβ2 integrin in Jurkat cells (29Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), were used as positive controls in this assay (Fig. 1 B ). Inhibitors of PI 3-kinase activity were then used to investigate the role of PI 3-kinase in Jurkat cell adhesion to ICAM-1 in greater detail (Fig. 1 C ). We found that preincubation of Jurkat E6 cells for 0.5 h with known inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (46Shimizu Y. Hunt S.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), either 50 nm wortmannin or 50 μm LY294002, inhibited OKT3-induced adhesion completely, whereas the responses to PMA or Mn2+ were not affected, the latter result being consistent with a previous report (23Driessens M.H. van Hulten H.P. van Rijthoren E.A. Soede R.D. Roos E. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 231: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PI 3-kinase acts downstream of the T cell antigen receptor in the LFA-1 adhesion pathway. p110* was partially inhibited, probably because the consequences of expression of p110* expression cannot fully be reversed when the indicated concentrations of inhibitors and short incubation times are used. Although prolonged incubation (i.e. several hours, data not shown) with Ly294002 or wortmannin reduced the adhesion levels induced by p110* dramatically, we found that all responses, including adhesion induced by phorbol ester and Mn2+ were strongly affected in this case, probably attributable to some rather nonspecific, global effect. LFA-1-dependent adhesion mediated by overexpression of cytohesin-1 was partially affected, suggesting that this phenotype is at least in part independent of PI 3-kinase, consistent with the idea that cytohesin-1 may be located downstream of PI 3-kinase. Taken together, these findings indicate that a constitutively PI 3-kinase is sufficient for the up-regulation of β2 integrin-mediated cell adhesiveness. How is PI 3-kinase coupled to the regulation of integrin activity? We postulated that the PH domain of cytohesin-1 may provide a link between the activation of cell adhesion mediated by PI 3-kinase and the recruitment of cytohesin-1 to the plasma membrane. Therefore, membrane recruitment of cytohesin-1 in the Jurkat cell line was assessed biochemically by the separation of crude cell extracts. Localization of either overexpressed cytohesin-1 or the isolated PH domain in the cytosolic or the particulate fractions was detected by Western blot analysis. We found that a substantial fraction of both full-length cytohesin-1 and the isolated PH domain was associated with membranes (Fig. 2, A andB ). Is the membrane recruitment mediated by the cytohesin-1 PH domain associated with its cellular function? To answer this question, we generated a point mutant (R281C) of the PH domain, which corresponds to a residue in the PH domain of Btk that had previously been shown to important for PIP3 binding and cellular function (39Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. G"
https://openalex.org/W2104153977,"Platelet interaction with soluble and insoluble collagens was characterized through binding studies. In contrast to resting platelets, cells reacted with activators, TS2/16 (integrin α2β1-activating antibody), thrombin, collagen-related peptide, or ADP, exhibited specific soluble collagen binding that is Mg2+-dependent, but inhibited by prostaglandin I2, Ca2+, and Gi9 (anti-integrin α2β1 antibody). Each platelet has 1500–3500 soluble collagen binding sites, with a dissociation constant of 3.5–9 × 10−8m. This is the first study to show the specific binding of soluble collagen to platelets; our data strongly suggest that the receptor is integrin α2β1 after it becomes activated upon platelet activation. These results suggest that activation of platelets transforms integrin α2β1 to a state with higher affinity binding sites for soluble collagen. The soluble collagen-platelet interaction was compared with the platelet interaction with fibrillar collagen, which has until now not been demonstrated to bind specifically to platelets. Here, we demonstrated specific, biphasic fibrillar collagen binding. One phase is rapid and metal ion-independent, and accounts for most of the binding. The other phase is slow and Mg2+-dependent. The characteristic differences in the specific bindings of soluble and fibrous collagens demonstrate the different contributions of two different collagen receptors.

When platelets react with collagen, they form aggregates after activation of their signal transduction systems through processes involving many reactions including calcium release, formation of phosphoinositides, and phosphorylation of proteins. Platelets can also adhere to an immobilized collagen surface. Collagen is one of the main components of the vascular subendothelium and becomes exposed to the blood stream when endothelial cells are damaged. These observations suggest that the interaction of platelets with collagen is one of the first, requisite reactions in thrombus formation under physiological conditions. The interaction of platelets with collagen has been studied under two conditions. One approach is to analyze platelet adhesion and aggregation onto a collagen-coated surface under flow conditions using whole blood (1Sakariassen K.S. Aarts P.A.M.M. De Groot P.G. Houdijk W.P.M.

Blood. 1996; 88: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This method observes platelet adhesion under flow conditions that closely simulate physiological conditions, and the fact that platelets adhere and aggregate under these conditions shows that the interaction with collagen is involved in physiological thrombus formation. Alternatively, platelet adhesion on a collagen-coated surface can be analyzed under static conditions; this type of assay uses washed platelets instead of whole blood (6Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 7Moroi M. Okuma M. Jung S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In both systems, two platelet glycoproteins, glycoprotein (GP) 1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; PGI2, prostaglandin I2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CRP, collagen-related peptide; GRGDS, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser; GRGES, Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser; TRAP, thrombin receptor agonist peptide (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF); PRP, platelet-rich plasma. 1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; PGI2, prostaglandin I2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CRP, collagen-related peptide; GRGDS, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser; GRGES, Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser; TRAP, thrombin receptor agonist peptide (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF); PRP, platelet-rich plasma. Ia/IIa, also known as integrin α2β1, and GP VI were found to participate in platelet adhesion to the collagen surface. However, the direct binding of collagen to platelets has not been studied in detail because soluble collagen did not bind to platelets. Resting platelets do not react with soluble collagen. They only react with insoluble collagen fibers or an immobilized collagen surface, both substrates having physical properties that made it very difficult to analyze the binding reaction of platelets and collagen. Gordon and Dingle (8Gordon J.L. Dingle J.T. J. Cell. Sci. 1974; 16: 157-166PubMed Google Scholar) reported that collagen did not bind to platelets until it became fibrillar. Binding of platelets to radiolabeled insoluble collagen particles was indicated to be a very fast reaction and Mg2+-independent (9Mazurov A.V. Idel'son G.L. Khachikyan M.V. Domogatskii S.P. Biokhimiya. 1988; 54: 1280-1289Google Scholar), but they could not find measurable specific binding of labeled collagen fibrils to platelets under their conditions. Thus, their binding data were not suitable for kinetic analysis of the binding reaction. Our present study is the first to demonstrate the binding of soluble collagen to platelets and the kinetic analyses of this reaction. The soluble collagen binding is Mg2+-dependent, and the activation of integrin α2β1 is involved in this reaction. In addition, we were also able to demonstrate the specific binding of fibrous collagen particles by platelets, finding that the major portion of this binding is Mg ion-independent. These results suggest that the two collagen receptors, integrin α2β1 and a Mg2+-independent collagen receptor, probably GP VI, would be involved in the collagen-platelet interaction with different specificities. Bovine type III collagen and human type III collagen were obtained from Koken Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and Fuji Chem. Ind. Co., Ltd. (Takaoka, Toyama, Japan), respectively. Both collagens were dialyzed against 136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mmNaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4 (buffer A) at 4 °C. After dialysis, the collagen solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The resultant collagen gel was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 20 min to obtain the supernatant and the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 25 °C, and the obtained supernatant solution was used as soluble collagen. This soluble collagen was stored at 4 °C until used in the experiments. The collagen pellet obtained after centrifugation was washed once with buffer A and then suspended with buffer A at the concentration of about 1 mg/ml. The suspended collagen was sonicated for 1 min three times with a sonicator attached with a cup horn (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics Inc., Farmingdale, NY), which was cooled by ice. The obtained microparticles of collagen suspensions were used as insoluble collagen. Soluble collagen was radiolabeled with Na125I by using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the preparation of125I-labeled insoluble collagen, collagen dialyzed against buffer A was labeled on ice by using IODO-BEADS and dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C. 125I-Labeled collagen was polymerized at 37 °C and centrifuged, and the pellet of labeled collagen obtained was processed as described above to make labeled insoluble collagen microparticles (fibrillar collagen). The specific radioactivities ranged between 3 and 9 × 104cpm/μg. The data presented in this paper are those obtained with bovine collagen. Similar data were obtained with human collagen, but its limited availability made it more feasible to employ bovine collagen for extensive studies. The concentrations of soluble and fibrillar collagen were determined by assaying the protein by the bicinchoninic protein assay (10Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18590) Google Scholar), with collagen as the standard protein. The molar concentration was calculated with 3 × 105 as the molecular weight of collagen. Whole blood was drawn from the cubital vein of healthy volunteers into 0.1 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. After platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained, platelets were sedimented from PRP by centrifugation at 900 × g for 12 min after the addition of sodium prostaglandin I2(PGI2) (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) at the final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. The centrifuged platelets were washed once with 6.85 mm citrate, 130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 6.5; and the washed platelets were finally suspended with buffer A containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at concentrations of 1–3 × 109 cells/ml. To ensure that the125I-labeled soluble collagen mixture consisted of only soluble collagen, just prior to use in each experiment, an aliquot of the preparation was warmed at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 56,000 × g for 60 min at 25 °C (Beckman TL-100 Ultracentrifuge with a TLA 100.3 rotor; Beckman, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The supernatant was removed and used as the soluble collagen preparation for the experiments. Routinely, an aliquot of the supernatant was retained for subsequent determination of protein concentration. The selection of the optimum reaction conditions and separation procedures was based on the data described under “Results.” For the soluble collagen binding experiments, non-siliconized tubes were used. Washed platelet suspensions were used for all the experiments. The complete mixture (final volume of 50–70 μl) for determination of total binding consisted of 2 mm MgCl2,125I-labeled soluble collagen, any desired reagents such as inhibitors or antibodies, 0.2% BSA, and 4 × 108platelets/ml (unless otherwise stated) in buffer A.125I-Labeled soluble collagen was used at a concentration of about 75–100 nm in most experiments, except for the kinetic studies for determination of binding parameters where the stated range of concentrations was employed. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding an approximately 100-fold excess of unlabeled soluble bovine collagen or 5 mm EDTA (further described under “Results”) to reaction mixtures containing the other components of the total binding mixture. Platelets were usually added last to the reaction tubes containing the remaining reagents to initiate the binding reaction. Four to eight replicates for each binding condition were used. Binding was allowed to occur for 80 min at room temperature, without agitating the reaction mixtures. Then, each reaction mixture was processed by a procedure based on the method described by Mazurov et al. (9Mazurov A.V. Idel'son G.L. Khachikyan M.V. Domogatskii S.P. Biokhimiya. 1988; 54: 1280-1289Google Scholar), which was modified to optimize the separation of platelet-bound soluble collagen from the unbound soluble collagen; each reaction mixture was layered over a 250-μl pad of 20% sucrose in buffer A containing 0.2% BSA in a needle-tipped 0.3-ml narrow-tipped microcentrifuge tube (Assist, Tokyo, Japan) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge (model MRX-150, MRX-150 rotor; Tomy, Tokyo, Japan) for 5 min at 20 °C. The tubes were placed in a −80 °C freezer for at least 30 min. The tips of the frozen tubes containing the platelets/platelet-bound soluble collagen were then cut off by scissors, individually placed in counting tubes, and the radioactivity determined in an Aloka Auto Well γ system (model ARC-1000m; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Just prior to use in each experiment, the 125I-labeled collagen microparticles (prepared as described above) were processed by the following procedure to sort out collagen microparticles of an appropriate size range,i.e. would bind well to resting platelets, but also not large enough to be pelleted under the conditions of the centrifugation assay (see “Results” for description of how the optimum conditions were chosen). An aliquot of the labeled microparticular collagen was sonicated for 1 min at 60% power, three times with a 1-min interval between each, by a sonicator attached with a cup horn under cooling with ice. The sonicated suspension was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm (250 × g ) for 3 min in the MRX-150 high speed micro-refrigerated centrifuge; the supernatant obtained was used for the binding studies. For the binding experiments of insoluble collagen, siliconized tubes and tips were used. The total binding mixture (total volume of 50 μl) contained 5 mm EDTA or 2 mmMg2+, any agents to be tested, microparticular suspension of 125I-labeled fibrillar collagen at the desired concentrations, and 0.4–4 × 108 platelets/ml in buffer A containing 0.2% BSA. In the experiments where Mg2+ was employed, the washed platelet suspensions were added with 0.1 μg/ml PGI2 and 10 μmindomethacin, to prevent aggregation, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min before aliquots of them were added to the binding mixtures. When binding was performed in the presence of EDTA, PGI2and indomethacin were not added unless the EDTA-containing binding experiment was performed to compare the results with those in the Mg2+-containing one. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an 80–100-fold excess, as estimated by protein concentration, of unlabeled bovine fibrillar collagen, microparticle suspension prepared in a manner similar to the labeled material. Platelets were added last to tubes containing the remaining binding mixture components to initiate the binding reaction, and incubation was carried out for 60 min at room temperature with gentle shaking on a shaking table, to prevent the settling of the microparticles of collagen. Each sample was then layered over a 250-μl pad of 20% sucrose and 2% BSA, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, and processed for counting as described above for soluble collagen binding. In the soluble collagen binding experiments, specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding obtained in the presence of excess unlabeled collagen or 5 mm EDTA. In the fibrillar collagen binding experiments, total binding and nonspecific binding were first corrected by subtracting the experimentally determined value for pelleted labeled fibrillar collagen in the absence and presence of excess unlabeled fibrillar collagen, respectively (see “Results” for further description). Specific binding was then calculated by subtracting the corrected nonspecific binding from the corrected total binding. Kinetic analyses of the data to obtain the binding parameters were performed by non-linear regression analyses by the software Prism (Version 2.01; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Other data analyses were also performed by the same program. Collagen-related peptide (CRP) was synthesized by the method of Morton et al. (11). The peptide Tyr-Gly-Lys-Hyp-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)10-Gly-Lys-Hyp-Gly, was synthesized by Tana Laboratories, L.C. (Houston, TX) using standard Fmoc (N -(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase chemistry. The peptide was dissolved in phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and then it was cross-linked with 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 1 h on ice (11Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The obtained CRP was dialyzed against buffer A and used for the experiments. The obtained CRP aggregated platelets in PRP at the concentrations of 0.2 μg/ml or higher. Monoclonal antibodies, P2 (anti-GP IIb/IIIa), SZ2 (anti-GP Ib), and Gi-9 (anti-integrin α2β1), were purchased from Immunotech (Luminy, France). The anti-GP Ib monoclonal antibody NNKY5–5 (12Yanabu M. Ozaki Y. Nomura S. Miyake T. Miyazaki Y. Kagawa H. Yamanaka Y. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Kume S. Komiyama Y. Fukuhara S.

Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly given to us by Dr. Shosaku Nomura, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan and by Drs. Yuji Saito and Junichi Takagi, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, respectively. Ristocetin and ADP were obtained from Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA. Peptides Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) and Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser (GRGES) were synthesized in our laboratory with a model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the FastMoc method according to the company's protocol (5Moroi M. Jung S.M. Shinmyozu K. Tomiyama Y. Ordinas A. Diaz-Ricart M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin and the thrombin receptor agonist TRAP (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF) were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), respectively. The centrifugation conditions for maximizing platelet sedimentation with the minimum of labeled collagen sedimentation was established by using51Cr-labeled platelets and 125I-labeled soluble or microparticular fibrillar collagen. As shown in Fig.1, platelet sedimentation was not affected by the presence of an excess of unlabeled soluble collagen in either the presence or absence of 2 mm Mg2+; greater than 96% platelet pelleting was obtained in about 4–5 min at 12,000 rpm as judged by the amount of sedimented 51Cr. Addition of 5 mm EDTA to the platelet mixtures containing excess collagen and 2 mm MgCl2 did not affect the sedimentation properties (data not shown). There was very little pelleting of the precentrifuged labeled soluble collagen at centrifugation times as high as 10 min; the amount sedimented varied among different soluble collagen preparations, but usually was less than 1% of the added 25I counts, and the sedimented amount plateaued before 5 min of centrifugation. In contrast, the situation with microparticles of labeled fibrillar collagen was quite different. The presence of the fibrillar collagen substantially slowed the rate of platelet sedimentation (Fig.2, left graph ). Furthermore, the presence of excess unlabeled fibrillar collagen affected the sedimentation of labeled collagen fibrils (Fig. 2, right graph ). Although some labeled collagen was sedimented in the absence of excess unlabeled collagen, its inclusion resulted in 1.5–3-fold higher levels of labeled collagen sedimentation at all centrifugation times and speeds. The conditions of 10-min centrifugation time at 12,000 rpm were chosen to optimize the pelleting of platelets (>95%), and the effect of high concentrations of unlabeled collagen fibrils, which were required for the establishment of nonspecific binding, was corrected for by determining how much125I-labeled fibrillar collagen is sedimented in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled fibrillar collagen at each concentration of labeled fibrillar collagen employed in an experiment. This had to be done for each experimental session because the preparation of collagen fibrils would be expected to be different on each occasion, even though the size of the fibrils may lie within a similar range. Platelets were preincubated with TS2/16 (5 μg/ml), thrombin (0.5 units/ml), or CRP (0.5 μg/ml) for 0–30 min to determine if preincubation of platelets with the agents affected the activation of their soluble collagen binding. As shown in Fig.3, the bindings of the platelets preincubated with TS2/16, thrombin, or CRP for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min were similar to that observed when the respective agent was added simultaneously (0 min) with the 125I-labeled collagen (about 100 nm) to initiate the binding reaction. Platelets not activated by the addition of one of the agents showed little or no binding. Therefore, we performed the following binding experiments without preincubation. Soluble collagen binding to agonist-activated platelets reached equilibrium within about 70–80 min. Typical of the time courses observed are those for TS2/16- and thrombin-activated platelets shown in Fig. 4. Control mixtures that contained no activating agents showed a very low level of counts sedimenting along with the platelet pellet; this might be due to a small amount of sedimentable soluble collagen, the amount which varied with the collagen preparation, or platelets may have become slightly activated during the platelet preparation procedures or during the incubation period. In this figure, TS2/16-activated platelets bound more soluble collagen than the thrombin-activated platelets. Although we observed a similar phenomena numerous times in the course of our experiments, in other instances, thrombin induced soluble collagen binding to levels comparable to those by TS2/16. This could be explained by the instability of platelet activation with thrombin. Platelets apparently have an optimum concentration of thrombin for their maximum activation, which varied from individual to individual. In contrast, TS2/16-activated platelets showed stable binding activity with high capacity. The effects of metal ions on soluble collagen binding to activated platelets activated by ADP, thrombin, TS2/16, or CRP are shown in TableI. The actual amounts of binding and the extent of metal ion effect differed among individuals. For platelets activated by any of the agents, soluble collagen binding was Mg2+-dependent. More specific binding was observed in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ than 1 mm; and in each experiment, specific binding induced by the agonists in the presence of either concentration of Mg2+was higher than that observed in the control platelets to which no metal ions had been added. The control platelets in the 2 mm Mg2+ experiment showed a significant amount of soluble collagen binding in the absence of added activator, suggesting that in some cases, there may have been some activation during the platelet isolation procedures. Because of this, the percent increase in soluble collagen binding relative to the control was less prominent, especially in the 2 mm Mg2+experiments (see explanation in the next paragraph). Compared with the binding in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+, that in the presence of Mn2+ was higher.Table IEffect of metal ions on the specific binding of soluble collagen to activated plateletsActivating agentExperimentNo added metal ionsMg2+ (1 mm)Mg2+ (2 mm)Mn2+ (2 mm)Mg2+ (1 mm) Ca2+ (1 mm)Ca2+ (2 mm)EDTA (5 mm)TS216 (5 μg/ml)17.2 ± 4.740.1 ± 8.070.6 ± 3.05.9 ± 3.02.1 ± 2.114.4 ± 10.624.7 ± 13.442.5 ± 6.5112.9 ± 23.517.2 ± 3.716.4 ± 6.75.6 ± 4.1485.9 ± 3.199.0 ± 3.6222.0 ± 5.4CRP (0.2 μg/ml)21.9 ± 2.627.6 ± 3.264.0 ± 5.223.7 ± 6.010.8 ± 1.73.0 ± 1.9336.3 ± 12.231.9 ± 14.946.8 ± 10.2−6.8 ± 17.60.0 ± 9.2−5.4 ± 14.6Thrombin(0.1 units/ml)462.8 ± 4.077.9 ± 5.7139.9 ± 5.2(0.5 units/ml)29.7 ± 4.135.1 ± 6.060.1 ± 3.026.9 ± 3.54.7 ± 1.78.2 ± 0.6ADP (20 μm)21.1 ± 1.326.6 ± 2.468.0 ± 8.25.0 ± 1.73.9 ± 3.05.4 ± 1.9317.6 ± 9.232.2 ± 7.846.8 ± 21.719.0 ± 8.86.1 ± 11.527.1 ± 12.2Control (buffer)111.0 ± 4.716.5 ± 3.042.7 ± 3.00.9 ± 5.911.4 ± 5.53.4 ± 4.722.4 ± 1.520.3 ± 1.552.2 ± 1.54.5 ± 1.12.8 ± 1.10.9 ± 2.638.8 ± 8.1−4.8 ± 7.842.4 ± 6.45.1 ± 5.46.8 ± 5.49.2 ± 8.54−0.1 ± 2.610.2 ± 3.2119.1 ± 5.1Each experiment was performed on a different day with platelets from a different individual.

Because platelets from different individuals showed variable sensitivities to the activating agents, only values from the same person can be validly compared with each other. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled soluble collagen in all experiments except for experiment 4, in which 5 mm EDTA was used. Specific binding is reported as femtomoles/106 platelets. As illustrated in Fig. 5, a more detailed examination of the Mg2+ concentration dependence in the cases of two activators, TS2/16 (5 μg/ml) and thrombin (0.1 units/ml), indicates that saturation with Mg2+ occurs around 2 mm for the bindings induced by both activators, since the specific binding of soluble collagen plateaus after this level of metal ion. As seen from the control curve (no added activators), there is indeed some increase in soluble collagen binding as higher concentrations of this divalent ion are included in the reaction mixture; because the saturation level for this low level of binding (a maximum of about 10%) occurs at about the same concentration as the TS2/16 and thrombin curves, it is likely due to some activation of the platelets during the isolation procedures or incubation, instead of an independent activation by Mg2+itself which would likely show a different Mg2+ ion dependence. For all the activators, little binding occurred in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. The level observed in the presence of 5 mm EDTA was similar to that observed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled soluble collagen (about 350 μg/ml), which we added to assess nonspecific binding in the preliminary experiments. Because of this, we employed 5 mm EDTA to assess nonspecific binding; this allowed us to determine nonspecific binding at higher concentrations of labeled soluble collagen where it would otherwise not have been possible to obtain the 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand required because of the limitation of how high a concentration of soluble collagen in solution can be achieved. For the ADP-, thrombin-, TS2/16-, or CRP-activated platelets, little binding was seen in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+; when both 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mmMg2+ were present, specific binding was lower than that seen in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ alone. These observations indicate the inhibitory effect of calcium ion as reported by Santoro (6Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A similar study performed with thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) (20–95 μm) indicated that it could also activate platelets to bind soluble collagen, although it was a weaker activator than thrombin because the maximum amount of binding induced by this agent was less than that obtained with thrombin (data not shown). The specific binding of soluble collagen to TRAP-activated platelets showed the same ion dependence as the bindings induced by the above agents (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of PGI2 markedly decreased the specific binding in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ in thrombin- or CRP-activated platelets. On the other hand, it did not inhibit the specific binding of TS2/16-activated platelets. In the ADP-induced platelets, soluble collagen binding was low, so it was difficult to assess the effect of PGI2 accurately. The results illustrated in Fig.7 show typical data observed in four separate experiments with different platelets and soluble bovine collagen preparations, with 0.1 units/ml thrombin as the platelet activating agent. Compared with the specific binding in the absence of any inhibitor, taken as 100% in the figure, the specific binding of soluble collagen was inhibited by the anti-GP Ia/IIa antibody Gi9 (10 μg/ml) to a level similar to that observed with PGI2 (0.1 μg/ml), but antibodies P2 (anti-GP IIb/IIIa, 10 μg/ml), NNKY5–5 (anti-GP Ib, 10 μg/ml), GRGDS (1 mm), and GRGES (negative control, data not shown) were not inhibitory. Fig. 8 shows the concentration dependence curve for CRP, which shows an apparent optimum concentration for activation of soluble collagen binding. To determine if this is due to CRP competing with soluble collagen for binding to activated platelets, the effect of high CRP concentrations on the binding of soluble collagen to TS2/16-activated platelets was assessed. The data shown in Fig. 9 shows that this is the case; CRP inhibited the specific binding of soluble collagen to TS2/16-activated platelets in a concentration-dependent manner, with the inhibitory concentrations of CRP corresponding to those at which soluble collagen binding to CRP-ac"
https://openalex.org/W2058012673,"Abstract Here we have employed p70s6ktruncation and point mutants to elucidate the role played by the carboxyl-terminal autoinhibitory domain S/TP phosphorylation sites in kinase activation. Earlier studies showed that truncation of the p70s6k amino terminus severely impaired kinase activation but that this effect was reversed by deleting the carboxyl terminus, which in parallel led to deregulation of Thr229 phosphorylation in the activation loop (Dennis, P. B., Pullen, N., Kozma, S. C., and Thomas, G. (1996)Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 6242–6251). In this study, substitution of acidic residues for the four autoinhibitory domainS/TP sites mimics the carboxyl-terminal deletion largely by rescuing kinase activation caused by the amino-terminal truncation. However, these mutations do not deregulate Thr229phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of another regulatory element in the intact kinase. This element appears to be Thr389 phosphorylation, because substitution of an acidic residue at this position in the p70s6k variant containing the S/TP mutations leads to a large increase in basal Thr229 phosphorylation and kinase activity. In contrast, an alanine substitution at Thr389 blocks both responses. Consistent with these data, we show that a mutant harboring the acidicS/TP and Thr389 substitutions is an excellentin vitro substrate for the newly identified Thr229 kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (Pullen, N., Dennis, P. B., Andjelkovic, M., Dufner, A., Kozma, S., Hemmings, B. A., and Thomas, G. (1998)Science 279, 707–710), whereas phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 poorly utilizes the two p70s6k variants that have only one set of mutations. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of the S/TP sites, in cooperation with Thr389 phosphorylation, controls Thr229 phosphorylation through an intrasteric mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1985437385,"Targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases to the lysosome is mediated by the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) and the insulin-like growth factor II/cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/CI-MPR). The two receptors, which share sequence similarities, constitute the P-type family of animal lectins. We now report the three-dimensional structure of a glycosylation-deficient, yet fully functional form of the extracytoplasmic domain of the bovine CD-MPR (residues 3-154) complexed with mannose 6-phosphate at 1.8 A resolution. The extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR crystallizes as a dimer, and each monomer folds into a nine-stranded flattened beta barrel, which bears a striking resemblance to avidin. The distance of 40 A between the two ligand-binding sites of the dimer provides a structural basis for the observed differences in binding affinity exhibited by the CD-MPR toward various lysosomal enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2044249032,"Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have implicated the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), and the early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) in the transcriptional regulation of the luteinizing hormone β-subunit (LHβ) gene. We have previously demonstrated the ability of SF-1 to bind to and transactivate the rat LHβ gene promoter acting at a consensus gonadotrope-specific element (GSE) located at position −127. We have now identified a second functional GSE site at position −59. In addition, based on electrophoretic mobility shift assay,in vitro translated Egr-1 is shown to bind to two putative Egr-1 binding sites (positions −112 and −50), which appear to be paired with the identified GSE sites. By transient transfection assay in pituitary-derived GH3 cells, it was seen that Egr-1 increases promoter activity of region −207/+5 of the rat LHβ gene promoter through action at both Egr-1 sites. Furthermore, LHβ gene promoter activity is markedly augmented in the presence of both factors together relative to activity in the presence of SF-1 or Egr-1 alone (150-fold versus 14-fold and 12-fold, respectively). These data define two composite SF-1-Egr-1 response-elements in the proximal LHβ gene promoter and suggest that SF-1 and Egr-1 act synergistically to increase expression of the LHβ gene in the gonadotrope.

Precise regulation of gonadotropin gene expression is required for normal reproductive function. The pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, are composed of a common α-subunit linked to one of two unique β-subunits, LHβ 1The abbreviations used are: LHβ, luteinizing hormone β-subunit; FSHβ, follicle-stimulating hormone β-subunit; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; Egr-1, early growth response protein 1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RXR, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor; DAX-1, dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; GSE, gonadotrope-specific element. or FSHβ. The common α-subunit can also associate with thyroid-stimulating hormone β-subunit in pituitary thyrotropes or, in humans, with placentally derived chorionic gonadotropin β-subunit. Studies of the α-subunit gene promoter have identified a number of transcription factors and cognate cis-acting DNA elements that provide basal, tissue-specific, and hormonally mediated regulation of gene expression. In particular, a gonadotrope-specific element (GSE) is believed to be important for conferring gonadotrope-specific expression of the α-subunit gene (1Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The GSE, or Ad4 response element, regulates expression of a number of genes with a role in steroidogenesis, sexual differentiation, and adult reproductive function (3Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The GSE/Ad4 site has been shown to interact with the transcription factor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), resulting in transcriptional activation of a variety of genes, including the steroidogenic P450, the Mullerian inhibiting substance, and the aromatase genes, among others (4Rice D.A. Mouw A.R. Bogerd A.M. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5Lynch J.P. Lala D.S. Peluso J.J. Luo W. Parker K.L. White B.A. Mol.

Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). SF-1 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Although it was previously considered to be an orphan member of this family, it has recently been reported that SF-1-dependent transcriptional activity is increased in the presence of cholesterol metabolites, particularly 25-OH-cholesterol (7Lala D.S. Syka P.M. Lazarchik S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J. Parker K.L. Heyman R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether this putative ligand is important for SF-1 function in nonsteroidogenic tissues, such as the pituitary gland. SF-1 expression is restricted to the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland and gonads and to the gonadotrope subpopulation of the pituitary gland. Thus, the pattern of SF-1 expression suggests that SF-1 may contribute to tissue-specific gene expression. In contrast with the α-subunit, progress has only recently been made in the identification of transcription factors that regulate the gonadotropin β-subunit genes. Understanding β-subunit regulation at the molecular level is critical because it is the β-subunits that provide the functional specificity that distinguishes luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone action. A number of recent reports have suggested that SF-1 may play a role in the regulation of LHβ gene expression in addition to its effects on the common α-subunit. Targeted disruption of the Ftz-F1 gene encoding SF-1 results in transgenic mice that lack transcripts for the gonadotrope markers LHβ, FSHβ, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and have greatly diminished levels of α-subunit mRNA (3Ingraham H.A.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone replacement was able to restore gonadotropin expression in four out of five of these animals, suggesting that cells from the gonadotrope lineage are present but that a specific defect in gonadotropin subunit gene expression exists (8Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By sequence homology, it has been shown that the LHβ gene promoter contains a consensus GSE site at position −127 in the rat and −125 in the cow. In vitro studies demonstrated the ability of SF-1 to bind to and transactivate the rat LHβ gene promoter through interaction with this putative GSE site (9Halvorson L.M. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of this site was confirmed using transgenic mice containing either the wild-type bovine LHβ gene promoter or a promoter with a GSE site-specific mutation linked to a CAT reporter vector (10Keri R.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10782-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Introduction of the GSE mutation substantially decreased LHβ gene promoter activity, indicating that the SF-1 binding site is a critical regulator of LHβ gene promoter activity in vivo . Of note, however, in both the in vitro andin vivo model systems, mutation of this GSE site failed to eliminate fully LHβ gene expression, suggesting the presence of a second functional SF-1-response element. Closer inspection of the rat LHβ gene promoter sequence identified a second region with similarity to the consensus GSE site (Fig. 1). We have termed this second putative site the 3′GSE and refer to the previously defined site as the 5′GSE. The first aim of the current study was to determine the functional significance of the putative 3′GSE site. In vivo observations in transgenic mice have also suggested a role for the transcription factor, early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1), in the modulation of LHβ gene expression. Egr-1, also known as NGFI-A, zif/268, and Krox-24, is a member of the immediate early gene family, the members of which contain a zinc finger domain with a Cys2-His2 motif that recognizes the nucleotide sequence CGCCC(C/A)CGC. Additional members of this family include Sp1 and the Wilms' tumor suppressor WT1 (11Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 12Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 13Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Egr-1 is widely expressed, and in a recent report, it has been shown to be expressed in the gonadotrope, as well as in the somatotrope subpopulation of the pituitary (14Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Trembleau A. Gourdji D. Driancourt M.-A. Rao C.V. Charnay P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 12: 107-122Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Of interest, two groups have demonstrated that targeted disruption of the Egr-1 gene results in specific loss of LHβ gene expression, with maintenance of FSHβ gene expression (14Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Trembleau A. Gourdji D. Driancourt M.-A. Rao C.V. Charnay P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 12: 107-122Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 15Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H.

Sequence analysis of the LHβ gene promoter identifies two highly conserved regions with homology to the consensus Egr-1 binding site (Fig. 1). Lee et al. (15Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that mutation of the 3′Egr site correlates with loss of Egr-1-mediated transactivation. However, the ability of Egr-1 to interact directly with the 3′Egr site and the functional importance of the putative 5′Egr site have not been determined. In the study reported here, we have therefore verified the ability ofin vitro translated Egr-1 to bind to both of the putative Egr-1 binding sites and have shown that both sites confer Egr-1 responsiveness to the rat LHβ gene promoter. In addition, we have demonstrated the ability of SF-1 and Egr-1 to interact with each other and have characterized the functional importance of this interaction to the regulation of LHβ gene expression. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and polymerase chain reactions are shown in Table I. The nucleotide sequence of the rat LHβ gene promoter is based on newly obtained sequencing data available at GenBankTM accession number AF020505, which differ slightly from that of Jameson et al.

The 5′GSE oligonucleotide contains additional 5′-Bam HI and 3′-Bgl II restriction sites. The −207LH-S, −82LH-S, and 5′LH-S primers introduced Bam HI restriction sites, whereas the +5LH-AS primer introduced a Hin dIII site, and the 3′LH-AS primer introduced Bgl II and Xho I restriction sites (restriction sites not shown).Table IOligonucleotides used for generation of rat LHβ gene promoter sequencesNamePurposePosition1-aPosition derived from revised rat LHβ promoter sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF020505), except for the Pit-1 oligonucleotide, which is based on the rat growth hormone promoter sequence (40).Sequence1-bEMSA and mutagenesis oligonucleotides shown as sense strand.5′GSEEMSA−134 /−1135′-TCCTTTCTGACCTTGTCTGTCT-3′3′GSEEMSA−66 /−435′-TGCTTAGTGGCCTTGCCACCCCCA-3′3′GSEMEMSA−66 /−435′-TGCTTAGTGGAATTCCCACCCCCA-3′5′GSE-5′EgrEMSA−131 /−1005′-TTTCTGACCTTGTCTGTCTCGCCCCCAAAGAG-3′5′GSE-5′EgrMEMSA−131 /−1005′-TTTCTGACCTTGTCTGTCTAGTACTCAAAGAG-3′3′GSE-3′EgrEMSA−67 /−355′-CTGCTTAGTGGCCTTGCCACCCCCACAACCCGC-3′3′GSE-3′EgrMEMSA−67 /−355′-CTGCTTAGTGGCCTTGCCACCCTTAGAACCTGC-3′Pit-1EMSA−137 /−655′-GGGAGGAGCTTCTAAATTATCCATCAGCACAAGCTGTCAGTGGCTCCAGCCATGAATAARat GHATTATAGGGAAA-3′pXP2Mutagenesis−12/+4 /pXP21-cIncludes rat LHβ promoter sequences as shown plus sequences from pXP2 vector multiple cloning site.5′-GGTAGGGAAGGTATCACGCGTGTCGACCCGGGTACC-3′pXP2-revMutagenesis−12/+4 /pXP21-cIncludes rat LHβ promoter sequences as shown plus sequences from pXP2 vector multiple cloning site.5′-GGTAGGGAAGGTATCAAGCTTGTCGACCCGGGTACC-3′5′GSEmutMutagenesis−145 /−1025′-GCTGGTCCCTGGCTTTTCTGAAATTGTCTGTCTCGCCCCCAAAG-3′5′EgrmutMutagenesis−128 /−915′-CTGACCTTGTCTGTCTAGTACTCAAAGAGATTAGTGTC-3′5′GSEmut-EgrmutMutagenesis−128 /−915′-CTGAAATTGTCTGTCTAGTACTCAAAGAGATTAGTGTC-3′3′GSEmutMutagenesis−71 /−325′-GCCTCTGCTTAGTGGAATTCCCACCCCCACAACCCGCAGG-3′3′EgrmutMutagenesis−60 /−235′-GTGGCCTTGCCACCCTTAGAACCTGCAGGTATAAAGCC-3′3′GSEmut-EgrmutMutagenesis−65 /−245′-GTTTAGTGGAATTCCCACCCTTAGAACCTGCAGGTATAAAGC-3′−207LH-S1-dPCR primers indicated by S (sense) or AS (antisense).PCR−207 /−885′-CCAATGTCAGTTAAGCTCAG-3′−82LH-SPCR−82 /−645′-CCAGGCCTGTAGCCTCTGT-3′+5LH-ASPCR+5 /−155′-TTGATACCTTCCCTACCTTG-3′5′LH-SPCR−141 /−1125′-GTCCCTGGCTTTTCTGACCTTGTCTGTCTC-3′3′LH-ASPCR−44 /−705′-GAGGGGGTGGCAAGGCCACTAAGCAGAGG-3′1-a Position derived from revised rat LHβ promoter sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF020505), except for the Pit-1 oligonucleotide, which is based on the rat growth hormone promoter sequence (40Suen C.-S.

Open table in a new tab In vitro translated proteins were generated from plasmids containing 2.1 kilobase pairs of the mouse SF-1 cDNA (provided by Dr. K. L. Parker, Southwestern University School of Medicine) or 3.2 kilobase pairs of the mouse Egr-1 cDNA (provided by Dr. D. Nathans, Johns Hopkins University) using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) (11Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 17Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The resultant product was determined to be of appropriate size by comparison with [35S]methionine-labeled protein markers by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The SF-1 polyclonal antibody, a generous gift of Dr. Parker, was generated in rabbits against a glutathione S-transferase-SF-1 fusion protein (18Nordeen S. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). The Egr-1 antiserum is a rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of mouse Egr-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA). The Pit-1 antiserum, directed against amino acids 136–150 of rat growth hormone pituitary factor-1/Pit-1, was provided by C. Bancroft (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine) (19Morris A.E. Jiang Y. McChesney R.E. Jackson A.E. Bancroft C. Chasin L.A. Gene. 1990; 94: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Region −141/−44 of the rat LHβ gene promoter (see Fig. 5 B ) was produced by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′LH-S and 3′LH-AS and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Bam HI andBgl II restriction enzymes were used to obtain the insert, which was agarose gel-purified and dephosphorylated. The remainder of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used as probes and in cold competition experiments were produced by annealing the sense oligonucleotide indicated in Table I with the corresponding antisense oligonucleotide (not shown). Probes were created by T4 polynucleotide kinase end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP followed by purification over a NICK column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro translated protein(s) were incubated with 50,000 cpm of oligonucleotide probe in DNA-binding buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) for 30 min on ice. For competition studies, a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added 5 min prior to the addition of probe. Where indicated, antiserum (1 μl) was added 30 min after the addition of probe, and the incubation was continued for 2 h. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and subjected to autoradiography and/or quantification using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein interaction assays were performed as described previously (20Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Briefly, a His6-containing SF-1 fusion protein was obtained by baculovirus transfection of insect cells. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by washing with 40 mm imidazole. In vitro translation of the Egr-1, DAX-1, and RXRα proteins was performed with the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Labeled proteins were incubated with the His6-SF-1 fusion protein bound to Ni-NTA agarose in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40 mm imidazole for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer followed by 10% PAGE separation and autoradiography. The deletion mutants of Egr-1 were created by digesting the pBSII(+) vector containing the Egr-1 cDNA with either Eco 47III,Msc I, or Sph I. The Msc I-digested cDNA was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to create a blunt end. These vectors were then digested with Eco RI, yielding cDNA fragments having a 5′ Eco RI restriction site and a blunt 3′-end. Next, the pCMX vector (provided by Dr. R. Evans, The Salk Institute) was digested with Nhe I, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and then digested with Eco RI. TheEco 47III-, Msc I-, and Sph I-digested cDNAs were subcloned into the altered pCMX vector to create pCMX Egr-1(1–533), Egr-1 del 486–533, and Egr-1 del 318–533, respectively. Reporter constructs used for these studies were created by subcloning polymerase chain reaction products containing the LHβ gene promoter sequence into the pXP2 vector using Bam HI/Hin dIII restriction sites, which were introduced by primers (18Nordeen S. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). The largest construct used for these studies contained 207 base pairs of the 5′-flanking sequence of the rat LHβ gene and the first 5 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region generated by primers −207LH-S and +5LH-AS. A 5′-truncated construct was obtained by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction product obtained with primers −82LH-S and +5LH-AS. Mutations in the reporter constructs were created using the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECHLaboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Generation of multiple mutations was performed sequentially and, therefore, required the use of two selection primers, one that converted a unique Hin dIII restriction site to a unique Mlu I site (pXP2) and another that reversed this mutation (pXP2-rev). The 5′GSE mutagenic primer eliminated a Tth III1 restriction site, in addition to introducing the desired mutation, as described previously (9Halvorson L.M. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers for the 3′GSE, 5′Egr, and 3′Egr sites introduceEco RI, Sca I, and Pst I restriction sites, respectively. All reporter constructs were confirmed by dideoxysequencing. The SF-1 expression vector contained 2.1 kilobase pairs of the mouse SF-1 cDNA driven by cytomegalovirus promoter sequences in the vector, pCMV5 (17Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The Egr-1 expression vector was created by cloning 3.2 kilobase pairs of the mouse Egr-1 cDNA into pCMV5 atBam HI and Hin dIII restriction sites (11Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Monkey kidney fibroblast (CV-1) cells or rat somatolactotrope (GH3) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CV-1 cells growing in 3.5-cm tissue culture wells (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) were transfected with expression (0.1 μg/well) and reporter (1.65 μg/well) plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.36Google Scholar). GH3 cells were cultured to 50–70% confluence and transfected by electroporation. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 0.4 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline plus 5 mm glucose with the DNA to be transfected. The cells received a single electrical pulse of 240 V at a total capacitance of 1000 microfarads using an Invitrogen Electroporator II apparatus (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For both cell types, control wells received the appropriate “empty” expression vector. Cotransfection with an Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase plasmid (1 μg/well) allowed correction for differences in transfection efficiency between wells. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the cell extracts were analyzed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (22deWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar, 23Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was first normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity. Results were then calculated as fold change relative to expression in the presence of the control empty expression vector. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. and represent a minimum of three independent experiments, with each point run in triplicate in each experiment. We have previously demonstrated the ability of SF-1 to increase rat LHβ gene promoter activity specifically through action at a functional GSE site located at position −127/−119, now designated as the 5′GSE site (9Halvorson L.M. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These studies were primarily based on transient transfection of the monkey kidney fibroblast cell line, CV-1, with preliminary confirmation in the rat pituitary-derived somatolactotrope cell line, GH3 (9Halvorson L.M. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). By Northern analysis, CV-1 cells lack the mRNA that encodes the SF-1 homologue Ad4BP (24Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that both CV-1 and GH3 nuclear extracts fail to produce specific protein-DNA interactions with the 5′GSE probe by EMSA (data not shown). In these earlier studies, it was noted that residual SF-1 responsiveness could be observed following mutation of the 5′GSE element by a CC to AA conversion at positions −124 and −123. These results suggested two possibilities: 1) the importance of additional base pairs in this GSE site to the SF-1-response, or 2) the presence of additional SF-1 binding sites that contribute to the regulation of LHβ gene promoter activity. Sequence analysis of the rat LHβ gene promoter identified a number of regions that resemble the consensus GSE, including region −59/−51, which was designated the putative 3′GSE site (Fig.1). We therefore tested the ability of SF-1 to bind to this region of the LHβ gene promoter using EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2 A, lane 1 ,in vitro translated SF-1 bound to a 32P-labeled 3′GSE probe to produce the complex indicated by the arrow. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by successful competition with unlabeled 3′GSE (Fig. 2 A, lane 2 ) but not with the mutated 3′GSE site (3′GSEM ) (Fig. 2 A, lane 3 ) nor with an unrelated oligonucleotide containing two binding sites for the pituitary transcription factor, Pit-1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 4 ). Unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate failed to bind to this probe (Fig. 2 A, lane 5 ). In order to confirm that the observed band contained SF-1, we investigated the effect of a SF-1-specific antibody on the formation of the identified complex. This antibody has previously been shown to block the ability of SF-1 to bind to the promoter element of a number of genes, including the glycoprotein α-subunit and 21-hydroxylase genes (2Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 25Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.-P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with this SF-1-specific antiserum decreased the intensity of the protein-DNA complex, whereas the addition of an anti-Pit-1 antiserum, used as a negative control, had no effect (Fig.2 A, lanes 8–10 ). The upper band, indicated by an asterisk, was observed in reactions that lacked in vitro translated protein (data not shown). This band is therefore presumed to represent a direct interaction between the antibody and the probe and does not represent supershift of the SF-1-DNA complex. In order to localize further the SF-1-recognition site, a 3-base pair mutation was introduced into the wild-type LHβ oligonucleotide sequence (3′GSE) to form mutated 3′GSE. As seen in Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and 7 , no additional complexes were observed beyond those produced in the presence of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate. Parallel EMSA was performed using nuclear extract from the gonadotrope-derived cell line, αT3–1. This cell line has previously been shown to express both SF-1 mRNA and protein (2Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 3Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Endogenous SF-1 present in αT3–1 nuclear extract was also able to bind to the 3′GSE region, as demonstrated by successful competition with the SF-1-specific antibody (data not shown). These data firmly establish that the putative 3′GSE site in the rat LHβ gene promoter is recognized by SF-1, present as either an endogenous protein or anin vitro translated product. We next wished to determine the relative affinities of the two GSE sites that we had identified for SF-1 binding. EMSA was performed using in vitro translated SF-1 and the 3′GSE oligonucleotide probe with an increasing molar excess of unlabeled 3′GSE or 5′GSE oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 B ). Based on this approach, the affinity of SF-1 for either of these sites is essentially identical within the sensitivity of this approach. In order to determine the functional significance of the interaction between SF-1 and the LHβ gene promoter sequences, transient transfection assays were performed in CV-1 cells, the cell line used in characterization of the 5′GSE site (9Halvorson L.M. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previously published results, cotransfection with the SF-1 expression vector resulted in an 80-fold increase in the luciferase activity of a wild-type reporter construct containing region −207 to +5 of the rat LHβ gene promoter (Fig.3 A ). Mutation of either the 5′GSE or 3′GSE sites eliminated over 90% of the SF-1-response, whereas mutation of both sites decreased the SF-1-response to the level of the empty reporter plasmid, pXP2. Ideally, we would have pursued these investigations in a gonadotrope-derived cell line. However, at the time these experiments were performed, only the αT3–1 cell line was available for study. Although these cells express the endogenous gonadotropin α-subunit gene, they do not express endogenous or exogenous β-subunit genes at appreciable levels (26Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Although we were able to detect a small increas"

We report here that a single substitution of alanine for glutamate at position 3885 (located in the putative transmembrane sequence M2 of the type 3 RyR) reduces the Ca2+ sensitivity, as measured by single channel activation, by more than 10,000-fold, without apparent changes in channel conductance and in modulation by other ligands (e.g. ATP and ryanodine). Co-expression of the wild type and mutant RyR proteins results in the synthesis of single channels that have intermediate Ca2+ sensitivities.

Physiol. 1991; 53: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the many ligands known to modulate the activity of RyR, Ca2+ is the essential regulator. Most other ligands exert their effect on RyR activity by influencing the Ca2+sensitivity of RyR (3Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J.

Alterations in the Ca2+sensitivity of RyR have been implicated in at least one disease, malignant hyperthermia (13Mickelson J.R. Louis C.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism that controls the Ca2+ sensitivity is fundamental to the understanding of RyR regulation and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. RyR activation by Ca2+ is thought to be mediated by high affinity Ca2+ binding sites in the protein (14Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1985; 25: 236-244Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar), but the molecular identity of these Ca2+ activation sites, the Ca2+ sensor, has yet to be defined. It has been shown that negatively charged residues within a transmembrane sequence are often involved in binding and translocation of cations across the membrane (15Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 16Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stuhmer W. Imoto K. Numa S.

Analysis of the amino acid sequences of RyRs reveals that of the 12 predicted transmembrane sequences of RyR (18Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), four (M1, M2, M7, and M10) contain negatively charged amino acid residues that are conserved in all known RyR isoforms (Fig. 1 A ) (19Takeshima H.

To investigate their roles in RyR function, we have mutated these negatively charged residues in the rabbit type 3 RyR. The functional consequence of one of these point mutations, a glutamate-to-alanine mutation at position 3885 (E3885A) located in the M2 transmembrane sequence (Fig. 1 B ), was assessed. Our results demonstrate that glutamate 3885 plays an essential role in determining the Ca2+ sensitivity and provide important new insights into the Ca2+-sensing mechanism of RyR. Cloning and sequencing of the rabbit uterus RyR3 cDNA have been described previously (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Substitution of alanine for glutamate 3885 (E3885A) was carried out by the overlap extension method (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Morton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The “outer” two oligonucleotides used were: forward, 5′-TACTCCAGAATGATGAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-TCCATGGCCTTCTGGAATTC-3′. The oligonucleotides for the E3885A mutation were: forward, 5′-CCCTCCTGGCAGGGAATGT-3′; and reverse, 5′-ACATTCCCTGCCAGGAGGG-3′. The sequences of the PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. TheApa I (11,469)–Rco RI (11,833) fragment was removed from the PCR product and subcloned into the Spe I (10,590)–Spe I (12,795) subfragment and subsequently into the full-length RyR3 cDNA. Transfection of HEK293 cells were carried out using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation. Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells grown for 18 h after transfection were washed three times with KRH buffer without MgCl2 and CaCl2 (KRH buffer: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 6 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubated in the same buffer at room temperature for 30 min and at 37 °C for 30 min. After being detached from culture dishes by pipetting, cells from two 100-mm tissue culture dishes were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 2 min in a Beckman TH-4 rotor. Cell pellets were suspended and loaded with 5 μm fluo-3 AM in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at room temperature for 30 min followed by washing with KRH buffer three times and resuspended in 150 μl of KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 250 μm sulfinpyrazone. The fluo-3-loaded cells (150 μl) were added to 2 ml (final volume) of KRH buffer in a cuvette. Fluorescence intensity of fluo-3 at 530 nm was measured in an SLM-Aminco series 2 luminescence spectrometer with 480 nm excitation at 25 °C (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Preparation of microsomal membranes from transfected HEK293 cells and purification of the expressed RyR were carried out as described previously (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Single channel recordings were carried out using CHAPS-solubilized and sucrose density gradient-purified wild type and mutant recombinant RyRs as reported previously (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato (29Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that addition of 2 mm caffeine to HEK293 cells transfected with the wild type cDNA caused an increase in the fluo-3 fluorescence (n = 5), similar to that observed previously (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fluo-3 fluorescence in HEK293 cells transfected with mutant E3885A cDNA failed to increase in response to 2 mm caffeine but did respond to 100 nmCa2+ ionophore A23187 (n = 7). Caffeine is known to sensitize RyR to Ca2+ (12Meissner G. Rios E. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1628-1638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The lack of caffeine response suggests that the E3885A mutation may interfere with the Ca2+ activation pathway. To examine directly whether the E3885A mutation alters Ca2+ activation, we incorporated the recombinant E3885A mutant proteins into planar lipid bilayers and determined the response of single mutant channels to a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. As shown in Fig.2 A , the E3885A mutant channel was essentially closed at micromolar Ca2+ and remained closed until the Ca2+ concentration was raised to about 500 μm. The mutant channel was further activated by increasing the Ca2+ concentration, but the maximal open probability was low. On the other hand, the wild type channel was activated at about 100 nm Ca2+ and reached full activation at micromolar Ca2+ (Fig. 2, B andC ) (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Open times of the mutant channels were short and exponentially distributed with a time constant of 0.296 ± 0.095 ms (mean ± S.D.) (n = 10) (Fig. 2 D ), as compared with the open time constant of 1.16 ms of the wild type channels (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus the E3885A mutant channel, although still regulated by Ca2+, differs markedly from the wild type channel in the sensitivity to Ca2+ activation, the extent of maximal Ca2+ activation, and the gating kinetics. To examine whether the mutant channel is still sensitive to other modulators of RyR, we assessed the effect of ATP, caffeine, and ryanodine on the single channel activity of the mutant channel (Fig. 2,E and F ). In the presence of 1 mmcytoplasmic Ca2+, the mutant channel was activated by the addition of 2 mm ATP (n = 3). The ATP-activated channel was inhibited by subsequent addition of EGTA. The mutant channel was also activated by caffeine and was sensitive to ryanodine (n = 3). The mutant channel exhibited a linear I-V relationship similar to that of the wild type (Fig.2 G ). The unitary conductance of the mutant channel, determined in the presence of both ATP and caffeine, was 806 ± 16 pS (n = 4), compared with 777 pS of the wild type (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the E3885A mutation does not cause gross alterations in channel function. The E3885A mutation thus appears to alter specifically the Ca2+ activation of the channel. Quantification of the extent of alteration in Ca2+ activation of the mutant channel was difficult because of its low open probability. To overcome this problem, we assessed the relative sensitivity to activation by Ca2+ of the mutant channel in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 4 mm caffeine. Under these conditions, the mutant channel was activated at micromolar Ca2+, and it was fully activated at about 150–200 μm Ca2+ (Fig.3 A ). In comparison, under the same conditions, the wild type channel was activated at less than 1 nm Ca2+, and it was fully activated at about 15–20 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B ). The Hill equation was used to fit the data obtained from two wild type and nine mutant single channels (Fig. 3 C ). This analysis revealed that half-maximal activation was achieved at a Ca2+concentration of 61.4 μm for the mutant channels and 4.7 nm for the wild type channels. Thus the sensitivity to Ca2+ activation of the mutant channel is more than 10,000-fold lower than that of the wild type. Based on the 10,000-fold difference in Ca2+ sensitivity and the threshold of the wild type channel (about 100 nm) (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the threshold for Ca2+ activation of the E3885A mutant in the absence of ATP and caffeine would be about 1 mm. The high threshold for Ca2+ activation of the mutant channel is close to the threshold for Ca2+ inactivation (about 1 mm) (27Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The very low activation by Ca2+ of the mutant channel (Fig. 2, A and C ) is, therefore, most likely because of simultaneous inactivation by Ca2+. This high threshold may also explain why we could not detect caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in E3885A-transfected HEK293 cells where the resting cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration is about 100 nm, although mutant channels in the lipid bilayers proved to be sensitive to caffeine. Taken together, these results indicate that glutamate 3885 is essential in determining the sensitivity of RyR to activation by Ca2+. The mechanism by which substitution of a single amino acid residue results in a more than 10,000-fold change in the Ca2+sensitivity of RyR is not clear. One possibility is that the four glutamates at position 3885 of each monomer may be located in close proximity to each other and act in concert to form the Ca2+sensor in the homotetrameric RyR. To examine this possibility, we co-expressed the wild type and mutant cDNA in HEK293 cells and determined caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. We reasoned that co-expression of the wild type and mutant E3885A would result in the formation of a Ca2+ sensor with a mixture of glutamates and alanines. This hybrid Ca2+ sensor would be expected to have reduced caffeine response and Ca2+ sensitivity. Fig.4 A shows that the caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in these co-transfected HEK293 cells was reduced as a result of the decreasing ratio of wild type over mutant cDNA (n = 4). Single-channel analysis revealed that co-transfection of HEK293 cells with a 1:1 ratio of wild type and mutant cDNA produced channels that have intermediate Ca2+ sensitivities (Fig. 4 B ). Half-maximal activation of these hybrid single channels was achieved at Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 36.6 nm to 7.5 μm. Most of the hybrid channels displayed half-maximal activation at about 238 nm Ca2+. These different Ca2+ responses most likely resulted from hybrid channels with different ratios of wild type and mutant subunits. Thus, these findings are consistent with the possibility that the glutamates at position 3885 of the monomers act coordinately to form the Ca2+ sensor. The putative transmembrane sequence M2 is highly conserved in all RyR isoforms sequenced to date (Fig. 1 B ). It is most likely that the corresponding glutamate in other RyR isoforms also plays a fundamental role in determining the Ca2+ sensitivity. Further studies of the Ca2+ sensor will provide clues to how the Ca2+ sensitivity is modulated by various modulators and by disease states and how binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+ sensor couples to channel opening. The oligomeric coordination of the Ca2+ sensor may provide the basis for controlling and manipulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of RyR. We thank Drs. Henry J. Duff, Michael Fill, Wayne R.

Gene-encoded peptide antibiotics are an essential defense component of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms destined to circumvent invading pathogens and proliferation of commensals. Small-sized antimicrobial peptides, termed bacteriocins, have been produced by a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria for million of years for containing the proliferation of microorganisms that are closely related or confined within the same ecological niche, thus helping the producing microbe to compete for limited resources (1Jung G. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1051-1068Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2James R. Ladzunski C. Pattus F. Bacteriocins, Microcins and Lantibiotics.

In vertebrates, polycationic antimicrobial peptides, 10–46 residues long, that are secreted by specialized epithelial cells offer a first line of defense against infectious agents by limiting bacterial invasion and/or colonization of the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal and genital systems, and the skin (6Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 7Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Gene-encoded peptides of the chemical defense so far isolated from vertebrates act completely unlike traditional antibiotic agents and may open novel perspectives in the conception of new therapeutic treatments of nosocomial infections and infections because of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Whereas many antibiotics or secondary metabolites disable microorganisms over a period of days by inhibiting critical enzymes, most of the antimicrobial peptides kill microorganisms rapidly by destroying or permeating the microbial membrane and impairing the ability to carry out anabolic processes (6Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 7Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In addition, these peptides are of small size and processed from prepro-proteins by dedicated pathways. Vertebrate antibiotics are thus unlikely to induce the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes by bacterial pathogens. In recent years, the secretions from amphibian skin have become a pivotal model for the discovery of new peptide antibiotics originating from the nonmyeloid cells of vertebrates. The frog dermatous glands synthesize and expel an extraordinarily rich variety of mammalian-like hormones and neuropeptides including thyrotropin-releasing hormone, angiotensin, bombesin, skin peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, and bradykinin as well as the astonishing d-amino acid containing heptapeptide opioids, dermorphin, and deltorphins (8Lazarus L.H. Attila M. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 1993; 41: 473-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Glands also produce huge amounts of cytolytic and antimicrobial cationic peptides thought to be involved in the defense of the naked skin against microbial invasion and to aid in wound repair. To date, the microbicidal peptides of the frog skin are grouped into three broad families on the basis of their sequence/tridimensional structure characteristics (6Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 7Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar): (a ) linear amphipathic helix forming peptides such as the magainins and related peptides from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis , and the dermaseptins S from the South american arboreal frogs Phyllomedusa sauvagei. These peptides manifest broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeast, protozoa, and fungi but have no or little harmful effect on human cells; (b ) four different groups of related peptides isolated from various species of the Ranidae family, namely the brevinins-1 and -2, the gaegurins, the esculentins-1, and the esulentins-2. Different from the peptides mentioned above they all contain 2 cysteine residues at the COOH terminus that are linked in a disulfide bridge; (c ) the temporins, isolated fromRana temporari , are the smallest antimicrobial peptides known so far being only 10–13 residues in length. As a rule, a given amphibian species produces a unique repertoire of antimicrobial peptides that have overlapping structural features but often target specific microorganisms. It is thought that the simultaneous presence of closely related antimicrobial molecules acting in synergy provides frogs with a better shield against a wider range of harmful invaders, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan. The peculiar characteristic of amphibians belonging to different families, genera, and species to store distinct set(s) of antimicrobial peptides that differ with respect to their chain length, hydrophobicity, charge distribution, and spectrum of activity may be exploited for unearthing new antimicrobial agents targeting specific microorganisms for which the therapeutic armament is scarce. Also, the isolation of new members of old families is not of minor importance because they may exhibit remarkable differences in activity from their congeners. In addition, very little is known about these peptides at the gene level. In that regard, we report herein the isolation, characterization, and molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding precursors of several new members of the dermaseptin B family of antimicrobial peptides. 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) 1The abbreviations used are: Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmetoxycarbonyl; DRS, dermaseptin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. -protectedl-amino acids and polyethylen glycol polystyren-graph copolymer support (PEG-PS resin, substituted at 0.18 meq/g) were from Milligen (Bedford, MA). Chemicals for peptide synthesis (dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, diisopropylcarbodiimide, hydroxybenzotriazol, piperidin, trifluroacetic acid, and acetonitrile) were obtained from commercial sources and were of the highest purity available. Frogs were placed in large wooden cages (120 × 90 × 90 cm; 12 animals/cage) covered on three sides by plastic mosquito net to provide good ventilation. Philodendron, pothos, and dracena were used as perches, and water bowls were made available for nocturnal baths. The frogs were fed crickets. Humidity was kept at 65% by a constantly operating humidifier. Temperature was maintained at 25 ± 1 °C. The skin and adherent tissues from one specimen of P. bicolor were minced with scissors and extracted for 1 min with a Braun press in 40 ml of 10% acetic acid at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged twice for 30 min at 10,000 × g , and the supernatant was lyophilized. The dried extract was dissolved in 200 ml of 5% acetic acid and lyophilized (yield, 800 mg). The resulting powder was dissolved in 30 ml of 10% acetic acid and fractionated on a calibrated gel filtration column (Sephadex G-50 superfine, 2.4 × 100 cm). Fractions (9 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 10 ml/h, from which aliquots (250 μl) were lyophilized and assayed for mitogenic activity as described below. Antimitogenic fractions (fractions 32–36, see Fig.1) were pooled and evaporated under vacuum (yield, 40 mg). This material was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC chromatography on a Waters RCM compact preparative cartridge Deltapak C18 (300 Å, 25 × 100 mm) loaded with 40 mg of extract in water containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. After an initial 1-min wash in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid/water, elution was achieved at a flow rate of 8 ml/min with a 0–60% linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.07% trifluoracetic acid (from 3 to 33 min). 10-ml fractions were collected, lyophilized, and resuspended in 1 ml of water from which an aliquot (60 μl) was assayed for cytotoxic activity (see below). Fractions P2, P4, P3, and P1 that eluted at 26.5, 29, 30.5, and 31.5 min, respectively, were further fractionated either on a Lichrosorb C18 analytical HPLC column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm; flow rate, 0.75 ml/min) or a Deltapak C18 column (5 μm, 150 × 2 mm; flow rate, 0.75 ml/min) using a 20–60% linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid.

Samples (25 pmol) were dissolved in a water/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) mixture containing 0.2% formic acid and introduced via a capillary using a microliter syringe. An electrospray voltage of 5 kV was applied to the internal wall of the source at the origin of the liquid dispersion for an electrospray formation and ion extraction. Ions were detected and analyzed in the positive mode as a function of their m /z ratio. Dermaseptins B3 and B4 were prepared by stepwise solid phase synthesis using Fmoc polyamide active ester chemistry on a Milligen 9050 pepsynthesizer (9Fleury Y. Abdel Dayem M. Montagne J.J. Chaboisseau E. Le Caer J.P. Nicolas P. Delfour A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14421-14429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). AllN α-Fmoc amino acids were from Milligen. PAL-PEG-PS resin was used for carboxamidated dermaseptin B4. Fmoc-SPC resin was used for dermaseptin B3. Side chain protections weretert -butyloxycarbonyl for lysine and tryptophan,O-tert -butyl ester for aspartic acid,O-tert -butyl ether for threonine; and trityl for asparagine and glutamine. Syntheses were carried out using a triple-coupling protocol; Nα-Fmoc-amino acids (4.4 molar excess) were coupled for 30–60 min with 0.23 m diisopropylcarbodiimide in a mixture of dimethylformamide and dichloromethane (60:40, v/v). Acylation was checked after each coupling step by the Kaiser test. Cleavage of the peptidyl resins and side chain deprotection were carried out at a concentration of 40 mg of peptidyl resin in 1 ml of a mixture composed of trifluoroacetic acid, phenol, thioanisole, water, and ethyl methyl sulfide (82.5:5:5:5:2.5, v/v/v/v/v) for 2 h at room temperature. After filtering to remove the resin and ether precipitation at 20 °C, the crude peptides were recovered by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, washed three times with cold ether, dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 20% acetic acid, and lyophilized. After lyophilization, the crude oxydized peptides were purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC on a Waters RCM compact preparative cartridge Deltapak C 18 (300 Å; 25 × 100 mm) eluted at a flow rate of 8 ml/min by a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Homogeneity of the synthetic peptides was assessed by solid phase sequence analysis, mass spectrum analysis, and analytical HPLC on a Lichrosorb C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) eluted at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min by a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water. Benzo[α]pyrene-transformed Balb/c mouse 3T3 fibroblast (BP-A31) cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 6% fetal calf serum. For studies of mitogenic effects, the cells were seeded in Limbro 24-well boxes (2 × 104 cells/well). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of minimum essential medium containing 0.05% fetal calf serum plus 2.5 μm FeSO4, and the cells were allowed to enter quiescence during the next 3 days. Quiescent cells, aliquots of the fractions from G-50 column, and [3H]thymidine (28 Ci/mmol, 4 nCi/ml) were incubated during 24 h. After 24 h the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation was monitored as described (10Gray H.E. Buchou T. Mester J. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 169: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic activity of fractions recovered from preparative HPLC column was measured on a human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) originally isolated from a pleural effusion of a primary breast cancer patient (11Zava A. Science. 1977; 196: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nonquiescent MCF-7 cells were incubated with the fraction to be tested for 24 h and then incubated with [3H]thymidine (4 and 28 Ci/mmol) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 m ascorbic acid, and the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation was monitored as described (10Gray H.E. Buchou T. Mester J. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 169: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of synthetic dermaseptins were determined against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CIP A22 and ATCC 27853), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922 and 54127) in sterilized 96-well plates (Nunk F96 microtiter plates, Denmark) in a final volume of 100 μl composed of 50 μl of 106bacteria/ml in Luria Bertani culture medium and 50 μl of synthetic peptide in serial 2-fold dilutions in water. Synthetic peptides were weighted in a microbalance and solubilized in water at the desired primary dilution. Concentrations were determined by measuring the optical density of primary dilutions at 280 nm. Positive and negative controls were, respectively, water or 0.4% formol/water added to the same suspension. Inhibition of growth was determined by measuring optical density at 540 nm with a Titertek Multiskan MCC after incubation time of 6 h at 37 °C. One adult specimen of P. bicolor was anaesthetized and immersed in liquid nitrogen and kept deep frozen until further processing. The skins were completely dissected on dry ice, and the tissues (approximately 7 g) were homogenized. Total RNAs were extracted as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were purified over an affinity oligo(dT) cellulose spun column supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and cDNA library was constructed from skin poly(A)+ RNA as described (13Amiche M. Ducancel F. Boulain J.C. Lajeunesse C. Menez A. Nicolas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using standard procedure (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA template for reverse transcription PCR was synthesized from RNA poly(A)+by reverse transcription. We used Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a 3′ antisense gene-specific primer (primer 2, 5′-GCTCTCCCACCGCATCAG-3′) corresponding to the 3′ nucleotide sequence of coding exon 2 in the dermaseptinDrg2 gene (15Vouille V. Amiche M. Nicolas P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the cDNA was used for PCR. The reaction was performed using primer 2 and a 5′ sense gene-specific primer (primer 1, 5′-GGCTTCCCTGAAGAAATCTC-3′) corresponding to the 5′ nucleotide sequence of coding exon 1 in the dermaseptin Drg2 gene under the following conditions: 94 °C for 180 s, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 180 s. At the end of the last cycle, the sample was further incubated at 72 °C for 5 min. The product were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gel, and the DNA fragments were excised from the gel and purified by Qiaquick gel extraction kit protocol (Qiagen). The PCR product was cloned in the pGEMT-Easy vector system (Promega). To determine the structure of the 3′ ends and 5′ ends of dermaseptins B3 and B4, we used the 3′ RACE and 5′ RACE strategy. Recombinant plasmids of the library were extracted from bacteria grown at 37 °C for 16 h in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and linearized by Bam HI or Eco RI. In the 3′ RACE, cDNA cleaved by Eco RI was used as template with an antisense universal primer (5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG-3′) and a 3′ sense gene-specific primer (primer 3, 5′-GAAGAAAAGAGAGC TCTGTGG-3′). In the 5′ RACE, cDNA linearized by Bam HI was used as template with a sense T7 primer (5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and a 5′ antisense specific primer (primer 4, 5′-ACCTTTCAGCATATTTTTCCA-3′). The following thermal cycle profile was used for the RACE PCRs: 94 °C for 240 s, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. Race products were purified by Qiaquick Kit (Qiagen) and cloned in pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega). Nucleotide sequencing analysis was performed by dideoxy chain termination technique (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) in double stranded pGEMT-Easy vector. We used the fluorescence-labeled dye terminator method and an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. During the search for new growth factors in P. bicolor skin we have size-fractionated skin extracts on a calibrated Sephadex G-50 superfine column and tested aliquots of each fractions for the presence of mitogenic activities. As shown previously, restimulation of quiescent serum-deprived BP-A31cells with growth factors leads to a peak of [3H]thymidine incorporation during 24-h pulses (17Buchou T. Charollais R.H. Fagot D. Mester J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, several fractions of the skin extract were found to exert significant mitogenic activity. In sharp contrast, fractions eluting in the mid-volume of the column strongly inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation by BP-A31 cells. Examination of the treated cells by light microscopy showed that cells began to swell after a very short period of time and to lose their intracellular content. As a first attempt to isolate this unexpected cytotoxic activity, fractions 32–36 from G-50 were pooled and fractionated on a reversed-phase HPLC preparative column. As depicted in Fig. 1, the initial cytotoxic material was recovered under four wide UV-absorbing peaks eluting at Å 26.5, 29, 30.5, and 31.5 min, respectively. Each peak was collected and subsequently purified on a C18 Deltapak or Lichrosorb HPLC analytical columns. Six components were isolated, each emerging as a symetrical sharp peak accounting for >95% of the eluted material (Fig. 2). Inspection of the near UV spectra of each peak indicated the presence of the classical Trp signature. The primary structure of the purified peptide that was recovered under the 30.5 min eluting peak in Fig. 1 (Peptide P3) was successfully determined up to the 28th residue (Fig.3) by automated Edman degradation of the peptide (150 pmol) using a solid phase sequencer after carboxylic covalent binding of the sample to a Sequelon arylamine membrane. Because the sequence analysis does not yield information on additional post-translational modifications of amino acid side chains, the purified peptide was also subjected to mass spectral analysis using electrospray ionization spectrometry. Two unequivocal pseudomolecular ions ([M + 3H]3+/3 = 927.7 and [M +4H]4+/4 = 695.9) were observed that correspond to protonated species whose averaged molecular mass was 2780.4 (Fig. 2). This value corresponded to that expected theoretically for the experimentally determined amino acid sequence of 28 residues (Fig. 3). Solid phase sequence analysis of the major peptide corresponding to the 29-min peak of Fig. 1 (Peptide P4) was interpretable until cycle 23. When subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry analysis, the peptide molecular mass was estimated to be 2997.15 ± 0.48 Da. The discrepancy of 587 Da between the measured and calculated molecular mass is because of the occurrence of a carboxamidated COOH-terminal residue because treatment of the peptide with 20% trifluoroacetic acid during 20 min at 110 °C gave then an interpretable sequence up to residue 28 (Fig. 3) whose theoretical molecular mass corresponded exactly to that experimentally determined by mass spectrometry. Using a similar procedure, the amino acid sequences of the 31- and 33-residue carboxamidated peptides, corresponding respectively to the 31.5-min (Peptide P1) and 26.5-min (Peptide P2) eluting peaks in Fig. 1, were determined (Fig. 3). Two other active peptides named P5 and P6 were also recovered during the final purification of peptide P4 and sequenced by a gas phase protein sequencer (Fig. 3). Whereas peptides P3, P4, P5, and P6 constitute previously unknown structures, peptide P1 exhibits strong sequence similarities with an antimicrobial peptide, designated dermaseptin B1, that have been recently isolated fromP. bicolor skin (18Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In particular, the sequence of dermaseptin B1 matches exactly that of the COOH-terminal core, residues 5–31, of peptide P1. Also, the missing NH2-terminal tetrapeptide ALWK is present in the coding part of prepro-dermaseptin B1 (see below). These findings make it likely that the novel 31-residue peptide isolated herein represents the genuine native form of dermaseptin B1, whereas the shorter version arose through proteolysisin vivo or in vitro . In a similar vein, there is almost complete agreement between the amino acid sequences of the 33-residue peptide adenoregulin, also termed dermaseptin B2 (13Amiche M. Ducancel F. Boulain J.C. Lajeunesse C. Menez A. Nicolas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), isolated by Daly et al. (19Daly W.J. Caceres J. Moni W.R. Gusovski F. Moos M. Seamon B.K. Milton K. Myers W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10960-10963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) from Phyllomedusa skin and that of peptide P2 of the present study. The only exception is the presence of a carboxamidated valyl residue at the COOH terminus of B2 that was not detected in the former study. The search for similarity in the complete amino acid sequences of dermaseptin B1 and B2 and that of the four novel peptides was performed using the Clustal V multiple alignment software (20Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar). Pairwise and multiple alignments revealed a significant level of identity between the peptides (33–62% of amino acid positional identities). Typical conserved features are a tryptophan in position 3 and positive net charge because of the presence of lysine residues that punctuate an alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic sequence. These properties, along with other characteristics (see below), suggest that the 6 peptides are homologous and are products of genes that are all members of the same family. Accordingly, the four novel peptides P3, P4, P5, and P6 were named dermaseptin B3, B4, B5, and B6, respectively. Dermaseptins B3 and B4 were synthesized by the solid phase method to confirm their proposed structures and to demonstrate that cytotoxic/antimicrobial activities of the native peptides reflected intrinsic properties. Purification of the synthetic peptides was by reversed-phase HPLC. After purification, synthetic dermaseptins were shown to be indistinguishable from the natural products by the following chemical and physical criteria. HPLC analysis revealed that synthetic dermaseptins eluted exactly at the same positions as the natural corresponding products (Fig. 2); coinjection of the native and synthetic peptides resulted in only one symmetrical peak (not shown). The sequences of synthetic dermaseptin B3 and B4 could be determined up to Ala28 and Thr23, respectively, by automated Edman degradation after covalent binding of the peptides to a Sequelon arylamine membrane. Mass spectrometry of a sample of each synthetic peptide gave pseudo-molecular ions at m /z values corresponding to species whose molecular mass was identical to that obtained with the corresponding natural peptide. Because the synthetic products were found to be indistinguishable from their natural counterparts, they were used in the following to evaluate their antimicrobial spectra of activity. Synthetic dermaseptins B3 and B4 were tested for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. As shown in Table I and Fig.4, both peptides were highly active in inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the range 1–10 μm. The corresponding values for dermaseptin S1 from P. sauvagei (21Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliore-Samour D. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8824-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) are also reported for comparison. The dose-response profiles obtained showed sharp curves in which 0–100% inhibition was generated within a 1–2-fold peptide dilution, suggesting that peptide aggregation occurs at a threshold concentration before membrane disruption (Fig. 4). No colony forming units were observed when plating bacteria after an overnight incubation with 1 μmdermaseptins B3 or B4, which indicated that the peptides are bactericidal. Cytotoxicity of dermaseptins B3 and B4 against mammalian cells was evaluated on a quantitative basis through their ability to inhibit the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by human transformed MCF-7 cells. With this assay, no inhibition was detected at least up to a peptide concentration of 10 μm, a concentration corresponding respectively to the mean lethal dose against the least sensitive bacterial strain P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and 10-fold higher than that inhibiting the proliferation of the most sensitive strain S. aureus. Cytotoxicity, however, occurred at doses above 10 μm, with 50% inhibition at ∼20 μm (Fig. 4).Table IGrowth inhibition activity of DRS B3, DRS B4, and DRS S1OrganismMIC1-aThe minimal inhibitory concentration is defined as the dose at which 100% inhibition of growth was observed after 6 h of incubation at 37 °C in culture medium.

https://openalex.org/W2066215505,"Insect hemocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria facilitate binding and internalization of either cell-associated or cell-free LPS (Charalambidis, N. D., Foukas L. C., and Marmaras V. J. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 236, 200–206). An early event in LPS signaling in hemocytes involves protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Charalambidis N. D., Zervas C. G., Lambropoulou M., Katsoris P. G., and Marmaras V. J.(1995) Eur. J. Cell Biol. 67, 32–41). Here we report further data of LPS-mediated signal transduction responsible for Escherichia coli phagocytosis. We demonstrate that both adhesion of hemocytes to substrata and LPS stimulation can cause activation of p44MAPK in Ceratitis capitata hemocytes but with distinct kinetics indicating different functions. In addition, we showed that Drk, a homolog protein to the mammalian GRB2, is implicated in the transmission of LPS signaling, indicating that the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is involved. Either the cell-free or the cell-associated LPS appears to attach to the hemocyte surface by the same mechanism that is based on the cross-linking of LPS to membrane-associated p47 via the intermediacy of tyrosine derivatives generated by the action of phenol oxidase. By contrast, the cell-free LPS internalization into the hemocytes differs from the cell-associated LPS internalization. For E. coli internalization integrin receptors as well as cytoskeletal rearrangements are required, as judged by inhibition of E. coli internalization in the presence of the RGD peptide, β3-integrin antibodies, and cytochalasin D. Insect hemocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria facilitate binding and internalization of either cell-associated or cell-free LPS (Charalambidis, N. D., Foukas L.

Phagocytosis is a process that involves binding and internalization of pathogens, and it is essential for host defense in higher eukaryotes. Phagocytosis in mammals is mainly achieved by neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, whereas in insects it is achieved by granular cells and plasmatocytes (1Brown E.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 2Gillespi J.R. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Even though phagocytosis is an event of major importance for insect immunity, the biochemical pathways involved in it are poorly understood. Recently, substantial progress in understanding the mechanism of LPS 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; Drk, downstream of receptor kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Y, catechol; TBS, Tris-buffered saline;membrane CD14. 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; Drk, downstream of receptor kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Y, catechol; TBS, Tris-buffered saline;membrane CD14. binding andEscherichia coli entrapment as well as nodule formation has been achieved by Ceratitis capitata hemocytes. Upon LPS triggering, a protein, p47, is released from hemocytes, in vitro , which together with tyrosine and phenol oxidase cause aggregation of E. coli cells (3Charalambidis N.D. Bournazos S.N. Lambropoulou M. Marmaras V.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 7: 655-662Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Lambropoulou M. Katsoris P.G. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 32-41PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregation is based on the cross-linking of LPS to p47 via the intermediacy of tyrosine derivatives generated by the action of phenol oxidase (5Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This protein is also weakly associated with the hemocyte surface (4Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Lambropoulou M. Katsoris P.G. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 32-41PubMed Google Scholar) and covalently binds to LPS with the same mechanism. The LPS·catechol·p47 complex is then internalized into hemocytes, as judged by proteinase K treatment (5Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The key regulatory component for the complex formation is pro (phenol oxidase)-activators (serine proteases), which are released by hemocytes upon LPS triggering and activate the hemocyte surface phenol oxidase (6Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Zervas G.C. Marmaras V.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The process of LPS-stimulated release of p47 and pro-activators (phenol oxidase) depends on protein tyrosine phosphorylation (4Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Lambropoulou M. Katsoris P.G. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 32-41PubMed Google Scholar, 6Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Zervas G.C. Marmaras V.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mammalian macrophages, on the other hand, utilize either the LPS-binding protein and membrane CD14 for LPS binding and internalization or the alternative complement C3 pathway. LPS forms a ternary complex, LPS binding protein·LPS· membrane CD14 based on weak interactions. This complex is utilized for LPS internalization (7Gerner A.J. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). LPS-stimulated macrophages cause the activation of MAP kinases and the release of active molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β (8Weinstein S.L. Gold M.R. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 88: 4148-4152Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 9Weinstein S.L. June C.H. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3829-3838PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the signal is transduced through G proteins or through the Ras protein (10Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In insects, MAP kinases have only been detected in Drosophila and are implicated in the development of the compound eye (11Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently, the Drosophila MAP kinase DJNK, which is homologous to the mammalian c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, has been reported to participate in multiple physiological processes. The DJNK signaling pathway mediates morphogenesis and initiates an insect immune response upon LPS triggering (12Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Internalization of a pathogen by a phagocyte requires multiple successive interactions between the phagocyte and the target (1Brown E.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Internalization is largely achieved by members of the integrin family, a class of heterodimeric surface receptors expressed on almost all cells in higher eukaryotes. Integrins act not only as simple mediators of cell adhesion but can also transduce signals across the cell membranes (13Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated signals activate cellular proteins, including most prominently MAP and FAK kinases (14Hannigan G.E. Dedhar S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, integrins are important for processes such as embryonic morphogenesis, leukocyte migration, platelet aggregation, and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (1Brown E.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Hannigan G.E. Dedhar S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Concerning insects, integrins have so far only been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster and are known to be required for a host of morphogenetic units (2Gillespi J.R. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The above results prompted us to clarify further the signal transduction pathways leading to E. coli phagocytosis by hemocytes in response to LPS. In the present work we show that the Ras/MAP kinase signal transduction pathway plays a pivotal role in the immune responses of insect hemocytes upon LPS triggering. In addition, cell-free LPS is evidently internalized into hemocytes by a receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas E. coli is phagocytosed via a β3 integrin-dependent process. LPS (from E. coli , serotype 0111:B4) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-p47 and anti-phenol oxidase are rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for C. capitata p47 and phenol oxidase, respectively, raised at our laboratory, as described previously (5Charalambidis N.D.

ERK1 (K-23), an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide that corresponds to amino acids 305–327 within the XI subdomain of the rat ERK1 MAP kinase, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 and the anti-β3 monoclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 16–223 of the extracellular domain of the mouse β3 integrin subunit, as well as the A431 and human fibroblasts cell lysates, were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-human HLA DR monoclonal antibody was from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). 96-Well cell culture plates were from Corning Glass Works (Corning, NY), and 8-well glass slides were from Nunc, Inc. (Naperville, IL). Other materials were obtained as indicated and were of the highest grade available. C. capitata were reared as described previously (16Marmaras V.J. Tsakas S. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Isolation and homogenization of larval hemocytes, fat bodies, and integuments were performed as described elsewhere (6Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Zervas G.C. Marmaras V.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211887) Google Scholar). Hemocyte monolayers were prepared by allowing 105 cells to adhere on cell culture wells for 15 min at 25 °C, followed by washing with 100 μl of insect Ringer's solution (128 mmNaCl, 18 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm KCl, 2.3 mm NaHCO3, pH 7), for 3 times to remove nonadherent hemocytes. Hemocyte monolayers were cultured in Grace's insect medium (Sigma). Isolated hemocytes were suspended in Grace's insect medium and then either incubated nonadherently in a rotator or plated onto cell culture wells (105 cells per well) at 25 °C for the indicated times. For LPS stimulation, hemocyte monolayers, which had been cultured for 2 h at 25 °C, were stimulated with 100 μg/ml LPS for 5 min at 25 °C. In both cases, after incubations, hemocytes were washed twice with cold Ringer's solution, then lysed in boiling electrophoresis sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol), and processed for immunoblot analysis. Intracellular loading of Drk antibodies or control antibodies or bovine serum albumin was achieved by promoting uptake of extracellular proteins by incubation in a hypertonic medium, followed by lysis of cytoplasmic pinosomes in a hypotonic solution by the method of Okada and Rechsteiner (18Okada C.Y. Rechsteiner M. Cell. 1982; 29: 33-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, hemocyte monolayers, prepared as described above, were washed with Ringer's solution and then incubated for 10 min in a hypertonic medium containing 0.5 m sucrose, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1,000, and Drk IgGs, DR antibody, or bovine serum albumin (30 μg/ml) in Grace's insect medium. The monolayers were then rinsed with a hypotonic solution of diluted Grace's medium/water (6:4) and incubated in the hypotonic medium for 2 min. After rinsing 3 times with normal Grace's medium, the monolayers were allowed to recover for 2 h before further procedures were performed. Viability of the hemocytes was assessed by exclusion of trypan blue dye (Sigma). After loading and cell recovery, hemocytes were stimulated with 100 μg/ml LPS for 5 min and then washed and allowed to secrete for 1 h. After that, culture media were collected, analyzed in SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted against p47. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205506) Google Scholar) in 12% acrylamide, 0.12% bisacrylamide slab gels (17Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211887) Google Scholar). After gel separation, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Immobilon P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) according to Towbin et al. (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). Membranes were then incubated in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody in the appropriate concentration (0.5 μg/ml for anti-rat ERK1, anti-β3 integrin, and PY20 antibodies or 1:2,000 and 1:10,000 dilution of anti-Drk and anti-p47 antisera, respectively) in TBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min in TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugates (Transduction Laboratories) diluted 1:4,000. Immunoreactivity was detected by incubating the membranes in TBS containing 0.06% (w/v) diaminobenzidine, 0.018% NiCl2 (w/v), 0.3% H2O2 (v/v). In the case of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) methodology (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stripping of membranes after ECL detection was performed according to the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Formation of the radiolabeled LPS-catechol adduct (LPS-Y) and the assays of LPS-Y binding and internalization into the hemocytes were performed as described previously (5Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For inhibition experiments, hemocyte monolayers were first incubated in 100 μl/well of 1 μg/ml anti-β3, or 2 mm RGDS peptide (Sigma), or 10 μm cytochalasin D (Sigma) diluted in Grace's insect medium for 30 min at 25 °C before the addition of the labeled LPS-Y complex. 200-μl aliquots of hemocytes suspended in Grace's medium (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were added into the wells of a multiwell glass LabTeK chamber (Nunc). After allowing 15 min for settlement and attachment of hemocytes, monolayers were washed three times in Grace's medium to remove nonadherent cells and challenged with E. coli or latex particles (0.8 μm diameter, Sigma). The phagocytic activity of E. coli was determined by a fluorescence quenching assay with trypan blue. The assay is a modification of a method originally established for vertebrate blood cells to distinguish ingested from attached bacteria (21Rahloff L.H. Wiesner A. Gotz P. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 1045-1049Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled E. coli suspension (∼1 × 108 E. coli ) was added into 200 μl of monolayers (ratio E. coli /hemocyte, 20:1). After incubation for 2 h at 31 °C the non-adhering E. coli were removed by exchanging the supernatants three times by Grace's medium. 250 μl of the supernatant in each well was exchanged by a trypan blue solution (2 mg/ml in Grace's medium). 20 min later the cells were washed with culture medium and fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution for 10 min. Trypan blue quenches only non-phagocytosed bacteria. Phagocytosis was observed by fluorescent microscopy. The phagocytic activity of latex partially was determined by the phase contrast microscope; under the microscope the particles appear refringent. For inhibition experiments hemocyte monolayers were preincubated in 100 μl/cell of genistein or anti-phenol oxidase or anti-β3(diluted 500-fold) in insect Ringer's solution for 15–30 min at 25 °C before the addition of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeledE. coli cells. The phagocytic assay was also performed in the continuous presence of anti-β3 or anti-phenol oxidase antibodies in the above solution. Insect hemocytes require protein tyrosine phosphorylation in order to attach and internalize cell-free or cell-associated LPS (3Charalambidis N.D. Bournazos S.N. Lambropoulou M. Marmaras V.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 7: 655-662Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Lambropoulou M. Katsoris P.G. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 32-41PubMed Google Scholar, 5Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To elucidate the triggered LPS signaling pathway which leads to phagocytosis of bacteria, we identified the tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides present in hemocyte extracts. Immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal antibody PY20 and ECL as detection method showed a number of phosphorylated proteins (Fig.1). Control experiments where antibodies were preincubated either with tyrosine phosphate or with a mixture of serine/threonine phosphates demonstrated the specificity of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. It is well known that hemocytes normally adhere to and spread upon foreign surfaces in protein-free medium (22Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Insect Physiol. 1995; 41: 481-488Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the adherence of hemocytes in the absence of any stimulus was relatively constant under the conditions of the assay, with an average of 70% in 15 min. Furthermore, it is well known that cell adhesion affects the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cells (23Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jewell K. Karpon-Bras C. Jeevaratnam P. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1165-1174PubMed Google Scholar). To study the putative pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins upon LPS triggering, three series of experiments were performed. In the first one series, hemocytes were kept in suspension (as control for plated cells); in the second series, hemocytes were plated in the absence of any stimulator (as control for LPS-triggered); and in the third series, monolayers were treated with LPS and incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends. As shown in Fig. 2, only a few proteins were significantly phosphorylated on tyrosine, including a protein with molecular mass of 44 kDa (identified as MAP kinase, see below). Although some variation was observed between different experiments due to a rather low level of activation of hemocytes inherent in the preparation of isolated hemocytes, the most important difference, constant in all experiments, was that observed between hemocytes in suspension and attached cells. Cells in suspension showed a progressive dephosphorylation in relation to incubation time, presumably due to activation of hemocytes during the isolation procedure. By contrast, attached hemocytes showed a progressive increase in protein phosphorylation due to the adherence effect. Focusing further on the 44-kDa protein, which shows a maximum of phosphorylation at 20 min, we succeeded in identifying a polypeptide homologue to ERK1 of mammals and ERK-A of D. melanogaster in hemocytes, fat body, and integument (epidermal cells plus cuticle) ofC. capitata . The identification was based on immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against rat ERK1, which recognize both the 42- and 44-kDa forms of MAP kinases (Fig.3, lane 1 ) and a MAP kinase ofDrosophila (DmERK-A) (Fig. 3, lane 2 ). Indeed, anti-rat ERK1 antibodies recognize in hemocytes, fat body, and integumental extracts of C. capitata a 44-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5 , respectively) and in the integument a 42-kDa polypeptide as well. To correlate the 44-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide of Fig. 2to p44MAPK, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane of Fig.2 was stripped from the various antibodies after the ECL treatment and was incubated with anti-rat ERK1. As shown in Fig. 2 B the band of 44 kDa is aligned perfectly with that recognized by rat ERK1 antibodies. Furthermore, by comparing A and B of Fig. 2, in regard to p44MAPK, it can be concluded that although the quantity of p44MAPK remained rather unchanged (Fig. 2 B ), the adhesion-induced MAP kinase activation was increased up to 20 min and then declined progressively (Fig.2 A ). Thus, cell adhesion can promptly and effectively activate MAP kinase, a situation already well known in mammalian systems (25Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). LPS-triggered hemocytes in suspension culture also caused a strong activation of p44MAPK (Fig.4 A ), whereas the quantity of ERK1 remained rather unchanged (Fig. 4 B ). However, the kinetics of adhesion-mediated activation and LPS activation are distinct. The adhesion-mediated activation of p44MAPKreached maximum at 20 min (Fig. 2), whereas the activation by LPS reached maximum at 5 min (Fig. 4). Similar results have already been obtained with integrin and growth factors (26Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that even though both LPS and cell adhesion stimulate MAP kinase activities they seem to demonstrate important regulatory differences. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether factors affecting cytoskeleton rearrangements, e.g. cytochalasin D, might influence the activation of MAP kinase by LPS. Treatment of hemocytes with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin filament formation, had no effect on LPS-induced MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4), suggesting that these kinases are not associated with cell shape changes including cell spreading and phagocytosis. As MAP kinases are considered to be key molecules for the convergence of extracellular signals, we sought to elucidate an upstream component in the pathway leading to the MAP kinase activation. A key component that functions downstream of the tyrosine kinases and upstream of the MAP kinase pathway is Drk, which is homologous to the mammalian GRB2 (27Olivier J.P. Raabe T. Henkemeyer M. Dickson B. Mbamalu G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Hafen E. Pawson T. Cell. 1993; 73: 179-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We initially tried to identify the presence of the Drk protein inC. capitata larval tissues. Immunoblot analysis by using polyclonal anti-Drk antibodies (Fig. 5) clearly showed a 24-kDa polypeptide recognized by anti-Drk in the tissues tested. Furthermore, to determine whether this SH2-SH3 adaptor protein is implicated in the transmission of LPS signaling, we used osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles to load hemocytes with anti-Drk. Fig. 6 A showed the successive uptake of anti-Drk IgGs by the hemocytes. Furthermore, to determine whether the LPS signaling is directly affected by Drk, we examined whether the p47 immune protein was released or not after LPS stimulation of the antibody-loaded hemocytes. Fig. 6 B showed that in hemocytes loaded with anti-Drk, the LPS-induced release of the immune protein p47 was largely inhibited (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10 ) compared with the unloaded hemocytes (Fig. 6,lanes 3 and 4 ), which reached the level of basal secretion (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2 ). The specificity of the anti-Drk effect was checked by loading the hemocytes with bovine serum albumin (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8 ) or with the monoclonal anti-DR, an irrelevant antibody (Fig. 6,lanes 5 and 6 ). Consequently, in hemocytes the Ras/MAP kinase pathway is activated in response to endotoxic LPS.Figure 6Effect of anti-Drk loading in LPS-stimulated secretion of p47. A , immunoblot analysis of anti-Drk IgGs loaded into the cytoplasm of the hemocytes. Hemocyte monolayers, cultured for 3 h after loading with anti-Drk IgGs, were lysed in electrophoresis sample buffer.

Hemocytes were either loaded with antibodies (lanes 5–10 ) or underwent the loading procedure without the inclusion of any antibody (lanes 1–4 ). Subsequently, the hemocytes were either stimulated with 100 μg/ml LPS for 5 min at 25 °C (lanes 3–10 ) or not (lanes 1 and 2 ). After culturing for an additional 1 h at 25 °C, the incubation media were collected, and the secreted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against p47.

In the following experiments, an attempt was undertaken to record some of the requirements needed for the process of E. coli phagocytosis by hemocytes and to compare it with the known requirements for cell-free LPS internalization into hemocytes (4Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Lambropoulou M. Katsoris P.G. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 32-41PubMed Google Scholar, 5Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J.

Biol. 1996; 26: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The phagocytic activity of the hemocytes against both latex beads and heat-fixed E. coli cells was evaluated by a fluorescence quenching assay with trypan blue (21Rahloff L.H. Wiesner A. Gotz P. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 1045-1049Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In both cases about 13% of the cells kept at 31 °C were phagocytically active. By employing the above assay, it was possible to demonstrate that the phagocytic activity was largely inhibited when hemocytes were first incubated with antibodies against phenol oxidase or an inhibitor of phenol oxidase activity (phenylthiourea) (TableI). These results strongly support the hypothesis that, in vivo , the cross-linking of LPS (E. coli ) to the hemocyte surface p47 via the intermediacy of tyrosine derivatives generated by the action of phenol oxidase (5Charalambidis N.D. Foukas L.C. Marmaras V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is a prerequisite for the phagocytosis of E. coli cells by hemocytes. In addition, genistein, as well as disodium 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate, an inhibitor of cell secretion, also blocked E. coli phagocytosis (Table I), further supporting the above hypothesis. Both inhibitors for different reasons blocked the LPS-dependent release of immune proteins p47 and pro-activators (phenol oxidase) (4Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Lambropoulou M. Kat"

Trypsin digestion was used to test for structural differences between mature and core-glycosylated forms of P-glycoprotein. We found that the core-glycosylated wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins were both 100-fold more sensitive to trypsin compared with the mature form of the wild-type enzyme. This result suggested that the core-glycosylated forms of both wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins have similar unfolded structures, whereas the mature enzyme is folded into a more compact structure. The core-glycosylated mutant P-glycoproteins could be converted to the mature trypsin-resistant form by synthesis in the presence of drug substrate. Addition of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to stabilize the core-glycosylated intermediate resulted in the accumulation but not maturation of the mutant protein. Further analysis showed that the second transmembrane domain TMD2 also became more resistant to trypsin digestion only after coexpression with TMD1 in the presence of substrate. Taken together, these results suggest that simply stabilizing the core-glycosylated intermediate is not sufficient to promote maturation of the processing mutants and that drug substrates induce maturation by promoting superfolding of the transmembrane domains.

P-glycoprotein, the product of the human multidrug resistance (MDR1 ) gene, is an ATP-dependent drug pump that extrudes a broad range of cytotoxic agents from the cell (reviewed in Ref. 1Gottesman M.M.

The protein plays an important role in the phenomenon of multidrug resistance during cancer chemotherapy (4Chan H.S.L. Grogan T.M. Deboer G. Haddad G. Gallie B.L. Ling V. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein belongs to the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of transport proteins. Its 1280 amino acids are organized into two tandem repeats; each repeat consists of a hydrophobic domain followed by an ATP-binding domain. Both tandem repeats are required for activity (5Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inactivation of either ATP-binding site by mutagenesis or chemical modification inhibits activity (6Azzaria M. Schurr E.

The composition of the primary amino sequence of P-glycoprotein is important for synthesis of the native protein, because point mutations throughout the molecule can cause misprocessing. The misprocessed mutants accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum as core-glycosylated intermediates in association with molecular chaperones such as calnexin and Hsc 70 (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J.

These defects in processing, however, can be overcome by carrying out synthesis in the presence of drug substrates (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our aim was to understand why mutations in P-glycoprotein cause misprocessing and how drug substrates induce correct folding. We used trypsin digestion of P-glycoprotein to detect structural differences in the wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins. We show that the core-glycosylated forms of both wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins were 100-fold more sensitive to trypsin compared with the mature enzyme. Conversion of the mutant P-glycoproteins into compact trypsin-resistant forms was mediated by drug-induced superfolding of the transmembrane domains. The results suggest that the core-glycosylated forms of wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins are structurally similar and in a “loosely folded” conformation, compared with the mature enzyme. It appears that the misprocessing mutations have to overcome a “hurdle” in the superfolding pathway to the native enzyme, a barrier that is lowered by synthesis in the presence of drug substrate. The cDNAs were constructed, mutated, and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT21 as described previously (5Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

For purification purposes a full-length MDR1 cDNA and the cDNAs coding for the half-molecules were modified to encode for 10 histidine residues at the COOH-ends of the proteins (14Loo T.W.

The membranes (5 mg/ml protein) were treated for 5 min at 22 °C with various amounts of TPCK-trypsin (Sigma, 12,000 BAEE units per mg), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of lima bean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington).

The major product of the misprocessed mutants expressed in HEK 293 cells is the 150-kDa core-glycosylated intermediate. Misprocessing mutations are located throughout the molecule; these include the transmembrane domains (e.g. A123L), intracellular (e.g. E243A) and extracellular (e.g. Y853C) loops, the linker region (e.g. E707A), and both nucleotide-binding domains (e.g. G427C, P1194A). Regardless of the location of these mutations, all could be converted to the fully mature enzyme (170 kDa) when the transfected cells were incubated with CsA. We used CsA because it was the most potent compound to affect protein kinesis (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). An example is shown in Fig. 1 A . When mutant G268V was expressed in HEK 293 cells (no drug , lane 1 ), the major product was a 150-kDa core-glycosylated protein that was sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (data not shown). In the presence of 10 μm CsA (+ drug ,lane 1 ), the major product was the fully mature enzyme (170 kDa) that was resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H (data not shown). We attempted to purify the core-glycosylated intermediate of mutant G268V to determine whether it was still active. A polyhistidine tag was attached at the COOH-end of the mutant P-glycoprotein to facilitate purification by nickel-chelate chromatography (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These attempts were unsuccessful because the core-glycosylated intermediate did not bind to the resin. The inability of the core-glycosylated intermediate to bind the resin was not due to problems with solubilizing the intermediate with detergent or with aggregation. The mutant core-glycosylated intermediate could be readily solubilized with mild detergents such as digitonin (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that it remained in the soluble fraction after high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g , 1 h). The mutant protein was recovered by the nickel column only after its conversion to the mature form of the enzyme in the presence of drug substrate (data not shown). All other mutants gave similar results. Similarly, the mature 170-kDa wild-type protein bound the nickel column more efficiently than the core-glycosylated 150-kDa protein (data not shown), suggesting that the core-glycosylated and mature enzyme may be structurally different. To determine whether the mature (170-kDa) and core-glycosylated (150-kDa) forms of P-glycoprotein were structurally different, we tested the mutant P-glycoproteins-A52 for their sensitivity to digestion by trypsin. As shown in Fig. 1 A (no drug ), the 150-kDa protein of mutant G268V was quite sensitive to trypsin. It was completely digested with 10 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin (lane 3 ). By contrast, the mutant became about 100-fold more resistant to digestion by trypsin when converted to the mature form (170-kDa) after growing in the presence of CsA. Even when synthesized in the presence of CsA, the 150-kDa protein remained sensitive to 10 μg/ml trypsin. Similar results were observed with the other mutants or when expression was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against either NBD (data not shown). The sensitivity of the wild-type enzyme was similar to the processing mutant (Fig. 1 B ). Again, the mature enzyme was about 100-fold more resistant to trypsin than the core-glycosylated 150-kDa protein. These results suggested that the core-glycosylated intermediate of both the wild-type and mutant enzymes were in a more “open” conformation and are likely to be structurally similar. The core-glycosylated wild-type enzyme, however, is quite efficiently converted to the mature form even in the absence of drug substrate. It was possible that rapid degradation of the core-glycosylated intermediate did not allow it time to fold to the mature form. Therefore, if the intermediate could be stabilized in the absence of drug substrate, then conversion to the mature form should occur. To test this possibility, we expressed mutant G268V in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132). Proteasome inhibitors such as MG-132 prevent degradation of core-glycosylated wild-type P-glycoprotein, as well as that of the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (16Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 17Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C (lanes 3 and 4 ), incubation of mutant G268V for 24 h in the presence of MG-132 resulted in accumulation of the core-glycosylated intermediate and a 130-kDa digestion product. There was, however, no detectable maturation of the intermediate. Increased accumulation of the core-glycosylated intermediate and the 130-kDa digestion product was also seen with the wild-type enzyme (lanes 1 and 2 ) but not in the amount of the mature (170-kDa) product. These results confirm previous findings that stabilizing the core-glycosylated intermediate does not enhance maturation (16Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 17Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The proteolytic digestion experiments suggested that misprocessing mutations likely cause P-glycoprotein to remain in an unfolded state, whereas the presence of drug substrates induces superfolding into the native structure. To determine how drug substrates induce superfolding, we tested their effects on association of the homologous halves of P-glycoprotein that were expressed as separate polypeptides. The two homologous halves of P-glycoprotein can be expressed as separate polypeptides, but coupling of ATPase activity to drug-binding requires the contemporaneous expression of both halves (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This suggested that both halves are necessary for drug binding. To test for interactions between the homologous halves we coexpressed each half of P-glycoprotein that contained either a histidine tag (N-Half-His or C-Half-His) or the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 (N-Half-A52 or C-Half-A52) at the COOH-end of the molecule and tested for association using nickel-chelate chromatography. We first introduced a processing mutation (G268V) into N-Half-His. Unlike the histidine-tagged full-length G268V P-glycoprotein, the mutant (G268V) N-Half-His could be recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography, even when grown with no CsA (Fig.2 A ). Wild-type or G268V N-Half-His molecules were then coexpressed with the C-Half-A52 molecule. We reasoned that if the two homologous halves associated, then C-Half-A52 could be recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2 B , C-Half-A52 was not retained on the column when expressed alone or when coexpressed with mutant G268V N-Half-His in the absence of CsA. In contrast, CsA promoted interaction between C-Half-A52 and mutant G268V N-Half-His, such that most of the C-Half-A52 was now recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography. Similarly, interaction between wild-type N-Half-His and C-Half-A52 was also enhanced by the presence of CsA. These interactions persisted even after washing the membranes several times to remove substrate, suggesting that the interactions are due to enhanced association during biosynthesis, rather than drug-induced stabilization of the complex. We then tested the effect of a misprocessing mutation located in the C-half of P-glycoprotein (A841L), on the ability of the two halves to associate. In this case, the epitope tag for monoclonal antibody A52 was attached to the COOH-end of the N-half molecule (N-Half-A52), and the histidine tag was attached to the COOH-end of the C-half molecule (C-Half-His). Wild-type N-Half-A52 was coexpressed in HEK 293 cells with either wild-type C-Half-His or mutant (A841L) C-Half-His, in the presence or absence of CsA. Fig.3 A shows that CsA had a dramatic effect on the association of A841L C-Half-His and wild-type N-Half-A52. No N-Half-A52 was retained by the nickel column when coexpression was carried out in the absence of drug substrate. In the presence of CsA, however, two bands (A and B) were eluted. Band B has an apparent mass of 72 kDa, and its size corresponds to the core-glycosylated form of the N-half molecule. Band A (96 kDa) appeared to be a more extensively glycosylated form of the N-half molecule, suggesting that this form of the protein had passed through the Golgi apparatus. This was confirmed by observing that both bands A and B were sensitive to digestion with PNGase F (Fig. 3 B ), but only band B (72 kDa) was sensitive to endoglycosidase H. Cell surface labeling with membrane-impermeant biotin hydrazide (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the 96-kDa N-Half-A52 was processed correctly and targeted to the cell surface (data not shown). Fig. 3 A also shows that coexpression of wild-type N-Half-A52 with wild-type C-Half-His in the presence of CsA resulted in about a 2-fold increase in the amount of Band A recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography. No 96-kDa (Band A) protein was observed when only the N-Half molecule was expressed in the presence or absence of drug substrate (see Fig. 2 A ). This suggested that the misprocessing mutations and drug substrates significantly affected the association of the two homologous halves of P-glycoprotein, but had no detectable effects on the individual half-molecules. P-glycoprotein has four domains organized in two tandem repeats. Each repeat has a TMD containing six predicted transmembrane segments followed by the NBD. Drug substrates may promote superfolding by inducing association of the transmembrane domains because evidence shows that the transmembrane segments from both halves of P-glycoprotein contribute to drug binding (15Loo T.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1051-1061Google Scholar). Because each domain of P-glycoprotein can be expressed as a separate polypeptide (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we tested whether drug substrates influenced association of the transmembrane domains. The NH2-terminal (TMD1) and the COOH-terminal (TMD2) transmembrane domains were contemporaneously expressed as separate polypeptides in the presence or absence of substrate and tested for their sensitivity to digestion by trypsin. To facilitate detection of expression, the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 was attached to the COOH-end of the molecule. Fig.4 (no drug ) shows that when TMD2-A52 was coexpressed with TMD1 in the absence of drug substrate, it was very sensitive to trypsin. Degradation of TMD2-A52 was detected at a trypsin concentration of 10 μg/ml, and digestion was complete at 100 μg/ml. Similar results were obtained when TMD2-A52 was expressed alone in the presence or absence of CsA (data not shown). By contrast, Fig. 4 (+ drug ) shows that when TMD2-A52 was coexpressed with TMD1 in the presence of substrate, it became resistant to high levels of trypsin (>1000 μg/ml). We were unable to detect any difference in the sensitivity of TMD1-A52 to trypsin, when it was coexpressed with TMD2, in the presence or absence of CsA (data not shown). Drug substrates, however, caused a 5–10-fold increase in the amount of TMD1-A52 only when coexpressed with TMD2 (immunoblots of whole cells, data not shown). It is thought that mutants are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum because they are structurally different from the wild-type enzyme. Our results, however, suggest that rather than inducing misfolding, the mutations cause accumulation of a core-glycosylated intermediate that resembles that of the wild-type enzyme. Our results suggest that the drug substrates promote superfolding of the enzyme by initiating interactions between TMD1 and TMD2. Indeed, increased protection of TMD2 from trypsin digestion after coexpression with TMD1 occurred only after expression in the presence of drug substrate (Fig. 4). In whole cells, drug substrates did not increase the level of expression of any of the TMDs when each was expressed separately but caused about a 5–10-fold increase in the amount of TMD1 and TMD2 only when they were coexpressed. Similarly, there was no increased expression of either TMD when each was coexpressed with either NBD (data not shown). Most of the core-glycosylated wild-type enzyme appears to exist in a partially unfolded state in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.1 B ) and may not be functional until just before or after it has left the endoplasmic reticulum. This may be of practical value to the cell. By keeping P-glycoprotein and possibly other plasma membrane transport proteins in a partially unfolded state until the very last moment, the cell prevents transport of various substrates into the endoplasmic reticulum. This may be accomplished with the aid of chaperones such as calnexin and Hsc 70 (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is possible that when the protein is ready for trafficking to the plasma membrane, conformational changes due to superfolding of the TMDs may be able to dislodge the enzyme from the chaperones. The results also show for the first time that the TMDs alone are sufficient to mediate drug-protein interactions in P-glycoprotein. Although, it has been observed that mutations in the NBDs can affect substrate specificity of P-glycoprotein (23Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Beaudet L. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17159-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), their presence is not required for drug binding. The requirement of both TMDs to be present for drug-induced folding is consistent with the observation that residues in the transmembrane segments from both halves of the molecule are required for drug binding (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Bruggemann E.P. Currier S.J. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol.

In a broader context, the results suggests that another strategy to overcome P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance during cancer chemotherapy could be to identify compounds that could prevent superfolding of the core-glycosylated intermediate. These compounds could mimic the effects of mutations that cause misprocessing."
https://openalex.org/W2077366814,"We have shown that lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) increases endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) expression at the transcriptional level (Zembowicz, A., Tang, J.-L., and Wu, K. K. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17006–17010). To elucidate the mechanism by which lyso-PC increases the eNOS transcription, we identified Sp1 sites at −104 to −90 and PEA3 sites at −40 to −24 as being involved in lyso-PC-induced promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of Sp1 sites resulted in a marked reduction of basal and lyso-PC-induced activity whereas PEA3 site mutation abrogated response to lyso-PC. Band shift assays revealed that lyso-PC augmented Sp1 binding activity. Pretreatment of cells or nuclear extracts with okadaic acid reduced the Sp1 binding activity. Furthermore, okadaic acid treatment abrogated the lyso-PC induced promoter augmentation. Lyso-PC increased the nuclear extract protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, which was suppressed by okadaic acid treatment. These results suggest that lyso-PC up-regulates eNOS transcription by a PP2A-dependent increase in Sp1 binding activity.

Three isoforms of NOS, i.e. neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS-I), inducible-NOS (iNOS or NOS-II), and endothelial-NOS (eNOS or NOS-III) have been identified and characterized (5Bredt D.S. Synder S.H. Proc.

The inducible form is expressed by stimulation with several inflammatory and mitogenic mediators (8Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol.

Altered endothelial NO productions have been implicated in several important cardiovascular disorders: hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, and diabetes. The mechanism by which NO synthesis is deranged in these disorders remained unclear. Although NOS-III is considered to be a housekeeping gene, recent studies have provided evidence to suggest that NOS-III is induced by shear stress (10Nadaud S. Philippe M. Arnal J.F. Michel J.B.

Res. 1995; 76: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings imply that induction of NOS-III plays an important role in protecting vascular integrity under stress. Work from our laboratory has shown that lyso-PC increases NOS-III expression at the transcriptional level (14Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which lyso-PC and other inducing agents increase NOS-III gene transcription remains to be elucidated.The 5′-flanking region of human eNOS gene has been cloned and sequenced (16Marsden P.A. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.L. Hall A.V. Shi X.-M. Tsui L.C. Shappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region adjacent to the transcription initiation sites is TATA-less and GC-rich. Functional analysis of the promoter activity conferred by the 5′-flanking region has shown that a canonical Sp1 site situated between −104 to −90 is required for the basal promoter activity (17Tang J.-L. Zembowicz A. Xu X.-M. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether this site is involved in lyso-PC-induced transcriptional activation. The purpose of this study is to identify cis-acting elements and nuclear transcriptional activators that are important in augmentation of eNOS transcription in response to lyso-PC stimulation. Our results indicate that Sp1 site at −104 to −90 and PEA3 site at −40 to −24 are required for lyso-PC-induced transcriptional activation. Lyso-PC increases the promoter function by enhancing the Sp1 binding activity mediated by the action of protein phosphatase 2A.DISCUSSIONLyso-PC is a main component of oxidized low density lipoprotein (22Parthasarathy S. Streinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The level of lyso-PC is highly elevated in human atherosclerotic tissues (23Portman O.W. Alexander M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that lyso-PC increases chemotaxis for monocytes and induces endothelial adhesive molecules such as intercellular adhesive molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesive molecule-1, which mediate monocyte and neutrophil adhesion to vascular endothelium (24Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Schichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, lyso-PC has been considered to play an important role in monocyte accumulation in the arterial walls. Furthermore, lyso-PC induces the expression platelet-derived growth factor A and B subunits and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor from endothelial cells (25Kume N. Gimbrone M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Kume N. Cybulski M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). These growth factors promote smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. These findings have led to the conclusion that lyso-PC is a key mediator of atherosclerosis (22Parthasarathy S. Streinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Work from this laboratory provides evidence to indicate that the expression of NOS-III and cyclooxygenase-2 are stimulated by lyso-PC (27Zembowicz A. Jones S.L. Wu K.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the synthesis of NO and prostacyclin, which act synergistically to block monocyte adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation; platelet activation and aggregation; and pathological vasoconstriction. This leads to a postulate that vascular injurious agents such as lyso-PC creates a yin-yan situation in which it induces the expression of vasoprotective genes to counteract the vascular damaging genes. It is interesting to note that lyso-PC induces the expressions of those diverse genes with two distinct types of kinetics: 1) rapid, transient as in heparin-binding epidermal growth factor and cyclooxygenase-2 gene induction and 2) delayed, sustained as in eNOS and intercellular adhesive molecule-1 gene induction. It is unclear whether these two types of genes are transcriptionally regulated by a common mechanism. In fact, the mechanism by which lyso-PC induces any of these genes had not been reported previously. This report is the first to shed light on the promoter regulation of eNOS gene by lyso-PC. Our results indicate that lyso-PC enhances the transcriptional activation of this housekeeping gene primarily by increasing the Sp1 binding activity via a PP2A-dependent reaction. Ets binding to its cognate site on the promoter region is also involved in basal and lyso-PC-induced eNOS transcription.Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcriptional activator mediating basal and regulated gene expression. Sp1 binding to its cognate motif depends not only on nuclear Sp1 levels but also on posttranslational modification of the Sp1 molecule. Recent studies indicate that Sp1 binding activity is influenced by phosphorylation: phosphorylation decreases, whereas dephosphorylation by the action of phosphatases increases Sp1 binding activity (28Daniel S.

A recent study on the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene indicates that glucose induces this gene transcription by a mechanism involving dephosphorylation of Sp1 by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (28Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our data, which show suppression of lyso-PC-induced Sp1 binding activity by okadaic acid, but not vanadate, and a selective increase in PP2A activity by lyso-PC, which was inhibited by okadaic acid, are consistent with a role of PP2A in modifying Sp1 binding activity. Results from this study led us to postulate that the Sp1 is phosphorylated at the basal cellular state, and lyso-PC activates PP2A, which in turn dephosphorylate Sp1, resulting in an increased Sp1 binding activity.Signal pathways for lyso-PC-induced transcriptional activation have not been fully established. A recent study suggests the involvement of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathway that leads to AP1 activation and binding to its cognate site (30Fang X. Gibson S. Flowers M. Furui T. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13683-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether JNK and/or other mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are involved in increased Sp1 binding activity. It is possible that lyso-PC may increase Sp1 binding activity by activating protein phosphatases via the mitogen-activated protein kinase or other kinase pathways. This is being investigated in our laboratory.Our results indicate that a PEA3/Ets sequence in the promoter/enhancer region of eNOS gene is involved in basal and lyso-PC-induced promoter activity. Nuclear Ets-related proteins contain a large family of polypeptides sharing an ETS domain (31Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). They bind to purine-rich sequences with a GGA core. The 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of the GGA core confer relative specificity for Ets family proteins. The GGA-containing sequences on eNOS lack a specificity for any given class of Ets-related proteins. This is in agreement with our experimental data showing promiscuity of binding for several representatives of Ets family proteins. Ets proteins are involved in cellular response to external stresses. They generally serve as co-activators for transcriptional activators including Sp1 (32Khachigian L.A. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that PEA3 and Sp1 sequences are often colocalized on the promoter/enhancer region and binding of Ets and Sp1 to their respective sites causes a synergistic activation of a number of genes (33Gegonne A. Bosselut R. Bailly R.-A. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As regards the activation of eNOS gene, our data are in agreement with the proposition that Ets serves as a co-activator for Sp1. Binding of Ets alone resulted in minimal promoter activation, whereas it augmented Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation. It is possible that Ets interacts with components of the general transcription factors in the preinitiation complex through which it may enhance recruitment of the preinitiation complex to the promoter region.

Three isoforms of NOS, i.e. neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS-I), inducible-NOS (iNOS or NOS-II), and endothelial-NOS (eNOS or NOS-III) have been identified and characterized (5Bredt D.S. Synder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar, 6Stuehr D.J. Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Weise M.F. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The inducible form is expressed by stimulation with several inflammatory and mitogenic mediators (8Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol.

Altered endothelial NO productions have been implicated in several important cardiovascular disorders: hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, and diabetes. The mechanism by which NO synthesis is deranged in these disorders remained unclear. Although NOS-III is considered to be a housekeeping gene, recent studies have provided evidence to suggest that NOS-III is induced by shear stress (10Nadaud S. Philippe M. Arnal J.F. Michel J.B.

Res. 1995; 76: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings imply that induction of NOS-III plays an important role in protecting vascular integrity under stress. Work from our laboratory has shown that lyso-PC increases NOS-III expression at the transcriptional level (14Zembowicz A. Tang J.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which lyso-PC and other inducing agents increase NOS-III gene transcription remains to be elucidated. The 5′-flanking region of human eNOS gene has been cloned and sequenced (16Marsden P.A. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.L. Hall A.V. Shi X.-M. Tsui L.C. Shappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region adjacent to the transcription initiation sites is TATA-less and GC-rich. Functional analysis of the promoter activity conferred by the 5′-flanking region has shown that a canonical Sp1 site situated between −104 to −90 is required for the basal promoter activity (17Tang J.-L. Zembowicz A. Xu X.-M. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether this site is involved in lyso-PC-induced transcriptional activation. The purpose of this study is to identify cis-acting elements and nuclear transcriptional activators that are important in augmentation of eNOS transcription in response to lyso-PC stimulation. Our results indicate that Sp1 site at −104 to −90 and PEA3 site at −40 to −24 are required for lyso-PC-induced transcriptional activation. Lyso-PC increases the promoter function by enhancing the Sp1 binding activity mediated by the action of protein phosphatase 2A. DISCUSSIONLyso-PC is a main component of oxidized low density lipoprotein (22Parthasarathy S. Streinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The level of lyso-PC is highly elevated in human atherosclerotic tissues (23Portman O.W. Alexander M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that lyso-PC increases chemotaxis for monocytes and induces endothelial adhesive molecules such as intercellular adhesive molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesive molecule-1, which mediate monocyte and neutrophil adhesion to vascular endothelium (24Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Schichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, lyso-PC has been considered to play an important role in monocyte accumulation in the arterial walls. Furthermore, lyso-PC induces the expression platelet-derived growth factor A and B subunits and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor from endothelial cells (25Kume N. Gimbrone M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Kume N. Cybulski M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). These growth factors promote smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. These findings have led to the conclusion that lyso-PC is a key mediator of atherosclerosis (22Parthasarathy S. Streinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Work from this laboratory provides evidence to indicate that the expression of NOS-III and cyclooxygenase-2 are stimulated by lyso-PC (27Zembowicz A. Jones S.L. Wu K.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the synthesis of NO and prostacyclin, which act synergistically to block monocyte adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation; platelet activation and aggregation; and pathological vasoconstriction. This leads to a postulate that vascular injurious agents such as lyso-PC creates a yin-yan situation in which it induces the expression of vasoprotective genes to counteract the vascular damaging genes. It is interesting to note that lyso-PC induces the expressions of those diverse genes with two distinct types of kinetics: 1) rapid, transient as in heparin-binding epidermal growth factor and cyclooxygenase-2 gene induction and 2) delayed, sustained as in eNOS and intercellular adhesive molecule-1 gene induction.

https://openalex.org/W2152268503,"The membrane-spanning protein, band 3, anchors the spectrin-based membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer via the bridging protein, ankyrin. To understand how band 3 subunit stoichiometry influences this membrane-skeletal junction, we have induced changes in the band 3 association equilibrium and assayed the kinetics and equilibrium properties of ankyrin binding. We observe that band 3 oligomers convert slowly to dimers and ultimately monomers following removal of ankyrin. Addition of excess ankyrin back to these membranes enriched in dissociated band 3 then shifts band 3 almost entirely to tetramers, confirming that the tetrameric form of band 3 constitutes the preferred oligomeric state of ankyrin binding. 4,4′-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) labeling of band 3, which is shown to shift most of the band 3 population to dimers, eliminates the majority of ankyrin-binding sites on the membrane and greatly reduces retention of band 3 in detergent-extracted membrane skeletons. Furthermore, DIDS<sup>−</sup> modified membranes lack all low affinity ankyrin-binding sites and roughly half of all high affinity sites. Since labeled membranes lack the rapid kinetic phase of ankyrin binding and exhibit only half of the normal amplitude of the slow kinetic phase, it can be concluded that the rapid phase of ankyrin association involves low affinity sites and the slow phase involves high affinity sites. A model accounting for these data and most previous data on ankyrin-band 3 interactions is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2080183319,"The icefishes of the Southern Ocean (family Channichthyidae, suborder Notothenioidei) are unique among vertebrates in their inability to synthesize hemoglobin. We have shown previously (Cocca, E., Ratnayake-Lecamwasam, M., Parker, S. K., Camardella, L., Ciaramella, M., di Prisco, G., and Detrich, H. W., III (1995)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 1817–1821) that icefishes retain inactive genomic remnants of adult notothenioid α-globin genes but have lost the gene that encodes adult β-globin. Here we demonstrate that loss of expression of the major adult α-globin, α1, in two species of icefish (Chaenocephalus aceratus and Chionodraco rastrospinosus ) results from truncation of the 5′ end of the notothenioid α1-globin gene. The wild-type, functional α1-globin gene of the Antarctic yellowbelly rockcod, Notothenia coriiceps , contains three exons and two A + T-rich introns, and its expression may be controlled by two or three distinct promoters. Retained in both icefish genomes are a portion of intron 2, exon 3, and the 3′-untranslated region of the notothenioid α1-globin gene. The residual, nonfunctional α-globin gene, no longer under positive selection pressure for expression, has apparently undergone random mutational drift at an estimated rate of 0.12–0.33%/million years. We propose that abrogation of hemoglobin synthesis in icefishes most likely resulted from a single mutational event in the ancestral channichthyid that deleted the entire β-globin gene and the 5′ end of the linked α1-globin gene. The icefishes of the Southern Ocean (family Channichthyidae, suborder Notothenioidei) are unique among vertebrates in their inability to synthesize hemoglobin. We have shown previously (Cocca, E., Ratnayake-Lecamwasam, M., Parker, S. K., Camardella, L., Ciaramella, M., di Prisco, G., and Detrich, H. W., III (1995)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We propose that abrogation of hemoglobin synthesis in icefishes most likely resulted from a single mutational event in the ancestral channichthyid that deleted the entire β-globin gene and the 5′ end of the linked α1-globin gene. Alone among vertebrate taxa, the 15 species of Antarctic icefishes (family Channichthyidae, suborder Notothenioidei) are unique in their failure to synthesize the respiratory oxygen transport protein hemoglobin (1Ruud J.T. Nature. 1954; 173: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although icefish blood contains “erythrocyte-like” cells in small numbers (2Hureau J.C. Petit D. Fine J.M. Marneux M. Llano G.A. Adaptations Within Antarctic Ecosystems. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.1977: 459-477Google Scholar, 3Barber D.L. Mills Westermann J.E. White M.G. J. Fish Biol. 1981; 19: 11-28Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), these cells are devoid of hemoglobin, and icefishes transport oxygen to their tissues solely in physical solution. In the cold (−1.86 to +1 °C), stable, and oxygen-rich environment experienced by these organisms, reduction of the hematocrit to near zero may have been selectively advantageous because it significantly diminishes the energetic cost associated with circulation of a highly viscous, corpuscular blood fluid (4Eastman J.T.

Indeed, hematocrit, mean cellular hemoglobin concentration, and hemoglobin chain multiplicity all decrease with increasing phylogenetic divergence among the red-blooded Antarctic notothenioid fishes (8di Prisco G. di Prisco G. Pisano E. Clarke A. Fishes of Antarctica. A Biological Overview. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar), and the Bathydraconidae (the sister group to the channichthyids) approach the hematological extreme displayed by the white-blooded icefishes. Furthermore, di Prisco et al. (9di Prisco G. Macdonald J.A. Brunori M. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown that a red-blooded nototheniid fish, Pagothenia bernacchii , survives under resting conditions when its hemoglobin is converted to the carbon monoxide form in vivo . Apparently, red-blooded Antarctic fishes can sustain their basal metabolism using plasma-dissolved oxygen, and they draw on their hemoglobin stores primarily when respiratory demand increases. Nevertheless, the development in icefishes of compensatory physiological and circulatory adaptations that reduce tissue oxygen demand and enhance oxygen delivery (e.g. modest suppression of metabolic rates, enhanced gas exchange by large, well-perfused gills and through a scaleless skin, and large increases in cardiac output and blood volume) argues that loss of hemoglobin and erythrocytes was maladaptive under conditions of physiological stress. Thus, the most plausible evolutionary scenario is that the phylogenetic trend to reduced hematocrits and decreased hemoglobin synthesis in notothenioid fishes developed concurrently with enhancements to their respiratory and circulatory systems, leading ultimately to the acorpuscular, hemoglobinless condition of the icefishes.The channichthyids diverged from other Antarctic notothenioids approximately 7–15 million years ago, but radiation of species within the icefish clade (i.e. lineage branch) appears to have been confined to the last one million years (10Bargelloni L. Ritchie P.A. Patarnello T. Battaglia B. Lambert D.M. Meyer A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 854-863PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that icefish species belonging to both primitive and advanced genera retain in their genomes inactive remnants of the major adult notothenioid α-globin gene but have lost the gene that encodes adult β-globin (11Cocca E. Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Parker S.K. Camardella L. Ciaramella M. di Prisco G. Detrich III, H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1817-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the hemoglobinless phenotype appears to be a primitive channichthyid character that was established by deletion or rapid mutation of the gene encoding β-globin before diversification of the clade. Our present objective is to determine the evolutionary fate of the channichthyid α1-globin gene. In this report we describe the structures of the functional α1-globin gene of the red-blooded Antarctic rockcod Notothenia coriiceps (family Nototheniidae) and of the α-globin gene remnants of two icefishes,Chaenocephalus aceratus and Chionodraco rastrospinosus . To our surprise, we find that the icefish α-globin gene is a truncated version of the α1-globin gene of red-blooded notothenioids. These remnants, which contain the 3′ portion of intron 2, all of exon 3, and the 3′-untranslated region of the α1-globin gene, appear to be mutating randomly. Using transversion substitutions, we estimate that these nonfunctional nuclear gene fragments are diverging at the rate of 0.12–0.33%/million years. Because the notothenioid adult globin genes are tightly linked in 5′ to 5′ orientation, 1A. Saeed, D. Lau, and H. W. Detrich III, manuscript in preparation. Linkage of α- and β-globin genes on the same chromosome is common in fishes and amphibians. In higher vertebrates (e.g. birds and mammals), the α- and β-globins are encoded by distinct gene clusters on separate chromosomes (see “Discussion”). 1A. Saeed, D. Lau, and H. W. Detrich III, manuscript in preparation. Linkage of α- and β-globin genes on the same chromosome is common in fishes and amphibians. In higher vertebrates (e.g. birds and mammals), the α- and β-globins are encoded by distinct gene clusters on separate chromosomes (see “Discussion”). we now propose that the hemoglobinless phenotype was established by a single deletional event in the ancestral channichthyid that eliminated the entire β-globin gene and the 5′ half of the α1-globin gene.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have demonstrated that the α-globin genes of two icefishes are partial 5′-truncated variants of the α1-globin gene of red-blooded notothenioid fishes. Furthermore, the residual icefish gene fragments have accumulated deletions, insertions, and nucleotide substitutions with respect to the functional globin gene. The striking similarity of the icefish remnants to each other, both in the apparent chromosomal breakpoint and in other mutations, strongly suggests that most of the changes evolved in the ancestral channichthyid approximately 7–15 million years ago. The relatively minor differences between the gene remnants of C. aceratus and C. rastrospinosus probably evolved by mutational drift during the radiation of the icefishes over the past one million years. The apparent random mutation of the icefish α1 remnant should provide a useful tool for development of a molecular phylogeny of icefishes based on nuclear gene divergence.Structure of a Functional Notothenioid α-Globin GeneThe structure of the functional α1-globin gene of N. coriiceps is remarkably similar to the α-globin genes of other vertebrates. Intron positions have been maintained, and splice junctions conform to the GT/AG rule (28Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3287) Google Scholar, 29Keller E.B. Noon W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the basic splicing mechanism is likely to have been conserved in the cold-adapted Antarctic fishes. The possibility that compensatory adaptations are required to permit efficient splicing in their cold thermal regime remains open.Surprisingly, three potential transcription start sites were detected for the α1-globin gene. The two cap sites most proximal to the α1-coding sequence (CAP 1, CAP 2) are associated both with basal TATA and CCAAT boxes and with hematopoietic CACCC and GATA promoter elements. A single NF-E2 site precedes CAP 1. The third, most distal site (CAP 3) contains a putative TATA box but lacks the CACCC element. Like many other globin genes (24Liebhaber S.A. Gootsens M.J. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7054-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Myers R.M. Tilly K. Maniatis T. Science. 1986; 232: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the sequences of the TATA boxes of the N. coriiceps promoters deviate from the vertebrate canon, TATAAA (33Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The use of alternative promoters and multiple transcription initiation sites to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes is now recognized to be a common phenomenon (37Ayoubi T.A.Y. van de Ven W.J.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For example, Hu et al. (38Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that tissue-specific expression of prolactin receptors in the rat is controlled by three promoters, two of which contain noncanonical TATA elements. We propose that the 5′-upstream sequence of the N. coriiceps α1-globin gene has evolved multiple promoters to offset slow rates of pol II transcription at psychrophilic temperatures by simultaneous recruitment of multiple transcriptional complexes. Indeed, the adult α1/β-globin intergenic region of N. coriiceps stimulates strongly, in either orientation, the transcription of a luciferase reporter construct in differentiated MEL cells.1Other departures of the notothenioid α-globin gene from the norm in higher vertebrates entail the length and nucleotide composition of the two introns. Both are longer and very rich in A + T residues. The 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequences of the gene are similarly A + T-rich. TableI presents a comparison of the nucleotide compositions of these subregions in α-globin genes from cold-living, temperate, and warm-bodied vertebrates. It is immediately evident that the noncoding regions of the cold-bodied and temperate vertebrates are significantly richer in A + T residues than are the corresponding regions in warm-bodied organisms. By contrast, the coding sequences, which are presumably constrained by functional requirements of the encoded globin polypeptides, are relatively A + T-poor and quite similar in composition in all taxa. The introns of several other notothenioid genes (myoglobin (39Small D.J. Vayda M.E. Sidell B.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the dynein heavy chain (40King S.M. Marchese-Ragona S.P. Parker S.K. Detrich III, H.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and three α-tubulins 3S. K. Parker and H. W. Detrich III, unpublished results. are also rich in A + T residues (61–71%). What functional significance can we attribute to the biased nucleotide compositions of genes from cold- and warm-bodied vertebrates?Bernardi et al. (41Bernardi G. Olofsson B. Filipski J. Zerial M. Salinas J. Cuny G. Meunier-Rotival M. Rodier F. Science. 1985; 228: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 42Bernardi G. Bernardi Gi J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 43Bernardi G. Mouchiroud D. Gautier C. Bernardi Gi J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 28: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the genomes of warm-bodied homeotherms (mammals, birds, etc.) are organized heterogeneously, with G + C- and gene-rich “isochores” interspersed with regions of lower G + C content. Among poikilotherms, warm-bodied (37–40 °C) Tilapia species also contain G + C-rich isochores, whereas their temperate congeners lack them (42Bernardi G. Bernardi Gi J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). High GC isochores may have evolved to maintain genome stability, to protect genes against DNA “breathing” and mutability (41Bernardi G. Olofsson B. Filipski J. Zerial M. Salinas J. Cuny G. Meunier-Rotival M. Rodier F. Science. 1985; 228: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), and to enhance mRNA and protein stability (42Bernardi G. Bernardi Gi J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) at relatively high body temperatures. Conversely, the A + T-rich genomes of cold-living and temperate poikilotherms may facilitate DNA strand separation during transcription and replication in low temperature regimes (39Small D.J. Vayda M.E. Sidell B.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). At the extreme temperatures experienced by Antarctic fishes, the latter advantage may be particularly important.Globin Gene Organization and Expression in FishesIn contrast to the distinct α- and β-globin gene clusters of higher vertebrates, the adult α- and β-globin genes of N. coriiceps , its temperate relative, N. angustata (the New Zealand black cod), and presumably other red-blooded notothenioids are tightly linked in 5′ to 5′ orientation.1 Head-to-head linkage of α/β gene pairs has also been observed in the Atlantic salmon (44McMorrow T. Wagner A. Deryckere F. Gannon F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), carp (45Miyata M. Aoki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the zebrafish (27Chan F.-Y. Robinson J. Brownlie A. Shivdasani R.A. Donovan A. Brugnara C. Kim J. Lau B.-C. Witkowska E. Zon L.I. Blood. 1997; 89: 688-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this gene organization probably represents the ancestral condition of gnathostome fishes and is likely to have arisen by duplication, inversion, and divergence of the primordial globin gene of primitive jawless fishes (e.g. the lamprey) to give an α/β gene pair (27Chan F.-Y. Robinson J. Brownlie A. Shivdasani R.A. Donovan A. Brugnara C. Kim J. Lau B.-C. Witkowska E. Zon L.I. Blood. 1997; 89: 688-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One plausible advantage of head-to-head linkage is coordinate regulation of globin gene transcription mediated by shared promoter and/or enhancer elements located in the intergenic sequences (27Chan F.-Y. Robinson J. Brownlie A. Shivdasani R.A. Donovan A. Brugnara C. Kim J. Lau B.-C. Witkowska E. Zon L.I. Blood. 1997; 89: 688-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In higher vertebrates, expression of the distinct α- and β-globin gene complexes is regulated during development by locus control regions that govern the sequential, stage-specific expression of embryonic, fetal, and adult globin genes (32Orkin S.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 665-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although locus control regions have not yet been described for fish globin genes, the developmental switching of globin genes in the phylogenetically ancient lamprey suggests that such elements exist throughout the piscine taxon (46Lanfranchi G. Pallavicini A. Laveder P. Valle G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, paired embryonic globin genes are linked to the adult α/β pairs (27Chan F.-Y. Robinson J. Brownlie A. Shivdasani R.A. Donovan A. Brugnara C. Kim J. Lau B.-C. Witkowska E. Zon L.I. Blood. 1997; 89: 688-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we isolated an N. coriiceps genomic clone that contains two non-adult α/β-globin gene pairs, 4E. Cocca, L. Camardella, H. W. Detrich III, and G. di Prisco, unpublished results. with each α/β pair linked 5′ to 5′. (We do not, as yet, know whether this presumptive embryonic/juvenile globin complex is contiguous to the adult α1/β gene pair.) The common organization of embryonic, juvenile, and adult globin genes in several teleost fishes suggests that a single, primordial locus control region may have evolved to regulate developmental switching of pairs of globin genes before the development of distinct α- and β-globin gene complexes, each with its own locus control region, in higher vertebrates.Mechanism of Globin Gene Loss in Antarctic IcefishesWith the demonstration that icefishes have undergone deletion of the adult β-globin gene (11Cocca E. Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Parker S.K. Camardella L. Ciaramella M. di Prisco G. Detrich III, H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1817-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and 5′ truncation of the major adult α-globin gene (this work), we can now propose a simple mechanism for globin gene loss. Fig. 5 shows that a single deletional event (scenario X) in the ancestral channichthyid, with chromosomal breakpoints located within intron 2 of the α1-globin gene and downstream of the 3′-untranslated region of the β-globin gene, would abrogate expression of adult globin polypeptides. This mechanism is supported strongly by the observation that the residual globin loci of C. aceratus and C. rastrospinosus share common 5′ breakpoints with respect to the N. coriiceps α1-globin gene. Multiple deletions (Y1, Y2) occurring before diversification of the icefish clade that together yield the disrupted icefish globin locus are a formal but less likely possibility. The evolutionary fate of embryonic and juvenile globin genes in icefish genomes is unknown, but the linkage of embryonic and adult globin genes in the zebrafish (27Chan F.-Y. Robinson J. Brownlie A. Shivdasani R.A. Donovan A. Brugnara C. Kim J. Lau B.-C. Witkowska E. Zon L.I. Blood. 1997; 89: 688-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the single deletional event postulated here (Fig. 5, scenario Z), or perhaps multiple events, may have removed almost the entire notothenioid globin gene complex.Divergence of the Icefish α-Globin Gene Remnants and the Mutational ClockMartin and Palumbi (36Martin A.P. Palumbi S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4087-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), summarizing nucleotide divergence rates among diverse taxonomic groups, have suggested that specific metabolic rate is the major parameter controlling the mutational clock. The rate of mutational change appears to be mediated by reactive oxygen species, generated metabolically, that can damage DNA either directly or indirectly. The data presented here indicate that rates of nuclear gene divergence in notothenioid fishes (0.12–0.33%/million years) in the absence of selective pressure are among the smallest observed in poikilotherms, in agreement with the their low specific metabolic rates (4Eastman J.T. Antarctic Fish Biology: Evolution in a Unique Environment. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). Thus, the “nucleotide generation time” (average interval for a nucleotide to be copied through replication or repair) of the nuclear genes of Antarctic teleosts is likely to be long (36Martin A.P. Palumbi S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4087-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The low mutational rates that we have estimated for the α-globin gene remnants of C. aceratus and C. rastrospinosus should be verified by analysis of these fragments in other icefish species and by examination of additional gene families in other notothenioid fishes. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the chronology of evolution of antifreeze glycoprotein genes from the notothenioid trypsinogen gene, estimated at 5–14 million years ago (47Chen L. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.-H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3811-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) based on mitochondrial divergence rates (0.5–0.9%/million years) of the salmon (36Martin A.P. Palumbi S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4087-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), may require reappraisal. Alone among vertebrate taxa, the 15 species of Antarctic icefishes (family Channichthyidae, suborder Notothenioidei) are unique in their failure to synthesize the respiratory oxygen transport protein hemoglobin (1Ruud J.T. Nature. 1954; 173: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although icefish blood contains “erythrocyte-like” cells in small numbers (2Hureau J.C. Petit D. Fine J.M. Marneux M.

Fish Biol. 1981; 19: 11-28Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), these cells are devoid of hemoglobin, and icefishes transport oxygen to their tissues solely in physical solution. In the cold (−1.86 to +1 °C), stable, and oxygen-rich environment experienced by these organisms, reduction of the hematocrit to near zero may have been selectively advantageous because it significantly diminishes the energetic cost associated with circulation of a highly viscous, corpuscular blood fluid (4Eastman J.T.

Indeed, hematocrit, mean cellular hemoglobin concentration, and hemoglobin chain multiplicity all decrease with increasing phylogenetic divergence among the red-blooded Antarctic notothenioid fishes (8di Prisco G. di Prisco G. Pisano E. Clarke A. Fishes of Antarctica. A Biological Overview. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar), and the Bathydraconidae (the sister group to the channichthyids) approach the hematological extreme displayed by the white-blooded icefishes. Furthermore, di Prisco et al. (9di Prisco G. Macdonald J.A. Brunori M. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown that a red-blooded nototheniid fish, Pagothenia bernacchii , survives under resting conditions when its hemoglobin is converted to the carbon monoxide form in vivo .

Nevertheless, the development in icefishes of compensatory physiological and circulatory adaptations that reduce tissue oxygen demand and enhance oxygen delivery (e.g. modest suppression of metabolic rates, enhanced gas exchange by large, well-perfused gills and through a scaleless skin, and large increases in cardiac output and blood volume) argues that loss of hemoglobin and erythrocytes was maladaptive under conditions of physiological stress. Thus, the most plausible evolutionary scenario is that the phylogenetic trend to reduced hematocrits and decreased hemoglobin synthesis in notothenioid fishes developed concurrently with enhancements to their respiratory and circulatory systems, leading ultimately to the acorpuscular, hemoglobinless condition of the icefishes. The channichthyids diverged from other Antarctic notothenioids approximately 7–15 million years ago, but radiation of species within the icefish clade (i.e. lineage branch) appears to have been confined to the last one million years (10Bargelloni L. Ritchie P.A. Patarnello T. Battaglia B. Lambert D.M. Meyer A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 854-863PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that icefish species belonging to both primitive and advanced genera retain in their genomes inactive remnants of the major adult notothenioid α-globin gene but have lost the gene that encodes adult β-globin (11Cocca E.

We overexpressed dGK as a fusion protein to the green fluorescent protein in the human pancreatic cancer cell lines PanC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 to determine the importance of dGK-mediated nucleoside analog phosphorylation. The transfected cells showed mitochondrial fluorescence patterns, and the mitochondrial locations of endogenous and overexpressed dGK were verified by Western blot analysis of cell extracts with polyclonal anti-dGK antibodies. The increase of dGK activity in the overexpressing cells was ∼4-fold. These cell lines exhibited increased sensitivity to CdA, araG, and dFdG as compared with the untransfected parent cell lines. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a correlation between the activity of a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinase and the cytotoxicity of nucleoside analogs.

This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a correlation between the activity of a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinase and the cytotoxicity of nucleoside analogs. Our data imply that the dGK activity is rate-limiting for the efficacy of nucleoside analogs in the cell lines investigated. Nucleoside analogs are commonly used in antileukemic chemotherapy (1Plunkett W. Gandhi V. Hematol. Cell. Ther. 1996; 38: S67-S74PubMed Google Scholar). Certain compounds are also active against solid tumors, although the efficiency against nonhematological malignancies is poor (2Hui Y.F. Reitz J. Am. J. Health-Syst. Pharm. 1997; 54: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The nucleoside analogs inhibit DNA synthesis after intracellular phosphorylation to their 5′-triphosphate form. The rate-limiting step in the pharmacological activation of the nucleoside analogs is the phosphorylation by a deoxyribonucleoside kinase. Differences in the expression levels and activities of the activating deoxyribonucleoside kinases in leukemic cells versus cells in solid tumors have been proposed as determinants of the differences in drug sensitivity. There are four human deoxyribonucleoside kinases that phosphorylate nucleoside analogs to their corresponding monophosphates: the S phase-specific thymidine kinase 1 and the cell cycle constitutively expressed deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), 1The abbreviations used are: dCK, deoxycytidine kinase; dGK, deoxyguanosine kinase; araC, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; araG, 9-β -d-arabinofuranosylguanine; CdA, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine; dFdG, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: dCK, deoxycytidine kinase; dGK, deoxyguanosine kinase; araC, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; araG, 9-β -d-arabinofuranosylguanine; CdA, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine; dFdG, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine; GFP, green fluorescent protein. deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), and thymidine kinase 2 (3Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar).Deficiency of dCK causes resistance to nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by this enzyme (4Owens J.K. Shewach D.S. Ullman B. Mitchell B.S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2389-2393PubMed Google Scholar, 5Carson D.A. Wasson D.B. Kaye J. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. Robins R.K. Montgomery J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recent work also demonstrates that sensitivity to nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by dCK increases by overexpression of dCK in tumor cell lines (6Hapke D.M. Stegmann A.P.A. Mitchell B.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar, 7Manome Y. Wen P.Y. Dong Y. Tanaka T. Mitchell B.S. Kufe D.W. Fine H.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The presence of dCK is thus shown to be both a prerequisite for activity of nucleoside analogs, and its expression level is quantitatively correlated to the cytotoxicity of certain drugs. dCK is closely sequence-related to dGK, and the two enzymes have overlapping substrate specificity. Both enzymes phosphorylate the purine nucleosides 2′-deoxyadenosine and 2′-deoxyguanosine as well as the purine nucleoside analogs 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine (CdA) and 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-guanine (araG) (8Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7258-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CdA is clinically used for treatment of indolent lymphoproliferative disorders (1Plunkett W. Gandhi V. Hematol. Cell. Ther. 1996; 38: S67-S74PubMed Google Scholar). araG is presently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of acute T-cell leukemia (10Kurtzberg J. Wiley J. Reese M. Elion G. Mitchell B.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 511aGoogle Scholar). dCK is regarded as the major nucleoside kinase for the activation of CdA and araG due to its high expression in lymphocytes. However, studies with purified enzymes suggest that dGK may contribute to the activation of CdA and araG (9Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difluoro-substituted deoxyguanosine analog 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine (dFdG) is another cytotoxic purine analog with anti-leukemic activity (11Gandhi V. Mineishi S. Huang P. Chapman A.J. Yang Y. Chen F. Nowak B. Chubb S. Hertel L.W. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1517-1524PubMed Google Scholar). This analog is not a substrate for dCK, and dFdG is believed to be activated only by dGK. Although the cytotoxic nucleoside analogs discussed above are demonstrated to be substrates for dGK, the contribution of this enzyme for pharmacological effects of nucleoside analogs is not clear. A difference between dCK and dGK is their subcellular location. dCK was until recently regarded as a cytosolic enzyme, but it is shown to be imported into the cell nucleus, whereas dGK is located in the mitochondria (12Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The initial phosphorylation of purine nucleoside analogs is thus performed within the mitochondria when a compound is activated by dGK or in the cell nucleus when activated by dCK. The aim of the present study was to investigate if overexpression of mitochondrial dGK would enhance the cytotoxicity of nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by the enzyme. Pancreatic cancer cell lines were chosen as a model of solid tumors with low sensitivity toward the purine nucleoside analogs. In conclusion, we have shown that overexpression of mitochondrial dGK in these cells increases the sensitivity to the purine nucleoside analogs araG, dFdG and CdA.DISCUSSIONWe have investigated the role of mitochondrial dGK for the cytotoxicity of purine nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by this enzyme. In summary, we have shown that the cytotoxicity of araG, dFdG, and CdA is enhanced by overexpression of dGK in the two investigated pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Our data strongly suggest that the level of dGK activity in cells is a rate-limiting factor for the activation of these therapeutic nucleoside analogs. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractionated protein extracts showed that both the endogenous cellular dGK and the artificial fusion protein of dGK-GFP were exclusively located in the mitochondrial fraction and we were not able to detect any dGK protein in the cytosolic fraction. Our conclusion is that dGK is exclusively located in the mitochondria. This report is thereby, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs by a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinase contributes to the cytotoxicity of these compounds.We believe that there are two separate deoxyribonucleotide pool compartments in a cell: the cytosolic-nuclear and the mitochondrial. The physical basis for the exchange of deoxyribonucleotides between the nucleus and the cytosol is that the nuclear pore complexes allow passive transport of small molecules across the nuclear membrane (17Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to hydrophilic compounds such as deoxyribonucleotides, and transport of deoxyribonucleotides across the membrane would require a carrier protein. Indirect evidence that phosphorylated nucleoside analogs can be imported into the mitochondria comes from experiments showing that nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the nuclear-cytosolic compartment inhibit mitochondrial DNA replication (18Chen C-H. Cheng Y-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2856-2859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Berk and Clayton (19Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that deoxythymidine is incorporated into mitochondrial, but not nuclear, DNA in thymidine kinase 1-deficient cells. Their data suggest that deoxythymidine phosphorylated by mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 is not exported from the mitochondria to the cytosol. In agreement with the model that deoxyribonucleotides are not exported from the mitochondria, it has been shown that depletion of the cytosolic-nuclear deoxyribonucleotide pool is not accompanied by a similar decrease in mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide levels (20Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that deoxyribonucleosides phosphorylated by dGK remain in the mitochondria.The pharmacological targets of cytotoxic anti-cancer nucleoside analogs are believed to be nuclear DNA replication and repair. However, several pyrimidine nucleoside analogs cause cytotoxic effects by interference with mitochondrial DNA replication (21Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial toxicity described for these compounds is delayed and occurs after several weeks of drug exposure due to decreased transcription of genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondrial DNA damage has not been described for purine nucleoside analogs, and there is no evidence that nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by dGK affect mitochondrial function or damage mitochondrial DNA. We therefore do not know if purine nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by dGK are able to interfere with mitochondrial DNA replication in a similar way as described for the pyrimidine compounds. The purine nucleoside analogs used in this study are cytotoxic to the dGK-overexpressing cells after 4 days of drug exposure. These data rather suggest that the nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the mitochondrial matrix are transported to the nucleus and interfere with nuclear DNA replication. This model would explain the early toxicity seen in the rapidly growing pancreatic cancer cell lines that are highly dependent on rapid nuclear DNA replication. However, there is still no evidence that deoxyribonucleotides or phosphorylated nucleoside analogs are exported from the mitochondria to the cytosol and nucleus as discussed above.The overlapping substrate specificity between dCK and dGK in regard to purine nucleoside analog phosphorylation makes it difficult to speculate about the contribution of dGK activation of nucleoside analogs in different tissues. There is strong evidence from cell culture experiments that dCK deficiency is associated with acquired resistance to deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, and CdA (5Carson D.A. Wasson D.B. Kaye J. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. Robins R.K. Montgomery J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if these cells retain dGK activity, and it is possible that the cells have lost both dCK and dGK activity. Indirect evidence for such an event is that a mouse model of purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency that accumulates high levels of deoxyguanosine shows signs of deficient dGK activity (22Snyder F.F. Jenuth J.P. Dilay J.E. Fung E. Lightfoot T. Mably E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The production of specific anti-dGK antibodies reported in this paper should facilitate future studies on the correlation of dCK and dGK expression and activity in purine nucleoside analog-resistant cells.We used pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines to determine the cytotoxicity of the nucleoside analogs with and without overexpression of dGK. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma responds poorly to available chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and better modalities to treat this malignant tumor are needed. In the future, gene therapy against pancreatic cancer may be possible if the current problems with efficient and tissue-directed gene transfer are solved. Expression of a suicide gene, such as dGK, in combination with nucleoside analog chemotherapy may be an option. There is so far no evidence that the human deoxyribonucleoside kinases, dGK or dCK, would be superior suicide genes as compared with the more carefully studied herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase. However, combinations of different nucleoside kinases and nucleoside analogs should be compared to find an optimal combination and thereby provide the best conditions to design future nucleoside kinase gene therapy trials. Nucleoside analogs are commonly used in antileukemic chemotherapy (1Plunkett W. Gandhi V. Hematol. Cell. Ther. 1996; 38: S67-S74PubMed Google Scholar). Certain compounds are also active against solid tumors, although the efficiency against nonhematological malignancies is poor (2Hui Y.F. Reitz J. Am. J. Health-Syst.

The difluoro-substituted deoxyguanosine analog 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyguanosine (dFdG) is another cytotoxic purine analog with anti-leukemic activity (11Gandhi V. Mineishi S. Huang P. Chapman A.J.

However, it is not known if these cells retain dGK activity, and it is possible that the cells have lost both dCK and dGK activity. Indirect evidence for such an event is that a mouse model of purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency that accumulates high levels of deoxyguanosine shows signs of deficient dGK activity (22Snyder F.F. Jenuth J.P. Dilay J.E. Fung E. Lightfoot T. Mably E.R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The production of specific anti-dGK antibodies reported in this paper should facilitate future studies on the correlation of dCK and dGK expression and activity in purine nucleoside analog-resistant cells. We used pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines to determine the cytotoxicity of the nucleoside analogs with and without overexpression of dGK. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma responds poorly to available chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and better modalities to treat this malignant tumor are needed. In the future, gene therapy against pancreatic cancer may be possible if the current problems with efficient and tissue-directed gene transfer are solved. Expression of a suicide gene, such as dGK, in combination with nucleoside analog chemotherapy may be an option. There is so far no evidence that the human deoxyribonucleoside kinases, dGK or dCK, would be superior suicide genes as compared with the more carefully studied herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase. However, combinations of different nucleoside kinases and nucleoside analogs should be compared to find an optimal combination and thereby provide the best conditions to design future nucleoside kinase gene therapy trials."

To elucidate the structure and function of C/EBPε in transcriptional activation, amino acid residues 1–115, 147–249, or 1–249 of C/EBPε were fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain. These expression vectors were cotransfected with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and, in all cell lines tested, only the GAL-C/EBPε-(1–115) fusion protein significantly activated expression from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. Sixteen deletion mutants of C/EBPε mapped the transactivation domain to amino acids 1–18 at the N terminus and revealed the presence of a transcription repression element between amino acid residues 116 and 162. Expression vectors containing the repression domain of C/EBPε strongly inhibited gene transcription from TK, SV40, and adenoviral major late promoters bearing GAL4 binding sites. Fusion of this repression domain to the VP16 activation domain inhibited the transactivation function of VP16. Deletion of this repression domain increased gene transcription from a neutrophil elastase promoter-luciferase reporter. Taken together, these data suggest that C/EBPε regulates transcription by utilizing both activation and repression functions.

Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N terminus is more diverse. Transcriptional activation domains from C/EBPα (31Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Nerlov C. Ziff E.B.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and C/EBPδ were localized to this region. However, C/EBPγ and C/EBPζ lack these N-terminal activation domains and can function as trans -dominant repressors of transcription (34Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Phillipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 35Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additional negatively acting regulatory domains were identified in C/EBPα (32Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Pei D. Shih C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and C/EBPβ (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These “attenuator” domains not only regulate transcription but define cell-specific transcriptional activity. The rat homologue of C/EBPε , CRP1, shares significant homology at its N terminus with other C/EBP family members (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The human C/EBPε gene was cloned recently (11Antonson P. Stellan B. Yamanaka R. Xanthopoulos K.G. Genomics. 1996; 35: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differential splicing and the use of alternative promoters generates a total of four proteins with calculated molecular masses of 32, 30, 27, and 14 kDa (12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yamanaka R. Kim G-D. Radomska H.S. Lekstrom-Himes J. Smith L.T. Antonson P. Tenen D.G. Xanthanopoulos K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This use of alternative splice sites has also been demonstrated for the C/EBPβ gene (5Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Unlike other C/EBP proteins, C/EBPε is primarily expressed in the myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages (11Antonson P. Stellan B. Yamanaka R. Xanthopoulos K.G. Genomics. 1996; 35: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell.

The human C/EBPε protein strongly and specifically binds to double-stranded DNA containing consensus C/EBP sites and significantly up-regulates transcription from both the myeloid-specific c-mim and human myeloperoxidase promoters. This suggests an important role for C/EBPε in the transcriptional regulation of a subset of myeloid-specific genes that contain these sites (12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand further the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of myeloid-specific genes by C/EBPε, we used molecular genetic methods to perform a systematic structure/function analysis of the C/EBPε protein. The ultimate goal of our experiments was to identify regions of C/EBPε that contribute to its ability to regulate myeloid gene expression. In this report, we demonstrate that the transcriptional activation function of C/EBPε is mediated through a bipartite activation domain localized in the N terminus. This domain functions as a transcriptional activator both in the context of the C/EBPε protein and when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. In addition, we identified an intrinsic repression domain in C/EBPε that, when deleted, allowed C/EBPε to enhance transactivation of gene transcription compared with the wild-type C/EBPε protein. Furthermore, this inhibitory signal conferred its repression function on a heterologous transcriptional activator. We propose a model in which C/EBPε regulates myeloid-specific gene expression through transcriptional activation and repression that is dependent on its associated factor(s). Cloning vector pGALM (a gift from Drs. Gregory Kato and Chi Dang) used for all recombinant plasmids in this study is similar to pSG424 (40Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 177539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and contains the DNA binding domain from GAL4 (amino acids 1–147) driven by the SV40 early promoter and followed by a polylinker containing restriction sites for subcloning. PCR was used to introduce restriction sites,Eco RI and Sal I, at the beginning and the end, respectively, of each C/EBPε fragment. The oligonucleotide primers for introduction of restriction sites consisted of a 5′ “clamp” sequence (6 base pairs), the restriction site, and 18 bases of homology to the target sequence at the 3′-end. PCR (25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C) usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was carried out under standard conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. The DNA fragments treated with restriction enzymes Eco RI andSal I were inserted into pGALM. All recombinant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Restriction sites,Eco RI/Hin dIII andHin dIII/Sal I, were introduced by PCR into the VP16 activation domain (AD; amino acids 420–456) (41Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and DNA fragments encoding C/EBPε amino acids 1–45, 1–115, 115–162, 162–199, and 115–199, respectively. After proper treatment with restriction enzymes, the VP16 AD and the C/EBPε fragments were inserted into the cloning vector pGALM by a three way ligation and confirmed by sequencing. All PCR-derived C/EBPε DNA fragments were digested with the Eco RI/Sal I enzymes before insertion into a CMV expression vector, pCMVSPORT (Life Technologies, Inc.). A translational initiation codon, ATG, present in the 5′-primer was introduced into all N-terminal deletions during PCR reactions. Expression plasmids containing internal deletions of C/EBPε were made in two ways. (i) For CMV-εΔ116–234, PCR-derived DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–70 and 235–249 of C/EBPε were digested with restriction enzymes Sal I and Eco RI and then ligated together after the two fragments were blunted by a fill-in reaction using Klenow. This produced an in frame fusion of the two C/EBPε fragments that removed residues 116–234. (ii) CMV-εΔ71–161, CMV-εΔ116–161, and CMV-εΔ116–184 were constructed by first synthesizing, by PCR, two targeted DNA fragments of C/EBPε encoding the corresponding amino acid residues 1–70, 1–115, 162–249, and 185–249, respectively. A Hin dIII restriction site, which was included in the primers used in the above PCR reactions, was introduced at the junction of all internal deletions. After proper treatment with restriction enzymes, a three way ligation was performed to insert these DNA fragments into the cloning vector pGALM. Several GAL4-responsive reporter constructs were used in this study: (i) G5E1bCAT, a gift from Drs. Gregory Kato and Chi Dang (42Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), which contains a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene regulated by the adenoviral E1b promoter bearing five GAL4 binding sites; (ii) G0TKCAT, G1TKCAT, G5TKCAT, G5SV40CAT, and G5MLPCAT, gifts from Dr. Arnold Berk (43Yew P.R. Xuan L. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), which contain zero, one, or five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the promoters for herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK), SV40, or adenoviral major late promoter. The neutrophil elastase promoter containing a consensus C/EBP binding site 1 base pair upstream of a Myb binding site (44Oelgeschlager M. Nuchprayoon I. Luscher B. Friedman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was fused to the luciferase gene (NE-Luc) for use as a reporter gene. COS-1, CV-1, and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected at 50–60% confluency in 60-mm dishes as described (12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For CAT assays, performed as described (45Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1995: 9.7.1-9.7.4Google Scholar), a total of 20 μg of DNA was introduced, consisting of 5 μg of reporter plasmid, 5 μg of GAL4-C/EBPε hybrid constructs, and pUC19 carrier DNA. The plasmid pCMV-Luc (0.5 μg) was included as a monitor of transfection efficiency. For luciferase assays, a total of 15 μg of DNA was used, consisting of 5 μg of NE-Luc reporter plasmid, 5 μg of CMV-C/EBPε constructs, and carrier DNA. The plasmid pCMVSPORT-β-gal (2 μg) was used as a control of transfection efficiency. Lysates were prepared 48–60 h after DNA was added to the cells. The HL60 (myeloblast/promyelocytic), U937 (myelomonocytic), and NB4 (promyelocytic) were maintained in RPMI with 20% fetal bovine serum. A total of 50 μg of DNA, including 10 μg each of the reporter and effector plasmids and 5 μg of pCMV-Luc and pUC19 carrier DNA, were introduced into the cells by electroporation as described (12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24–48 h after transfection. All effector plasmids were tested at least three times. Levels of transactivation or repression were all compared with that of the reporter plasmid in the absence of any effector plasmid. We previously demonstrated that C/EBPε can activate transcription from the myeloid-specific mim-1 and human myeloperoxidase promoters (12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To map the transcriptional activation domains as they function in mammalian cells, expression plasmids were constructed to give the following fusions of the GAL4 DNA binding domain with C/EBPε: GAL-C/EBPε; GAL-ε-(1–115); and GAL-ε-(147–249). Fig. 1 A shows a schematic representation of these constructs. Sequence analysis revealed that the basic region and the leucine zipper (bZIP) domains are located between amino acid residues 162 and 235 (11Antonson P. Stellan B. Yamanaka R. Xanthopoulos K.G. Genomics. 1996; 35: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used the adenoviral E1b promoter bearing five GAL4 binding sites that was linked to the CAT gene as the target promoter. Transient cotransfections of these GAL-C/EBPε expression plasmids with the GAL4–5E1bCAT reporter construct into COS-1 cells demonstrated that the GAL-ε-(1–115) fusion protein activated expression of the CAT reporter gene 12-fold when compared with the level of reporter expression alone (Fig. 1 A ). The GAL-ε-(1–115) chimeric protein also activated CAT expression to a similar level in three hematopoietic cell lines (HL-60, U937, NB4) (data not shown). In contrast, neither GAL-ε-(147–249) nor GAL-C/EBPε significantly activated CAT expression in any of these cell lines (Fig. 1,A and B ). Western blotting demonstrated that the three protein fusions were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that amino acids 1–115 of the C/EBPε protein are sufficient to confer the C/EBPε transcriptional activation function, which is independent of the bZIP domain, and suggest that a repressive effect is mediated by amino acids 116–249. To define regulatory domains within the C/EBPε gene, we constructed two sets of nested deletions that removed various amino acid residues from either the N or C terminus of C/EBPε (Fig.2 A ). These deletion mutants were fused to the GAL4 DBD and tested for their abilities to transactivate the CAT reporter gene in COS-1 cells. The N-terminal deletions consisted of eight truncations beginning from the first 18 amino acids and extending varying distances toward the C terminus. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B , all eight hybrid proteins were completely inactive in transactivation of the CAT reporter gene. The expression of all the fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). The C-terminal deletion mutants also comprised a total of eight truncations starting with deletion of the C-terminal bZIP domain (Fig.2 A ). Deletion mutants lacking amino acid residues 200–249, 180–249, and 163–249 were unable to activate transcription (GAL-ε-(1–199), GAL-ε-(1–179), and GAL-ε-(1–162), respectively) (Fig. 2 A ). Removal of amino acids 116–249 (GAL-ε-(1–115)) generated, as before, a 12.8-fold increase in transactivation in our CAT reporter assays. Further deletion of 45 amino acids, resulting in a GAL-ε-(1–70) fusion, produced a 17.2-fold increase in the level of CAT activity (Fig. 2 A ). Fusions GAL-ε-(1–45) and GAL-ε-(1–18) both activated CAT expression. GAL-ε-(1–18) activated the CAT reporter gene to 80% of the level observed with GAL-ε-(1–70) (13.7- versus 17.2-fold) (Fig. 2, A and B ). Amino acid sequence comparisons have revealed the presence of two homologous domains at the N termini of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ that are also present in C/EBPε (amino acids 1–18 and 19–27) (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). CRP1, the rat homologue of C/EBPε, has been shown to contain a second activation domain (amino acids 19–27), which corresponds to a motif shared by Fos and Jun called homology box 2 or HOB2 and AMD3 of C/EBPβ (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 46Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, a construct containing this domain alone, GAL-ε-(19–45) showed little activity in our CAT reporter assays (Fig. 2 A ). Likewise, another fusion containing this second domain, GAL-ε-(19–70), as well as the constructs GAL-ε-(39–70) and GAL-ε-(39–115), did not activate CAT expression beyond basal levels (data not shown). Similar results were obtained from transient transfections in U937 cells. Therefore, the essential element involved in C/EBPε transcriptional activation is localized within amino acids 1–18, and maximal transactivation function is conferred by amino acids 1–70. C/EBPε has also been identified with an ATG site 32 amino acids upstream from our designated start site (11Antonson P. Stellan B. Yamanaka R. Xanthopoulos K.G. Genomics. 1996; 35: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated that both isoforms of C/EBPε are present in cells transfected with a construct containing both ATG sites, suggesting that both proteins may have a role within the cell. 2A. M. Chumakov, unpublished observations. Since these 32 N-terminal amino acids contain sequences related to the ADM1 region of C/EBPβ (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), fusions were constructed to include these 32 amino acids either alone (GAL-ε32N) or with amino acids 1–18 (GAL-ε32N18), 1–45 (GAL-ε32N45), or 1–70 (GAL-ε32N70). In our CAT reporter assays from transiently transfected COS-1 cells, GAL-ε32N did not activate CAT expression beyond basal levels, and the presence of the upstream 32 amino acids did not increase the activation of CAT gene expression further compared with those sequences (amino acids 1–18, 1–45, and 1–70) previously identified as having transactivation function in C/EBPε (Fig. 2 C ). Western blotting confirmed that all fusions were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). These results indicate that the additional 32 amino acid residues do not significantly alter the transcriptional activity of C/EBPε. Our results suggest that the inability of GAL-C/EBPε to activate the CAT reporter gene may result from an intrinsic inhibitory domain in the protein. We observed little transactivation from GAL-ε-(1–199), GAL-ε-(1–179), and GAL-ε-(1–162) fusion proteins from which the leucine zipper and basic regions were deleted sequentially (Fig.2 A ). Further deletion of amino acids 116–162 (GAL-ε-(1–115)), however, produced at least a 10-fold increase in CAT activity, thus suggesting the presence of a transcriptional inhibitory element within this segment (residues 116–162) of C/EBPε (Fig. 2 A ). To test this hypothesis, we first cotransfected our GAL-C/EBPε fusion constructs with reporter plasmids that express intermediate levels of CAT activity to permit detection of either up- or down-regulation of transcription. The reporter constructs used in this study contained zero (G0TKCAT), one (G1TKCAT), or five (G5TKCAT) GAL4 binding sites upstream of the herpes simplex virus TK promoter (−105 to +51) controlling CAT expression. Cotransfection of the GAL-C/EBPε constructs with the reporter plasmid G5TKCAT into COS-1 cells showed that GAL-C/EBPε, GAL-ε-(147–249), GAL-ε-(40–249), and GAL-ε-(111–249) repressed CAT gene expression up to 90% (Fig.3). Also, constructs GAL-ε-(1–199), GAL-ε-(1–179), and GAL-ε-(1–162) inhibited CAT expression significantly, but GAL-ε-(185–249) showed no significant effect on CAT activity, thus indicating that the observed repression was not due to the basic region and leucine zipper domains of C/EBPε (Fig. 3). In contrast, constructs GAL-ε-(1–115) and GAL-ε-(1–70) activated transcription in this reporter assay (Fig. 3). The above constructs produced similar levels of transcriptional repression or activation with G1TKCAT, but CAT expression was unchanged with G0TKCAT as the reporter plasmid, indicating that repression required binding of the fusion proteins to the reporter (data not shown). In addition, the GAL-ε-(40–249) fusion protein significantly inhibited CAT reporter genes downstream from the strong SV40 early control region (complete enhancer plus promoter) and the relatively weak (in uninfected cells) adenovirus 2 major late promoter (data not shown). We next examined whether the repression domain of C/EBPε could inhibit the activational function of a known transcriptional activator. PCR-derived DNA fragments encoding C/EBPε amino acids 1–45, 1–115, 115–162, 115–199, or 162–199 were fused individually in frame downstream of the VP16 activation domain (Fig.4 A ). Each construct was cotransfected into U937 cells with the G5E1bCAT reporter and tested for its ability to repress the transactivation of CAT by VP16. The chimeras GAL4-VP16ε-(115–162) and GAL-VP16ε-(162–199) repressed VP16 transactivation function 60 and 65%, respectively, when compared with GAL-VP16 (Fig. 4 B ). The GAL-VP16ε-(115–199) hybrid inhibited VP16 activation by 85%, suggesting a slight cooperative effect by the repression domain and basic region domain of C/EBPε (Fig. 4 B ). However, fusion of the VP16 activation domain to regions of C/EBPε previously shown to activate CAT gene expression (amino acids 1–45 and 1–115) had no significant effect on the transactivation function of VP16 (Fig. 4 B ). Our results demonstrate that C/EBPε possesses an intrinsic repressor domain that is capable of attenuating the strong transcriptional activator VP16. Our group and others have demonstrated that c-Myb, together with C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPε, synergistically activates the promoters of a subset of myeloid specific genes including the neutrophil elastase gene (44Oelgeschlager M. Nuchprayoon I. Luscher B. Friedman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). 3W. Verbeek, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, we next investigated the function of the transactivation and repression domains of C/EBPε in regulating a myeloid-specific gene promoter in the absence of GAL4DBD. The two full-length forms of C/EBPε (1–249 and PE32, the latter a gift from Dr. Kleanthis Xanthanopoulos) and various C- and N-terminal deletions were placed under the control of the CMV promoter, and four internal deletions were generated that removed the repression domain and its surrounding residues (Fig.5 A ). These constructs, in the presence and absence of c-Myb, were cotransfected with the reporter NE-Luc into COS-1 cells, and the activity of the NE promoter was measured. Both full-length forms of C/EBPε activated the NE promoter 2-fold (Fig. 5 B ). Each N-terminal deletion mutant failed to activate transcription from the NE-Luc reporter gene (Fig.5 B ). However, two of the internal deletions, CMV-εΔ71–161 and CMV-εΔ116–161, demonstrated a 2-fold higher luciferase activity over that seen with the full-length forms. We also observed that while C/EBP with c-Myb synergistically activated NE-Luc, deletion of the repression domain further increased transcription 2-fold in the presence of c-Myb (Fig.5 B ).3 Our results indicate that C/EBPε contains a distinguishable polypeptide element that can function in efficient transcriptional activation both in the context of the C/EBPε protein and when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain. Moreover, we have identified an internal region of the C/EBPε protein that can negatively regulate gene transcription from three different promoters, as well as attenuating the function of a known potent transcriptional activator VP16. Futhermore, when the repression domain was deleted from C/EBPε, the altered C/EBPε protein enhanced transactivation of gene transcription 2-fold when compared with that of the wild-type form of C/EBPε. Taken together, both transactivation and repression domains exist within the C/EBPε gene (Fig.6 A ). The activation domain of C/EBPε was mapped to the N terminus of the protein with a minimal requirement of the first 18 amino acids, while the highest activity of transactivation was conferred by amino acid residues 1–70. Two predicted activation domains within the N terminus of CRP1 (rat C/EBPε) were identified based on sequence comparison between C/EBP family members (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). When the first domain, amino acids 1–18, was fused to the GAL4DBD, its transactivation potential retained 80% of the peak activity. Amino acid residues 19–45 of C/EBPε, containing the second domain (amino acids 19–27), conferred only weak activating potential to the GAL4DBD; however, when both domains were fused to the GAL4DBD (GAL-ε-(1–45)), potent activity was observed. The potent activity observed with GAL-ε-(1–45) does not reflect synergy between these domains in human C/EBPε. Deletion of these two domains in the construct CMV-ε-(40–249) abolished the transactivation potential on the NE promoter and reduced the synergistic stimulation of gene transcription with c-Myb. The major difference in the transactivation domains between C/EBPε and other C/EBP proteins is that only one activation domain, amino acids 1–18 of C/EBPε, corresponding to ADM2 of C/EBPβ (Fig.6 A ), is sufficient to confer a potent transactivation function to a heterologous GAL4DBD (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation domains identified in either C/EBPα or C/EBPβ were unable to confer transactivation when fused individually to the GAL4DBD (31Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,36Pei D. Shih C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unlike C/EBPε, combinations of these individual domains resulted in synergistic activation, indicating that more than one domain was required for full activating potential to be realized. Two forms of C/EBPε have been identified that differ by 32 amino acids containing sequences related to the ADM1 region of C/EBPβ (11Antonson P. Stellan B. Yamanaka R. Xanthopoulos K.G. Genomics. 1996; 35: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, this sequence alone was inactive, and in combination with the identified activation domains it did not increase the transactivating potential on the GAL4DBD. Further, both forms activated the NE promoter to the same level in the absence or presence of c-Myb. In C/EBPβ, two residues, Phe6 and Tyr7, were identified as being essential for the function of ADM1, and mutation of these residues yielded a protein with activity similar to a protein lacking this domain (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The aforementioned 32 amino acids of C/EBPε contain tyrosine residues at both sites, suggesting a possible reason for the lack of activity in this domain. Among the six C/EBP family members characterized, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPε, are activators of transcription for a variety of target genes. However, C/EBPα (32Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Pei D. Shih C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and C/EBPβ (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) both also contain extra regulatory domains, called the attenuator domain in C/EBPα and RD1 and RD2 in C/EBPβ (Fig. 6 A ). In C/EBPβ , RD1 and RD2 have independent functions. While RD1 modulates the activation domain of the protein, RD2 controls cell type-specific transactivation function through regulation of its DNA binding activity; together, RD1 and RD2 inhibit transcription 50-fold and decrease VP16 transactivation function by over 95% (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The attenuator domain identified in C/EBPα , however, exhibits neither detectable stimulation nor repression of transcription. When combined with other activation domains of C/EBPα , the attenuator domain diminishes their transactivation effect (32Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Pei D. Shih C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Deletion of these sequences causes only a modest increase in transcriptional activity (33Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The attenuator domain may actually be a regulatory domain that allows post-translational modification of C/EBPα , possibly converting a repressor into an activator or a weak activator into a strong activator (36Pei D. Shih C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). C/EBPε is distinct from other C/EBP family members in that, although C/EBPε expression occurs exclusively within the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, the identified domains show little difference in cell type-specific regulation of transcription. As for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ , we have identified a negative regulatory element in C/EBPε localized to amino acids 116–162, downstream of the activation domain and upstream of the DNA binding and dimerization domain (Fig.6 A ). In contrast to C/EBPβ, deletion of the C/EBPε repression domain does not give the same magnitude of increase in transactivation, and this effect may be more similar to the increase observed with deletion of the attenuator domain of C/EBPα. Also, the inhibition of VP16 transactivation function by the repression domain of C/EBPε is significantly less than that mediated by RD1 and RD2 of C/EBPβ. Therefore, the repression domain identified in C/EBPε may be functionally more similar to the attenuator domain of C/EBPα rather than RD1 and RD2 of C/EBPβ. We cannot determine from these experiments whether the GAL4-C/EBPε fusions repress transcription directly or whether additional factors interacting with the repression domain are required. What role do the transcriptional activation or repression domains play in the function of C/EBPε? Recent studies indicate that it is quite common for a protein to serve either as an activator or a repressor, depending on the other gene regulatory proteins present in the cell (47Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the case of C/EBPε, this may reflect its specific role in regulating myelopoiesis (48Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPε has been demonstrated to have a remarkable effect on myeloid cell proliferation (12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of a promyelocyte cell line (NB4) with a C/EBPε expression plasmid increased cell growth by 7-fold, but proliferation was significantly decreased upon transfection of the C/EBPε antisense expression vector (12Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells may depend on a negatively regulatory domain (C/EBPε itself) or associated factors that interact with this domain to control cell proliferation at a certain growth stage. Therefore, the repression domain (and its associated factors) probably acts as a buffer for the activation function of C/EBPε. Our simplified and speculative model shown in Fig. 6 B proposes that C/EBPε interacts with different partners in the varied contexts of cellular signaling, which induces exposure of the activation or repression domain. These domains may actually represent oligomerization surfaces that allow C/EBPε to form higher order aggregates either with itself or with other proteins that play a more direct role in transcriptional regulation of myeloid genes. In support of this model, our data indicate that Myb is such a potential activation partner. Many other proteins have been suggested as potential C/EBP-interacting factors (21Mink S. Kerber U. Klempnauer K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1316-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22LeClair K.P. Blanar M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It will be interesting to identify factor(s) that interact with the repression domain to dissect further the repressive function of C/EBPε. Although no common signature has been found within the repression domain of C/EBPε when searched in the data base, it contains a relatively high content of prolines and other hydrophobic amino acid residues. Application of the two-hybrid cloning system by using the repression domain of C/EBPε as bait may lead to new information about the network of transcription factors that specifically modulate genes important in hematopoiesis.

Models of the folding topology of membrane channels, primarily based on hydropathy plot analysis of amino acid sequences, have guided biochemical, biophysical, and molecular biological experimental approaches toward better understanding of the sequence-structure determinism of these macromolecules. Though powerful, these approaches do not reveal what structural elements constitute and control the selective permeability of ion channels and are limited in scope in the absence of high resolution structures determined by either two-dimensional or three-dimensional crystallography.

Although two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins have been extremely useful for determining their detailed three-dimensional structures the principal obstacle in the way of progress toward determination of tertiary structure of other ion channels has been the difficulty to produce high amounts of pure channel proteins required for electron crystallography. In this context, the large mechanosensitive ion channel (MscL) 1The abbreviations used are: MS, mechanosensitive; MscL, mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance. 1The abbreviations used are: MS, mechanosensitive; MscL, mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance. of Escherichia coli presents an excellent candidate for two-dimensional electron crystallography because of (i) the bacterial source providing a relative abundance of the MscL protein and (ii) the sturdiness of this channel protein that allows for its easy overproduction, purification, and liposome reconstitution required for the two-dimensional crystallization. Despite its obvious biological significance, there is a considerable lack of knowledge of molecular structures and mechanisms underlying the mechanosensitivity of mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. This has been largely a result of the lack of both structural information and specific pharmacological agents for this ubiquitous and diverse family of ion channels (6Sachs F. CRC Crit. Rev. Biomed.

The channel is gated by mechanical force transmitted via membrane lipid bilayer alone because it remained functional upon reconstitution in pure lipid bilayer (15Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). How this is achieved is yet unknown, although a recently proposed electromechanical coupling model of MscL gating (23Gu L. Liu W. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) may account for the channel mechanosensitivity at the molecular level. In the present study, we describe a method that allowed a successful generation of two-dimensional crystalline arrays of MscL, whose crystallographic analysis yielded a projection map at 15-Å resolution. The map showed the molecular boundary and hexameric organization of the MscL channels in the membrane bilayer, thus making MscL the first MS ion channel with its gross tertiary structure revealed. E. coli strain AW737-KO, carrying the plasmid PGEX1.1 and encoding the glutathioneS -transferase-MscL fusion protein, was grown as described previously (15Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5% sucrose, 2 mm MgSO4, DNase (20 μg/ml) and passed two times through a French press at 8,000 p.s.i. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 45 min at 4,300 ×g to eliminate cell debris and inclusion bodies. The supernatant was incubated with 1% Triton X-100 and added to 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 3 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed four times by centrifugation using a desktop centrifuge for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After the last centrifugation, the beads were resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100. Thrombin was added to a final concentration of ≈1 unit/μg of protein and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The beads were transferred to a small column (10 × 30 mm) and washed two times with 250 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100. Protein samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The MscL protein purified with Triton X-100 was incubated with azolectin liposomes at the protein-to-lipid ratios of 1:6,000 or 1:4,000 (w/w) for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 80 mg of Bio-Beads per ml of protein solution in 0.2% Triton X-100. After 4 h Bio-Beads were discarded, and the suspension was centrifuged for 25 min at 90,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of HEPES-KOH pH 7.0, and aliquots were subjected to a dehydration/rehydration to obtain giant proteoliposomes as described previously (15Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The giant proteoliposomes, collapsed in the recording chamber containing 200 mm KCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, were examined for mechanosensitive currents using the standard patch-clamp technique (15Häse C.C.

Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). Purified MscL was resuspended in 100 mmKCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 and supplemented with E. coli lipids. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and the lipid-to-protein ratio to 0.45 w/w. The samples were incubated for 1 h in a cold room with gentle stirring and were subsequently treated with Bio-Beads SM2 according to the batch procedure as described previously (26Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Levy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Typically, the detergent removal was performed in the cold room by adding first 5 mg of Bio-Beads to 50 μl of the reconstitution mixtures for a period of 4 h, followed by a second addition of 5 mg of Bio-Beads for about 1 h to ensure the complete detergent removal. The reconstituted material was then separated from the Bio-Beads with a micropipette and incubated overnight at 4 °C before carrying out three cycles of freezing (−190 °C) and thawing (25 °C). Aliquots were taken daily and examined by electron microscopy following negative staining with 1% (w/w) uranyl acetate solution. The specimens were examined in a Philips CM 120 electron microscope operating at 120 kV under low dose conditions. Initial attempts to crystallize MscL purified with octyl glucoside have been unsuccessful. A mixture of protein aggregates and amorphous pure lipid structures was observed after removal of the detergent, indicating non-mixing of lipids and proteins in the original micellar solutions and/or protein aggregation at low lipid content in the presence of this detergent. Because two-dimensional crystallization of membrane proteins has been shown to drastically depend upon the nature of the detergent, we have focussed on the development of a new method using Triton X-100 instead of octyl glucoside for the MscL solubilization. As the first step during the extraction procedure, we used the French press to eliminate the inclusion bodies that might have contained non-functional and/or misfolded MscL proteins. Four consecutive washes of glutathione-Sepharose columns in the presence of Triton X-100 ensured an almost complete delipidation of MscL (approximately 10m lipid/m protein). The final step was to minimize the volume of the solutions during the enzymatic cleavage, which ensured a high protein concentration (0.7–1.2 mg/ml) and thus made unnecessary the concentration of the protein by Amicon filters that usually led to unknown final detergent concentrations. The amount of the pure protein obtained with Triton X-100 was approximately 1 mg of MscL/1 liter of cell culture, a yield larger by a factor of 1.3–2 when compared with that obtained using octyl glucoside. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the MscL proteins purified with Triton X-100 revealed a large and diffuse band around 17 kDa, similar to the pattern observed with MscL purified using octyl glucoside (Fig. 1 A ). We have also functionally examined the channel activity of MscL purified using Triton X-100. When examined by the patch clamp the reconstituted proteins were activated by negative pressure (suction) in a way similar to what was reported previously (15Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B ). The channel sensitivity to pressure in the particular patch was estimated to be 5.9 mm Hg per exponential-fold change in open probability, and the negative pressure required to induce half-maximal activation of MscL was 40 mm Hg at a pipette potential of −20 mV. The single channel conductance was 3.5 ± 0.2 nS (n = 3) (data not shown) (15Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, between 86 and 100% of the patches examined (n = 20) were found to contain functional MscL proteins. A similar result of 83% active patches (n = 41) was obtained with MscL purified using octyl glucoside and reconstituted into liposomes at the same protein-to-lipid ratio. These results are comparable with those previously reported (15Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional crystals were obtained at low lipid-to-protein ratios (0.3–0.6, w/w) by mixing the purified Triton X-100-solubilized MscL with small amounts of E. coli lipids. The detergent was then removed from these micellar solutions by hydrophobic adsorption onto Bio-Beads SM2. Electron microscopy of samples obtained after the treatment with the Bio-Beads indicated vesicular crystals. The order and appearance of crystalline arrays were optimal at a lipid-to-protein ratio of 0.45 w/w. Lower ratios decreased the number of vesicular crystals at the expense of lipid-protein aggregates, whereas higher ratios lead to proteoliposome formation with a decreasing degree of crystallinity. After 5 h of incubation with the Bio-Beads ensuring complete detergent removal at 4 °C, electron microscopy revealed vesicles of approximately 50–75 nm in diameter with densely packed particles and with about 50% of them already crystalline (data not shown). The formed crystals did not grow upon further incubation and were very stable, existing for weeks. After several freeze-thaw cycles, some of the crystalline vesicles fused to give larger vesicles of about 200 nm in diameter with crystalline arrays covering all the vesicles (Fig.2 A ). Despite their small size, optical diffraction of the negatively stained MscL crystals showed strong reflections on a hexagonal lattice with resolution up to about 30 Å. We selected single layered two-dimensional crystals corresponding to split-open vesicles. Fig. 2,A and B, shows electron micrograph and Fourier transform of such a single layered two-dimensional crystal. Interestingly, the filtered image of the two-dimensional crystal (Fig.2 C ) clearly shows a hexagonal packing of cylindrical particles, which are characterized by a central depression. We selected the 20 best micrographs of crystals exhibiting the appearance and optical density of single layers. The unit cell parameters were calculated as:a = b = 57 Å and γ =120 Å. When the micrographs were processed to correct for crystal distortion according to the procedure of Henderson et al. (27Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar), statistical analysis of the data indicated significant structural information up to a resolution of about 15 Å. Examination of the phase residuals using the ALLSPACE program indicated a p6 plane group (28Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We merged 14 images to produce a projection map at 15-Å resolution (see IQ plot in Fig. 3 B ). The striking resemblance of the maps without (Fig. 3 A ) and with p6 symmetry applied (Fig. 3 C ) showed that the MscL channel molecules in the unit cell were indeed related by a 6-fold symmetry. The projection map clearly delineates the contour of the channel molecules (the molecular boundary of the particles). This map shows that the molecules consist of hexagonal particles, with an outer diameter between 42 and 48 Å. The stain-excluding regions are arranged in a ring with a radial width of approximately 11–15 Å, which surrounds a central depression of approximately 18 Å in diameter. Within each ring, there are six round regions of density that are clearly resolved and demonstrate a homohexameric organization of the MscL channels. Because negative staining revealed the overall topography of the surfaces exposed to the aqueous medium, it is likely that a significant fraction of each monomer projects out of the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The predicted external domains of the MscL monomer (S1, S2, S3, and C terminus) (13Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) probably contribute to these densities. In this study we described a method that for the first time made possible a two-dimensional crystallization of a mechanosensitive channel providing information about its structure at the resolution of 15 Å. We believe that the new protocol of the MscL solubilization and purification using Triton X-100 and the strategy of two-dimensional crystallization employing Bio-Beads SM2 as a detergent-removing agent (26Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Levy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) has been essential for developing this structural approach. Previously, MscL has been purified using octyl glucoside as a solubilizing agent (13Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 15Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Häse C.C. Minchin R.F. Kloda A. Martinac B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, octyl glucoside was found not to be useful for the two-dimensional crystallization procedure because of the larger variability in the purity of the final MscL protein fraction purified using this detergent as compared with the purity of MscL extracted by Triton X-100. One of the possible explanations includes delipidation as the crucial step, because delipidation of the protein could lead to protein aggregation and/or denaturation in the presence of octyl glucoside but not Triton X-100. Also, protein aggregation may occur during two-dimensional crystallization because of inefficient mixing of lipids and proteins that could lead to lipid-rich micelles and protein-rich micelles and/or preferential octyl glucoside removal from one type of micelles. The Bio-Beads were recently reported to provide an efficient alternative method to conventional dialysis for removal of detergents and for obtaining two-dimensional crystalline arrays of membrane proteins (26Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Levy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This method has been successfully applied for the generation of crystals of different classes of membrane proteins solubilized in different detergents (26Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Levy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Young H.S. Rigaud J.-L. Lacapere J.-J. Reddy L.G. Stokes D.L. Biophys.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20263-20268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, as demonstrated in this study, it was very efficient in producing two-dimensional crystals of MscL. The patch-clamp analysis of the MscL proteins reconstituted by the same method as the one used for the two-dimensional crystallization demonstrated that the MscL channel remained fully functional in terms of its pressure sensitivity as well as conductive properties. These results strongly suggest that the two-dimensional MscL protein crystals represent the oligomeric tertiary structure of the channel that most likely reflects its functional assembly in the native bacterial membrane. Several independent studies suggested that the functional MscL channel is a homohexamer (18Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Schroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Guy H.R. Kung C. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters. The Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 133-141Google Scholar, 21Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our data obtained by electron crystallography showed that the MscL monomers are arranged in almost equivalent positions conferring upon the structure a high degree of hexagonal symmetry and demonstrated clearly that the MscL does form homohexameric ion channels. The other prominent feature of the projection map is the central depression domain of approximately 18 Å in the center of the channel molecule. A first interpretation would be to consider a channel model in which hexameric organization produces an aqueous pore in the middle of the channel that should be accessible from both sides of the membrane. However, from permeation studies using large organic molecules, the size of the open channel pore of MscL was estimated to be approximately 35–40 Å in diameter (31Cruickshank C.C. Minchin R.F. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), i.e. much larger than the 18 Å measured from the projection map. In addition, because there is no reason to believe that the bilayer was stretched in our MscL crystallization conditions, the hexamer most likely depicts the closed channel. Thus, a second more plausible interpretation would be to assume that the projection map represents the channel in the closed state. Indeed, taking into account that the negative stain does not penetrate into bilayer, only the extramembranous domains can be visualized. Thus, the depression in the center of the hexamer may be filled by the transmembrane helices kinked or oriented at an oblique angle with respect to the membrane plane and not detectable in our experimental conditions. Because no proline residues are present in the transmembrane regions of MscL, possible closure of the channel by kinked α-helices could involve a leucine ring as reported for the acetylcholine receptor channel (5Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar); according to this hypothesis, there are two leucines in the M1 helix and one leucine in the M2 helix of each MscL monomer. This interpretation has an important consequence for the closed-to-open conformation of the MscL channel molecule upon stretching the membrane. Indeed, in the open configuration, the channel pore is 35–40 Å in diameter. Consequently, the minimal calculated external diameter of the hexameric channel should be about 50–60 Å (31Cruickshank C.C. Minchin R.F. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Compared with a diameter of 42–48 Å measured on the projection map for the closed channel, this indicates a substantial conformational change in different domains of the channel hexamer. It is known that proteins undergo substantial internal motions, ranging from side chain realignments on a picosecond time scale to large transitions in folding occurring over several microseconds. Recent mutagenesis studies have revealed major internal motions during the gating of Na+channels; upon depolarization, the S4 voltage sensors move 4.5–11 Å within 1 ms (32French R.J. Prusak-Sochaczewski E. Zamponi G.G.W. Becker S. Shavantha Kularatna A. Horn R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 407-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At present, the issue of the precise molecular organization of secondary structural elements forming the channel with a pore in the center of the hexamer cannot be resolved until higher resolution maps are calculated. Frozen-hydrated MscL crystals should contain additional information on the channel protein structures buried within the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid bilayer in which the stain cannot penetrate. This, however, will be the subject of further crystallographic studies aiming toward improving the quality of the two-dimensional MscL crystals that will allow us to decipher the structure of this MS channel at the atomic level. With the current convergence of conceptual and technical breakthroughs, we stand at the threshold of an exciting phase in the structural analysis of this membrane protein. We are grateful to G. Mosser for helpful discussions and Anna Kloda for technical assistance."

This study provides important insight into the identification of functional domains that determine differences among glutamate transporter subtypes. l-Glutamate transport in the central nervous system and also in peripheral organs is mediated by a family of structurally related membrane proteins. In the central nervous system, glutamate transporters play an important role by mediating removal of glutamate released at excitatory synapses and also influencing the kinetics of glutamate receptor activation (1Otis T.S.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent cloning and expression of recombinant glutamate transporter proteins in heterologous expression systems allow a number of questions concerning the molecular basis for transporter function to be addressed. In particular, an important aspect of such studies is the identification of domains involved in substrate recognition and substrate translocation through the membrane. In this study we have constructed a series of chimeric glutamate transporters, using the EAAT1 and EAAT2 subtypes, and exploited the pharmacological and electrophysiological differences between the two subtypes to map functional domains of these proteins. To make meaningful predictions about the functional role of various domains, an understanding of the structure of the transporters is particularly useful. The predicted amino acid sequences of EAAT1 and EAAT2 are 65% identical, and if conservative substitutions are allowed the degree of relatedness is increased to 80% (8Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteins are likely to form very similar structures and therefore are good candidates for the generation of functional chimeras. Through the use of hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequences it has been predicted that there are six α-helical transmembrane segments in the amino-terminal portion of the protein. Tagging amino acid residues between the various transmembrane segments within this region and identifying whether the tags are located intracellularly or extracellularly have confirmed the predictions from the hydrophobicity analysis (9Seal B. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 211861Google Scholar, 10Wahle S. Stoffel W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of the remaining portion of the proteins has been inconclusive. This region is the most highly conserved part of the protein and has been suggested to form part of the pore of the transporter through which glutamate and various ions pass in the transport process (11Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This suggestion has been supported by evidence from point mutation studies (11Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is highly likely that at least some of this part of the protein is closely associated with the membrane. In two recent studies, molecular tags have been introduced into the transporters, and the intracellular and extracellular locations of the tags have been used to predict the topology of this region (10Wahle S. Stoffel W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Slotboom D.J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. J. Biol.

Two very different models for the transmembrane topology of the transporters have been predicted from the two studies. In both models, four transmembrane domains have been predicted, but in the model suggested by Slotboom and co-workers (14Slotboom D.J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31317-31321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the four transmembrane segments are α-helical, whereas in the model suggested by Wahle and Stoffel (10Wahle S. Stoffel W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the four transmembrane segments are β-sheets. In most membrane proteins the most highly conserved domains are located within the transmembrane regions. Although other topological models are also possible, 1B. Seal and S. G. Amara, unpublished observations. for the purposes of this study, we tentatively favor the first model, consisting of 10 α-helical transmembrane segments, because this model places a larger proportion of the highly conserved domain within the membrane. However, further work is clearly required to resolve this issue. Despite the high degree of amino acid sequence conservation between EAAT1 and EAAT2, the transporter subtypes show quite distinct pharmacological differences. The most striking pharmacological difference between the transporter subtypes is the selective sensitivity of the EAAT2 subtype to competitive inhibition or blockade by dihydrokainate, kainate, and threo -3-methylglutamate (8Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These compounds block glutamate transport by EAAT2 in a voltage-independent manner, suggesting that they block transport by competing with glutamate at an extracellular recognition site. Another compound, (2S ,4R )-4-methylglutamate, shows some very distinctive differences in its mechanism of action on the transporters. (2S ,4R )-4-Methylglutamate is a voltage-independent, competitive blocker of glutamate transport by EAAT2, but it is also a potent substrate of the EAAT1 transporter subtype. As such these compounds provide a set of selective molecular probes for the extracellular glutamate recognition site of the transporters. In contrast to the competitive blockers of glutamate transporters, a number of other pharmacological agents have been shown to inhibit glutamate transport by competing with glutamate as a substrate for the transporters (8Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One pharmacological substrate that shows some clear differences in transport parameters between EAAT1 and EAAT2 isl-serine-O -sulfate.l-Serine-O -sulfate is a substrate for both EAAT1 and EAAT2, but it is a less potent substrate on EAAT2 than EAAT1. In addition, the EC50 2The abbreviations used are: EC50, concentration of substrate which generates half-maximal current; I, current; S, substrate; EC50R, selectivity ratio; B, blocker; IC50, concentration of blocker which causes a 50% reduction in glutamate transport current; Erev, reversal potential. values forl-serine-O -sulfate transport by EAAT2 are steeply voltage-dependent but relatively constant for transport by EAAT1 (16Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This difference between EAAT1 and EAAT2 inl-serine-O -sulfate transport is likely to reflect a difference in the structure of the pore of the two transporters. Thus, l-serine-O -sulfate may be used as a molecular probe for the pore of the transporters. In addition to the pharmacological differences, the different transporter subtypes allow a varying degree of a thermodynamically uncoupled chloride flux through the transporter (6Fairman W.A.

Different transporter substrates also appear to be coupled differentially to the activation of chloride fluxes (6Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 17Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

In particular, the chloride conductance activated byd-aspartate transport by EAAT1 is significantly greater than the chloride conductance activated by d-aspartate transport by EAAT2 (17Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These differences in substrate-activated chloride conductance between transporter subtypes provide another independent molecular probe for identifying the domain responsible for forming the pore of the transporters. We have constructed a series of chimeric glutamate transporters with the aim of investigating the importance of transmembrane domains 7–10 in determining functional differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2. The chimeric glutamate transporters were characterized in terms of electrogenic glutamate transport; sensitivity to the transport blockers kainate, threo -3-methylglutamate, and (2S ,4R )-4-methylglutamate; l-serine-O -sulfate transport; and chloride permeability. l-Glutamate (Na+ salt),d-aspartic acid, l-serine-O -sulfate (K+ salt), kainic acid, and HEPES were obtained from Sigma, Sydney, Australia. (2S ,4R )-4-Methylglutamate andthreo -3-methylglutamate were obtained from Tocris Cookson, Bristol, U. K. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. The chimeric glutamate transporters were constructed using cDNAs encoding the EAAT1 and EAAT2 transporter subtypes. Two procedures were used to construct the various chimeras. First, an in vivo recombination procedure was used to construct the chimeras based on the method described by Buck and Amara (20Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). EAAT1 and EAAT2 cDNAs were cloned in tandem into the pCMV plasmid (21Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a uniqueXba I site between the cDNAs. The tandem construct was linearized with Xba I, and 100 ng of DNA was used to transform competent DH5α cells. Colonies were screened for recombinant plasmids that contained only a single cDNA and sequenced to determine the junction sites (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A number of chimeras were isolated, and all of them had junction sites within the most highly conserved domain from serine 366 to glutamine 415 (EAAT1 numbering). One of these chimeras, termedEAAT1-EAAT2-Chimera-7(E12C7), contained the EAAT1 sequence at the amino terminus and junctions with EAAT2 at leucine 404. The chimera was subcloned into pOTV for synthesis of cRNA and expression in Xenopus oocytes. In all of the remaining chimeras unique restriction sites were engineered into the cDNAs, using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and then the cDNA fragments of one of the transporters were cut out of the plasmid and ligated into corresponding sites of the other transporter cDNA. More than 20 different chimeric glutamate transporters were constructed in this way, but only the chimeras in Fig. 1 were functional in terms of supporting electrogenic glutamate transport. All of the functional chimeras were sequenced using a Perkin-Elmer 377 sequencer with the Catalyst 800 robotic work station at the Sydney University and Prince Alfred Macromolecular Analysis Center. Selected nonfunctional chimeras were also sequenced to check that polymerase chain reaction-generated errors were not introduced into the chimeric cDNAs. The functional chimeras are named according to the orientation of cDNA fragments, with the numbering referring to the transmembrane closest to the junction site. For example, E12C7 contains EAAT1 sequence from the amino terminus to transmembrane domain 7 and then the EAAT2 sequence to the carboxyl terminus. E121C7–8 contains the EAAT1 sequence from the amino terminus to transmembrane domain 7 followed by the EAAT2 sequence to the end of transmembrane 8 and then EAAT1 sequence to the carboxyl-terminal end. Xenopus laevis were obtained from the African Xenopus Facility, Republic of South Africa. A lobe of the ovary was surgically removed while the frog was anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester methanesulfonate salt (Sigma), and stage V–VI oocytes were isolated after collagenase treatment. 10–50 ng of cRNAs encoding the various glutamate transporters were injected into oocytes. 2–7 days later transport was measured by two-electrode voltage clamp recording using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) and a MacLab 2e recorder (ADInstruments). In transport experiments the membrane potential of the oocytes expressing the given transporter was clamped at −60 mV and superfused continuously with frog ringer buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55). When measuring dose responses for various substrates, this buffer was changed to one containing the indicated concentration of substrate. Voltage-dependent l-glutamate ord-aspartate transport currents were measured by clamping the membrane at various potentials between −60 and +60 mV and applying the substrate to the bath solution. Current (I) as a function of substrate concentration ([S]) was fitted by least squares to I = Imax·[S]/(EC50 + [S]), where Imax is the maximal current, and EC50 is the concentration of substrate which generates half-maximal current. The Imax values for l-serine- O -sulfate and, where appropriate, (2S ,4R )-4-methylglutamate, are expressed relative to a maximal dose of l-glutamate in the same cell. A selectivity ratio, EC50R, represents the EC50value for each substrate divided by the EC50 for glutamate for EAAT1, EAAT2, and each chimeric transporter. Imax and EC50 values are expressed as mean ± S.E. and were determined by fitting data from individual oocytes. Current (I) as a function of blocker concentration ([B]) was fitted by least squares to I = Imax − (Imax·[B]/(IC50 + [B])), where Imax is the current generated by 30 μmglutamate, and IC50 is the concentration of the blocker that causes a 50% reduction in the glutamate transport current. The transport blockers, (2S ,4R )-4-methylglutamate,threo -3-methylglutamate, and kainate, have all been shown to be competitive blockers of glutamate transport by EAAT2 using Schild analysis (8Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A.R.

K i values are expressed as mean ± S.E. and were determined by fitting data from individual oocytes. A number of chimeric glutamate transporters (>20) were constructed using the EAAT1 and EAAT2 subtypes, but only the five chimeric transporters depicted in Fig. 1 showed high affinity electrogenic glutamate transport in oocytes expressing the corresponding cDNAs. The EC50 values for glutamate transport by EAAT1 and EAAT2 are 14.7 ± 2.9 μm and 23.2 ± 1.2 μm, respectively, and the corresponding values for the five functional chimeric transporters fall within the range 3.2–37.2 μm (Fig. 2 and TableI).Table IGlutamate and l-serine-O-sulfate transport parameters for EAAT1, EAAT2, and chimeric transportersTransporterGlutamate EC50l-Serine-O-sulfateEC50ImaxEC50REAAT114.7 ± 2.918.4 ± 3.41.00 ± 0.031.3EAAT223.2 ± 1.2174 ± 20.20.70 ± 0.037.6E21C813.2 ± 1.818.7 ± 2.20.94 ± 0.011.4E12C1028.1 ± 5.527.9 ± 7.11.07 ± 0.031.0E21C1017.0 ± 1.3178 ± 25.70.74 ± 0.0310.5E12C737.2 ± 1.7213 ± 7.70.62 ± 0.015.7E121C7–83.2 ± 0.358.4 ± 1.51.34 ± 0.032.6EC50 (μm), Imax, and EC50R were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Imax values are relative to the maximal transport current generated by glutamate in the same cell.

Open table in a new tab EC50 (μm), Imax, and EC50R were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Imax values are relative to the maximal transport current generated by glutamate in the same cell. Data represent mean ± S.E. (n = 3–8). For ease of interpretation the chimeric transporters are effectively dissected into four regions. Region 1 starts at the amino terminus and includes the first six transmembrane domains and part of transmembrane domain 7. Region 2 continues through the seventh transmembrane domain to the end of the eighth transmembrane domain. Region 3 includes transmembrane domains 9 and 10. Region 4 consists of the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1). The wild-type and chimeric glutamate transporters have been characterized in terms of potency of l-serine-O -sulfate as a substrate, chloride permeability, sensitivity to the transport blockers kainate and threo -3-methylglutamate, and whether (2S ,4R )-4-methylglutamate is a substrate or a blocker of transport. In each of these functional characteristics there are clear differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2 (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and TablesTable I, Table II, Table III). The EC50 values for glutamate did not differ more than by a factor of 2 for the chimeras, with the exception of E121C7–8, EC50 3.2 μm. To allow meaningful interpretation of EC50 data a selectivity ratio has been included for each chimera. This ratio represents the EC50value for each substrate divided by the EC50 for glutamate for each chimera, allowing the comparison with wild-type transporters with standardization for the EC50 differences observed. Wild-type transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 display a 9-fold difference inl-serine- O -sulfate transport parameters (EAAT1; EC50 18.4 ± 3.4, EC50R 1.3; EAAT2, EC50 174 ± 20, EC50R 7.6) (Fig. 2 and Table I). Differences in maximal current are also displayed between EAAT1, which attains the same Imax as glutamate, and EAAT2, which attains 70% of the Imax observed for glutamate. The five chimeras transport l-serine-O -sulfate within the EC50 range 8.4–213 μm. Chimeric transporters that displayed transport parameters more aligned with EAAT1 were E21C8 (EC50 18.7 ± 2.2, Imax0.94 ± 0.01, EC50R 1.4), E12C10 (EC5027.9 ± 7.1, Imax 1.07 ± 0.03, EC50R 1.0), and E121C7–8 (8.4 ± 1.5, Imax 1.3 ± 0.03, EC50R 2.6) (Fig. 2 and Table I). EAAT2 transport parameters were represented in chimeric transporters E21C10 (EC50 178 ± 26, Imax 0.74 ± 0.03, EC50R 10.5) and E12C7 (EC50 213 ± 8, Imax 0.62 ± 0.01, EC50R 5.7) (Fig. 2 and Table I). The chimeric transporters define a functional domain (region 3) that influences the substrate selectivity ofl-serine-O -sulfate observed with EAAT1 and EAAT2. Chimera E21C8, which contains EAAT1 sequence in region 3 and 4, has EAAT1-like l-serine-O -sulfate selectivity. Chimera E12C10 showed EAAT1-likel-serine-O -sulfate selectivity, and the reverse chimera E21C10 had EAAT2-like l-serine-O -sulfate selectivity, implying that the intracellular region 4 does not conferl-serine-O -sulfate selectivity.l-Serine-O -sulfate transport by chimera E12C7, which contains EAAT2 sequence in regions 2, 3, and 4, displayed EAAT2 selectivity, whereas E121C7–8, which contains EAAT1 sequence in regions 3 and 4, displayed EAAT1 selectivity, confirming the importance of region 3. In summary, these results suggest that region 3, which includes the 9th and 10th transmembrane domains, is a major determinant of differences in substrate selectivity between EAAT1 and EAAT2. Chloride permeation of both wild-type and chimeric transporters was estimated by measuring voltage-dependent transport currents of d-aspartate andl-glutamate. Differences in chloride permeation between EAAT1 and EAAT2 are most obvious for d-aspartate transport (17Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 and TableII), and the membrane potential at whichd-aspartate transport currents reverse direction may be used as an indicator of relative chloride permeability. The chimeric transporters for the most part clearly resembled either EAAT1 or EAAT2. Chimeric transporters E21C8 (Erevd-aspartate +7.1 ± 1.5; Erevl-glutamate > +50 mV) and E12C10 (Erevd-aspartate +2.3 ± 1.2; Erevl-glutamate +37.0 ± 3.8 mV) both have reversal potentials that are similar to EAAT1 (Fig. 3 and TableII). Chimera E12C7 (Erevd-aspartate > +50 mV; Erevl-glutamate > +50 mV) did not show a reversal of current in the membrane potential range up to > +50 mV, indicative of EAAT2-like chloride permeability (Fig. 3 and Table II). Chimera E21C10 (Erevd-aspartate +23.9 ± 2.5 mV; Erevl-glutamate > +50 mV) did not obviously correspond to either EAAT1 or EAAT2 classification (Fig. 3and Table II).Table IIReversal potential measurements for transport currents induced by 300 μml-glutamate and 300 μmd-aspartateTransporterErevl-GlutamateErevd-AspartatemVmVEAAT1>50 (n = 4)+6.9 ± 2.5 (n = 4)EAAT2>50 (n = 6)>50 (n = 6)E21C8>50 (n = 3)+7.1 ± 1.5 (n = 3)E12C10+37.0 ± 3.8 (n = 3)+2.3 ± 1.2 (n = 3)E21C10>50 (n = 4)+23.9 ± 2.5 (n = 4)E12C7>50 (n = 6)>50 (n = 6)E121C7–8>50 (n = 4)>50 (n = 4)Results represent mean ± S.E. (n = 3–6). Open table in a new tab Results represent mean ± S.E. (n = 3–6). The results from the reversal potential measurements of the chimeric transporters suggest that the third region, which is transmembrane domains 9 and 10, is a major determinant of the differences in chloride permeability observed between EAAT1 and EAAT2. Chimera E21C8, which contains EAAT1 sequence in regions 3 and 4, has chloride permeation parameters similar to those of EAAT1 wild-type, suggesting that the region conferring differences in chloride permeation is region 3 and 4, which contains transmembrane domains 9 and 10. The results for E12C7 are also consistent with this conclusion. The transport currents for chimera E121C7–8 showed some unusual characteristics. A comparison of the current-voltage relationships for l-glutamate andd-aspartate of chimera E121C7–8 displays relative maximal currents similar to those of EAAT1, especially at negative membrane potentials (Fig. 3). However, at positive membrane potentials thed-aspartate current does not reverse direction, which is characteristic of EAAT2 (Fig. 3). In addition to the unusual current-voltage curves for l-glutamate andd-aspartate transport, the chimera E121C7–8 supports a leak current because of chloride-modulated fluxes of Na+and K+ (23Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17668-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Leak currents have not been detected in either EAAT1 (24Lebrun B. Sakaitani M. Shimamoto K. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Nakajima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20336-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or EAAT2 (22Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which suggests that the functional properties of the E121C7–8 chimera have been partially compromised. The lack of outward currents generated by d-aspartate transport at positive membrane potentials may be related to the compromised ion permeation properties of this chimera. As such, the reliability of any conclusions relating to ion permeation by E121C7–8 must be questioned. The reversal potential measurements for the chimera E12C10 are similar to those of EAAT1, which is also consistent with region 3 conferring differences in chloride permeability. However, chimera E21C10 (which is the reverse chimera of E12C10 and contains only the carboxyl-terminal region 4 from EAAT1), displayed a lower reversal potential ford-aspartate than observed for EAAT2 (Table II). The current-voltage relationship for the chimera E21C10 resembled EAAT1-like characteristics more than EAAT2 (Fig. 3). The results from this chimera imply that the carboxyl terminus may play an additional role in determining differences in chloride permeation. It appears that the major determinant of the differences in both chloride permeability and l-serine-O -sulfate substrate selectivity between EAAT1 and EAAT2 may be localized to the same region of the transporter, which includes transmembrane domains 9 and 10. In addition, the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region may also play a minor role in chloride permeation. A defining feature of the differences between EAAT1 and EAAT2 transporters is the selective sensitivity of EAAT2 to the transport blockers kainate andthreo- 3-methylglutamat"

The formation of the Trp radical would facilitate one electron transfer from Cyt c to the porphyrin, inasmuch as Cyt c cannot be directly accessible to the Cc P heme active center (10Finzel B.C.

Thus, the position of the radical center in compound I is closely related to function of peroxidase and amino acid residues that control the radical center can be considered to be one of key factors to discriminate the functions of peroxidases.On the basis of sequence alignment between HRP and Cc P, an amino acid residue corresponding to Trp-191 in Cc P is a Phe residue (Phe-221) in HRP (12Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To investigate the control mechanism for the position of the radical center in the reaction intermediates, some mutagenic studies focused on Trp-191 in Cc P have been carried out and shown that a “HRP-type” Cc P mutant, in which the proximal Trp was replaced with Phe (Trp-191 → Phe), yields an oxyferryl porphyrin π-cation radical intermediate similar to that of HRP compound I, suggesting that the proximal Trp controls the position of the radical center (8Mauro J.M.

However, the radical transfer from the porphyrin ring to the proximal Trp has not yet been confirmed, which is one of the most crucial processes in the formation of Cc P compound I.In this paper, we have prepared a complementary HRP mutant enzyme to the Cc P mutant, a “Cc P-type” HRP mutant having a tryptophan residue at the position of Phe-221 (F221W) (Fig.1), in order to elucidate the regulation mechanism of radical transfer in peroxidase reaction intermediates. NMR, EPR, and ICP emission spectroscopies were used in this study to characterize the heme environmental structure of the mutant. These spectroscopies, demonstrating formation of the Trp radical during the oxidation of the mutant by hydrogen peroxide after the porphyrin π-cation radical formation, provide strong evidence that the radical center on the porphyrin ring can be transferred to the Trp residue near the heme in peroxidase, indicating that the Trp residue is the key amino acid residue to differentiate the function of peroxidases. Peroxidases catalyze one-electron oxidation of various substrates by using H2O2 as an oxidant (1Dunford H.B. Stillman J.S. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1976; 19: 187-251Crossref Scopus (934) Google Scholar).

Compound I in HRP effects one-electron oxidation of the substrates, small organic or inorganic molecules, producing the second intermediate, compound II. The remaining oxidized site, ferryl iron (FeIV), again oxidizes substrates to be reduced back to the resting state. On the other hand, the compound I of another typical peroxidase, cytochromec peroxidase (Cc P), can catalyze the redox reaction with cytochrome c (Cyt c ), a sole substrate of Cc P (3Poulos T.L.

https://openalex.org/W1967675708,"The closely related proto-oncogene proteins CrkII and CrkL consist of one SH2 and two SH3 domains and share 60% overall homology with the highest identity within their functional domains. In this study we show that CrkL and CrkII may play overlapping but different roles in insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor-mediated signal transduction. While both proteins are substrates involved in IGF-I receptor signaling, they apparently demonstrate important different properties and different biological responses. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes (<i>a</i> ) the oncogenic potential of CrkL <i>versus</i> the absence of this potential in CrkII overexpressing cell lines, (<i>b</i> ) the inhibition of IGF-I-dependent cell cycle progression by overexpression of CrkII, and (<i>c</i> ) the differential regulation of the phosphorylation status of selective proteins in CrkII and CrkL overexpressing cell lines. In addition we demonstrate the specific association of CrkL and CrkII with the newly characterized IRS-4 protein, again in a differential manner. Whereas CrkL strongly interacts with IRS-4 via its SH2 and N-terminal SH3 domains, CrkII interacts only via its SH2 domain, possibly explaining the unstable nature of IRS-4-CrkII association. The results obtained allow us to propose a unique mechanism of CrkL and CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IGF-I stimulation. Thus these highly homologous proteins apparently possess structural features that allow for the differential association of each protein with different effector molecules, thereby activating different signaling pathways and resulting in unique biological roles of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2164304328,"The product of the Aspergillus nidulans cnxF gene was found by biochemical analysis of cnxF mutants to be involved in the conversion of precursor Z to molybdopterin. Mutants cnxF1242 and cnxF8 accumulate precursor Z, while the level of molybdopterin is undetectable. The DNA sequence of the cnxF gene was determined, and the inferred protein of 560 amino acids was found to contain a central region (residues around 157 to 396) similar in sequence to the prokaryotic proteins MoeB, which is thought to encode molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase, ThiF, required for thiamine biosynthesis, and HesA, involved in heterocyst formation, as well as eukaryotic ubiquitin-activating protein E1. Based on these similarities, a possible mechanism of action is discussed. Sequence comparisons indicate the presence of one and possibly two nucleotide binding motifs, Gly-X- Gly-X-X -Gly, as well as two metal binding Cys-X-X -Cys motifs in this central region of the CnxF protein. Seven in vivo generated A. nidulans cnxF mutants were found to have amino acid substitutions of conserved residues within this central region of similarity to molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase, indicating that these seven amino acids are essential and that this domain is crucial for function. Of these seven, the cnxF1285 mutation results in the replacement of Gly-178, the last glycine residue of theN -proximal Gly-X -Gly-X-X -Gly motif, indicating that this motif is essential. Mutation of the conserved Arg-208, also probably involved in nucleotide binding, leads to a loss-of-function phenotype in cnxF200 . Alteration of Cys-263, the only conserved Cys residue (apart from the metal binding motifs), in cnxF472 suggests this residue as a candidate for thioester formation between molybdopterin synthase and the sulfurylase. Substitution of Gly-160 in two independently isolated mutants, cnxF21 and cnxF24 , results in temperature-sensitive phenotypes and indicates that this residue is important in protein conformation. The C-terminal CnxF stretch (residues 397–560) shows substantial sequence conservation to a yeast hypothetical protein, Yhr1, such conservation between species suggesting that this region has function. Not inconsistent with this proposition is the observation that mutant cnxF8 results from loss of the 34 C-terminal residues of CnxF.

The molybdenum cofactor is a ubiquitous molecule found in most organisms from bacteria to humans and is required for activity by a number of molybdoenzymes, including nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase (also known as purine hydroxylase I) (1Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). The first biochemical studies, by Nason and co-workers (2Ketchum P.A. Cambier H.Y. Frazier W.A. Madanski C.H. Nason A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence and universality of the cofactor in bacterial cell-free extracts as well as acid-treated enzymes from diverse sources of biological material, such as cow milk or fowl liver, was suggested by their ability to reconstitute holo -nitrate reductase after mixing that source with nit-1 crude extracts. Later, Garrett and Cove (5Garrett R.G. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 147: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) predicted the presence of the cofactor, using a similar approach, in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans . Direct chemical studies by Rajagopalan (Refs. 1Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar and 6Rajagopalan K.V. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 215-289PubMed Google Scholar, and articles therein) suggested that the molybdenum cofactor of liver sulfite oxidase consists of a novel pterin called molybdopterin linked by its 6-alkyl side chain to a dithiolene group which coordinates molybdenum. Further biochemical and genetic work carried out in the prokaryote Escherichia coli has provided valuable information regarding the events that take place leading to the biosynthesis of a prokaryotic molybdenum cofactor variant, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (reviewed in Refs. 1Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar and 7Hinton S.M. Dean D. Crit. Rev. Ind. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The proposed structure of the molybdenum cofactor and intermediates and their biosynthesis from a guanosine derivative are summarized in Fig.1. Even earlier than the biochemical work, genetic studies of molybdenum cofactor synthesis had been initiated by Cove and Pateman (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Pateman et al . (9Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Using the fungus A. nidulans , they isolated mutants resistant to chlorate, an analogue of nitrate toxic to wild-type cells. One particular class of chlorate-resistant mutants was unable to utilize either nitrate or purines such as adenine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine as sole sources of nitrogen. This inability to grow on nitrate and hypoxanthine was found to be due to the concomitant diminution of nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase activities. Cove and Pateman (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) astutely suggested that such mutants were defective in the synthesis of a cofactor common to both nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase and designated the mutants cnx (common component fornitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase). Five cnx loci (namely cnxABC , cnxE ,cnxF , cnxG, and cnxH ) were identified (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). With the exception of the complex cnxABC locus that is involved in the first section of the pathway (Fig. 1), namely the biosynthesis of the pterin precursor Z from a guanosine derivative (10Unkles S.E. Smith J. Kana'n G.J.M. Millar L.J. Heck I.S. Boxer D.H. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28381-28389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), little or no information is available to suggest the function of cnx gene products or the nature of the pathway in eukaryotes. We report here the isolation of the A. nidulans cnxF gene, analysis of the wild-type and mutant sequences, levels of precursor Z and molybdopterin intermediates in cnxF mutants, and the likely nature of CnxF involvement in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. The wild-type strain used was G051 (biA1 ). Strains cnxF2, cnxF7, andcnxF8 were original mutants described by Cove and Pateman (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Pateman et al. (9Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Further cnxF mutants were selected in this study on the basis of resistance to chlorate (11Aberg B. Kungl Lantbrukshögskolans Ann. 1947; 15: 37-107Google Scholar) using chemically generated mutagenesis (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A.

In this regard,N -methyl-N ′-nitro-N -nitrosoguanidine was used to obtain mutant strains cnxF119, cnxF200 ,cnxF472 , cnxF480, cnxF1242 , cnxF1228 , and cnxF1285 while 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane was used forcnxF142 , cnxF1224 , and cnxF1193 . Chlorate was used at a concentration of 200 mm with proline as the sole source of nitrogen at 37 °C as described previously (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,9Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Assignment of mutations to cnx loci was carried out by the heterokaryotic complementation test, i.e. growth of pair-wise heterokaryons on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source against representative cnx mutants, cnxA9 ,cnxB11 , cnxC3 , cnxE3 ,cnxF7 , cnxG4, and cnxH4 (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Standard Aspergillus growth media and handling techniques were as described by Clutterbuck (12Clutterbuck A.J. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. I. Plenum Press, New York1974: 447-510Google Scholar). For transcript analysis, cultures were grown at 37 °C for 16 h in liquid minimal medium containing 10 mm sodium nitrate or 5 mmammonium tartrate as the sole nitrogen source (13Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for propagation of cosmids and for subcloning and propagation of plasmids in E. coli strain DH5α. Conditions employed here forA. nidulans Southern and Northern blot analysis were as described previously (14MacCabe A.P. Riach M.B.R. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence of the A. nidulans wild-type cnxF gene was determined on both strands of genomic and cDNA clones using a Sequenase Version 2 DNA sequencing kit according to manufacturer instructions (Amersham plc, UK). This sequence can be found under GenBankTM accession number AF055287. For primer extension analysis, mRNA was prepared from mycelium grown in minimal medium containing 10 mmsodium nitrate as the sole nitrogen source at 25 °C for 18 h, using a Quickprep mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia plc, UK). mRNA (2 mg) was hybridized with 5′ 32P end-labeled primer FP2 (5′-GTTGCGTTCGCACTCGC, position +383) at 52 °C for 1 h and reverse-transcribed using a Primer Extension System as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). The extension product was compared on a denaturing sequencing gel with a DNA sequence ladder prepared using the same end-labeled primer with pSTA508 as template. The A. nidulans cosmid library was purchased from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (Kansas City, KS). AnargB -based A. nidulans genomic bank cleaved byBam HI together with the autonomously replicating A. nidulans vector pHELP consisting of pUC18 and AMA1, an A. nidulans sequence with replication activity, were used to transform A. nidulans cells, basically the approach described by Gems and Clutterbuck (15Gems D.H. Clutterbuck A.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After transformation of the mutant cnxF7, nitrate-utilizing colonies were purified on selective medium (i.e. minimal medium containing nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen). Hybrid plasmid molecules, containing pHELP and argB withcnxF7 complementing sequences, created by in vivo recombination and/or DNA ligation events (15Gems D.H. Clutterbuck A.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were isolated by conventional A. nidulans DNA extraction procedures and transferred or “rescued” by transforming E. coli DH5α cells and selecting for ampicillin resistance. Such plasmids were then analyzed by standard recombinant DNA procedures. Positive identification of clones was achieved by reintroducing the isolated hybrid plasmid into the A. nidulans cnxF7 mutant with the successful restoration of wild-type growth with nitrate. Genomic DNA was prepared from mycelia grown in liquid culture for 16–18 h at 25 °C using a Nucleon BACC2 Kit (Scotlab Ltd, UK). DNA was cleaved with Eco RI, and around 100 ng was amplified using 2.5 units/ml Dynazyme (Flowgen) or 2.5 units/ml Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μm each primer, and 100 μm dNTPs. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 50 s for 1 cycle followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 50 s. The entirecnxF coding region was amplified in three overlapping sections using primers FP1 and FP2 (5′-ACCCAGTATTGTTGGTA and 5′-GTTGCGTTCGCACTCGC, positions –321 to +383), primers FP3 and FP4 (5′-CAACAGCACGGAGCTACAG and 5′-GTCTTGTCTCCAGGCGGCT, positions +200 to +1077), and primers FP5 and FP6 (5′-CGGCATCGGCACTACGGA and 5′-CCTTGTCCTCTGTTGAGC, positions +1005 to +1851). Following removal of PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kb, kilobase(s). primers and unincorporated nucleotides by the Glassmax DNA Isolation Spin Cartridge System (Life Technologies), the amplified DNA was sequenced directly in a single strand only by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI 373 A fluorescence sequencing apparatus and PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), with the PCR primers at a concentration of 10 μm. Additional 17-mer primers used for sequencing were FPS7 (+36), FPS8 (+542), and FPS9 (+1440). Sequences were compared with the wild-type using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.). Levels of form A dephosphorylated and compound Z, as a measure of molybdopterin and precursor Z, respectively, were determined by HPLC using the method described by Johnson and Rajagopalan (16Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications detailed in Unkles et al. (10Unkles S.E. Smith J. Kana'n G.J.M. Millar L.J. Heck I.S. Boxer D.H. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28381-28389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), following growth of the cells in minimal medium containing 10 mm proline plus 10 mm sodium nitrate as the only nitrogen sources for 16 h at 30 °C and 250 rpm. The data presented in Fig. 2 show the levels of precursor Z and molybdopterin, measured as their oxidized derivatives compound Z and form A dephosphorylated, respectively, in the wild-type and the mutantcnxF1242 (likely to be a null mutant as the mutation results in an intron boundary change, see below for details of the nucleotide lesion). The wild-type and mutant were grown with nitrate plus proline as the only nitrogen sources, a growth regime that permits the growth of cnxF mutants and yields appreciable levels of precursor Z and molybdopterin in wild-type cells. The level of precursor Z was observed to be markedly increased in the mutant cnxF1242 to a value 9-fold of that of the wild-type (Fig. 2 A ). In contrast, molybdopterin is undetectable in the mutant strain (Fig.2 B ). Similar levels of precursor Z and molybdopterin were observed in the cnxF8 mutant strain (the mutation resulting in the loss of the C-terminal 34 amino acid residues, see below) grown under the same conditions. 2I. S. Heck, unpublished data. These results suggest that the cnxF product is involved in the conversion of precursor Z to molybopterin. A 27-kb plasmid was isolated following co-transformation of the autonomously replicating A. nidulans plasmid pHELP with an A. nidulans argB -based genomic library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This recombinant plasmid repaired the phenotype of the cnxF7 mutation, i.e. restoration of growth on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. The size and the restriction endonuclease digestion pattern of the rescued plasmid 3S. E. Unkles, unpublished data. indicated thatin vivo recombination events had occurred between pHELP and the gene library. Therefore, to avoid potential problems of sequence rearrangement within the rescued plasmid, a genomic copy of thecnxF gene was isolated from an A. nidulans cosmid library. Hin dIII and Bam HI fragments of the rescued plasmid were first identified, which did not hybridize to pHELP or to argB, and these fragments were then used as hybridization probes to isolate eight cosmids from the library of chromosome 7 (18Brody H. Griffith J. Cuticchia A.J. Arnold J. Timberlake W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), on which the cnxF gene was shown previously to reside (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Three of these cosmids were subsequently shown to complement another cnxF mutation, i.e. cnxF8 , at high frequency. The complementing region of one of these (W17D04) was identified, by transformation of each of eight possible Bam HI-generated fragments, as a 4-kbBam HI fragment that was subcloned into pUC13 and designated pSTA508. This recombinant vector complemented the cnxF8 mutation and was used as a template for DNA sequence determination. A unique open reading frame encodes a protein of 560 amino acid residues (Fig. 3). Since no N-terminal data is available for the CnxF protein, we can only speculate as to the identity of the translational initiation codon. However, this ATG (nucleotide position +1) is the first in-frame ATG downstream from a major transcriptional start point that has been mapped at around 80 base pairs upstream. 4M. V. C. L. Appleyard, unpublished data. Comparison of the DNA sequence of genomic and an RT-PCR product, generated using primers FP3 and FP4,3 allowed the identification of two typical short fungal introns (86 and 62 base pairs) (19Gurr S.J. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eukaryotic Microbes. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 93-139Google Scholar) interrupting the putative CnxF protein coding region. Comparisons to the SwissProt protein data base using Blastp (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70338) Google Scholar) showed that fungal CnxF shares considerable similarity with amino acid sequences belonging to an E. coli enzyme encoded by the moeB gene (21Nohno T. Kasai Y. Saito T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4097-4102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has also been shown to be required for the conversion of precursor Z to molybdopterin (22Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears to be involved in sulfur transfer and was recently termed molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase although the mechanisms and substrates are poorly defined (1Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). The A. nidulans CnxF protein, at 560 residues, is much larger than the 249 residues of MoeB, the CnxF protein having a 150-residue extension at the N-terminus and an amino acid extension of 161 residues to the C-terminus relative to MoeB. The relevant section (residues 157 to 396) of CnxF homology with E. coli MoeB is presented in Fig. 4 A . Inspection of this section of the CnxF sequence reveals the presence of two potential nucleotide binding Gly-rich motifs (Gly-X -Gly-X-X -Gly) starting at residue positions 173 and 189. Comparative analysis of this region also shows substantial similarity with a priori functionally unrelated proteins containing this Gly motif, in particular E. coli ThiF, required in the synthesis of thiamine (24Van der Horn P.B. Backstrom A.D. Stewart V. Begley T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and HesA, involved in heterocyst formation in the cyanobacterium, Anabaena (25Borthakur D. Basche M. Buikema W.J. Borthakur P.B. Haselkorn R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, CnxF in common with MoeB (1Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar) shares up to 36% identity with the yeast (Fig. 4 B ), plant, and human ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 (Uba1), a protein which also harbors the Gly-containing catalytic domain for nucleotide binding (26McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Gly-rich motifs of other, and functionally unrelated, nucleotide binding proteins often have associated with them several amino acid residues which are thought to be important for nucleotide binding (27Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,28Bragg P.D. Glavas N.A. Hou C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Certain of these residues are also associated with the first Gly-rich sequence of CnxF, shown boxed in Fig. 4,A and B . These include a stretch of hydrophobic residues following the first Gly-rich motif encompassing a highly conserved Ala at position 186 in CnxF (conserved in MoeB, ThiF, HesA, and Uba1), a negatively charged Asp residue at position 197 (conserved in MoeB and ThiF), and a basic Arg residue at position 208 (conserved in MoeB, ThiF, HesA, and Uba1). The second Gly-X -Gly-X-X -Gly motif of CnxF (boxed in Fig. 4, A and B ) is not conserved in MoeB, ThiF, or HesA but is present in Uba1 (Fig. 4 B ). However, this second motif does not appear to have those residues, conserved in equivalent positions, which are found in association with the first Gly-rich sequence. As well as the Gly-X -Gly-X-X -Gly motif, there is an arrangement of conserved Cys residues resembling a metal-binding motif toward the C-terminal end of this central region of CnxF. These Cys-X-X -Cys pairs of Cys residues (boxed in Fig.4, A and B ) at positions 314 and 317 and positions 393 and 396 are also found in equivalent positions relative to the nucleotide binding motif in MoeB, ThiF, and HesA (Fig.4 A ), but not Uba1, Fig. 4 B ). No significant sequence similarity was observed between the 150-residue N-terminal or the 161-residue C-terminal extension of CnxF and otherE. coli proteins, including those required for the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. Similarly, comparison of the N- and C-terminal amino acid extensions with the SwissProt data base yields little illuminating information as to their potential function. Limited similarity of the 161 C-terminal residues was observed to a eukaryotic enzyme, rhodanese, a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase that is probably involved in formation of iron-sulfur complexes and cyanide detoxification (29Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, none of the apparently conserved residues was associated with the known active site of rhodanese, and more stringent analysis using GCG Bestfit indicated that the similarity is unlikely to be significant. There is high similarity of CnxF to hypothetical proteins recognized from genome sequencing. These include the 440 residue Yhr1 and the 401 residue YabA proteins from the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe , respectively, which possess maximum similarity (54 and 51% identical, respectively) to the central portion of CnxF, containing both possible Gly-X -Gly-X-X -Gly motifs and both Cys-X-X -Cys pairs in equivalent positions. Unlike MoeB, ThiF, HesA, and Uba1, similarity of the yeast proteins extends to the CnxF C-terminus with 33 and 34% identity to the S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4 C ) and S. pombe (not shown) proteins, respectively. At the N-terminus, CnxF is at least 100 residues longer than the yeast proteins and no striking similarity is seen except in a small stretch of 18 residues where 13 are identical in Yhr1 and 9 in YabA. From several hundredcnx mutants isolated on the basis of chlorate resistance at 37 °C and determined by lack of growth on nitrate or hypoxanthine as sole nitrogen source, ten in this study were found to becnxF mutants after complementation in heterokaryons resulting in growth on nitrate as sole nitrogen source (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nine of these (cnxF119, cnxF200, cnxF472, cnxF480, cnxF1193, cnxF1224, cnxF1228, cnxF1242, andcnxF1285 ) were found to be temperature non-conditional,i.e. were unable to grow on either sole nitrogen source and were chlorate-resistant at the two temperatures tested (25 and 37 °C). One mutant, cnxF142 , failed to grow on nitrate or hypoxanthine at both temperatures, was fully chlorate-resistant at 37 °C, but showed almost wild-type sensitivity at 25 °C. In addition, five mutants (cnxF2, cnxF7, cnxF8, cnxF21, andcnxF24 ) originally isolated by Pateman and Cove (8Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were checked again phenotypically. The mutants cnxF2, cnxF7 , and cnxF8 failed to grow on nitrate or hypoxanthine and were resistant to chlorate at both temperatures as expected from the reported work. The two reported temperature-sensitive mutants, cnxF21 and cnxF24 , while growing significantly better on nitrate and showing sensitivity to chlorate at the permissive temperature, i.e. 25 °C as expected (30MacDonald D.W. Cove D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), completely failed to grow on hypoxanthine as the nitrogen source at the permissive temperature. Both mutants showed the expected phenotype at 37 °C, i.e. failure to grow on nitrate or hypoxanthine and resistance to chlorate. It was also noted that there were marked differences in growth and conidiation between cnxF21 andcnxF24 on complete medium. Of the 15 mutations described above, 7 resulted from amino acid substitutions, the positions of which are shown in Fig.4 A . Four mutations were found to change highly conserved Gly residues and included the three with temperature-sensitive phenotypes—both cnxF21 and cnxF24 result in the same alteration of Gly-160 to Asp while in cnxF142, residue Gly-342 is converted to Ser. The fourth, a non-conditional mutation, namely cnxF1285 , was found to alter Gly-178 to Asp, the last Gly residue of the N-proximal Gly-X -Gly-X-X -Gly"
https://openalex.org/W2032130336,"Abstract Arginine transport is important for a number of biological processes in vertebrates, and its transport may be rate-limiting for the production of nitric oxide. The majority ofl-Arg transport is mediated by System y+, although several other carriers have been kinetically defined. System y+ cationic amino acid transport is mediated by proteins encoded by a family of genes, Cat1, Cat2, andCat3. High affinity l-arginine transport was investigated in embryonic fibroblast cells derived fromCat1 knockout mice that lack functional Cat1. Both wild type and knockout cells transport arginine with comparableK m and V max. However, the apparent affinity for lysine transport was 2.4 times lower inCat1 −/− cells when compared with wild type cells, a property characteristic of Cat3-mediated transport. Northern analysis-documented Cat2 mRNA increased 2-fold, whereasCat3 mRNA levels increased 11-fold inCat1 −/− relative toCat1 +/+ cells. The low affinityCat2a mRNA was not detectably expressed in these cells. Even though Cat3 expression is normally limited to adult brain, there was a large increase in the amount of Cat3 protein present at the plasma membrane of Cat1 −/− embryonic fibroblast cells. These results suggest that Cat3 compensates for the loss of functional Cat1 in cells derived from Cat1 knockout mice and mediates the majority of high affinity arginine transport."

However, positive regulation by 1α-25-(OH)2D3 of AP-1 transcriptional activity in osteoblastic cells has not been demonstrated in detail. Therefore, it is of interest to explore the possibility of 1α-25-(OH)2D3 positive regulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity via “genomic” or “nongenomic” action. In this regard, we investigated in the present study the regulation by 1α-25-(OH)2D3 of TGF-β1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. As a result, we demonstrated the presence of 1α-25-(OH)2D3synergism toward TGF-β1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity via genomic action. This demonstration suggests the presence of a novel positive regulation by 1α-25-(OH)2D3 of AP-1 transcriptional activity in osteoblastic cells via the VDR-dependent pathway (genomic action). Human recombinant TGF-β1 was purified to homogeneity (>98.9%, determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis: King Brewer, Kakogawa, Japan). 1α-25-(OH)2D3, 24,25-(OH)2D3, and 22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (OCT) were kindly provided by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). α-MEM was obtained from Flow Laboratories (McLean, VA). FCS was from HyClone (Logan, UT). 5′-[α-32P]dCTP megaprime DNA labeling system and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo, Japan). 5′-[α-32P]UTP and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from NEN Life Science Products. Clonal osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells derived from C57BL/6 mouse calvaria were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS in plastic dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in air and subcultured every 3 days as described previously (8Takeshita A.

The cells (3 × 105 cells) were cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS in 90-mm plastic dishes until nearly confluent. Then the cells were washed, incubated for 24 h in serum-free α-MEM, and subsequently treated for the desired periods in serum-free α-MEM with or without test samples at various concentrations. Total cellular RNA was extracted by the guanidine isothiocyanate procedure (39Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

After hybridization, the membranes were washed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. β-Actin was used as an internal standard for quantification of total RNA in each lane of the gel. This assay was performed according to the method of Groudine et al . (40Groudine M. Peretz M. Weitraub H. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (5 × 107 cells) were cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS in 15-cm plastic dishes until nearly confluent. Then the cells were washed and incubated for 24 h in serum-free α-MEM. In addition, the cells were next treated or not for 24 h with 1α-25-(OH)2D3 and then for 40 min with TGF-β1, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged. Subsequently, the cell pellet was suspended in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) after which the nuclei were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 15 min. Transcription initiated in intact cells was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5′-[α-32P]UTP, and the RNA was then isolated and hybridized to slot-blotted cDNA probes (5 μg/slot). Blots were hybridized for 72 h and autoradiographed for 3 days. β-Actin gene was utilized as an internal standard. Confluent monolayers in 15-cm diameter dishes were treated with test samples as indicated in the figure legends, and then their nuclei were isolated as described above, and extracts of them were prepared as described previously (8Takeshita A.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). This assay was carried out as described previously (8Takeshita A. Chen Y. Watanabe A. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J.

Binding reactions were performed for 20 min on ice with 5 μg of nuclear protein of 20 μl of binding buffer (2 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 8 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)) containing 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide in the absence or presence of nonlabeled oligonucleotide. Poly(dI-dC) and nuclear extract were first incubated at 4 °C for 10 min before addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. 30-Mer double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the -TGACTCA- sequence (Oncogene Science, Inc., Manhasset, NY) of the AP-1 binding site were end-labeled by the oligonucleotide 5′-end-labeling [γ-32P]ATP method. Reaction mixtures for the binding were incubated for 15 min at room temperature after addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was used as the competitor. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on native 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE buffer (22 mmTris, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). Gels were vacuumed, dried, and exposed to Kodak x-ray film at −70 °C. The plasmid pTRE-TK-CAT was constructed by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the -TGACTCA- motif withHin dIII-Xba I sites into the corresponding sites of pTK-CAT, which contains the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter enhancer region located upstream of the CAT gene. The pGL-TK used also contains the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter enhancer region, but it is located upstream of the luciferase gene, and this plasmid was made from a pGL3-Enhancer Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). pSG-VDR is a rat VDR expression vector. This assay was performed according to the method of Felgner et al . (44Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsem M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells (1 × 106 cells) were inoculated in 5-cm diameter dishes and incubated for 12 h in 10% FCS containing α-MEM. Then the cells were washed 3 times with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), transfected with a total of 7 μg of DNA by use of 10 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubated for 6 h in serum-free Opti-MEM. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmid, and the expression vector for the nuclear receptor (4 μg of each expression vector) was used. The assay was performed in the presence of 1 μg of pGL-TK, a luciferase expression plasmid, used as an internal control to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. Bluescribe M13+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a carrier to adjust the total amount of DNA. The cells were washed three times after the transfection, and 1α-25-(OH)2D3 at 10−8m or its analogs at 10−8m in serum-free α-MEM was then added. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were treated for 6 h with TGF-β1. The cellular extracts were prepared by use of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) and subjected to the CAT assay after normalizing luciferase activity. CAT activity was determined by autoradiography of thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates following completion of the CAT reaction using the appropriate concentration ofd-threo -[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Japan) as described previously (46Gorman C.M.

VDR antisense (5′-GCT GGC TGC CAT TGC CTC-3′) phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide was synthesized and purified as described previously (8Takeshita A. Chen Y. Watanabe A. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J.

Also, the corresponding sense oligonucleotide was prepared and used as a control. We (8Takeshita A. Chen Y. Watanabe A. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J.

Since AP-1 typically appeared when the cells were treated for 3 h with TGF-β1 at 1 ng/ml, in this study we investigated the regulatory action of 1α-25-(OH)2D3 on TGF-β1-induced AP-1 activity in the cells under these experimental conditions. First, we examined the effect of 1α-25-(OH)2D3 on TGF-β1-induced expression of the c-jun and c-fos genes in the cells. The cells were treated or not with TGF-β1 at 1 ng/ml before the vitamin D3 was added to the cell cultures. As shown in Fig.1 A ,1α-25-(OH)2D3 stimulated synergistically TGF-β1-induced expression of the c-jun gene in the cells. The synergistic action was observed at a physiological concentration (10−10m) of the hormone. However, such action was not observed in the expression of the cytokine-induced c-fos gene in the cells. Also, the synergistic effect of 1α-25-(OH)2D3 on the expression of the c-jun gene in the cells was observed even when the hormone pretreatment time was only 1 h before the cells were incubated with TGF-β1 and tended to be pretreatment time-dependent (Fig. 1 B ). Next we examined, using the run-on assay, whether or not the 1α-25-(OH)2D3synergistic action toward TGF-β1-induced expression of the c-jun gene in the cells operates at the transcriptional level. The cells were pretreated or not for 24 h with 1α-25-(OH)2D3 at 10−8m and then were treated or not for 1 h with TGF-β1 at 1 ng/ml. Thereafter, the run-on assay was performed using nuclei isolated from the cells. Fig. 2,A and B , shows that 1α-25-(OH)2D3 clearly stimulated the transcriptional activity of the TGF-β1-induced c-jun gene. These results indicate the synergistic action of 1α-25-(OH)2D3 at the transcriptional level for TGF-β1-induced expression of c-jun gene in the cells. AP-1 is a heterodimer of FOS and JUN proteins and binds to the TRE consensus sequence (48Verma I.M. Ransone L.J. Visvader J. Sassone-Corsi P. Lamph W.W. CIBA Found. Symp. 1990; 150: 128-137PubMed Google Scholar). Synergistic stimulation by 1α-25-(OH)2D3 of TGF-β1-induced expression of the c-jun gene in the cells suggested to us that the hormone may remarkably increase AP-1 binding to TRE in the cytokine-treated cells. Therefore, we examined this point by the gel mobility shift assay. As we expected, and as shown in Fig.3,1α-25-(OH)2D3 caused a synergistic increase in AP-1 binding to TRE in the TGF-β1-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. The stimulated binding was completely inhibited by the unlabeled oligonucleotide containing TRE (data not shown). In addition, we explored whether 1α-25-(OH)2D3 is able, moreover, to stimulate TGF-β1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity in the cells. We investigated this possibility by employing the transient CAT assay on cells transfected with plasmids containing with TRE-TK-CAT reporter gene (pTRE-TK-CAT). As shown in Fig.4, A and B ,1α-25-(OH)2D3 pretreatment clearly stimulated TGF-β1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity in the cells. No CAT activity was observed in the cells transfected with the TK-CAT reporter plasmid (pTK-CAT). Several recent studies (27Lieberherr M. J. Biol.

Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether the synergistic action of 1α-25-(OH)2D3 toward AP-1 transcriptional activity in TGF-β1-treated cells was VDR-dependent or -independent. In this regard, some studies (34Inoue M. Masakiya W. Wakao R. Gan N. Tawata M. Nishii Y. Onaya T. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 49Okano T. Tsugawa N. Masuda S. Takeuchi A. Kobayasi T. Nishii Y. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1989; 35: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have shown that OCT, a 1α-25-(OH)2D3derivative, has a high affinity for VDR and that its biological activity is generated via the VDR-dependent (genomic) pathway. In contrast, 24,25-(OH)2D3 is an analog that has very low affinity for VDR (29Yukihiro S. Posner G.H. Guggino S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23889-23893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Okano T. Tsugawa N. Masuda S. Takeuchi A. Kobayasi T. Nishii Y. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1989; 35: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, using these two analogs, we examined their effect on TGF-β1-induced expression of the c-jun gene in the cells. And also we explored whether the synergistic action of 1α-25-(OH)2D3 toward the cytokine-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity in the cells was VDR-dependent or -independent. Fig. 5 A shows the results of a Northern blot assay, in which OCT synergistically stimulated the cytokine-induced expression of the c-jun gene in the cells. However, such a synergistic effect was not observed in 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells. These data suggest the possibility that 1α-25-(OH)2D3 may stimulate AP-1 transcriptional activity in TGF-β1-treated cells via VDR action. Fig. 5 B supports strongly this possibility, because OCT stimulated the AP-1 transcriptional activity of CAT to the same extent as 1α-25-(OH)2D3, although such effect was not detected in 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells. In the CAT assay with the TK-CAT reporter plasmid (pTK-CAT), neither 1α-25-(OH)2D3 nor 1α-25-(OH)2D3 derivatives were stimulatory (data not shown). These results clearly suggest that 1α-25-(OH)2D3 pretreatment stimulated TGF-β1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity in MC3T3-E1 cells in a VDR-dependent manner. To ensure that 1α-25-(OH)2D3synergy toward TGF-β1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity in the cells is mediated through VDR, it is significant to understand the precise role of VDR in the hormone synergy toward c-jun gene expression in the cells. Therefore, we explored using a VDR expression vector (pSG-VDR) the functional role of endogenous VDR in this synergy. The cells were transfected with pSG-VDR or control vector pSG-5 and then pretreated or not with 1α-25-(OH)2D3. Subsequently, the cells were treated or not with TGF-β1, and c-jun gene expression was analyzed by the Northern blot assay. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B , 1α-25-(OH)2D3 markedly stimulated TGF-β1-induced expression of the c-jun gene in pSG-VDR-transfected cells when the gene expression was compared with that of the control and pSG-5 vector-transfected cells. These results confirm the functional role of endogenous VDR in 1α-25-(OH)2D3 synergy in TGF-β1-induced expression of"
https://openalex.org/W2018267898,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been reported to interact with glutathione andS -hexylglutathione and to possess glutathioneS -transferase activity. However, contrary to these reports, a recent NMR study concluded that MIF shows no affinity for glutathione. Re-examination of the glutathione-MIF interactions indicates that the reported increase in fluorescence upon addition of glutathione is because of pH-induced unfolding of the protein and not to any direct interactions. Circular dichroism shows that MIF remains folded from pH 4.5–7.5 but is 50% unfolded at pH 2.9 ± 0.2. The reported increase in fluorescence can be achieved by acid titration. Under strongly buffered conditions, no fluorescence change is observed upon addition of glutathione. In contrast to the results with glutathione, MIF binds S -hexylglutathione with aK d of 2.5 ± 0.6 mm. Using NMR spectroscopy, a binding site which clusters around the N-terminal proline was identified. These data indicate that the binding site forS -hexylglutathione is the same as the catalytic site for the dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF. Consequently, the binding of S -hexylglutathione as well as hexanethiol inhibits this catalytic activity.

Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). MIF is the only cytokine known to be induced by glucocorticoids and to regulate glucocorticoid activity.MIF is also expressed in cells not normally associated with immune or inflammatory reactions and therefore may have additional activities. MIF is found in testes, ovaries, and early embryos, suggesting a possible role in development (10Meinhardt A. Bacher M. McFarlane J.R. Metz C.N. Seitz J. Hedger M.P. DeKretser D.M. Bucala R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5090-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki H. Kanagawa H. Nishihira J. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 51: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is also found in the islet cells of the pancreas where it plays a role in regulating insulin secretion (12Waeber G. Roduit R. Haefliger J-A. Bonny C. Thompson N. Thorens B. Temler E. Meinhardt A. Bacher M. Metz C. Nicod P. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4782-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). And perhaps most importantly, MIF has been detected in the corticotropic cells of the anterior pituitary where it may mediate neural-immune system communication (9Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar).In addition to the proinflammatory activities, MIF has also been reported to possess three catalytic activities:d-dopachrome tautomerase, hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase, and glutathione S -transferase (GST) (13Rosengren E. Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Blocki F. Schlievert P. Wackett L. Nature. 1992; 360: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).d-Dopachrome tautomerase, a nonphysiological reaction which involves the conversion of d-dopachrome methyl ester to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxymethylester, was discovered fortuitously during the study of melanin biosynthesis (13Rosengren E. Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase, which catalyzes the keto-enol isomerization of both p- hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, was discovered in an attempt to identify natural ligands for MIF (14Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Glutathione S -transferase activity was identified when a purification scheme intended to isolate novel glutathione S -transferases yielded a protein from rat liver that was identified as a homologue of MIF (15Blocki F. Schlievert P. Wackett L. Nature. 1992; 360: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This protein had 25 of 26 residues identical with the amino terminus of MIF and was reported to catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to 1,2-epoxy-3-(p -nitrophenoxy) propane (EPNP) (15Blocki F. Schlievert P. Wackett L. Nature. 1992; 360: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The glutathione S -transferase activity and sequence identity at the N terminus led to the speculation that MIF functioned as a GST. This view was supported by fluorescence titration experiments which showed that human MIF binds glutathione with a dissociation constant that is within the physiological concentration of glutathione (16Nishihira J. Kuriyama T. Nishino H. Ishibashi T. Sakai M. Nishi S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 841-850PubMed Google Scholar).The potential interaction between MIF and glutathione was intriguing because both of these molecules have important functions in the immune system (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D. Schenk H. Eck H.-P. Roth S. Gmunder H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 18Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). The release of MIF and glutathione by lipopolysaccharide (19Irita K. Okabe H. Koga A. Kurosawa K. Tagawa K. Yamakawa M. Yoshitake J. Takahasi S. Circ. Shock. 1994; 42: 115-120PubMed Google Scholar), the proinflammatory effects of MIF and glutathione metabolites, and the reported molecular interactions between these two molecules invited speculation that their mechanism of action was linked. However, a number of reports argued against any role for glutathione in MIF activity (20Pearson W.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Sun H.W. Bernhagen J. Bucala R. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 22Muhlhahn P. Bernhagen J. Czisch M. Georgescu J. Renner C. Ross A. Bucala R. Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To resolve the discrepancy in the literature with regard to glutathione binding to MIF, we reexamined glutathione-MIF interactions. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism, we find that titration of MIF with unbuffered glutathione induces a change in tryptophan fluorescence due to pH-induced denaturation of MIF rather than a direct interaction with glutathione as previously reported. This is in agreement with a recent NMR study that was unable to detect glutathione binding (22Muhlhahn P. Bernhagen J. Czisch M. Georgescu J. Renner C. Ross A. Bucala R. Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, we show that MIF displays affinity for S -hexylglutathione. Using NMR spectroscopy and enzymatic assays, we were able to quantify this affinity, locate the binding site, and determine thatS -hexylglutathione inhibits MIF dopachrome tautomerase activity. We used hexanethiol to confirm that the basis of this inhibition is the S -hexyl moiety.DISCUSSIONThe report that glutathione interacted with MIF was intriguing in light of the increased levels of these molecules at inflammatory sites (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D. Schenk H. Eck H.-P. Roth S. Gmunder H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Glutathione serves two general roles in cells: (1David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) it contributes to the redox state of the cell, and (2Bloom B.R. Bennett B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) it is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics via conjugation by glutathioneS -transferases. In addition, glutathione has other roles in the immune system. Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels are important for NFκB activation and subsequent transcription of several immunologically important genes such as TNFα and the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D. Schenk H. Eck H.-P. Roth S. Gmunder H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In leukotriene biosynthesis, glutathione is conjugated to LTA4 by leukotriene C4 synthase to produce LTC4 (18Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). LTC4 and its metabolites are released from lung tissue of asthma patients upon stimulation by allergens and induces proinflammatory reactions (18Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tempting to speculate that the effects of glutathione in the immune system were mediated by MIF.MIF was also proposed to be structurally related to the glutathioneS -transferase family of proteins based on several observations. First, MIF shares 28% sequence identity at the amino terminus with μ-class glutathione S -transferases (15Blocki F. Schlievert P. Wackett L. Nature. 1992; 360: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of glutathione S -transferases plays a major role in glutathione binding. Second, polyclonal antibodies to MIF cross react with θ class glutathione S -transferases (25Blocki F.A. Ellis L.B. Wackett L.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Third, glutathione S -transferases have a conserved hydroxyl group from a serine or tyrosine at the active site, which is implicated in glutathione deprotonation. MIF contains an invariant threonine at the equivalent position. Finally, MIF can be purified byS -hexylglutathione affinity chromatography, a method that is routinely used to purify glutathione S -transferases. These observations led to the suggestion that MIF was a distant ancestor of glutathione S -transferases that linked the immune and detoxifying systems (25Blocki F.A. Ellis L.B. Wackett L.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).However, several reports argued against any role for glutathione in MIF activity. Sequence analysis showed a statistically insignificant similarity between MIF and glutathione S -transferases along the length of the entire polypeptide (20Pearson W.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The crystal structure for human MIF revealed similar secondary structure between MIF and GST along the first thirty residues, but no similarity in the tertiary or quaternary structure for these two proteins (21Sun H.W. Bernhagen J. Bucala R. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). NMR experiments contradicted the results of earlier fluorescence and catalytic studies and showed that the interaction between glutathione and MIF was weak (22Muhlhahn P. Bernhagen J. Czisch M. Georgescu J. Renner C. Ross A. Bucala R. Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, we were unable to reproduce the GST activity of MIF using EPNP as a substrate (data not shown) and have shown that the reported interactions between MIF and glutathione are artifacts of the experimental method. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy are common methods used to measure protein conformational changes upon ligand binding. The fluorescence spectra of MIF when glutathione was added showed an increase in fluorescence with a shift in emission from 344 to 350 nm. This type of shift is often seen when proteins become unfolded. Creatine kinase is an example of a protein that, like MIF, exhibits an increase in fluorescence and a shift of the emission maximum upon protein unfolding (26Raimbault C. Couthon F. Vial C. Buchet R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of MIF, the tryptophan is present on the C-terminal loop which is involved in subunit interactions of the trimer. The fluorescence data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal loop of MIF undergoes a conformational change such as disruption in the subunit interface or random coil formation leading to a concomitant increase in tryptophan fluorescence. In addition to fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism is a sensitive method to assess large changes in protein conformation. Circular dichroism studies of MIF indicate increased unfolding as the pH is decreased from 4.5, with a stable conformation above pH 4.5. Based on these data, it is now evident that there is little, if any, binding of glutathione to MIF, consistent with results from a recent NMR report (22Muhlhahn P. Bernhagen J. Czisch M. Georgescu J. Renner C. Ross A. Bucala R. Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In contrast to the results with glutathione, MIF binds toS -hexylglutathione affinity resin and is specifically eluted with S -hexylglutathione (data not shown). In addition,S -hexylglutathione can inhibit MIF dopachrome tautomerase activity. The binding of S -hexylglutathione to MIF is due to the alkyl moiety as hexanethiol inhibits the tautomerase activity of MIF with an IC50 of 17.4 ± 4.9 μm. HSQC NMR experiments show that several MIF residues are perturbed upon addition of S -hexylglutathione. These residues map to a pocket surrounding the N-terminal proline on the three-dimensional structure of MIF (Fig. 5). This site consists of a hydrophobic region that can provide the binding interactions for the S -hexyl moiety. The structural similarity between this site and the active sites of the bacterial enzymes CHMI and OT, which both use an N-terminal proline as a catalytic base, indicates that the catalytic site of MIF is near the N-terminal proline. The designation of this region as an active site is consistent with inhibition of MIF dopachrome tautomerase activity by S -hexylglutathione and hexanethiol. Moreover, this site has been identified as the catalytic site for p- hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase activity (27Swope M. Sun H.W. Blake P. Lolis E. EMBO J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore appears that this site is a promiscuous binding site for hydrophobic small molecules. The concept of small molecules binding to cytokines is both novel and interesting. If this site is important for biological activity, our studies provide a lead compound for development of a specific high affinity inhibitor for MIF. Based on the importance of this cytokine in the immune response, the design of small molecule inhibitors of MIF may have therapeutic value. Macrophage migration inhibitory activity was first described in 1966 as a secretion product from activated T cells and has been associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions ever since (1David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar,2Bloom B.R. Bennett B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar).

MIF is released from these cells upon stimulation by a variety of proinflammatory stimuli such as TNFα, IFNγ, and lipopolysaccharide. Interestingly, MIF is also released by monocytes and T cells in response to physiological concentrations of glucocorticoids. Once released, it serves to counter-regulate the effects of glucocorticoids by overriding the inhibition of cytokine production by glucocorticoids (9Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). MIF is the only cytokine known to be induced by glucocorticoids and to regulate glucocorticoid activity. MIF is also expressed in cells not normally associated with immune or inflammatory reactions and therefore may have additional activities. MIF is found in testes, ovaries, and early embryos, suggesting a possible role in development (10Meinhardt A. Bacher M. McFarlane J.R. Metz C.N. Seitz J. Hedger M.P. DeKretser D.M. Bucala R.

It is also found in the islet cells of the pancreas where it plays a role in regulating insulin secretion (12Waeber G. Roduit R. Haefliger J-A. Bonny C. Thompson N. Thorens B. Temler E. Meinhardt A. Bacher M. Metz C. Nicod P. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4782-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). And perhaps most importantly, MIF has been detected in the corticotropic cells of the anterior pituitary where it may mediate neural-immune system communication (9Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In addition to the proinflammatory activities, MIF has also been reported to possess three catalytic activities:d-dopachrome tautomerase, hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase, and glutathione S -transferase (GST) (13Rosengren E. Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L.

Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase, which catalyzes the keto-enol isomerization of both p- hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, was discovered in an attempt to identify natural ligands for MIF (14Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Glutathione S -transferase activity was identified when a purification scheme intended to isolate novel glutathione S -transferases yielded a protein from rat liver that was identified as a homologue of MIF (15Blocki F. Schlievert P. Wackett L. Nature. 1992; 360: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This protein had 25 of 26 residues identical with the amino terminus of MIF and was reported to catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to 1,2-epoxy-3-(p -nitrophenoxy) propane (EPNP) (15Blocki F. Schlievert P. Wackett L. Nature. 1992; 360: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The glutathione S -transferase activity and sequence identity at the N terminus led to the speculation that MIF functioned as a GST. This view was supported by fluorescence titration experiments which showed that human MIF binds glutathione with a dissociation constant that is within the physiological concentration of glutathione (16Nishihira J. Kuriyama T. Nishino H. Ishibashi T. Sakai M. Nishi S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 841-850PubMed Google Scholar). The potential interaction between MIF and glutathione was intriguing because both of these molecules have important functions in the immune system (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D.

Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). The release of MIF and glutathione by lipopolysaccharide (19Irita K. Okabe H. Koga A. Kurosawa K. Tagawa K. Yamakawa M. Yoshitake J. Takahasi S. Circ. Shock. 1994; 42: 115-120PubMed Google Scholar), the proinflammatory effects of MIF and glutathione metabolites, and the reported molecular interactions between these two molecules invited speculation that their mechanism of action was linked. However, a number of reports argued against any role for glutathione in MIF activity (20Pearson W.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Sun H.W. Bernhagen J.

Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To resolve the discrepancy in the literature with regard to glutathione binding to MIF, we reexamined glutathione-MIF interactions. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism, we find that titration of MIF with unbuffered glutathione induces a change in tryptophan fluorescence due to pH-induced denaturation of MIF rather than a direct interaction with glutathione as previously reported. This is in agreement with a recent NMR study that was unable to detect glutathione binding (22Muhlhahn P. Bernhagen J. Czisch M. Georgescu J. Renner C. Ross A. Bucala R. Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, we show that MIF displays affinity for S -hexylglutathione. Using NMR spectroscopy and enzymatic assays, we were able to quantify this affinity, locate the binding site, and determine thatS -hexylglutathione inhibits MIF dopachrome tautomerase activity. We used hexanethiol to confirm that the basis of this inhibition is the S -hexyl moiety. DISCUSSIONThe report that glutathione interacted with MIF was intriguing in light of the increased levels of these molecules at inflammatory sites (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D. Schenk H. Eck H.-P. Roth S. Gmunder H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Glutathione serves two general roles in cells: (1David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) it contributes to the redox state of the cell, and (2Bloom B.R. Bennett B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) it is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics via conjugation by glutathioneS -transferases. In addition, glutathione has other roles in the immune system. Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels are important for NFκB activation and subsequent transcription of several immunologically important genes such as TNFα and the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D. Schenk H. Eck H.-P. Roth S. Gmunder H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In leukotriene biosynthesis, glutathione is conjugated to LTA4 by leukotriene C4 synthase to produce LTC4 (18Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). LTC4 and its metabolites are released from lung tissue of asthma patients upon stimulation by allergens and induces proinflammatory reactions (18Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar).

Moreover, we were unable to reproduce the GST activity of MIF using EPNP as a substrate (data not shown) and have shown that the reported interactions between MIF and glutathione are artifacts of the experimental method. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy are common methods used to measure protein conformational changes upon ligand binding. The fluorescence spectra of MIF when glutathione was added showed an increase in fluorescence with a shift in emission from 344 to 350 nm. This type of shift is often seen when proteins become unfolded. Creatine kinase is an example of a protein that, like MIF, exhibits an increase in fluorescence and a shift of the emission maximum upon protein unfolding (26Raimbault C. Couthon F. Vial C. Buchet R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of MIF, the tryptophan is present on the C-terminal loop which is involved in subunit interactions of the trimer. The fluorescence data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal loop of MIF undergoes a conformational change such as disruption in the subunit interface or random coil formation leading to a concomitant increase in tryptophan fluorescence. In addition to fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism is a sensitive method to assess large changes in protein conformation. Circular dichroism studies of MIF indicate increased unfolding as the pH is decreased from 4.5, with a stable conformation above pH 4.5. Based on these data, it is now evident that there is little, if any, binding of glutathione to MIF, consistent with results from a recent NMR report (22Muhlhahn P. Bernhagen J. Czisch M. Georgescu J. Renner C. Ross A. Bucala R. Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In contrast to the results with glutathione, MIF binds toS -hexylglutathione affinity resin and is specifically eluted with S -hexylglutathione (data not shown). In addition,S -hexylglutathione can inhibit MIF dopachrome tautomerase activity. The binding of S -hexylglutathione to MIF is due to the alkyl moiety as hexanethiol inhibits the tautomerase activity of MIF with an IC50 of 17.4 ± 4.9 μm. HSQC NMR experiments show that several MIF residues are perturbed upon addition of S -hexylglutathione. These residues map to a pocket surrounding the N-terminal proline on the three-dimensional structure of MIF (Fig. 5). This site consists of a hydrophobic region that can provide the binding interactions for the S -hexyl moiety. The structural similarity between this site and the active sites of the bacterial enzymes CHMI and OT, which both use an N-terminal proline as a catalytic base, indicates that the catalytic site of MIF is near the N-terminal proline. The designation of this region as an active site is consistent with inhibition of MIF dopachrome tautomerase activity by S -hexylglutathione and hexanethiol. Moreover, this site has been identified as the catalytic site for p- hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase activity (27Swope M. Sun H.W. Blake P. Lolis E. EMBO J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore appears that this site is a promiscuous binding site for hydrophobic small molecules. The concept of small molecules binding to cytokines is both novel and interesting. If this site is important for biological activity, our studies provide a lead compound for development of a specific high affinity inhibitor for MIF. Based on the importance of this cytokine in the immune response, the design of small molecule inhibitors of MIF may have therapeutic value. The report that glutathione interacted with MIF was intriguing in light of the increased levels of these molecules at inflammatory sites (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D. Schenk H. Eck H.-P. Roth S. Gmunder H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Glutathione serves two general roles in cells: (1David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) it contributes to the redox state of the cell, and (2Bloom B.R. Bennett B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) it is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics via conjugation by glutathioneS -transferases. In addition, glutathione has other roles in the immune system. Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels are important for NFκB activation and subsequent transcription of several immunologically important genes such as TNFα and the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (17Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mihm S. Galter D. Schenk H. Eck H.-P. Roth S. Gmunder H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In leukotriene biosynthesis, glutathione is conjugated to LTA4 by leukotriene C4 synthase to produce LTC4 (18Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). LTC4 and its metabolites are released from lung tissue of asthma patients upon stimulation by allergens and induces proinflammatory reactions (18Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tempting to speculate that the effects of glutathione in the immune system were mediated by MIF. MIF was also proposed to be structurally related to the glutathioneS -transferase family of proteins based on several observations. First, MIF shares 28% sequence identity at the amino terminus with μ-class glutathione S -transferases (15Blocki F. Schlievert P. Wackett L. Nature. 1992; 360: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of glutathione S -transferases plays a major role in glutathione binding. Second, polyclonal antibodies to MIF cross react with θ class glutathione S -transferases (25Blocki F.A. Ellis L.B. Wackett L.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Third, glutathione S -transferases have a conserved hydroxyl group from a serine or tyrosine at the active site, which is implicated in glutathione deprotonation. MIF contains an invariant threonine at the equivalent position. Finally, MIF can be purified byS -hexylglutathione affinity chromatography, a method that is routinely used to purify glutathione S -transferases. These observations led to the suggestion that MIF was a distant ancestor of glutathione S -transferases that linked the immune and detoxifying systems (25Blocki F.A. Ellis L.B. Wackett L.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, several reports argued against any role for glutathione in MIF activity. Sequence analysis showed a statistically insignificant similarity between MIF and glutathione S -transferases along the length of the entire polypeptide (20Pearson W.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The crystal structure for human MIF revealed similar secondary structure between MIF and GST along the first thirty residues, but no similarity in the tertiary or quaternary structure for these two proteins (21Sun H.W. Bernhagen J. Bucala R. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). NMR experiments contradicted the results of earlier fluorescence and catalytic studies and showed that the interaction between glutathione and MIF was weak (22Muhlhahn P. Bernhagen J. Czisch M. Georgescu J. Renner C. Ross A. Bucala R. Holak T.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2055983197,"Monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of biogenic and xenobiotic amines. The oxidative step is coupled to the reduction of an obligatory cofactor, FAD, which is covalently linked to the apoenzyme at Cys397. Our previous studies identified two noncovalent flavin-binding regions in MAO B (residues 6–34 and 39–46) (Kwan, S.-W., Lewis, D. A., Zhou, B. P., and Abell, C. W. (1995) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 316, 385–391; Zhou, B. P., Lewis, D. A., Kwan, S.-W., Kirksey, T. J., and Abell, C. W. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 9526–9531). In these regions, Glu34 and Tyr44 were found to be required for the initial binding of FAD. By comparing sequences with enzymes in the oxidoreductase family, we now have found an additional FAD-binding site in MAO B (residues 222–227), which is highly conserved across species (human, bovine, and rat). This conserved sequence contains adjacent glycine and aspartate residues (Gly226 and Asp227). Based on the x-ray crystal structures of several oxidoreductases (Eggink, G., Engel, H., Vriend, G., Terpstra, P., and Witholt, B. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 212, 135–142; Van Driessche, G., Kol, M., Chen, Z.-W., Mathews, F. S., Meyer, T. E., Bartsch, R. G., Cusanovich, M. A., and Van Beeumen, J. J. (1996) Protein Sci. 5, 1753–1764), the Gly residue at the end of a β-strand facilitates a sharp turn and extends the β-carbonyl group of Asp to interact with the 3′-hydroxyl group of the ribityl chain of FAD. To assess the hypothesis that Gly226 and Asp227 are involved in FAD binding in MAO B, site-specific mutants that encode substitutions at these positions were prepared and expressed in mammalian COS-7 cells. Our results indicate that Gly226 and the β-carbonyl group of Asp227 are required for covalent flavinylation and catalytic activity of MAO B, but not for noncovalent binding of FAD. Our studies also reveal that mutagenesis at Glu34 and Tyr44 not only interferes with covalent flavinylation and catalytic activity of MAO B, but also with noncovalent binding of FAD. Based on these collective results, we propose that the coupling of FAD to the MAO B apoenzyme is a multistep process.

Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAOs 1The abbreviations used are: MAOs, monoamine oxidases; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A and B; EC 1.4.3.4) are the major enzymes in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues of mammals that catalyze the oxidative deamination of neuroactive and vasoactive amines (5Von Korff R.W. Singer T.P. Van Korff R.W. Murphy D.L. Monoamine Oxidase: Structure, Function, and Altered Functions. Academic Press, New York1979: 1-7Google Scholar). These isozymes are integral proteins of the outer mitochondrial membrane (6Greenawalt J.W. Schnaitman C. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and can be distinguished by differences in substrate and inhibitor preferences and in cell and tissue distribution (7Dostert P.L. Beneditti M.S. Tipton K.F. Med. Res. Rev. 1989; 9: 45-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Westlund K.N. Denney R.M. Kochersperger L.M. Rose R.M. Abell C.W.

Neurosci. 1985; 11: 2874-2881Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, comparison of their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences shows that MAOs A and B are distinct proteins with a high degree of sequence identity (12Bach A.W.J. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.-W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4934-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar,13Weyler W. Hsu Y.-P.P. Breakefield X.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 391-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Recent studies (14Tsugeno Y. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14033-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown that the substrate selectivity of MAOs A and B appears to be determined by a single amino acid residue (Phe208 in MAO A and Ile199 in MAO B). Oxidation of amines by MAO A or B is coupled to the reduction of FAD, an obligatory cofactor. MAO B contains one FAD molecule/subunit (15Weyler W. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which is covalently linked at Cys397 (12Bach A.W.J. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.-W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4934-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 16Kearney E.B. Salach J.I. Walker W.H. Seng R.L. Kenney W. Zeszotek K. Singer T.P. Eur. J.

Lee J.H. Abell C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although the precise steps required for flavinylation of MAO B remain unknown, it appears that FAD initially binds noncovalently to the consensus sequences near the amino terminus (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Kirksey T.J. Abell C.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9526-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and subsequently is covalently linked to Cys397(18Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since the MAOs are integral proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane, it has been difficult to obtain a crystal structure to identify the precise residues that constitute the active site and those that interact with FAD. However, we identified two regions in MAO B that are crucial for noncovalent FAD binding in our previous studies (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Kirksey T.J. Abell C.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9526-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One is a dinucleotide-binding site, which is located in the N-terminal region of MAO B (residues 6–34). This dinucleotide-binding site is observed in many flavoproteins with diverse functions and is thought to consist of a β1-α-β2 motif (19Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), in which the terminal glutamate (Glu34) interacts with the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety of FAD. Site-directed mutagenesis studies, which replaced Glu34 with alanine, aspartate, or glutamine, resulted in a dramatic loss of FAD coupling and, consequently, a corresponding loss of MAO B enzymatic activity (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,18Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A second FAD-binding region was found adjacent to the dinucleotide-binding motif in MAO B (residues 39–46 in human MAO B). This new region was recognized by comparing sequences in several reductase flavoproteins, including ferredoxin-NADP+reductase, whose three-dimensional structure has been solved (20Correll C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence contains a tyrosine residue (Tyr44), which is postulated to participate in FAD binding through Van der Waals contact with the isoalloxazine ring. We found that the aromatic ring of the tyrosine residue is essential for FAD binding and catalytic activity of MAO B (2Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Kirksey T.J. Abell C.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9526-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to the two adjacent FAD-binding regions on the N terminus and the covalent binding site near the C terminus, we found that MAO B contains a fourth FAD-binding site, which was recognized by sequence similarities in other flavoproteins (Fig.1) (3Eggink G. Engel H. Vriend G. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This fingerprint site was first found in the oxidoreductase family of flavoproteins by Eggink et al. (3Eggink G. Engel H. Vriend G. Terpstra P. Witholt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and has been recently described in several flavoproteins (4Van Driessche G. Kol M. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Meyer T.E. Bartsch R.G. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In those flavoproteins whose structure is known (Fig. 1), this fingerprint region consists of a β-strand followed by an invariant glycine residue that folds into a sharp turn to extend the next invariant aspartate residue into close proximity to the ribityl chain of FAD. The β-carbonyl group of this highly conserved aspartate forms a hydrogen bond with the 3′-hydroxyl group of the ribityl chain of FAD (21Schultz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This region is highly conserved in MAOs A and B across species (human, bovine, and rat), but the function of this region in MAOs A and B remains unknown. To test the hypothesis that these two residues are involved in FAD binding in human MAO B, we changed Gly226 to alanine (G226A) and Asp227 to glutamate (D227E), asparagine (D227N), or alanine (D227A) by site-directed mutagenesis and transiently expressed the cDNAs in COS-7 cells. The effects of these substitutions were assessed by enzymatic activity assays, quantitation of expression, covalent [14C]FAD coupling, and noncovalent [14C]FAD binding. Our results indicate that the putative sharp turn at Gly226 and the carbonyl group of Asp227 are required for covalent flavinylation and catalytic activity of MAO B, but not for noncovalent FAD binding. We also analyzed the ability of MAO B variants at Glu34 and Tyr44 to bind FAD noncovalently. This work, in conjunction with our previous studies (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Kirksey T.J. Abell C.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9526-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), reveals that the MAO B variants at Glu34 and Tyr44, which lose MAO B catalytic activity and the ability to couple FAD covalently, also cannot bind FAD noncovalently in dot-blot assays. Thus, it appears that the participation of Gly226 and Asp227 in MAO B flavinylation takes place after the initial noncovalent binding of FAD to the consensus sequences of MAO B near the amino terminus, but prior to covalent linkage to Cys397. In addition, we observed that changes at position 227 abolished recognition by the monoclonal antibody MAO B-1C2, indicating that Asp227 may constitute part of the epitope recognition site. [14C]FAD was synthesized by a modified method of Manstein and Pai (22Manstein D.J. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16169-16173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (18Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed by the method of Deng and Nickoloff (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) using a Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) as described previously (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Human MAO B cDNA cloned into the Eco RI site of the expression vector pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to construct MAO B mutants. The mutagenic primers and the corresponding amino acid changes are shown in Fig. 2. Gly at position 226 was replaced with Ala in the G226A variant, and Asp at position 227 was replaced with Glu (D227E), Asn (D227N), or Ala (D227A). For the purpose of screening, all mutagenic primers were designed to create a new restriction site without altering the coding sequence for any other amino acids. An Hpa I restriction site was introduced into a 29-mer selection primer to replace the onlyKpn I site in the vector. The mutant clones were screened for the presence of the new restriction site created by the mutagenic primer. The presence of the correct mutations in all mutant cDNAs was confirmed by double-stranded dideoxy-DNA sequencing (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant plasmid DNAs were purified through CsC1 gradients prior to transfection studies. Mammalian COS-7 cells used for MAO B expression were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Riboflavin-depleted COS-7 cells were generated by maintaining these cells in riboflavin-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for >100 days (18Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transient transfection by electroporation (25Zimmerman U. Vienken J. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 67: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) of wild-type or mutant MAO B cDNAs into COS-7 cells was carried out as described previously (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In experiments where covalent flavinylation or noncovalent FAD incorporation of wild-type or variant MAO B was studied, 20 μl of 0.8 mm[14C]FAD and 15 μg of MAO B cDNA were simultaneously electroporated into riboflavin-depleted COS-7 cells in riboflavin-free medium (2.5 × 106 cells/0.8 ml). Transfected cells were resuspended in 15 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/dialyzed fetal bovine serum (or riboflavin-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were harvested at 48 h and homogenized in a lysis solution (500 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0. Extraction of MAO B from each sample was carried out by adding Triton X-100 to a concentration of 0.25% and stirring for 50 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of samples containing wild-type or variant MAO B were determined using a Micro-BCA kit (Pierce). All samples were then adjusted to equal protein concentration. MAO B concentration was quantitated by ELISA with a goat polyclonal antibody to MAO B using a modification of the method of Yeomanson and Billett (26Yeomanson K.B. Billett E.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as described previously (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression levels of wild-type or variant MAO B were determined in duplicate for three separate experiments. MAO B activity was measured by a modification of the method of Wurtman and Axelrod (27Wurtman R.J. Axelrod J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1963; 12: 1439-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) as described previously (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activities of wild-type and MAO variants were determined in duplicate in three separate experiments. MAO B activity was expressed both as specific activity (nmol of benzylamine/min/mg of total protein) and as enzymatic activity (μmol of benzylamine/min/mg of MAO B). COS-7 cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant MAO B were homogenized in 300 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0. MAO B was extracted from the homogenate with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from each sample was collected after centrifugation at 1300 × g for 5 min, and all supernatants were adjusted to equal MAO B concentrations using ELISA. Supernatants (300 μl) were incubated with 10 μg of a goat anti-MAO B polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by further incubation with 50 μl of immobilized protein G-Sepharose beads for 3 h. The immunocomplexes composed of immobilized protein G-Sepharose, goat antibody, and wild-type MAO B or its variants were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 s and washed six times with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. For Western blotting and fluorography, the wild-type or variant MAO B proteins in the immunocomplexes were solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subsequently analyzed. For dot-blot assay, the wild-type or variant MAO B proteins were eluted from the immunocomplexes with 150 μl of 50 mm glycine, pH 3.0. After a brief spin for 20 s at room temperature, the supernatant was immediately neutralized by mixing with 20 μl of 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Elution and neutralization were repeated twice to ensure complete extraction of wild-type or variant MAO B proteins from the immunocomplexes. The eluents were combined for dot-blot assays. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with the MAO B-specific monoclonal antibody, MAO B-1C2 (10Denney R.M. Fritz R.R. Patel N.T. Abell C.W. Science. 1982; 215: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), as described previously (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated wild-type and variant MAO B enzymes were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed (7% acetic acid and 10% methanol) for 1 h and processed for fluorography according to Bonner and Laskey (28Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar) with modification as described previously (18Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The dried gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80 °C for 3 weeks. Immunoprecipitated wild-type and variant MAO B enzymes were analyzed in a dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) was prewetted with 150 ml of 20 mmTris and1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and assembled into the dot-blot apparatus. Each sample, containing immunoprecipitated wild-type or variant MAO B, was loaded into an individual well before the membrane dried out and filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane under a gentle vacuum pressure, immobilizing the protein onto the membrane surface. The wells were washed twice with 150 μl of 20 mmTris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The nitrocellulose membrane was dried in an oven at 50 °C and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80 °C for 3 weeks. The fluorogram of SDS-PAGE and the autoradiogram of dot-blot analysis were digitized and quantitated using the program NIH Image 1.62 (47Rasband Wayne NIH Image, Version 1.62. NIH, Bethesda, MD1997Google Scholar). Wild-type and variant MAO B enzymes were expressed in mammalian COS-7 cells since these cells do not contain any detectable endogenous MAO B (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression levels of wild-type and variant MAO B enzymes are shown in Table I. The amount of MAO B expressed for all variants (0.67–0.72 μg of MAO B/mg of protein) was similar to that of wild-type MAO B (0.69 μg/mg of protein). Substitution of Asp227 with glutamate (D227E) or asparagine (D227N) led to a slight decrease (91%) or moderate decrease (70%) in enzymatic activity, respectively (Table I). However, substitution of Asp227 with alanine (D227A) resulted in a substantial loss of enzymatic activity (35%). A fourth mutant, G226A, in which the invariant glycine was replaced with alanine at position 226, also exhibited a marked loss of enzymatic activity (33%). Likewise, the specific activities of all the variants closely correlated with their enzymatic activities.Table IComparison of expression levels and activities of wild-type and variant human MAO B enzymesMAO B concentrationEnzymatic activitySpecific activityμg MAO B/mg proteinμmol benzylamine/min/mg MAO Bnmol benzylamine/min/mg proteinWild-type0.69 ± 0.04 (100)1-aPercent of wild-type values are shown in parentheses.1.22 ± 0.06 (100)0.84 ± 0.04 (100)D227E0.67 ± 0.05 (98)1.11 ± 0.07 (91)0.74 ± 0.05 (88)D227N0.70 ± 0.05 (101)0.87 ± 0.07 (70)0.60 ± 0.01 (71)D227A0.71 ± 0.06 (103)0.43 ± 0.08 (35)0.31 ± 0.04 (36)G226A0.72 ± 0.07 (104)0.40 ± 0.04 (33)0.28 ± 0.00 (33)An equal amount of wild-type or variant MAO B cDNA (15 μg) was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h.

Open table in a new tab An equal amount of wild-type or variant MAO B cDNA (15 μg) was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h.

After the total protein concentration was equalized in all samples, MAO B quantitation (by ELISA) and activity measurements were performed. Samples were run in duplicates in each experiment. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments. To determine the expression of MAO B by Western blotting, wild-type and variant MAO B enzymes were quantitatively immunoprecipitated with goat anti-MAO B polyclonal antibodies, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using MAO B-1C2 as primary antibody (10Denney R.M. Fritz R.R. Patel N.T. Abell C.W. Science. 1982; 215: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 2 and6 ), wild-type MAO B and G226A have bands of approximately equal intensity corresponding to 59 kDa, whereas the sample prepared from untransfected COS-7 cells (lane 7 ) showed no MAO B band. Surprisingly, all variants at position 227 (lanes 3–5 ) did not exhibit a visible band. Flavinylation of wild-type and variant MAO B enzymes with substitutions at Asp227 and Gly226 was studied by simultaneous electroporation of [14C]FAD and MAO B cDNA. The quantitatively immunoprecipitated wild-type and variant MAO B enzymes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then fluorography (Fig.4 a ). Quantitation of the fluorogram showed that covalent incorporation of [14C]FAD into D227E, D227N, D227A, and G226A was 91, 67, 29, and 28% of that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively (Fig. 4 c ). These results indicate that wild-type MAO B and the variant D227E can covalently bind to [14C]FAD to approximately equal extents. D227N, D227A, and G226A, however, showed decreased ability to bind [14C]FAD covalently (67, 29, and 28%, respectively). The total amount of [14C]FAD incorporated into MAO B variants includes both covalently linked FAD and noncovalently bound FAD. The presence of the MAO B band on the fluorograms of SDS-PAGE reflects only FAD covalently bound to the enzyme (Figs. 4 a and 5 a ) since noncovalently bound FAD will be released from the enzyme due to denaturation of proteins prior to and during SDS-PAGE. Consequently, we developed a dot-blot assay to determine the total amount of [14C]FAD that is both covalently and noncovalently incorporated into the wild-type or variant MAO B enzymes. As seen in Fig. 4 b , the wild-type and variant enzymes exhibited approximately equal intensities in the dot-blot assay. Densitometric examination of the autoradiogram showed that the total amounts of [14C]FAD bound to D227E, D227N, D227A, and G226A were 92, 89, 88, and 89% of that of wild-type MAO B, respectively (Fig. 4 c ), indicating that the total amount of [14C]FAD bound to the apoenzyme (covalent and noncovalent binding) is approximately the same in the wild-type and variant enzymes with substitutions at positions 226 and 227. In our previous studies (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W.

Substitution of Glu34 with aspartate (E34D), or alanine (E34A) resulted in an almost complete loss of enzymatic activity and covalent FAD coupling (Fig. 5 a ) (1Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23653-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Substitution of Tyr44 with phenylalanine (Y44F) had no significant effect on enzymatic activity or covalent FAD binding. However, substitution of Tyr44 with alanine (Y44A) resulted in a complete loss of enzymatic activity and covalent FAD binding (Fig. 5 a ) (2Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Kirksey T.J. Abell C.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9526-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whether these variants could still bind FAD noncovalently was not previously known. In this paper, we used dot-blot assays (Fig.5 b ) to assess the extent of total FAD binding for these variants. The fluorograms of SDS-PAGE and the autoradiograms of the dot-blot assay were quantitated and compared with the respective enzymatic activities (Fig. 5 c ). The results of this study revealed that the total FAD binding for these variants correlated well with their covalent binding and enzymatic activities. Y44F had 88% of total FAD binding, 108% of covalent binding of FAD, and 93% enzymatic activity as compared with wild-type MAO B. However, E34D had 15% total FAD binding, 12% covalent binding of FAD, and 7% enzymatic activity compared with wild-type MAO B. E34A and Y44A appeared to lose their ability to bind FAD not only covalently but also noncovalently since no more than 5% of the values for wild-type MAO B were found. The dot-blot patterns of these MAO variants correlated"
https://openalex.org/W2020747321,"The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is the responsible agent for Legionnaires' disease and has recently been shown to harbor a gene encoding a kinase that confers resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic spectinomycin (Suter, T. M., Viswanathan, V. K., and Cianciotto, N. P. (1997) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 41, 1385-1388). We report the overproduction, purification, and characterization of this spectinomycin kinase from an expressing system in Escherichia coli. The purified protein shows stringent substrate specificity for spectinomycin with Km = 21.5 microM and kcat = 24.2 s-1 and does not bind other aminoglycosides including kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, butirosin, streptomycin, or apramycin. Purification of spectinomycin phosphate followed by characterization by mass spectrometry and 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR established the site of phosphorylation to be at the hydroxyl group at position 9. Thus this enzyme is designated APH(9)-Ia (where APH is aminoglycoside kinase). The enzyme was inactivated by the electrophilic ATP analogue 5'-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine, consistent with a nucleophilic residue such as Lys lining the nucleotide binding pocket. Site-directed mutagenesis of Lys-52 and Asp-212 to Ala confirmed that these residues were important for catalysis, with Lys-52 playing a potential role in ATP binding and Asp-212 in phosphoryl transfer. Thio and solvent isotope effect experiments in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ were consistent with a kinetic mechanism in which phosphate transfer does not contribute significantly to the rate-limiting step. These results establish that APH(9)-Ia is a highly specific antibiotic resistance kinase and provides the requisite mechanistic information for future structural studies."
https://openalex.org/W1972849138,"A fundamental issue in allosteric regulatory enzymes is the identification of pathways of signal transmission. Rabbit muscle and kidney pyruvate kinase isozymes are ideal to address this issue because these isozymes exhibit different enzymatic regulatory patterns, and the sequence differences between these isozymes have identified the amino acid residues that alter their kinetic behavior. In an earlier study, Cheng et al. (Cheng, X., Friesen, R. H. E., and Lee, J. C. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6313–6321), reported the effects of a threonine to methionine mutation at residue 340 in the muscle isozyme. In this study, the same mutation was effected in the kidney isozyme. Qualitatively, the same negative effects are observed in both isozymes, namely a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency and decrease in apparent affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate but no change in affinity for ADP, and a decrease in responsiveness to the presence of effectors, be it activator or inhibitor. Because the diversity in the primary sequence between these two isozymes does not alter the negative impact of the T340M mutation, it can be concluded that this mutation exerts a dominant, negative effect. The negative effects of T340M mutation on the kinetic properties imply that there is communication between residue 340 and the active site. Residue 340 is located at the 1,4 subunit interface; however, a T340M mutation enhances the dimerization affinity along the 1,2 subunit interface. Thus, this study has identified a communication network among the active site, residue 340, and the 1,2 subunit interface.

Mammalian pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O -phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) (PK) 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; RMPK and rRMPK, rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; RKPK and rRKPK, rabbit kidney pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Phe,l-phenylalanine; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; RMPK and rRMPK, rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; RKPK and rRKPK, rabbit kidney pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Phe,l-phenylalanine; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol. is a key regulatory glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the transphosphorylation from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP. One of the enzymatic products, pyruvate, is situated at a major metabolic junction between the metabolic pathways of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. Thus, a tight regulatory control of PK is critical to proper cellular function.PK activity in mammalian cells is regulated by two different mechanisms. The first mechanism occurs at the level of expression. The mammalian genome contains two distinct genes coding for four different enzymes with PK activity. The M1- and M2-type isozymes of PK are produced from one gene by alternative RNA splicing (1Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R- and L-type PK isozymes are products of a different gene with two different promoters. The R- and L-type mRNAs differ only in their 5′-terminal sequences (2Noguchi T. Yamada K. Inoue H. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14366-14371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These four isozymic forms of PK are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (3Hall E.R. Cottman G.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1978; 9: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The M1-type PK is the major isozyme of cardiac muscle and brain and is the only isozyme found in adult skeletal muscle. The M2-type PK is widely distributed throughout the body and is the major isozyme derived from kidney and leukocytes. The L-type PK is the major isozyme in the liver, and the R-type isozyme is isolated from erythrocytes.The second mechanism of control of PK activity is through allosteric regulation. PK isozymes are regulated by a host of allosteric inhibitors and activators (3Hall E.R. Cottman G.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1978; 9: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The M2-, R-, and L-type isozymes are homotropically activated by PEP and heterotropically activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The M1-type isozyme is activated by PEP and FBP only in the presence of the inhibitor l-phenylalanine (Phe), which is an inhibitor of all isozymes. In addition, the catalytic activity of the L-type isozyme is known to be allosterically regulated by phosphorylation (4Engstrom L. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1978; 13: 29-51Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The four PK isozymes have distinct kinetic characteristics. Thus, these isozymes are genetic products to accommodate the various metabolic requirements demanded by the different tissues.In general, the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of allosteric regulation at the atomic level is lagging far behind that of the molecular mechanism of catalysis. Whereas a catalytic site usually comprises a part of the enzyme, allosteric control is transmitted over a long range, thus significantly increasing the number of possible residues involved in regulation. It is, therefore, difficult to identify the structural elements that play an important role in the regulation of PK and the propagation of these allosteric signals. Recently, an approach was successfully applied to increase the efficiency of identifying structural elements involved in the regulation of PK (5Cheng X. Friesen R.H.E. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6313-6321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The approach is based on the assumption that the molecular mechanism of allosteric regulation is conserved for all mammalian PK isozymes. This hypothesis is based on the structural homology among mammalian PK isozymes and their qualitatively similar functional behavior. It follows from this hypothesis that structural elements involved in the regulation of PK have similar functional significance in the other mammalian PK isozymes. Guided by this hypothesis, genetic information from different PK isozymes is recruited to identify the targets for mutational studies. Thus far, 55 different mutations have been described for the human R-type PK isozyme from patients with PK-deficient hemolytic anemia (6Beutler E. Baronciano L. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 7: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutant PK Tokyo/Nagasaki/Beirut was identified by genetic studies of erythrocyte PK in hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia patients (7Kanno H. Fujii H. Hirono A. Miwa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8218-8221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Kanno H. Fujii H. Hirono A. Omine M. Miwa S. Blood. 1992; 79: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Neubauer B. Lakomek H. Winkler H. Parke M. Hofferbert S. Schroter W. Blood. 1991; 77: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant involves a threonine to methionine at a residue equivalent to 340 in rabbit kidney PK (RKPK). Threonine 340 or its equivalent is conserved in all known aligned PK sequences (10Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1992; 59: 105-235Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of RMPK, it is located outside of the active site (11Larsen T.M. Laughlin T. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows a schematic representation of the location of T340M mutation relative to the active site and the subunit interfaces. The characterization of the T340M mutation in rRMPK has been reported (5Cheng X. Friesen R.H.E. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6313-6321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Characterization of the same mutant in the rRKPK will not only provide information to address the validity of the hypothesis of an evolutionary conserved allosteric mechanism, it will also provide information on the dominance of this mutation in the presence of a background of sequence differences between rRKPK and rRMPK. The ability of rRKPK to undergo subunit assembly provides a unique opportunity to monitor the changes in energetics at the subunit interface as a result of the T340M mutation. 2Friesen, R. H. E., Chin, A. J., Ledman, D. W., and Lee, J. C. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 2949–2960. 2Friesen, R. H. E., Chin, A. J., Ledman, D. W., and Lee, J. C. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 2949–2960. The T340M rRKPK mutant is characterized by kinetic and physical studies. The results are analyzed to define the sites that communicate with each other, and a structural model for the transmission of the allosteric signal is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe major observations of this study are that T340M mutation exerts a dominant effect on mammalian PK by lowering the catalytic efficiency and apparent affinity for PEP, and a decrease in responsiveness to the presence of effectors while exhibiting no apparent effect on ADP binding. Furthermore, the effects of T340M mutation are propagated through long range communication to the active site and the 1,2 subunit interface which are ∼20 Å and ∼45 Å away, respectively. Thus, these results provide the first direct evidence to establish the communication network between the active site and both subunit interfaces.Mutation of this highly conserved threonine to methionine in rRKPK (this study), rRMPK (5Cheng X.

Hirono A. Miwa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8218-8221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Kanno H. Fujii H. Hirono A. Omine M. Miwa S.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in a similar observation of decrease in enzyme activity. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the molecular mechanism of regulation in PK is conserved. The verification of this assumption significantly increases the efficiency of selecting functionally important structural elements. The information embedded in human erythrocyte PK variants can be revealed by studying the equivalent mutants of the other isozymic forms of PK. The sites of mutation and the nature of amino acid substitution reported in these human genetic variants can serve as leads in probing the molecular mechanism of allosteric regulation in mammalian PK.The T340M mutation significantly alters the kinetic properties of the enzyme. By comparing the kinetic behavior of the wild type and T340M rRKPK, there is an approximately 50% decrease in the value ofk cat. The effect of mutation on the steady state affinity for PEP is based on the observed perturbation on the values ofK app,PEP. Although one may question the validity in equating these kinetically determined K appparameters to actual equilibrium binding constants in rRKPK, it was shown by independently determined ligand binding constants that theK app parameters are reasonable approximation of binding constants in RMPK (26Harris S.J. Williams R.C. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8752-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Cai G.-Z. Callaci T.P. Luther M.A. Lee J.C. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Oberfelder R.W. Lee L.-Y. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3813-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Oberfelder R.W. Barisas B.G. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3822-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Consler T.G. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2787-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is most interesting to note that the same effects of T340M mutation were observed on the kinetic behavior of the other form of PK, the rRMPK isozyme (5Cheng X. Friesen R.H.E. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6313-6321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence differences between the two isozymes along the 1,2 subunit interface do not alter the dominating, negative effects of the T340M mutation. These effects are a decrease in catalytic efficiency, decrease in apparent affinity for PEP, and decreased responsiveness to allosteric effectors.An important feature of allosteric regulation is the communication between ligand binding sites and subunits of an oligomeric enzyme such as PK. An outstanding advantage of rRKPK to elucidate the communication network is its propensity to undergo a dynamic association-dissociation reaction. The change in the energetics of subunit assembly can be employed to reflect a communication via this subunit interface (13Friesen R.H.E. Effects of conserved residues on the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase: A structure-function study of rabbit muscle- and kidney-pyruvate kinase. University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX1997Google Scholar).2 In wild type rRKPK, it was shown that binding of all metabolites communicates through the 1,2 subunit interface. From the results of both analytical gel chromatography and sedimentation velocity experiments, it was apparent that the T340M mutation shifts the equilibrium in favor of the tetrameric form. Thus, an obvious conclusion is that there is communication between residue 340 and the 1,2 subunit interface, although the exact mechanism of communication has to be defined. The mechanism could involve a direct pathway between these two sites, or it might be indirect through a global structural perturbation by the T340M mutation. It is interesting to note that analogous to the observed correlation between subunit assembly and metabolite binding, a possible linkage can be considered between the self-association equilibrium and the effect of Phe on the kinetic behavior of the T340M mutant. In wild type rRKPK, the kinetic behavior is more responsive to Phe and the presence of this ligand significantly shifts the subunit assembly equilibrium toward the dimeric form. However, in the presence of up to 12 mm Phe, the T340M rRKPK remains predominantly tetrameric. These results indicate that the T340M mutation in rRKPK affects the intrinsic properties of the 1,2 subunit interface, and there is an apparent correlation between the decrease in responsiveness to Phe in enzyme kinetics and subunit assembly equilibrium, namely less response with a decreased ability to shift the subunit assembly equilibrium. Residue 340 not only communicates with the 1,2 subunit interface, there is also communication between residue 340 and the active site approximately 20 Å away. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the catalytic efficiency of the T340M mutant is significantly decreased. Communication between the active site and the 1,2 subunit interface was established for the wild type rRKPK (13Friesen R.H.E. Effects of conserved residues on the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase: A structure-function study of rabbit muscle- and kidney-pyruvate kinase. University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX1997Google Scholar).2 Studies in this report identify the communication between the T340M mutation at the 1,4 subunit interface and the 1,2 subunit interface. This completes a triangulation of communication network within the rRKPK subunit between the T340M mutation at the 1,4 subunit interface, the 1,2 subunit interface, and the active site. This is the first report that identifies the communication between these functionally important structural elements in PK and in turn addresses a fundamental issue in elucidating the regulatory mechanism of PK by identifying the network of communication between functionally important sites, such as ligand binding sites and subunit interfaces.Results from small angle neutron scattering experiments and computation modeling led to a proposal that the conversion of inactive RMPK to the active state is associated with a rotation of the B domain toward the A domain along the 1,4 subunit interface (31Consler T.G. Uberbacher E.C. Bunick G.J. Liebman M.N. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2794-2801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of this domain rotation, one of the new contact sites involves residue 340. Thus, the observed perturbation of kinetics and communication pathway reported in this study is consistent with the earlier proposal. Being encouraged by these consistent results, it is useful to examine the structure of RMPK determined by Larsen et al. (11Larsen T.M. Laughlin T. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in order to develop a model for the transmission of information between the 1,4 subunit interface and the active site.The model indicates that the closed cleft conformation of the active state is stabilized by intersubunit electrostatic interactions between Asp-177 in the B domain of subunit 1 with Arg-341 of the A domain in the subunit across the 1,4 subunit interface. Stabilization of the active state by an electrostatic interaction between Arg-341 and Asp-177 is consistent with results of a study of RMPK that indicated a loss of activity in the presence of high salt concentrations (32Consler T.G. Jennewein M.J. Cai G.-Z. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7870-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Arg-341 is part of α-helix 12, which includes residues 341–353, that constitutes part of the 1,4 subunit interface. It is possible that a minor change, such as a T340M mutation, at the 1,4 subunit interface is propagated through helix 12, resulting in a perturbation of the proper positioning of its neighboring Arg-341 with Asp-177, resulting in the destabilization of the active state. Asp-177, Arg-341, and Thr-340 are conserved residues in all known PK sequences (10Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1992; 59: 105-235Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with the kinetic observations of the T340M mutants in rRKPK, rRMPK, and human erythrocyte PK (5Cheng X. Friesen R.H.E. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6313-6321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Kanno H. Fujii H. Hirono A. Miwa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Winkler H. Parke M. Hofferbert S. Schroter W. Blood. 1991; 77: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the T340M mutation in all three PK isozymes lead to the same net result, namely significant deficiency in PK activity. Of course, the validity of this proposed model awaits the high resolution structural information of this mutant and further experimental results of mutants and solution biophysical characterizations of these mutants. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that Mattevi et al. (33Mattevi A. Valentini G. Rizzi M. Speranza M.L. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1995; 3: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) identified the equivalent of residue 341 in E. coli PK as playing a role in intersubunit salt bridge formation to stabilize the T-state enzyme. Alternatively, a communication pathway between residue 340 and active site may involve transmission of information between residue 340 and the 1,2 subunit interface, which in turn communicates to the active site. A communication between the 1,2 subunit interface and active site has been demonstrated in an earlier study (13Friesen R.H.E. Effects of conserved residues on the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase: A structure-function study of rabbit muscle- and kidney-pyruvate kinase. University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX1997Google Scholar).2 These two models can rationalize part of the communication network that couple different locations within the PK tetramer.The significance of this mutation in affecting the molecular mechanism of regulation has yet to be determined, inasmuch as allosteric regulation is the net consequence of linked functions in which the binding affinity of one ligand is linked to that of another ligand and structural equilibria as formulated mathematically by Wyman (12Wyman Jr., J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). As a consequence of these linkages, the observed fitted constants are apparent parameters and can be distinct from their intrinsic values. To assess the actual effect of the T340M mutation on the regulatory mechanism at the molecular level, it is imperative to identify the intrinsic properties of the various linked equilibria that are affected. Further studies are being conducted to dissect these linked equilibria. 3P. Herman and J. C. Lee, manuscript in preparation. Mammalian pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O -phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) (PK) 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; RMPK and rRMPK, rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; RKPK and rRKPK, rabbit kidney pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Phe,l-phenylalanine; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; RMPK and rRMPK, rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; RKPK and rRKPK, rabbit kidney pyruvate kinase and recombinant enzyme, respectively; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Phe,l-phenylalanine; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol. is a key regulatory glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the transphosphorylation from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP. One of the enzymatic products, pyruvate, is situated at a major metabolic junction between the metabolic pathways of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. Thus, a tight regulatory control of PK is critical to proper cellular function. PK activity in mammalian cells is regulated by two different mechanisms. The first mechanism occurs at the level of expression. The mammalian genome contains two distinct genes coding for four different enzymes with PK activity. The M1- and M2-type isozymes of PK are produced from one gene by alternative RNA splicing (1Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R- and L-type PK isozymes are products of a different gene with two different promoters. The R- and L-type mRNAs differ only in their 5′-terminal sequences (2Noguchi T. Yamada K. Inoue H. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14366-14371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These four isozymic forms of PK are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (3Hall E.R. Cottman G.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1978; 9: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The M1-type PK is the major isozyme of cardiac muscle and brain and is the only isozyme found in adult skeletal muscle. The M2-type PK is widely distributed throughout the body and is the major isozyme derived from kidney and leukocytes. The L-type PK is the major isozyme in the liver, and the R-type isozyme is isolated from erythrocytes. The second mechanism of control of PK activity is through allosteric regulation. PK isozymes are regulated by a host of allosteric inhibitors and activators (3Hall E.R. Cottman G.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1978; 9: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The M2-, R-, and L-type isozymes are homotropically activated by PEP and heterotropically activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The M1-type isozyme is activated by PEP and FBP only in the presence of the inhibitor l-phenylalanine (Phe), which is an inhibitor of all isozymes. In addition, the catalytic activity of the L-type isozyme is known to be allosterically regulated by phosphorylation (4Engstrom L. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1978; 13: 29-51Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The four PK isozymes have distinct kinetic characteristics. Thus, these isozymes are genetic products to accommodate the various metabolic requirements demanded by the different tissues. In general, the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of allosteric regulation at the atomic level is lagging far behind that of the molecular mechanism of catalysis. Whereas a catalytic site usually comprises a part of the enzyme, allosteric control is transmitted over a long range, thus significantly increasing the number of possible residues involved in regulation. It is, therefore, difficult to identify the structural elements that play an important role in the regulation of PK and the propagation of these allosteric signals. Recently, an approach was successfully applied to increase the efficiency of identifying structural elements involved in the regulation of PK (5Cheng X. Friesen R.H.E. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6313-6321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The approach is based on the assumption that the molecular mechanism of allosteric regulation is conserved for all mammalian PK isozymes. This hypothesis is based on the structural homology among mammalian PK isozymes and their qualitatively similar functional behavior. It follows from this hypothesis that structural elements involved in the regulation of PK have similar functional significance in the other mammalian PK isozymes. Guided by this hypothesis, genetic information from different PK isozymes is recruited to identify the targets for mutational studies. Thus far, 55 different mutations have been described for the human R-type PK isozyme from patients with PK-deficient hemolytic anemia (6Beutler E. Baronciano L. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 7: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutant PK Tokyo/Nagasaki/Beirut was identified by genetic studies of erythrocyte PK in hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia patients (7Kanno H. Fujii H. Hirono A. Miwa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8218-8221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Kanno H. Fujii H. Hirono A. Omine M. Miwa S. Blood. 1992; 79: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Neubauer B. Lakomek H. Winkler H. Parke M. Hofferbert S. Schroter W. Blood. 1991; 77: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant involves a threonine to methionine at a residue equivalent to 340 in rabbit kidney PK (RKPK). Threonine 340 or its equivalent is conserved in all known aligned PK sequences (10Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1992; 59: 105-235Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of RMPK, it is located outside of the active site (11Larsen T.M. Laughlin T. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows a schematic representation of the location of T340M mutation relative to the active site and the subunit interfaces. The characterization of the T340M mutation in rRMPK has been reported (5Cheng X. Friesen R.H.E. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6313-6321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Characterization of the same mutant in the rRKPK will not only provide information to address the validity of the hypothesis of an evolutionary conserved allosteric mechanism, it will also provide information on the dominance of this mutation in the presence of a background of sequence differences between rRKPK and rRMPK. The ability of rRKPK to undergo subunit assembly provides a unique opportunity to monitor the changes in energetics at the subunit interface as a result of the T340M mutation. 2Friesen, R. H. E., Chin, A. J., Ledman, D. W., and Lee, J. C. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 2949–2960. 2Friesen, R. H. E., Chin, A. J., Ledman, D. W., and Lee, J. C. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 2949–2960. The T340M rRKPK mutant is characterized by kinetic and physical studies. The results are analyzed to define the sites that communicate with each other, and a structural model for the transmission of the allosteric signal is discussed. DISCUSSIONThe major observations of this study are that T340M mutation exerts a dominant effect"

The identification and characterization of IFN-γ-specific transcripts in VSMCs are an important approach to discern the molecular mechanisms underlying vascular proliferative disease. In this report, we describe IRT-1, a novel mRNA transcript constitutively expressed in a number of human tissues, but expressed in human VSMCs only when they are stimulated with IFN-γ. This mRNA expression is induced >200-fold 72 h after IFN-γ treatment. IRT-1 mRNA is also acutely expressed in rat carotid arteries that are injured by balloon angioplasty. The IRT-1 cDNA transcript encodes a basic protein that contains a leucine zipper motif, a core nuclear localization sequence, and a single strongly hydrophobic region. Constitutive IRT-1 mRNA expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes is reduced when these cells are stimulated to proliferate. Overexpression of IRT-1 protein in VSMCs alters their morphology and dramatically reduces their proliferative capacity.

Vascular disease, the principal cause of heart attack, stroke, and circulatory deficit disorders, is responsible for 50% of all mortality in the western world. The use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting to treat coronary artery disease has increased exponentially in the past decade. However, the long-term efficacy of these procedures is significantly limited by the high incidence of vascular restenosis observed in as many as 40% of patients undergoing this procedure (1Libby P. Schwartz D. Brogi E. Tanaka H. Clinton S.K. Circulation. 1992; 86: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The lack of a correlation between the efficacy of pharmacological interventions in preclinical and clinical studies is indicative of our poor understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. The resultant neointima formation associated with balloon angioplasty is a complex process actively involving various cell types that secrete many different cytokines and growth factors seminal to the local inflammatory response (2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9947) Google Scholar). These cytokines include, but are not limited to, interleukin-1, platelet-derived growth factor, and a number of colony-stimulating factors and interferons (IFNs) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bZIP, basic leucine zipper; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; PHA, phytohemagglutinin A. 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bZIP, basic leucine zipper; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; PHA, phytohemagglutinin A.

The major cellular component of the atherosclerotic lesion is the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), which, upon exposure to these soluble factors, migrates into the intimal layer and proliferates. In restenotic lesions, VSMCs express a synthetic phenotype and secrete many cytokines and matrix proteins, which further promotes VSMC growth in an autocrine fashion (5Liu M.W. Roubin G.S. King S.B.

Cardiol. 1985; 6: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cytokine-induced activation of VSMCs in media resulting in intimal thickening is the most critical cellular event in the restenotic process (5Liu M.W. Roubin G.S. King S.B.

Upon interaction with its target cell, interferons induce expression of a number of IFN-specific genes (9Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Adv. Immunol. 1992; 52: 263-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which manifest their biological activities by antiviral, immune modulatory, and antiproliferative effects (10Demayer E. Demayer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 91-113Google Scholar). This is particularly true in VSMCs, as it has been shown that proliferation of these cells is inhibited by lymphocyte-specific factors, primarily IFN-γ (11Hansson G.K. Holm J. Holm S. Fotev Z. Hedrich H.J. Fingerle J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10534-19530Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Rolfe B.E. Campbell J.H. Smith N.J. Cheong M.W. Campbell G.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The antiproliferative effects of IFN-γ on VSMCs can be exerted indirectly, though generation of nitric oxide (13Nunokawa Y. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), or directly, though generation of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcriptional regulators, which can act as activators or repressors of IFN-γ-inducible genes (14Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 15Wang I.-M. Blanco J.C. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell.

IFN-γ is also directly antiproliferative to VSMCs in tissue culture, and the addition of IFN-γ to proliferating VSMCs results in a reduction of c-myc expression within 2 h (17Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Newby A.C. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Other data suggest that IFN-γ inhibits VSMC proliferation by blocking the transition from G0 to G1 (18Hansson G.K. Jonasson L. Holm J. Clowes M.M. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that key cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as Cdc2, Cdk2, cyclins A and D, and Wee1, are also down-regulated or altered (19Yamada H. Ochi K. Nakada S. Nemoto T. Horiguchi-Yamada J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 136: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by IFN-γ treatment. Finally, VSMCs co-cultured with endothelial cells transduced with IFN-γ cDNA grew 30–70% slower than control cells (20Stopeck A.T. Vahedian M. Williams S.K. Cell Transplant. 1997; 6: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immune cells are present in the atherosclerotic lesion and appear in greater numbers immediately following balloon angioplasty-induced vascular injury (21Hansson G.K. Jonasson L. Seifert P.S. Stemme S. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ is produced in vivo by activated T lymphocytes, and a number of investigators have determined that T lymphocytes exert phenotypic and proliferative effects on VSMCs (12Rolfe B.E. Campbell J.H. Smith N.J. Cheong M.W. Campbell G.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Wang W. Chen H.J. Giedd K.N. Schwartz A. Cannon P.J. Rabbani L.E. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies have shown that in rats, IFN-γ treatment inhibits arterial restenosis due to balloon angioplasty (24Hansson G.K. Holm J. Circulation. 1991; 84: 1266-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,25Castronuovo J.J. Guss S.B. Mysh D. Sawhney A. Wolff M. Gown A.M. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1995; 3: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is likely due to its antiproliferative effects on VSMCs. These findings have raised the possibility that IFN-γ may represent an antirestenotic cytokine therapy. Because interferon-γ inhibits proliferation of VSMCs in culture and IFN-γ inhibits arterial restenosis post-balloon angioplasty, identification and characterization of IFN-γ-specific transcripts in VSMCs are a promising strategy to discern the molecular mechanisms underlying vascular proliferative disease. This study describes the identification and characterization of IRT-1 (interferon-responsivetranscript-1), which was identified as an aberrant PCR product using gene-specific primers and RNA extracted from VSMCs stimulated with various cytokines as a template (26Autieri M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). IRT-1 mRNA is expressed in VSMCs only by IFN-γ and encodes a novel basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein. IRT-1 expression is also induced by balloon angioplasty in rat carotid arteries. Overexpression of IRT-1 in human VSMCs results in altered morphology and inhibition of cell growth. Taken together with data indicating that IFN-γ is antiproliferative to VSMCs and exerts protective effects on rat carotid artery balloon angioplasty, modulation of IRT-1 expression may represent an important event in the regulation of VSMC growth. VSMCs were obtained as a cryopreserved secondary culture from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) and subcultured in growth medium as described previously (26Autieri M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The growth medium was changed every other day until cells approached confluence. Cells from passages 5–9 were used in the described studies. Preconfluent VSMCs were serum-starved for 48 h in Dubecco's minimal essential medium and then exposed for 20 h to 10% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 100 units/ml IFN-γ, 20 ng/ml interleukin-1β, 20 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, or 2 ng/ml transforming growth factor-β, at which time samples were processed for RNA isolation. Some samples remained untreated and were used as controls. Platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, IFN-γ, and transforming growth factor-β were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; interleukin-1β was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated by venipuncture from normal adult donors, isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/complete (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) plus phytohemagglutinin A (PHA) (5.0 μg/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the times indicated, and processed for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from IFN-γ-stimulated human VSMCs as described above and reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transcripts were poly(C)-tailed with terminal deoxytransferase, and 5′-cDNA was amplified by PCR of dC-tailed cDNA using nested IRT-1-specific reverse primers. PCR products were isolated from agarose gels by glass extraction and cloned into the pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen) for DNA sequence analysis. The cDNA clone obtained above was dideoxynucleotide-sequenced on both strands in its entirety (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) as described previously (26Autieri M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequences were analyzed using the MacVector software package (International Biotechnologies, Inc.). Searches for sequence similarity were performed using the GenBank™ nucleic acid data base and Prosite protein data base through the Genetics Computer Group FASTA, BLAST, PROSITE, and PSORT programs. Left common carotid artery balloon angioplasty was performed on 350-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (65 mg/kg intraperitoneally; Steris Laboratories, Phoenix, AZ) as described previously (26Autieri M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the left external carotid artery was cleared of adherent tissue, allowing the insertion of a 2-F Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter (Model 12-060-2F, Baxter Healthcare, Santa Ana, CA). The catheter was guided a fixed distance down the common carotid artery to the aortic arch, inflated with a fixed volume of fluid, and withdrawn back to the site of insertion a total of three times. Once completed, the catheter was removed, and the wound was closed (9-mm Autoclips, Clay Adams) and swabbed with Povadyne surgical scrub (7.5% povidone-iodine, Chaston, Dayville, CT). Animals were housed in Plexiglas cages under a 12-h light/dark cycle with access to standard laboratory chow and drinking water ad libitum until required for tissue collection. To isolate the carotid arteries, rats were exsanguinated via the vena cava under barbiturate anesthesia (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Left common carotid arteries were rapidly cleared of adherent tissuein situ , isolated, and placed directly in guanidine thiocyanate (Promega). These vessels were then immediately processed for RNA isolation. For subsequent Northern analysis, tissues were isolated from naive animals (control) and from animals that had undergone angioplasty 1, 3, and 7 days prior, and RNA was extracted as described below. Northern analysis was also performed on sham vessels (data not shown). All surgical procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Deborah Research Institute and the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care. For each time point studied, four or five left carotid arteries were pooled, or VSMCs from culture were isolated, and total RNA was obtained by standard techniques as described (26Autieri M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA were loaded and separated on a formaldehyde-containing 1.3% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized (0.25 m NaCl, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, 2× Denhardt's solution, 25 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 5% dextran sulfate at 42 °C overnight) with the indicated probe. All probes were α-32P-labeled by the random priming method (Boehringer Mannheim) (all isotopes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were washed under high stringency (0.2× sodium citrate and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) and exposed to film for 6–48 h at −80 °C. The same filter was stripped and subsequently hybridized with the various DNA probes. The β-actin probe was generated from PCR amplimers (CLONTECH). Relative intensities of hybridization signals were obtained by densitometric scanning (RFLP-Scan software, Scanalytics, Inc.) of autoradiograms exposed within the linear range of the film (Eastman Kodak X-Omat). Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased fromCLONTECH, hybridized, and washed according to manufacturer's instructions. The protein coding region of the IRT-1 cDNA was cloned by PCR using IRT-1 cDNA sequence-specific primers. The PCR 5′-primer also contained a Kozak consensus sequence (GCCGCCGCCATGG) to enhance translation (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4159) Google Scholar). This modified protein coding sequence was inserted into the expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene), and purified DNA from a single bacterial colony containing IRT-1 in pBK-CMV was isolated. This construct was termed pBK-CMV-IRT-1. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells grown in T75 flasks were transfected with no plasmid (mock control), with the pBK-CMV plasmid alone, or with pBK-CMV-IRT-1 in the forward and reverse orientations using 2 μl/ml LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and mixed with 1 μg of either plasmid. Two days following transfection, cells were trypsinized and split 1:2, with one-half grown in the presence of the neomycin analog G418 (Geneticin) and left to grow in the presence of growth medium + G418 for 14 days. The other half was saved for RNA isolation. After selection for 14 days, the cells were then trypsinized and counted using a standard hemocytometer. Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells as described above, and 4 μg was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers as described previously (26Autieri M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One-fifth of the cDNA was PCR-amplified for 32 cycles using the following neomycin-specific amplimers: 5′-GCAAGCAGGCATCGCCATGGTTCA-3′ and 5′-TGGGCGAAGTGCCGGGGCAGGATC-3′, which define a 290-base pair region of the neomycin cDNA. This is in the linear assay range with respect to cycle number, template concentration, and dilution of cDNA. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplimers were purchased from CLONTECH and define an amplicon of 450 base pairs. One-fifth of the reaction was run on a 2.5% agarose gel, ethidium bromide-stained, and photographed. Stably transfected cells were grown on microscope slides. The medium was removed, and cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Immunoperoxidase staining was performed using the Zymed Histostain-Plus kit. Cells were incubated in 0.1% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, in 10% nonimmune blocking serum for 15 min, and overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1000 dilution of column-purified IRT-1 primary antibody. Cells were washed, incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase enzyme conjugate, and incubated with aminoethyl carbazole chromogen. Cells were rinsed and counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. IRT-1 was identified as an aberrant PCR product using gene-specific primers and RNA extracted from VSMCs stimulated with various cytokines as a template (26Autieri M.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Under low stringency primer annealing conditions, a PCR product almost twice the expected size of the gene we were studying was observed in samples from IFN-γ-treated VSMCs (data not shown). Using this PCR product as a probe, we verified the expression pattern of its cognate cDNA by Northern analysis of VSMCs stimulated with various cytokines. Fig.1 indicates that the transcript recognized by this probe is ∼1300 nucleotides in length and, similar to that observed by reverse transcription-PCR, is expressed in these cells only upon treatment with IFN-γ. Expression of this transcript in VSMCs is dependent upon IFN-γ treatment, regardless of prior serum starvation (data not shown). This indicates that IRT-1 is an IFN-γ-specific transcript. We determined the full-length IRT-1 transcript by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure using IRT-1 sequence-specific primers. The full-length IRT-1 cDNA transcript is ∼1.25 kilobase pairs (Fig.2 A ) and, following termination codons in all three reading frames, contains on open reading frame of 399 nucleotides encoding for a deduced 132-amino acid basically charged protein (pI 9.89) with a mass of ∼14,617 kDa. This open reading frame was confirmed by cell-free in vitro translation of both the full-length cDNA and the deduced open reading frame, each of which displayed the predicted 14-kDa protein (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of human IRT-1 contains a number of motifs that may suggest its function and is depicted schematically in Fig. 2 B . A strongly basic region at amino acids 67–75 is immediately followed by a consensus leucine zipper motif (LX 6LX 6LX 6LX 6) at amino acids 75–95. This bZIP pattern is present in many gene regulatory proteins (28Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). A single strongly hydrophobic region is indicated in amino acids 50–80, and Fig. 2 C is a Kyte-Doolittle depiction of this hydrophobicity. A 4-amino acid nuclear localization sequence (RPKK), identical to the SV40 large T antigen core sequence, is also present at amino acids 25–28 (29Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 30Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this protein predicts a strong α-helix secondary structure, also prevalent in some gene regulatory proteins. Other amino acid domains include potential phosphorylation consensus sequences for mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C at amino acids 67–70 and 81–83, respectively. The IRT-1 cDNA also has a long 3′-untranslated region that contains an ATTTA sequence, which is found in the mRNA of many cytokines and proto-oncogenes and is thought to confer instability to mRNA (31Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Schimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 32Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3112) Google Scholar). IRT-1 mRNA expression is dose-dependent, with optimal concentrations of IFN-γ being 100 units/ml (data not shown). The time course of IRT-1 expression was also investigated. IRT-1 expression is temporal, beginning at ∼8 h after IFN-γ treatment and reaching a peak at 72 h after IFN-γ treatment (Fig.3). Quantitation of this expression by scanning densitometric analysis normalized to RNA content reveals a >200-fold induction of IRT-1 mRNA 72 h after IFN-γ treatment (not shown). Generally, IFN-γ-inducible proteins are regulated at the transcriptional level in a protein synthesis-dependent fashion (33Williams J.G. Jurkovich G.J. Maier R.V. J. Surg. Res. 1993; 54: 79-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine if IRT-1 transcription is dependent on protein synthesis, a 500 nm concentration of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added to VSMCs and then stimulated with IFN-γ for 24 h. Fig.4 shows that this concentration of cycloheximide inhibits expression of IRT-1 by ∼96%, suggesting that transcription of IRT-1 mRNA is dependent on de novo synthesized transcription factors. The addition of cycloheximide to unstimulated VSMCs did not induce IRT-1 expression, suggesting that inhibition of transcription of this gene in unstimulated cells is not under the control of constitutively expressed factors. Activated T lymphocytes, which are present in injured arteries, produce IFN-γ, and a number of studies have determined that T lymphocytes exert pleiotropic effects on VSMCs (12Rolfe B.E. Campbell J.H. Smith N.J. Cheong M.W. Campbell G.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Nunokawa Y. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because activated VSMCs are the primary cell type in restenotic lesions, we hypothesized that this transcript would be prevalent in injured arteries. Total RNA from undamaged arteries, and from rat carotid arteries at three time points post-balloon angioplasty, was isolated and Northern analysis performed with IRT-1 cDNA as a hybridization probe. Fig. 5 demonstrates that IRT-1 mRNA is induced by balloon angioplasty in an acute fashion, with a 10-fold increase in expression of IRT-1 mRNA over basal levels 1 day post-balloon angioplasty, 3-fold at 3 days, and 2-fold at 7 days post-injury. This indicates that expression of this gene is induced in rat carotid arteries in response to balloon angioplasty. To determine the tissue distribution of this transcript, filters containing RNA from 16 different human tissues were screened with the IRT-1 cDNA as a probe. IRT-1 mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues, with the highest expression in cells of lymphoid origin, in particular, spleen, pheripheral blood (PBLs), and thymus (Fig. 6). Other tissues expressing appreciable amounts of IRT-1 are lung, skeletal muscle, and small intestine. Varying but detectable amounts of expression are in pancreas, kidney, liver, placenta, heart, colon, ovary, testes, and prostate. No IRT-1 mRNA is detectable in brain. This pattern indicates that IRT-1 expression is tissue-specific, and the relatively high degree of constitutive expression of IRT-1 in human lymphoid tissue suggests a function for this protein in cells of this lineage. The high degree of constitutive expression of IRT-1 in human lymphoid tissue led us to investigate if IRT-1 expression is regulated in activated human lymphocytes. Northern analysis of the IRT-1 transcript in unstimulated and PHA-stimulated human PBLs showed that unstimulated PBLs demonstrated a high level of constitutive IRT-1 expression, consistent with that observed in the multiple tissue analysis (Fig. 7 A ). However, a 24-h treatment of these cells with PHA decreased IRT-1 mRNA levels >3-fold, and by 72 h, IRT-1 mRNA levels were decreased 6-fold (Fig. 7 B ). As expected, proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels in such treated cells were increased dramatically, reflecting the proliferative state of these cells. These results indicate that the constitutive levels of IRT-1 mRNA expression in quiescent human PBLs can be diminished by the proliferative lymphocyte mitogen PHA. As an initial approach toward understanding the function of IRT-1, we forced expression of this gene in human VSMCs. The protein coding region of the IRT-1 cDNA was cloned by PCR using IRT-1 cDNA sequence-specific primers and a PCR 5′-primer containing the Kozak consensus sequence (GCCGCCGCCATGG) to enhance translation (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4159) Google Scholar). This sequence increases IRT-1 protein expression 9-fold in an in vitro translation system (data not shown). Human vascular smooth muscle cells were transfected with no plasmid (mock control), with the pBK-CMV plasmid alone, or with pBK-CMV containing IRT-1 (pBK-CMV-IRT-1) in the forward and reverse orientations. Two days following transfection, cells were trypsinized and split 1:2, with one-half grown in the presence of the neomycin analog G418 (Geneticin) and left to grow in the presence of growth medium + G418 for 14 days. The other half was saved for RNA isolation. After selection for 14 days, the cells were then trypsinized and counted using a standard hemocytometer. The results of three experiments are tabulated in Table I and demonstrate an average 18% decrease in pBK-CMV-IRT-1-containing cells as compared with pBK-CMV and pBK-CMV-IRT-1 antisense orientation control cells. These results are not due to differences in transfection efficiency, as reverse transcription-PCR of RNA isolated from newly transfected cells indicated that equal amounts of the plasmid pBK-CMV were present in both plasmid-only and pBK-CMV-IRT-1-transfected cells (Fig. 8). Overexpression of other genes that do not significantly affect VSMC proliferation has no effect on cell number in this system (data not shown). This demonstrates that human VSMCs that overexpress IRT-1 proliferate at a dramatically slower rate than do cells that do not express IRT-1 protein, suggesting an antiproliferative function for IRT-1.Table IOverexpression of IRT-1 protein in human VSMCs inhibits their proliferationExp.MockpBK-CMVAntisense pBK-CMV-IRT-1pBK-CMV-IRT-1Reductioncells/flaskcells/flaskcells/flaskcells/flask-fold106.5 × 1057.1 × 1053.1 × 10420.0202.3 × 1061.9 × 1068.5 × 10527.5302.4 × 1052.2 × 1053.1 × 1047.7Human coronary artery VSMCs were transfected with no plasmid (mock control), the pBK-CMV plasmid alone, pBK-CMV-IRT-1 in the antisense orientation, or pBK-CMV-IRT-1.
