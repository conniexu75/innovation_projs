https://openalex.org/W1965464174,"Associated with some plant viruses are small satellite RNA's that depend on the plant virus to provide protective coat protein and presumably at least some of the proteins necessary for satellite RNA replication. Multimeric forms of the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus are probable in vivo precursors of the monomeric satellite RNA. Evidence is presented for the in vitro autolytic processing of dimeric and trimeric forms of this satellite RNA. The reaction generates biologically active monomeric satellite RNA, apparently is reversible to form dimeric RNA from monomeric RNA, and does not require an enzyme for its catalysis."

Electron microscopic examination of these sections has revealed the internal structures of chondritic micrometeorites, and a subset of highly porous, fragile particles has been identified. Delicate meteoritic materials such as these are characteristic of debris from cometary meteors."
https://openalex.org/W2079941209,"Calculations show that, at a mean altitude of 1000 miles, radiation pressure can displace the orbit of the 100-foot Echo balloon at rates up to 3.7 miles per day, the orbit of the 12-foot Beacon satellite at 0.7 mile per day. For certain resonant conditions this effect accumulates, drastically affecting the satellite's lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W2076151518,"Transmission electron microscopy of a hydrated interplanetary dust particle (IDP) indicates that it contains abundant magnesium-iron carbonates, primarily breunnerite and magnesian siderite. This IDP displays a strong absorption band at 6.8 micrometers in its infrared spectrum, similar to that in certain protostellar spectra. The carbonates probably account for the 6.8-micrometer band in the IDP spectrum, suggesting that carbonate also may occur in interstellar dust and be the source of the controversial 6.8-micrometer feature from the protostellar spectra."
https://openalex.org/W2051714828,"A chemical dissolution experiment on an interplanetary dust particle (IDP) showed that carbonates, not acid-insoluble organic compounds, were responsible for virtually all the absorption at 6.8 micrometers seen in the infrared spectra of this particle. The IDP examined had an infrared spectrum characteristic of layer-lattice silicates and belongs to a class of IDP's whose spectra resemble those of protostellar objects like W33 A, which also exhibit a band at 6.8 micrometers."
https://openalex.org/W2067888966,The effect of solar radiation pressure on the perigee height of satellite 1958ss(2) (Vanguard I) has been considered. Previous consideration of the effect of the third hairmonic and the lunar and solar gravitational perturbations left an unexplained discrepancy between the observed and calculated values of perigee height. The inclusion of the effect of radiation pressure leads to close agreement between the orbit data and the theoretical results for Vanguard I.

https://openalex.org/W2062382808,"Riboflavin deficiency, even in a relatively early stage, greatly lowers the resistance of the rat to endemic typhus, thereby resulting in a fatal disease. Not only the serosal cells, but also the endothelial cells in several organs, notably the Kupfer cells of the liver, become greatly distended with rickettsiae under these conditions. Preliminary experiments strongly suggest that advanced vitamin A deficiency, even when making animals markedly cachetic, does not have a comparable effect. Riboflavin deficient animals remain alive for several weeks with an abnormal intracellular metabolism. This type of deficiency is worthy of further study as a possible method of approach in the investigation of other intracellular parasites and filtrable viruses. Speculation regarding the mechanism concerned also suggests the desirability of a study of the effects of this deficiency upon the production of immune bodies in general."

Three types are noted: those producing rings with or without stimulation, those never producing rings, and a mixed or wild type, made up of a mixture of the first two types."

https://openalex.org/W2088662846,"A point function may be defined on the ""cells"" of cellular approximations to plane figures which retains much of the information of the figures and whose distribution function is relatively invariant with respect to cell size; the function is useful in constructing a quantitative field theory in embryology and a nonaddressed system for pattern generalizing in neurophysiology."
