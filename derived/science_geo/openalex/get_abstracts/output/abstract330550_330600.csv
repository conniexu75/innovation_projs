https://openalex.org/W2040058617,Soil-water equilibrium data suggest that the transfer of nonionic chemicals from water to soil may be described in terms of a hypothesis of solute partitioning in the soil organic matter. This concept allows estimation of soil-water distribution coefficients either from solvent-water partition coefficients or aqueous solubilities.
https://openalex.org/W2074673023,"A method is developed for evaluating the effects of cosmic rays on computer memories and is applied to some typical memory devices. The sea-level flux of cosmic-ray particles is reviewed and the interaction of each type of particle with silicon is estimated, with emphasis on processes that produce bursts of charge. These charge pulses are then related to typical computer large-scale integrated circuit components and cosmic-ray-induced errors are estimated. The effects of shielding (such as building ceilings and walls), altitude, and solar cycle are estimated. Cosmic-ray nucleons and muons can cause errors in current memories at a level of marginal significance, and there may be a very significant effect in the next generation of computer memory circuitry. Error rates increase rapidly with altitude, which may be used for testing to make electronic devices less sensitive to cosmic rays."
https://openalex.org/W2065979441,"Volume and structural data obtained by shock-wave and diamond-cell techniques demonstrate that calcium oxide transforms from the B1 (sodium chloride type) to the B2 (cesium chloride type) structure at 60 to 70 gigapascals (0.6 to 0.7 megabar) with a volume decrease of 11 percent. The agreement between the shockwave and diamond-cell results independently confirms the ruby-fluorescence pressure scale to about 65 gigapascals. The shock-wave data agree closely with ultrasonic measurements on the B1 phase and also agree satisfactorily with equations of state derived from ab initio calculations. The discovery of this B1-B2 transition is significant in that it allows considerable enrichment of calcium components in the earth's lower mantle, which is consistent with inhomogeneous accretion theories."
https://openalex.org/W2065807747,"Many major volcanic eruptions coincide with cooling trends of decadal or longer duration that began significantly before the eruptions. Dust veils provide positive feedback for short-term (less than 10 year) global cooling, but seem unlikely to trigger glaciations or even minor climate fluctuations in the 10-to 100-year range. On the contrary, variations in climate lead to stress changes on the earth's crust-for instance, by loading and unloading of ice and water masses and by axial and spin-rate changes that might augment volcanic (and seismic) potential."
https://openalex.org/W1965251035,"The bacterium that causes Pierce's disease of grapevines is isolated most consistently from the foregut of its leafhopper vector Graphocephala atropunctata. As seen in light and scanning electron microscopy of infective leafhoppers, the bacteria are attached to the cibarial pump and the lining of the esophagus in the foregut where they appear to multiply. These findings suggest that the bacterium is transmitted from the foregut by egestion during feeding by infective leafloppers."
https://openalex.org/W1982403073,"A detailed analysis of energy inputs and outputs is performed on grain-based gasohol (10 percent grain-based ethanol, 90 percent gasoline). Existing differences of opinion on the energy balance derive mainly from variations in interpretation which are several examples of inherent methodological problems in energy analysis. The result is strongly dependent on assumptions about use of crop residues for fuel and the miles-per-gallon rating of gasohol. In terms of total nonrenewable energy, gasohol is close to the energy break-even point. On the other hand, in terms of petroleum or petroleum-substitutable energy, gasohol is an unambiguous energy producer, since most energy inputs to the process can be supplied by nonpetroleum sources such as coal."

https://openalex.org/W2080668435,"Foliar applications of alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid, together with 6-benzyladenine, prevent the seed-induced degeneration (monocarpic senescence) in soybeans. In addition to halting leaf yellowing and shedding, this treatment prevents the loss of starch and nitrogen that occurs during senescence of these leaves. Although nitrogen and starch are normally redistributed to support pod growth, pod development is not impaired by this treatment, apparently because photosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation continue."

https://openalex.org/W1972589610,"Seventeen years of stream pH data indicate a trend of acidification in two small streams in the New Jersey Pine Barrens which drain relatively undisturbed areas. The decline in pH has amounted to approximately 0.4 unit, with an estimated increase in H(+) concentration of about 50 microequivalents per liter. The data collected to date are consistent with the postulation of an atmospheric source for the increased H(+)."

https://openalex.org/W2127341750,"Widmanstaetten patterns have been found in several specimens of josephinite, a complex, metamorphosed, metal-bearing rock from placers on serpentinized peridotite in southwest Oregon. The patterns, in interior less-altered regions of the specimens, are typical of exsolution textures produced during slow cooling of a homogeneous metal. The bulk composition of the metal phases indicates that the homogeneous metal must have existed at temperatures above 500Â°C. Josephinite Widmanstaetten patterns are the first known in terrestrial rock. We interpret them as further evidence that josephinite was derived from the mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2046266145,"The concentration of electrical energy usage in alternating-current motor drives presents an opportunity for substantial conservation. Emerging advances in power semiconductor transistor systems will support a major commerical effort to this end. An alternating-current synthesizer for this purpose may soon be available. The synthesizer produces electricial power of variable and programmable frequency, voltage, and wave form so that performance can be optimized. This technology provides the additional opportunity for fundamental improvements in electrical distribution and usage systems in the longer term. Power processing with semiconductor a-c motor controls is expected to become widespread in the near future."
