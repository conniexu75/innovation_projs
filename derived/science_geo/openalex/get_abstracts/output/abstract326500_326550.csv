https://openalex.org/W1974518293,"An interdependence between the geographical distribution of dextral and sinistral populations of the planktonic foraminifer, Globigerina pachyderma, and sea surface-temperatures is demonstrated. It is inferred that changes in dominant coiling direction at lower levels in sediment cores from the North Atlantic record southward shifts of isotherms during the last ice age."
https://openalex.org/W1980703521,"1) During the opening phase of the Early Cretaceous (Neocomian), angiosperms commenced to invade lowland basins of deposition at generally lower latitudes. They reached high northern and middle southern latitudes at the close of the epoch (Albian) and only replaced the relict Jurassic-type vegetation at high latitudes during the early part of Late Cretaceous time."

The results provide greater insight into the origin of the earth's atmosphere."

By photographic or electronic means, a past image can be subtracted from the present one to emphasize the moving parts of a motion picture scene. Rhythms and patterns of motion become more noticeable, and changes in velocity can give an impression of accelerations and the force pattern."

https://openalex.org/W2000936025,"IN reference to the letter of Messrs. Pocock and Bather, on the subject of the Zoological Record, in NATURE of November 16, I desire to state that the council of this Society (to which the Zoological Record at present belongs) quite agree with the above-named gentlemen in their wish to render the Zoological Record more complete by combining palaeozoology with it. With this view the council some time since addressed the Geological Society, and suggested what in their opinion would be an equitable arrangement for carrying out the plan. This arrangement, however, as will be seen by the copy of the correspondence enclosed herewith, was rejected by the council of the Geological Society. It remains, therefore, for Mr. Bather and such members of the Geological Society as may share his sentiments, to do their best to induce the council of the Geological Society to alter their views upon this question."
