https://openalex.org/W1591510379,"Angiotensin II acts on at least two distinct receptor subtypes (AT1 and AT2). Most known effects of angiotensin II in adult tissues are attributable to the AT1 receptor. The function of AT2 receptor is undefined, but its abundant expressions in fetal tissues, immature brain, skin wound, and atretic ovarian follicles suggest a role in growth and development. Previous studies suggested that AT2 receptor may not be G protein-coupled. Here, from a rat fetus expression library, we cloned a cDNA encoding a unique 363-amino acid protein with pharmacological specificity, tissue distribution, and developmental pattern of the AT2 receptor. It is 34% identical in sequence to the AT1 receptor, sharing a seven-transmembrane domain topology. A review of prior data on other receptors suggests that this receptor may belong to a unique class of seven-transmembrane receptors (including somatostatin SSTR1, dopamine D3, and frizzled protein Fz) for which G protein coupling has not been demonstrated. All members of this class exhibit fetal and developmental and/or neuronal-specific expression. A conserved motif in the third intracellular loop, distinguishing this class from classical G protein-coupled receptors, may mediate novel intracellular effects."
https://openalex.org/W1527240164,"There are two major isoforms of the angiotensin II receptor, type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2). AT2 is distinguished from AT1 with respect to its ligand selectivity, its insensitivity to non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues, and its as yet unidentified biological functions. In the present study we have expression-cloned AT2 cDNA from a cDNA library of a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12w). Rat AT2 cDNA encodes a 363-amino acid protein that has seven transmembrane domains. AT1 is the closest in homology to AT2 but with only a 32% identity of amino acid sequence. Stably expressed in COS-7 cells, the receptor showed selective binding to AT2-specific ligands PD123319 and CGP42112A but not to the AT1-specific ligand, losartan. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA of rat AT2 was expressed not only in PC12w cells but also in the adrenal glands and in the inferior olive of the brain, both of which are known to contain AT2 type binding sites. The expressed AT2 receptor mediated angiotensin II-induced inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase, an action that was dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-coupled mechanism in COS-7 cells. The AT2-specific ligand CGP42112A was an agonist rather than antagonist in the inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase. AT2 did not cause a decrease in cGMP in PC12w or COS-7 cells expressing AT2 stably. These results indicate that the AT2 receptor is structurally and functionally different from AT1 and suggest novel functional roles of the renin-angiotensin system in cross-talk with phosphotyrosine signaling by modulating protein phosphotyrosine levels."
https://openalex.org/W1601433695,"The major protein subunit of the paired helical filaments (PHF) of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau is a family of phosphopolypeptides that are abnormally phosphorylated in PHF. In this study, a non-PHF pool of tau abnormally phosphorylated at Ser-199/202, and tau not phosphorylated at this site (AD P-tau and AD tau, respectively) were isolated from the 27,000 x g to 200,000 x g fraction of AD brain homogenate by extraction in 8 M urea, followed by dialysis against Tris buffer. AD P-tau and AD tau were further purified and separated from each other by acid precipitation, glial fibrillary acidic protein affinity chromatography, and phosphocellulose chromatography. The resulting AD P-tau and AD tau preparations were free of cytoskeletal proteins, ubiquitin, and beta-amyloid peptide. Immunochemical and morphological analysis of AD P-tau preparations revealed that most of the protein was of non-PHF origin. The AD P-tau was about 3-4-fold (approximately 8 mol P04/mol protein, M(r) 41,318) more phosphorylated than cytosolic tau from AD and control brains. Unlike PHF, the AD P-tau lacked ubiquitin. In AD brain the levels of cytosolic tau were about half of those in control aged cases. These findings suggest that the abnormal phosphorylation of tau in AD occurs in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1564302359,"The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine-threonine kinases comprises at least eight members. These are differentially expressed, show varying affinities for activators such as Ca2+ and lipid species, and are therefore thought to play wide-ranging roles in the regulation of such cellular processes as differentiation, growth, and secretion. The aim of this study was to identify new PKC isoforms in the insulin-secreting cell line RINm5F that might be activated by the alterations in lipid metabolism that accompany nutrient-stimulated insulin release. Fragments of cDNA, derived from RINm5F cell mRNA, were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to highly conserved regions in the catalytic domains of all known PKCs. A novel sequence generated by this approach was subsequently used to screen cDNA libraries. The entire 587-amino acid coding region of a new PKC isoform, PKC iota, was deduced from two overlapping clones isolated from a human kidney cDNA library. The amino acid sequence of PKC iota showed greatest homology to PKC zeta, with 72% identity overall rising to 84% in the catalytic domain. In contrast, the homology of PKC iota to the other isoforms was less pronounced, with"

Chem. 267, 25676-25684), showed that ParC was 22 amino acids longer on the N terminus and ParE was 29 amino acids longer on the C terminus than reported previously. E. coli strains bearing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-based expression plasmids carrying both intact and truncated parC and parE were used to overproduce the ParC and ParE proteins. Full-length ParC and ParE were required to reconstitute Topo IV activity, whereas the truncated ParC and ParE were inactive. Topo IV activity was supported only by ATP or dATP. The [ATP]1/2 for DNA relaxation was 0.45 mM, almost 25-fold higher than the [ATP]1/2 for decatenation of kinetoplast DNA. Topo IV activity was inhibited by the quinolone and coumarin antibiotics, although the concentrations required for 50% inhibition of activity were 3-30-fold higher than those required to inhibit DNA gyrase. The norfloxacin-induced DNA cleavage patterns of Topo IV and DNA gyrase were distinct but overlapping. The native forms of ParC and ParE were a dimer and a monomer, respectively; whereas the active form of Topo IV was a heterotetramer, ParC2ParE2. The inactivity of the truncated forms of ParC and ParE could be attributed to their failure to form the heterotetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1512214997,"The gadd45 gene is transcriptionally activated through at least two different mechanisms; one following treatment with base-damaging agents such as methylmethane sulfonate and UV radiation and the other following ionizing radiation. To investigate the sequences involved in induction of gadd45 by agents producing high levels of base damage, the hamster, human, and mouse genes were sequenced. Comparison of these sequences revealed a high level of conservation between species of 1500 base pairs of the proximal promoter and 700 base pairs within the third intron. However, in the promoter regions, there was no conservation between species of any transcription factor binding sites known to confer DNA damage responsiveness. The promoter of the hamster gene was inducible by base-damaging agents in both rodent and human cell lines and the human gene was inducible in a rodent cell line. This indicates that both sequence elements in the gadd45 promoter and factors binding to these sites are conserved in mammalian cells. Deletion analysis of the hamster promoter did not reveal any specific sequence which conferred damage inducibility and the maximal response required a large portion of the promoter. The hamster promoter was not inducible by ionizing radiation, suggesting that sequences outside the promoter region used, such as a p53 binding site in the third intron, are necessary. The human GADD45 gene was mapped to chromosome 1p31.1-31.2."
https://openalex.org/W1481203098,"Botulinum C3 exoenzyme was used to specifically ADP-ribosylate and inactivate rho p21, and the effects of rho p21 inactivation on lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation were examined in cultured Swiss 3T3 cells. LPA induced a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins. Pretreatment of the cells with the C3 exoenzyme caused ADP-ribosylation of rho p21 in the cells and selectively attenuated the phosphorylation of several proteins, including p43 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p125 focal adhesion kinase, and two proteins of 72 and 88 kDa. C3 exoenzyme pretreatment did not block the initial phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase but suppressed its subsequent rise. In contrast, the enzyme treatment inhibited the induction of phosphorylation of the 72- and 88-kDa proteins and suppressed the basal and LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase. In addition, immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an antibody directed against the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) co-precipitated a tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 180 kDa. C3 exoenzyme pretreatment suppressed both the phosphorylation of this band and PI 3-kinase activation associated with LPA stimulation. These findings suggest that rho p21 works as a link between the LPA receptor signal and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486436311,"Overexpression of rab5 via a Sindbis virus vector resulted in a 2-3-fold stimulation of horseradish peroxidase uptake in BHK-21 cells. Based on this functional assay of rab5 activity, we conducted extensive mutational analysis of the structure-function relationship of rab5. A total of 21 deletion and substitution mutations were created and their effects on rab5 activity were examined. Deletion of the entire C-terminal tetrapeptide motif CCSN abolished rab5 activity. A mutant with the last three residues deleted, however, showed residual rab5 activity. Truncation of only two residues from the C terminus had no effect on the biological activity of rab5. A mutant containing a 4-residue deletion from the N terminus retained full activity in comparison with wild-type rab5. N-terminal deletion of 19 residues only partially blocked rab5 activity. Substitution mutations in the guanine nucleotide binding motifs showed dramatic effects on rab5 function. In addition to the previously reported N133I mutation, the S34N mutation also resulted in a guanine nucleotide binding defective form that was a dominant inhibitor of endogenous rab5 activity. The Q79L mutation (the ras equivalent Q61L decreases intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein-stimulated GTPase activities), however, had no effect on rab5 activity. The S35N mutation, which is immediately downstream of the first GTP/GDP binding motif, decreased guanine nucleotide binding by approximately 4-fold and partially inactivated rab5. Mutations in several other conserved residues (K22A, F57Y, and R81A) also resulted in partial loss of rab5 activity. Eight mutations in and around the putative effector domain had little effect on rab5 activity. In light of these data, the structure-function relationship of rab5 is discussed and compared with that of ras, the prototype of small GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W1533457677,"Stimulation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 by cross-linking either Fc gamma receptor I (Fc gamma RI) or Fc gamma receptor II (Fc gamma RII) gave rise to the rapid phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins. The pattern of proteins that were phosphorylated appeared to be identical. Analysis of these proteins by specific immunoprecipitation indicated that stimulation through either receptor did indeed give rise to phosphorylation of the same set of proteins. These included: Fc gamma RII, phospholipase C (PLC) gamma 1, PLC gamma 2, Vav, GAP, and a protein that co-precipitated with the Fc gamma receptors and migrated with a molecular weight of about 70,000. Co-cross-linking an F(ab')2 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody together with monoclonal antibodies to either of the Fc gamma receptors inhibited phosphorylation of all these proteins. Analysis of the tyrosine kinases in the cells revealed that both receptors stimulated the phosphorylation and activation of a kinase recognized by antibodies to Syk. Furthermore, the Syk kinase became associated with the Fc gamma RII following receptor cross-linking. These data indicate that although the two Fc gamma receptors have different cytoplasmic tails, they are coupled to the same signal transduction cascade that is regulated by CD45 and involves the activation of Syk."
https://openalex.org/W1505650637,"Although phospholipase C hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides constitutes one of the major second messenger pathways in animal cells, its participation in signal transduction in higher plants has not been established. To determine whether activation of phosphatidylinositol-directed phospholipase C might be involved in signaling the elicitor-induced oxidative burst in plants, suspension-cultured soybean cells were treated with two stimulants of the H2O2 burst and examined for polyphosphoinositide turnover. Both polygalacturonic acid elicitor and the G protein activator, mastoparan, promoted a transient increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) content that exceeded basal IP3 levels (0.9 +/- 0.4 pmol of IP3/10(6) cells, n = 28) by 2.6- and 7-fold, respectively. In each case, intracellular IP3 content reached a maximum at 1 min post-stimulation and declined to near basal levels during the subsequent 5-10 min. Neomycin sulfate, an inhibitor of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, blocked the IP3 transient, and Mas-17, an inactive analogue of mastoparan, induced no change in IP3. Thin layer chromatography of lipid extracts of the soybean cells corroborated the above results by revealing a rapid decrease in phosphatidyl-inositol monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate following polygalacturonic acid elicitor and mastoparan (but not Mas-17) stimulation. Since the rise in IP3 preceded H2O2 production and since neomycin sulfate inhibited the appearance of both, we hypothesize that phospholipase C activation might constitute one pathway by which elicitors trigger the soybean oxidative burst."
https://openalex.org/W1529838344,"The Alcaligenes eutrophus 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, encoded by the tfdA gene of plasmid pJP4, is an Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate to 2,4-dichlorophenol and glyoxylate concomitant with the decomposition of alpha-ketoglutarate to form succinate and carbon dioxide (Fukumori, F., and Hausinger, R. P. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 2083-2086). Using recombinant Escherichia coli cells that overexpress the tfdA gene, the thermolabile enzyme (stable only up to 30 degrees C) was purified to apparent homogeneity (specific activity of 16.9 mumol of substrate converted min-1 mg of protein-1) by a simple two-step procedure. The native protein has an apparent M(r) of 50,000 +/- 2,500, consistent with a homodimeric structure. Ferrous ion is absolutely required for activity and cannot be replaced by several other divalent cations tested. Ascorbic acid stimulates dioxygenase activity and reduces the rate of enzyme inactivation by a metal ion-mediated process. The enzyme exhibits maximum activity at pH 6.5-7, however, it is stable over a pH range of 6.5-11. Although capable of hydroxylating a wide range of phenoxyacetates and related compounds, the enzyme exhibits the greatest affinity (Km 17.5 +/- 1.0 microM) and highest catalytic efficiency for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate. Similarly, alpha-ketoglutarate is the preferred co-substrate (Km 3.20 +/- 0.54 microM) for the enzyme, but it can utilize a range of other alpha-ketoacids with lower efficiency. Results from chemical modification studies are consistent with the presence of multiple essential histidine residues in the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1545684494,"A gene (PSD1) encoding a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned by complementation of a conditional lethal mutation in the homologous gene in Escherichia coli strain EH150. Expression of the cDNA clone in EH150 corrected growth, phospholipid, and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity defects. Expression of the genomic clone in wild type yeast resulted in 20-fold amplification of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity. A 1500-base pair open reading frame encodes a 56,558-Da protein with a potential mitochondrial targeting sequence. Upstream regulatory elements found in other enzymes of the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway are present in PSD1. The derived amino acid sequence shows 44 and 35% identity with the phosphatidylserine decarboxylases from Chinese hamster ovary cells and E. coli, respectively. Near the carboxyl terminus is an LGST sequence which, in E. coli, is the site of proteolytic cleavage of the proenzyme into the alpha and beta subunits and formation of the pyruvate prosthetic group (Dowhan, W., and Li, Q.-X. (1992) Methods Enzymol. 209, 348-359). Disruption of the PSD1 gene in a haploid strain of yeast resulted in loss of detectable decarboxylase activity but little alteration of the growth properties or phospholipid composition. These results suggest that yeast has a second phosphatidylserine decarboxylation activity."
https://openalex.org/W1519478770,"The regulation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation by phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of an 85-kDa, arachidonoyl-hydrolyzing PLA2 was investigated in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases, stimulated arachidonic acid release, supporting a role for phosphorylation events in regulating PLA2 activation. In response to zymosan, PMA, or A23187, arachidonic acid was released at a linear rate up to 30-45 min after stimulation, whereas there was a 30-min lag preceding arachidonic acid release in response to okadaic acid. The 85-kDa PLA2 was phosphorylated on serine in the macrophages, and the level of phosphorylation increased in response to zymosan, PMA, okadaic acid, and, to a lesser extent, A23187. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping revealed multiple phosphopeptides, several of which showed increased phosphorylation in response to zymosan, okadaic acid, and PMA. Zymosan, PMA, A23187, or okadaic acid stimulated time-dependent increases in PLA2 activity in the cytosolic fraction. PLA2 activation was most rapid in response to PMA, whereas activation in response to okadaic acid was delayed similar to the time course of arachidonic acid release. The cytosolic PLA2 had characteristics of the 85-kDa enzyme, including kinetic properties and substrate preference. Phosphatase treatment of the cytosols dephosphorylated the 85-kDa PLA2 and reversed the increase in activity. The results provide evidence that phosphorylation of the 85-kDa PLA2, induced by stimuli that induce arachidonic acid release, is an important mechanism for activation of the enzyme in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1546729302,"The alpha-amylase from Pyrococcus furiosus, a hyperthermophilic archaebacterium, has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 66 kDa. The isoelectric point is 4.3. The enzyme displays optimal activity, with substantial thermal stability, at 100 degrees C, with the onset of activity at approximately 40 degrees C. Unlike mesophilic alpha-amylases there is no dependence on Ca2+ for activity or thermostability. The enzyme displays a broad range of substrate specificity, with the capacity to hydrolyze carbohydrates as simple as maltotriose. No subtrate binding occurs below the temperature threshold of activity, and a decrease in Km accompanies an increase in temperature. Except for a decrease in Asp and an increase in Glu, the amino acid composition does not confirm previously defined trends in thermal adaption. Fourth derivative UV spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence measurements detected no temperature-dependent structural reorganization. Hydrogen exchange results indicate that the molecule is rigid, with only a slight increase in conformational flexibility at elevated temperature. Scanning microcalorimetry detected no considerable change in the heat capacity function, at the pH of optimal activity, within the temperature range in which activity is induced. The heat absorption peak due to denaturation, under these conditions, occurred within the temperature range of 90-120 degrees C. When the pH was increased, a change in the shape of the heat absorption peak was observed, which when analyzed thermodynamically shows that the process of heat denaturation is complex, and includes at least three stages, indicating that the protein structure consists of three domains. At temperatures below 90 degrees C no excess heat absorption or change in the CD spectra were observed which could be associated with the cooperative conformational transition of the protein. According to the thermodynamic characteristics of the heat denaturation, the cold denaturation of this protein can be expected only at -3 degrees C. Therefore, the observed inactivation of this enzyme is not caused by the cooperative change of its tertiary structure. It can be associated only with the gradual changes of protein domain interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1601289231,"A gene encoding a highly thermostable alpha-amylase from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the gene predicts a 649-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 76.3 kDa, which corresponds well with the value obtained from purified enzyme using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The NH2 terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence corresponds precisely to that obtained from the purified enzyme, excluding the NH2-terminal methionine. The amylase expressed in E. coli exhibits temperature-dependent activation characteristic of of the original enzyme from P. furiosus, but has a higher apparent molecular weight which is attributed to the improper formation of the native quaternary structure. No homology was found with previously characterized promotor or termination sequences. The deduced amino acid sequence displayed strong homology to the alpha-amylase A of Dictyoglomus thermophilum, an obligately anaerobic, extremely thermophilic bacterium. Evolutionary implications of this homology are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1565494365,"In Xenopus, the germ cell-specific Y-box (CTGATTGGCCAA) factor, FRGY2, facilitates in vitro transcription in egg extracts from oocyte-selective promoters containing a Y-box. This same factor is a major component of the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) storage particles of the oocyte. These particles store maternal mRNAs and inhibit their translation. FRGY2 is identical to mRNP4 and homologous to mRNP3, two previously described oocyte-specific mRNP proteins. We demonstrate that FRGY2 associates with a broad spectrum of mRNAs exhibiting no apparent sequence specificity. These interactions suggest that FRGY2 has a general role in packaging mRNA analogous to that of histone with DNA. All mRNAs examined that accumulate in oocytes appear within these mRNP storage particles, including messages coding for proteins such as FRGY2 and TFIIIA, which are translated in the oocyte. Moreover, we show that mRNAs that are translationally repressed in oocytes, such as messages coding for the proteins histone H1 and FRGY1, accumulate only within the particles. These mRNAs are subsequently recruited from the particles to the ribosomes and utilized for translation during embryogenesis prior to transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. We propose that the assembly of mRNP storage particles represents a default state and that translational regulation is achieved via specific recruitment of the messages from the mRNP fraction to the ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1507389214,"A gene encoding transketolase, TKL1, was cloned from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using oligonucleotide primers derived from protein sequence data. The TKL1 sequence predicts a 74-kDa polypeptide which is related to other transketolases. A sequence comparison revealed that the transketolases can be subdivided into three evolutionary branches. We also found that the transketolases are related to another vitamin B1-dependent enzyme: the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli. Gene disruption and overexpression experiments were used to investigate the function of transketolase in yeast. We found that growth on fermentable carbon sources, but not on gluconeogenic carbon sources, is reduced in cells disrupted for TKL1. This suggests that the glycolytic efficiency is impaired. Growth on fermentable carbon sources is also reduced in cells that overexpress TKL1. Finally, we found that cells disrupted for TKL1 are unable to grow in the absence of aromatic amino acids. This is most likely due to the fact that transketolase is required for the synthesis of erythrose-4-P, a precursor of the aromatic amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1681309649,"Interaction with a receptor is the first step in the process of signal transduction by heterotrimeric (alpha beta gamma) G proteins. We have examined the role of the G protein gamma subunit in interaction between a receptor (rhodopsin) and a G protein, transducin (Gt). We have obtained recombinant beta gamma complexes containing the same beta subunit but three different gamma subunit types by expressing them in the baculovirus/insect cell system. We show that the different recombinant beta gamma complexes interact equally well with the alpha subunit of transducin (alpha t) but only the gamma subunit specific to rod photoreceptors (gamma 1) is able to support interaction of alpha t with rhodopsin. This indicates a direct role for the G protein gamma subunits, which are a family of proteins with diverse structures, in conferring specificity to receptor-G protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1601723642,"Mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and mutants changing residues thought to be involved at the active site were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate-agarose affinity column, and tested for their kinetic properties and their inactivation by enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors. All of the mutant enzymes were expressed at comparable levels to the wild type protein (2-4% of the total soluble protein), all bound to the affinity column, and there were only small differences in the apparent Km values for L-ornithine providing strong evidence that the mutations did not lead to any gross changes in the protein structure. The mutation K69A led to a change in the spectrum of the enzyme and a 550-fold decrease in the kcat/Km (specificity constant) value. These results are consistent with lysine 69 being the residue that forms a Schiff base with the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate co-factor. Mutation C70S did not greatly affect the activity despite its proximity to this lysine but increased the Km about 2-fold. In contrast, the mutation C360A greatly reduced the specificity constant (by 26-fold) despite a 2-fold decrease in the Km, suggesting that this cysteine residue is critically involved at the active site. Although cysteine 360 is known to be the major site of binding of the inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), the C360A mutant was still sensitive to inhibition by this drug. However, the kinetics of inactivation were altered, the partition ratio was 10 times greater, and the labeled adduct formed by reaction with [5-14C]DFMO was removed from the protein under some denaturing conditions. This adduct was found to occur at lysine 69. The K69A mutant was also sensitive to DFMO with a lower partition ratio than the wild type enzyme. These results indicate that inactivation of ODC by DFMO can occur via interaction with either of two separate residues that form essential parts of the active site. This renders it unlikely that resistant mutants will arise from changes in the enzyme structure. In contrast to the results with DFMO, the C360A mutant ODC was completely resistant to inactivation by (R,R)-delta-methyl-alpha-acetylenicputrescine and was much less sensitive than the wild type enzyme to alpha-monofluoromethyldehydromethylornithine, showing that the reactive species formed from these inhibitors either cannot be formed by this mutant or are unable to react with lysine 69.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1485943646,"We have identified and cloned a new member of the trk gene family, termed trkE, which generates a 3.9-kilobase (kb) transcript in normal human keratinocytes and in a variety of normal human tissues, but not in liver. Albeit at low level, trkE transcript is expressed also by PC12 cells. The open reading frame codes for a polypeptide of 876 amino acids exhibiting the classic features of cell surface tyrosine protein kinases. trkE catalytic domain is 41% identical to trkA and shows several features unique to the trk gene family. Its extracellular domain does not show significant homology to any known proteins. trkE is the first member of this gene family found abundantly and widely expressed in normal human tissues. Several lines of evidence suggest that NGF is also the ligand for trkE; (i) normal human keratinocytes bind NGF with high affinity, (ii) NGF stimulates keratinocyte growth in an autocrine fashion, (iii) NGF exerts its biological effect on keratinocytes through the stimulation of a trk-specific tyrosine kinase, and (iv) keratinocytes lack trkA but do express large amount of trkE. trkE might also be the NGF receptor by other human peripheral tissues, such as pancreatic islets, and might represent a non-neuronal receptor for this ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1509315828,"We have applied in vitro selection methods to achieve a large increase in the catalytic activity of a hairpin ribozyme targeted against a highly conserved 14-nucleotide sequence within HIV-1 pol RNA. The substrate specificity was changed by mutating 8 bases within the substrate-binding domain of the parental (-)sTRSV ribozyme. The resulting enzyme cleaved the HIV substrate specifically but with a 20-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). Following random mutagenesis, ribozymes with increased activity against the target sequence were selected through 10 rounds of in vitro selection. Selective pressure was increased by decreasing MgCl2 and spermidine concentrations, and reducing reaction time. Variant ribozymes with base substitutions A11—>G and U39—>C were selected in the population. These mutations were introduced singly and in combination into the trans-acting anti-HIV ribozyme. Each of the single-base substitutions significantly increased ribozyme activity, while the activity of double mutant was increased to nearly the level of the parental ribozyme. These findings demonstrate that in vitro selection is a powerful and efficient method to optimize ribozymes for the catalytic inactivation of targeted RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1557726616,"We have recently purified a novel human serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin), designated as kallistatin, which binds to tissue kallikrein and inhibits kallikrein's kininogenase and amidolytic activities. In the present studies, we have cloned a full-length cDNA encoding kallistatin from human liver RNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA is 1284 base pairs in length and encodes 427 amino acid residues, including a 26-residue signal peptide and a 401-residue mature peptide. The translated amino acid sequence of kallistatin matches with the protein sequence and shares 44-46% sequence identity with human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, protein C inhibitor, corticosteroid-binding globulin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, thyroxin-binding globulin, and rat kallikrein-binding protein. Kallistatin is a new member of the serpin superfamily with a unique reactive site P1-P1' of Phe-Ser. Four potential glycosylation sites are found in the translated amino acid sequence of kallistatin. In a Southern blot analysis following reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction, kallistatin was found to be expressed in human liver, stomach, pancreas, kidney, aorta, testes, prostate, artery, atrium, ventricle, lung, renal proximal tubular cell, and a colonic carcinoma cell line T84. A genomic Southern blot using the full-length kallistatin cDNA probe revealed simple banding patterns suggesting the gene encoding kallistatin is single-copied. The kallistatin cDNA encoding the mature peptide was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant kallistatin forms an SDS-stable complex with 125I-human tissue kallikrein and has a molecular mass of 40 kDa. The cloning of human kallistatin cDNA established the identity of the novel kallikrein inhibitor and its expression in a functional form in E. coli provides means for studying its structure-function relationship through protein engineering."

To assess the importance of each gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residue we made, by site directed mutagenesis, a series of mutant human prothrombins each with a single glutamic acid to aspartic acid substitution at positions 6, 7, 14, 16, 19, 20, 25, 26, 29, or 32 which are gamma-carboxylated in native prothrombin. Along with wild-type prothrombin, the prothrombin mutants were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using polyclonal anti-prothrombin antibodies, and shown by amino acid analysis to contain the expected number of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. Only substitution of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid 6 with aspartic acid yields a protein with procoagulant activity, affinity for phospholipid and KM(app) for prothrombinase indistinguishable from wild-type prothrombin. In contrast, the conservative gamma-carboxyglutamic acid to aspartic acid mutation at positions 16, 26, or 29 results in proteins with little or no procoagulant activity, Kd(app) for binding to phospholipid at least 200-fold higher than wild-type prothrombin and a KM(app) for interaction with the prothrombinase complex nearly 100-fold higher than wild-type prothrombin. The mutations at residues 7, 14, 19, 20, 25, or 32 yielded proteins with intermediate procoagulant activities, between 15 and 52% of wild-type prothrombin. These data have been interpreted to suggest that there are certain gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues which are important to maintaining the basic structure of the calcium-liganded Gla domain while other gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues subserve other functions including membrane binding and interdomain interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1522341023,"Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is a highly conserved protein functioning in peptide elongation during translation. A cDNA, S1, was isolated; its deduced amino acid sequence shares high similarity with mammalian EF-1 alpha s (92%). While EF-1 alpha is present in all tissues, S1 mRNA can only be detected in brain, heart, and muscle. We report here that the retropseudogene phenomenon is attributable to EF-1 alpha and not S1, the latter being represented by a single copy in the rat genome. The S1 steady-state mRNA levels are consistently higher than EF-1 alpha in S1-positive tissues. S1 mRNA can only be detected late during brain, heart, and muscle development in vivo and increases to a plateau in early postnatal life. In a cultured muscle system, S1 expression is dependent upon the formation of myotubes, although the accumulation of S1 mRNA is significantly lower than that observed in adult skeletal muscle. EF-1 alpha mRNA levels are down-regulated during brain, heart, and muscle development, but stay relatively steady in liver. We show here that EF-1 alpha and S1 are differentially expressed during rat development and that the activation of S1 gene expression is subsequent to the terminal differentiation process in brain, heart, and muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1590296587,"Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor responsible for activating growth hormone (GH) and prolactin genes. Here, we describe the isolation of a rainbow trout cDNA clone that contains the entire Pit-1 coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence contains 358 residues, encoding a 39-kDa protein. Comparison of the protein sequences of the rainbow trout and rat Pit-1 shows that the 160 residue POU domain at the C terminus is highly conserved (86% identical). However, homology is much weaker in the N-terminal region (56% identical), and the rainbow trout Pit-1 contains segments of 29 and 33 amino acids that are not present in rat Pit-1. The protein produced by expression of rainbow trout Pit-1 cDNA in Escherichia coli binds specifically to at least four sites in the rainbow trout GH gene promoter. Moreover, we demonstrate that the promoter region of salmon somatolactin gene, which belongs to the GH prolactin gene family and is also expressed specifically in the pituitary, has at least five rainbow trout Pit-1 binding sites. The consensus sequence of these binding sites closely matches the 9-base pair motif, (T/A)(T/A)TATNCAT, recognized by rat Pit-1. Rainbow trout Pit-1 specifically activates rainbow trout GH promoter fusion gene expression, confirming the ability of Pit-1 to bind in a transcriptionally active conformation in GH gene promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1529499262,"The neuron-specific proteins SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein 25 kDa), synaptobrevin and syntaxin, are localized to presynaptic terminals in mammals and have been found to associate with proteins involved in vesicle docking and membrane fusion. We describe here SNAP-25 cDNA clones from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the ray Torpedo marmorata. In situ hybridization showed that SNAP-25 mRNA is exclusively found in brain and ganglia in Drosophila with a pattern suggesting expression in most neurons. The Drosophila and Torpedo proteins show 61 and 81% amino acid identity to mouse SNAP-25, a degree of conservation similar to that previously reported for synaptobrevin. None of the SNAP-25 sequences has a membrane-spanning region, but all contain a cluster of cysteine residues that can be palmitoylated for membrane attachment. SNAP-25 displays sequence similarity to syntaxin A and B. These data show that SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin, which are both implicated in vesicle docking and/or membrane fusion, have both been highly conserved during evolution. This supports the existence of a basic molecular machinery for synaptic vesicle docking in vertebrate and invertebrate synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1517653810,"Replacement of the presequence of yeast cytochrome c1 by the amino-terminal 61 residues of MAS70, a yeast mitochondrial outer membrane protein, resulted in exclusive localization of the fusion protein (termed the 61-mC1 protein) to the outer membrane. When a cytochrome c1-deficient yeast strain was transformed with a plasmid encoding the fusion protein, the cells could not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. We isolated a novel yeast gene MSP1 (mitochondrial sorting of proteins) whose overexpression causes mislocalization of the 61mC1 fusion protein to the inner membrane, probably via the intermembrane space, and thereby allows the host cells to grow on glycerol. The predicted MSP1 protein (MSP1) is a hydrophilic 40-kDa polypeptide containing a putative membrane-spanning domain near the amino terminus. Further sequence analyses revealed that MSP1 is a member of a novel family of putative ATPases which share a highly conserved domain of about 185 amino acid residues, including a consensus motif for a nucleotide binding site. MSP1 was found to be an intrinsic mitochondrial outer membrane protein of an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa with a large domain facing to the cytosol. The MSP1 gene is not essential for the cell growth either on fermentable or nonfermentable carbon sources."
https://openalex.org/W1482613590,"Membrane binding of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) is GTP-dependent and seems to require amino-terminal myristoylation. Recently it has been proposed that myristoylation is needed not for the activation of ARF by GTP but for its subsequent association to membranes. Here we show that unmyristoylated bovine ARF1, expressed in bacteria, can be efficiently loaded with GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thio)triphosphate) at 1 microM free Mg2+, in the presence of phospholipids. Unmyristoylated ARFGTP gamma S cosediments with phospholipid vesicles and totally binds to phospholipid-cholate micelles, as seen by gel filtration chromatography. We therefore propose that, in vivo, myristoylation is required for the interaction of ARFGDP with its membrane-bound exchange factor rather than for the association of ARFGTP with lipid membranes. Phospholipid-bound ARFGTP gamma S can also stably interact with and activate the catalytic subunit of cholera toxin, suggesting that ARFGTP provides a membrane anchor for cholera toxin and thereby facilitates its access to membrane-bound substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1510616039,"Calsequestrin is an intermediate affinity, high capacity Ca(2+)-binding protein found in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Previous sequence analysis suggested that calsequestrin may contain a hydrophobic binding site for the drug trifluoperazine, a site shared by the calmodulin family and shown to play a role in calmodulin/calmodulin receptor interaction. Previous studies showed that, upon Ca2+ binding, calsequestrin undergoes a conformational change, burying the trifluoperazine-binding site, folding into a more compact structure that is trypsin-resistant, and increasing the negative ellipticity of the circular dichroism spectrum. In this study, the structural and functional roles of the trifluoperazine-binding site in the Ca(2+)-induced conformational change of calsequestrin are further studied using the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and melittin. If trifluoperazine or melittin is added to calsequestrin prior to Ca2+ addition, then Ca(2+)-induced folding is inhibited as determined by the changes in circular dichroism spectra and protein sensitivity to trypsin digestion. If, however, Ca2+ is added prior to trifluoperazine or melittin, calsequestrin remains resistant to trypsin digestion, just as if the calmodulin antagonists are not present, suggesting that the conformational change is not affected. Aggregates of calsequestrin that exhibit high Ca2+ binding capacity have previously been shown to occur at high Ca2+ and calsequestrin concentrations. By preventing a prerequisite folding step, trifluoperazine or melittin also prevents the Ca(2+)-induced aggregation of calsequestrin, thus decreasing the maximal Ca2+ binding by calsequestrin. These data suggest that the trifluoperazine-binding site is critically involved in the Ca(2+)-induced intramolecular folding step required for the intermolecular interactions leading to high capacity Ca(2+)-binding by calsequestrin."
https://openalex.org/W15225809,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) plays an important role in the process of atherosclerosis which is characterized by the presence of macrophage-derived foam cells. In the present study, the induction of the mRNA of PDGF-beta receptor was demonstrated during cell differentiation of human monocyte-macrophages, whereas no mRNA was detected in the cells during the early days of culture. Flow cytometry analysis using antibodies specific for PDGF-beta receptor and CD14 showed the presence of both PDGF-beta receptor and CD14 on human monocyte-derived macrophages, whereas no PDGF-beta receptor was detected on human monocytes 4 h after cell adhesion to a culture dish. In the binding assay of PDGF-BB on human monocyte-derived macrophages, a saturable and high affinity binding site with Kd of 27.5 pM and Bmax of 23.3 fmol/mg of cell protein was demonstrated. When human monocytes were cultured in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, PDGF-beta receptor induction was inhibited, and tetradecanoylphorbol acetate enhanced PDGF-beta receptor expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages, indicating that PDGF-beta receptor expression is associated with maturation and differentiation of monocyte-macrophages through the activation of protein kinase C. In response to PDGF-BB homodimer, PDGF-beta receptor was phosphorylated, and thymidine uptake and inositol trisphosphate production were stimulated in monocyte-derived macrophages. Furthermore, PDGF-BB suppressed the production of macrophages colony-stimulating factor in macrophages. The expression of PDGF-beta receptor on human monocyte-derived macrophages suggests that PDGF influences the process of atherosclerosis by regulating the function of macrophages as well as smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall."
https://openalex.org/W1551396948,"The mouse Kv1-5 K+ channel cDNA has been cloned from heart. This channel was highly expressed in heart and, to a lesser extent, in other tissues, including brain and thymus. Two alternatively spliced isoforms were found. The longer form encoded a 602-amino acid protein, while in the short form (Kv1-5 delta 5'), the first 200 amino acids lying upstream the transmembrane segment S1 were deleted. RNase protection experiments showed that both Kv1-5 mRNA isoforms are present in the mouse tissues examined, the longer form being predominant. The short mRNA (Kv1-5 delta 5') arose by an unusual splicing event within the exonic sequence. An additional short cDNA clone (Kv1-5 delta 3') that codes for a carboxyl-terminal truncated protein has been isolated. The gene coding sequence contained a single exon and has been mapped on human chromosome 12 (p13) and on mouse chromosome 6 (band F). Expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed that the long (Kv1-5) and the amino-terminal deleted (Kv1-5 delta 5') isoforms elicited similar K+ currents with a drastically decreased efficacy for Kv1-5 delta 5'. The carboxyl-terminal truncated Kv1-5 delta 3' clone was not functional but inhibited the expression of the long isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1522260796,"The chaperone protein Hsc70 is an ATPase of unknown mechanism, although the crystal structure of the 44-kDa ATPase domain has been solved. This structure shows that the hydroxyl of threonine 204 is located close to the gamma-phosphate of ATP, in a position where it might be an intermediate phosphate acceptor in the hydrolysis reaction. We made two point mutations at residue 204 of Hsc70, threonine to valine (T204V) and threonine to glutamic acid (T204E). The wild-type ATPase domain had a Km for ATP of approximately 1 microM; the mutants had Km values of approximately 90 microM. The kcat values for the mutant proteins were also increased. After crystallization, the structures of the T204V and T204E proteins were solved and refined with data to 2.3- and 2.4-A resolution, respectively. The overall tertiary structure of the mutants showed little change from the wild type; however, significant changes were observed in the active site. Analysis of the structures suggested possible reasons for the changes in kinetic constants. Threonine 204 does not seem to be an obligatory intermediate phosphate acceptor in the hydrolysis reaction since the mutants retained appreciable ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1494237198,"Cell-CAM105 proteins (also called C-CAM) are epithelial cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. The sequences of C-CAM are highly homologous to those of human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-family proteins. In previous studies using baculoviral vectors, we showed that expression of the L-form cell-CAM105 (also called C-CAM1) in insect cells resulted in cell aggregation (Cheung, P. H., Thompson, N. L., Earley, K., Culic, O., Hixson, D., and Lin, S. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 6139-6146). This result indicates that the insect-cell system is suitable for studying the adhesion function of C-CAM. Since C-CAM1 contains four extracellular Ig-domains, the structural features directly responsible for C-CAM1 adhesion function were investigated by site-directed deletion and expression in the baculovirus/insect cell system. Results from these studies indicated that the first Ig domain located in the NH2-terminal of C-CAM plays a crucial role in intercellular adhesion. Site-directed deletion producing mutants lacking the second, third, or fourth Ig domains had no effect on the adhesion function. In addition, adhesion function was retained when both the third and fourth Ig domains were deleted, although the adhesion activity was reduced to half that in control cells. However, simultaneous deletion of the second, third, and fourth domains abolished adhesion, suggesting that these domains affect the accessibility of the binding site localized in the first domain. In our previous studies, we showed that the cytoplasmic domains of C-CAM play a significant role in the isoforms' adhesion activity since expression of a C-CAM isoform containing only 6 instead of 71 amino acids intracellularly failed to show the adhesion phenotype (Cheung, P. H., Culic, O., Qiu, Y., Earley, K., Thompson, N., Hixson, D. C., and Lin, S.-H. (1993) Biochem. J. 295, in press). These results together suggest that both the cytoplasmic domain and the first N-terminal Ig-like domain are required for C-CAM-mediated cell adhesion activity."
https://openalex.org/W1480540532,"Two RNA binding activities were demonstrated in bovine liver homogenate. One binding protein was isolated by a simple ion exchange and gel filtration protocol and was shown by N-terminal protein sequence analysis to be glutamate dehydrogenase. Using identical RNA substrate and assay conditions, no detectable RNA binding was observed with equimolar amounts of other representative dehydrogenases and proteins. Furthermore, excesses of tRNA, salmon testis DNA, or each of the four homoribopolymers were unable to compete for the RNA-binding site. Total cytosolic RNA, however, successfully prevented binding of radiolabeled RNA substrate. These data are consistent with glutamate dehydrogenase containing a binding site for heteropolymeric RNA with highest affinity for an as yet undefined nucleotide consensus sequence or structure. The potential physiological relevance of these observations is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1600234976,"Characterization of an endoprotease-deficient mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell, designated RPE.40, revealed that it bound less than 10% as much insulin as did its parent, CHO-K1. We examined processing of the endogenous insulin receptor in CHO-K1 and RPE.40 cells, and processing of the human insulin receptor expressed in these cells. RPE.40 cells did not process the endogenous insulin proreceptor to its subunit forms, and processed the human insulin proreceptor inefficiently. Accumulation of the proreceptor form of the insulin receptor was seen in both cases. Furin is a mammalian endoprotease that cleaves proproteins at a consensus sequence of basic amino acids found in the insulin proreceptor. Expression of mouse furin in RPE.40 cells restored normal processing of the endogenous and the human insulin receptor in these cells. In addition, expression of mouse furin corrected the reduced binding of insulin in RPE.40 cells, indicating that receptor function as well as processing was restored."
https://openalex.org/W1488034932,"Transcriptional regulation by thyroid hormone is mediated through its nuclear receptors, which bind to target response elements as homodimers or as heterodimers with proteins such as retinoid X receptors (RXR). Thyroid hormone response elements exhibit remarkable flexibility in that the receptor binding half-sites can be arranged as direct repeats, inverted repeats, or everted repeats. We report that a limited region at the carboxyl-terminal end of the thyroid hormone receptor differentially contributes to the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers. The functionally inactive thyroid hormone receptor splicing variant alpha 2, which is altered at the juncture of the homo- and heterodimerization domains, cannot form homodimers. However, alpha 2 can form a heterodimer when bound to half-sites arranged as a direct repeat spaced by 4 base pairs (DR4), but not with other arrangements of response element half-sites. The alpha 2-RXR heterodimer strongly inhibits wild type receptor function mediated by the DR4 element, suggesting that the alpha 2 isoform modulates thyroid hormone action by binding as an antagonist to a subset of response elements."
https://openalex.org/W1559073162,"The genes encoding methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase from Veillonella parvula were cloned on plasmids using oligonucleotides derived from N-terminal amino acid sequences as specific probes. The entire DNA sequence of the methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase genes together with upstream and downstream regions was determined. The genes encoding subunits alpha (mmdA), delta (mmdD), epsilon (mmdE), gamma (mmdC), and beta (mmdB) of the decarboxylase were clustered on the chromosome in the given order. The previously unnoted epsilon-chain (M(r) 5,888) was clearly shown to be a subunit of the decarboxylase by correspondence of the N-terminal amino acid sequence with that deduced from the DNA sequence of mmdE. The alpha-subunit was 60% identical with the carboxyltransferase domain of rat liver propionyl-CoA carboxylase, the beta-subunit showed 61% sequence identity with the beta-subunit of oxaloacetate decarboxylase from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the biotin-containing gamma-subunit was 29-39% identical with biotin-domains of other biotin enzymes. The delta-subunit of methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase and the gamma-subunit of oxaloacetate decarboxylase did not show significant sequence homology. The gross structure of both proteins, however, was similar, consisting of a hydrophobic membrane anchor near the N terminus, a proline/alanine linker, and a remarkable accumulation of charged amino acids in the C-terminal part. The sequence of the small epsilon-subunit could be aligned to the C-terminal region of the delta-subunit downstream of the proline/alanine linker, where the two subunits were 47% identical. Of considerable interest for the mechanism of Na+ transport are the long stretches of complete sequence identity between the hydrophobic beta-subunits of methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase and the presence of two conserved aspartic acid residues within putative membrane-spanning helices."

The purified enzyme is distinct from human EC-SOD C (Hjalmarsson, K., Marklund, S. L., Engstrom, A., and Edlund, T. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The rat EC-SOD is a dimer with a subunit M(r) of 34,000-36,000 and is extensively modified by post-translational processing. Although rat EC-SOD has a high sequence homology with the catalytic center and the polybasic heparin-binding site near the COOH terminus of human EC-SOD C, its NH2-terminal sequence and the sequences flanking the heparin-binding site differ substantially. The sequence of the isolated rat EC-SOD cDNA fully confirms the data obtained from amino acid sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme and its biochemical properties support its identification as the rat EC-SOD B."
https://openalex.org/W1504298894,"Rab3A/smg25A is a small Ras-like guanine nucleotide binding protein implicated in the control of regulated secretion from cells. Rab3A is approximately 30% cytosolic and 70% associated with the membranes of secretory vesicles. It cross-links specifically to a rat brain membrane protein of about 85 kilodaltons (p85). To identify epitopes on Rab3A that are important for its interaction with this putative target protein, we have determined the effects of point mutations on the cross-linking efficiency of Rab3A to p85. Rab3A, which was preincubated with a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, cross-linked more efficiently to p85 than did Rab3A-GDP. Rab3A mutants that had decreased nucleotide binding also exhibited poor cross-linking to p85. Mutations in the effector domain, a site important for the interaction of Rab3A with its guanine nucleotide releasing factor, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, and GTPase-activating protein, eliminated the ability of Rab3A to cross-link to p85. However, short peptides corresponding to the effector domain did not reduce cross-linking efficiency when present at a concentration of 50 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1555661004,"Human chymase (h-chymase) is a serine protease that efficiently converts angiotensin I to II. Its structure and homology to other serine proteases suggest that it is synthesized as a zymogen, and is processed to the active form by cleavage of a 19-residue signal peptide and of a dipeptide pro-segment. To evaluate maturational processing of this enzyme, the proteins encoded by three h-chymase cDNA constructs (wild-type, lacking the pro- or lacking the prepro-segment) were characterized after expression in COS-1 cells. These recombinant proteins were not catalytically active. Purification and NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the protein expressed from the wild-type construct revealed processing to the proenzyme. Prochymase activation was achieved by incubation with a B-cell lymphoma homogenate, which apparently contains a heterologous processing enzyme sensitive to thiol protease inhibitors. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the activated h-chymase revealed cleavage of the pro-segment, and its biochemical characteristics were identical to those of native h-chymase purified from the myocardium. These findings indicate that processing of the dipeptide pro-segment is necessary and sufficient for activation of human chymase. Such processing is probably also required for the activation of related serine proteases, e.g., cathepsin G, which have homologous dipeptide pro-segments."
https://openalex.org/W1562481790,"MyoD is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of muscle gene regulatory proteins that includes myogenin, myf-5, and MRF4. These proteins have been shown to heterodimerize with E2A bHLH proteins, E12/E47, and to bind to a consensus sequence known as an E-box, CANNTG, the target for transcriptional activation by these myogenic regulators. MyoD is also a phosphorylated nuclear protein that is present in muscle cells prior to the transcriptional activation of the muscle-specific genes, many of which contain E-box elements in their regulatory regions. Here we report that phosphorylated chicken MyoD, called CMD1, produced in sf9 cells using the baculovirus system, is qualitatively similar to CMD1 isolated by immunoaffinity purification from primary cultures of embryonic chick breast muscle. Functional analysis of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated CMD1 produced in sf9 cells indicates that, in the presence of magnesium, DNA binding of phosphorylated CMD1 is inhibited whereas binding in association with E12 is not affected. However, CMD1 binding alone is equally efficient when either EDTA is added in excess or dephosphorylated or bacterially expressed CMD1 is used in the assay. Our results suggest that cellular phosphorylation changes the CMD1 homodimer-heterodimer equilibrium which, in turn, modulates and/or eliminates binding site competition between CMD1 homodimers and CMD1/E-protein heterodimers in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W49986325,"Ankyrin has a spectrin-binding region within a central 62-kDa chymotryptic peptide. We examined the spectrin binding ability of a series of smaller ankyrin fragments and recombinant peptides within the 62-kDa domain using a ligand blot assay. The smallest proteolytic fragment that bound was a 12-kDa tryptic peptide starting at amino acid 1068. Peptides containing this region expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion products also bound spectrin and suggested that residues 1101-1192 were important. In contrast, a fusion protein containing residues 826-898 did not bind spectrin, a surprising finding since this region is known to influence binding affinity. Proteins that bound spectrin on ligand blots also competed for binding in solution, but did so with one-tenth the affinity of the native peptide. Comparing the 62-kDa domains of erythrocyte and brain ankyrins (species that bind spectrin but with 10-fold differences in affinity), the NH2-terminal regions are 0-40% identical, while the regions (1136-1160) common to all binding peptides are 80-90% identical. We hypothesize that the highly conserved region contains an important spectrin-binding site, while the poorly conserved region controls the binding affinity. We speculate that this unique NH2-terminal region is what gives different members of the ankyrin family their signature set of affinities, and accordingly their distinctive cellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W1630586741,"The activity of Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) depends on its GTP- and GDP-bound conformations. In this work we have studied the influence of the antibiotic GE2270 A, a new EF-Tu-specific inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, on these two conformations with respect to the interaction with the various ligands and stability. One molecule of GE2270 A bound per EF-Tu is sufficient to block poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) incorporation. This drug binds stably to both EF-Tu.GTP and EF-Tu.GDP but only affects the reactivity of the GTP-bound conformation that is no longer able to interact efficiently with aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) and ribosomes. Consequently, the protection by EF-Tu.GTP of the aminoacyl-ester bond against nonenzymatic hydrolysis is strongly weakened. The intrinsic EF-Tu GTPase is little affected, but its response to aa-tRNA and ribosomes is impaired. The specificity of GE2270 A to the GTP-bound form of EF-Tu is supported by the course of temperature- and urea-dependent inactivation or tryptic digestion. Furthermore, in its presence elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) can enhance the dissociation of EF-Tu.GDP but not that of EF-Tu.GTP. Unlike kirromycin, this antibiotic can bind to EF-Tu.EF-Ts without causing dissociation of this complex. Evidence was obtained that the EF-Tu binding site for GE2270 A is also distinct from those for kirromycin, pulvomycin, and aa-tRNA, even though this antibiotic functionally interferes with all three of these ligands. GE2270 A appears to interact with a crucial regulatory region of the EF-Tu molecule that is activated in the GTP-bound state."
https://openalex.org/W1519610235,"In this report, we have measured the cadmium (Cd2+)-induced expression of all known metallothionein I (MT-I) mRNAs in a human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2. Among the human MT-I gene family promoters, marked sequence conservation exists; despite this, the mRNA accumulation level for each species was found to be quite unique. This differential Cd2+ induction of MT-I family members provides an ideal opportunity to assess whether the characteristic response results from subtle isoform-specific variations in promoter structure. Accordingly, we have examined the mechanism for differential expression of two isoforms, MT-IG and MT-IF, by transient transfection into Hep G2 cells. In the presence of Cd2+, MT-IG promoter activity and endogenous mRNA level were, respectively, 4.7- and 3-fold greater than those of MT-IF. This close correlation between promoter activity and mRNA accumulation strongly suggests that differential expression occurs at the level of transcription. The difference in Cd(2+)-stimulated activity was found to be conferred by 240- and 243-base pair promoter fragments spanning nucleotides -174 to +66 and -172 to +71 of the MT-IG and MT-IF genes, respectively. One of the most striking nonhomologies between the promoters is a single A (TATAAA) to C (TATCAA) transversion in the TATA motifs of MT-IG and MT-IF genes, respectively. To determine whether such a subtle change in the TATA motif could account for the marked differences in promoter function, we constructed MT-IG-TATCA and MT-IF-TATAA promoters and measured their activities in transient transfection and cell-free transcription assays. Results of both assays showed a profound difference between the two motifs that paralleled the difference in Cd(2+)-stimulated MT-IG and MT-IF mRNA levels. In summary, we have shown that differential regulation of two MT-I promoters is primarily due to a single base alteration in their TATA motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1635458573,"Abstract A pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (GK) links muscarinic cholinergic and A1-purinergic receptors with an inwardly rectifying K+ (KACh) channel in cardiac atrial cell membranes. Although the beta gamma subunits of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (G beta gamma) have been reported to fully activate this channel, it is not known whether exogenously applied G beta gamma interacts with the KACh channel through the same mechanism as the active subunit of endogenous GK (GK*). We examined in inside-out patches the relationship between the concentration of GTP and KACh channel activity with or without preactivation of the channels by either GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) or G beta gamma purified from bovine brain. In the control, KACh channels were activated by intracellular GTP (with acetylcholine in the pipette) in a positive cooperative manner (Hill coefficient approximately 2.5). As the channels were preactivated by GTP gamma S to progressively higher levels, the GTP channel activity relationship shifted more to the left, but the Hill coefficients of the curves remained the same. The same changes were observed when KACh channels were preactivated with brain G beta gamma. These results indicate that endogenous GK* and exogenous G beta gamma share a common molecular mechanism to activate the KACh channel."

Chem. 267, 11329-11336) we have shown that SpYPT5p is prenylated both in vivo and in vitro, where geranylgeranylation was confirmed, and carboxyl-methylated. In order to dissect the role of prenylation of each cysteine, we have generated C-terminal mutants where either one or both cysteine(s) were replaced by serine and expressed them in vitro in reticulocyte lysates and in vivo in transfected COS cells. Our results suggest that both cysteines of the CXC motif are prenylated but that the rate of prenylation of the two cysteines is different. The upstream cysteine was found to be preferentially prenylated in reticulocyte lysates unless cytosol from COS cells was added. A separate activity could therefore be required for prenylation of the second cysteine, or the presence of an additional factor is needed to allow accumulation of doubly prenylated SpYPT5p. However, the modification of the upstream cysteine is not a prerequisite for the prenylation of the other. Furthermore, gene replacement in Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that each cysteine of the CXC motif can individually support function. Carboxyl methylation occurred only on protein which had been prenylated on the C-terminal cysteine and was required for efficient membrane binding in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1504874733,"Abstract The putative overlapping consensus sequences (-129 to -105) for binding of fumarate nitrate reductase regulator- and integration host factor (IHF)-like proteins to puc operon upstream DNA of Rhodobacter sphaeroides was protected from DNase I digestion by purified Escherichia coli IHF. The binding of E. coli IHF to the purported IHF-binding site in the puc upstream DNA is highly sequence-specific. The recorded binding affinity was significantly lower than that of E. coli IHF to the lambda attP site. Employing site-directed changes in the DNA sequence within the -129 to -105 region, a loss in IHF binding, as monitored through gel retardation analysis, was correlated with alterations in puc operon expression monitored through the use of puc::lacZ transcriptional fusions. These results suggest that the IHF-binding site is involved in repression of puc operon transcription by oxygen as well as modulation of puc operon transcription levels by incident light intensity. Mutations specific to the upstream half of the putative fumarate nitrate reductase regulator-binding site of the puc upstream DNA did not show any physiological effects under the experimental conditions employed. Taken together, these studies reveal that the DNA sequence between -129 to -105 may involve facilitation of the interaction between upstream and downstream cis-acting regulatory sequences involved in puc operon expression."
https://openalex.org/W1544672619,"MalT, the transcriptional activator of the Escherichia coli maltose regulon, is a 901-amino acid-long protein that specifically binds to short, asymmetric nucleotide sequences present in several copies in the promoters of the regulon. We report that the protein structure involved in this specific binding is carried by a small C-terminal part of MalT encompassing the last 95 amino acid residues. This was demonstrated by fusing the last 95 codons of malT to the gene that encodes glutathione S-transferase, purifying the hybrid protein by affinity chromatography, and comparing the DNase I and dimethyl sulfate footprints of the hybrid and of wild-type MalT on different MalT-binding sites. MalT belongs to a large family of prokaryotic transcriptional activators, which share significant homology in their approximately 60-amino acid C-terminal regions. Our result strongly supports the suggestion that the region of homology corresponds to the DNA-binding domain of the proteins in this family."
https://openalex.org/W1591211701,"Full-length cDNA for rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase has been cloned and characterized (Li, J., Chen, Z., Lu, L., Byrnes, M., and Chang, S. H. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 170, 1056-1060). The 2.8-kilobase cDNA was inserted in the plasmid vector pPL2 and transformed into Escherichia coli cells deficient in endogenous phosphofructokinase activity (DF 1020). The recombinant phosphofructokinase so prepared is nearly identical in kinetic properties and size of subunits to the enzyme isolated from rabbit muscle. On the basis of the sequence homology between the muscle and the bacterial phosphofructokinases and the crystallographic structure of the latter, the glutamine at position 200 of the muscle enzyme is implicated in the allosteric transitions. This residue was replaced by alanine (Q200A), glutamate (Q200E), or arginine (Q200R). The purified enzymes were analyzed for quaternary structure, activity, and allosteric properties. The native and all the altered enzymes are tetramers. At pH 7.0, the wild-type enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by ATP at concentration above 0.6 mM, and its activity responds to fructose 6-phosphate concentration cooperatively at high ATP concentration. In contrast, the mutated enzyme Q200R is virtually insensitive to ATP inhibition up to 7 mM. Thus at high ATP concentration, its activity responds to fructose 6-phosphate concentration is a manner similar to the activated form of the native enzyme. Under the same conditions, mutant Q200E exhibits cooperative behavior only at much higher concentration of fructose 6-phosphate. Mutant Q200A is active at pH 8.0 but inactive at pH 7.0. The native enzyme and all three mutants are activated by inorganic phosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and inhibited by citrate."
https://openalex.org/W1586496997,"Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT, EC 2.3.1.28) is a bacterial chloramphenicol resistance marker that is commonly used as a reporter enzyme in gene expression studies and as a carrier protein for the production of fused peptides. The latter can be done by insertion of target sequences into the native ScaI site near the 3'-end of the Tn9 cat gene. CAT activity in the resulting fusion proteins is retained. We observed that creation of a stop codon at this ScaI, which causes a COOH-terminal 9-amino acid deletion, results in loss of chloramphenicol resistance and total deposition of the mutant protein in inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Cytoplasmic solubility and enzyme activity are completely regained by elongation of this mutant with only 2 residues. Apparently, terminal residues of the alpha 5-helix play a crucial role in achieving the native conformation of nascent CAT molecules. Thus, CAT provides an interesting model system for mutational analysis of protein folding in vivo."
